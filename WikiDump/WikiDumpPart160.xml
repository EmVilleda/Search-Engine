      <text xml:space="preserve">In grammar, parallelism is a balance of two or more similar words, phrases, or clauses. The application of parallelism in sentence construction can sometimes improve writing style, clearness, and readability. 

&quot;I went to the store, I went to the mall and I went to bed&quot; can be reduced to &quot;I went to the store, to the mall, and to bed&quot; through a parallel construction with &quot;I went&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">In English, there are three contexts for conditional sentences. 

The first context involves the possible outcome of an event that is likely to occur:

:If + Present Simple/Present Progressive + Present Simple/Present Progressive/Future Simple/Future Progressive/Imperative
:*''If + I miss the bus, + I will be late for school''

The second context involves the possible outcome of an event that is less likely to occur; various sentence structures are possible for this context:

:If + Present Perfect/Present Perfect Progressive/Preterite/Past Continuous + Full Infinitive + Conditional Present/Conditional Present Progressive
:*''If + I was + to miss the bus, + I would be late for school.''

:In some dialects: If + Imperfect Subjunctive + Full Infinitive + Conditional Present/Conditional Present Progressive
:*''If + I were + to miss the bus, + I would be late for school.''

:In some dialects: If + modal auxiliary &quot;should&quot; + Bare Infinitive + Conditional Present/Conditional Present Progressive
:*''If + I should + miss the bus, + I would be late for school.''

:The latter two formulations, with the imperfect subjunctive or the modal construction, can be modified to use subject-verb inversion instead of the conjunction ''if'':
:*''Were I + to miss the bus, + I would be late for school.''
:*''Should + I miss the bus, + I would be late for school.''

The third context involves the hypothetical outcome of an event that did not occur:

:If + Pluperfect/Pluperfect Progressive + Conditional/Conditional Progressive/Conditional Perfect/Conditional Perfect Progressive
:*''If + I had missed the bus, + I would have been late for school.''

:Here too the conjunction ''if'' can be replaced by subject-verb inversion:
:*''Had I missed the bus, + I would have been late for school.''

In each formulation it is possible to reverse the order of the clauses; however, the protasis must always follow the word &quot;if&quot; or exhibit subject-verb inversion:
:*''If + I miss the bus, + I will be late for school'' can be adjusted to ''I will be late for school + if + I miss the bus.''
:*''Should + I miss the bus, + I will be late for school'' can be adjusted to ''I will be late for school + should + I miss the bus.''

      <text xml:space="preserve">Perfect use of grammar is never easy in the English language. The English language prides itself on its versatility and adaptability. Unlike other languages, there is no governing body that officially sets the rules of English grammar. Although there are certainly conventions that if deviated from will make your writing seem amateurish. The good thing is that many people make the same mistakes. Habitually so. In this sense, it's easy to anticipate some of these common offenses by knowing how to identify them.

The Hellenistic period or Hellenistic era of history is the period which followed the conquests and death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC. The Hellenistic period may be seen to end either with the final conquest of the Greek heartlands by Rome in 146 BC or with the final defeat of the last remaining successor-state to Alexander's empire after the Battle of Actium in 31 BCE. The Hellenistic period was characterized by a wave of colonists who established Greek cities and kingdoms in Asia and Africa.

It was so named by the historian J. G. Droysen. During this time, Greek cultural influence and power was at its zenith in Europe and Asia. It is often considered a period of transition, sometimes even of decline or decadence, between the brilliance of the Greek Classical era and the emergence of the Roman Empire.

There many different network topologies.Mesh network is widely used. Mesh networking is a topology where each node must not only capture and disseminate its own data, but also serve as a relay for other nodes.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_topology#Point-to-point&lt;/ref&gt;
The network is redundant and fault tolerant. This makes it so that if one node goes &lt;br /&gt;
down it does not take the whole network with it. &lt;br /&gt;
This gives it self-healing capabilities. The network will change the route of the packets to a node that is still up and working. As a result, the network is typically quite reliable, as there is often more than one path between a source and a destination in the network.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesh_networking&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
Some of the advantages are as follows: Point to point line configuration makes identification and isolation of faults easy, messages travel through a dedicated line meaning that only the intended recipient receives the message, in the case of a fault in one link, only the communication between the two devices sharing the link is affected, and the use of dedicated links ensures that each connection carries its own data load thus eliminating traffic problems that would have been encountered if a connection/link was shared. Mesh networks are best for WAN, MAN and large LANs. For the average house hold this network is not recommend.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.meshdynamics.com/&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
This is because the network will grow larger and expensive to maintain. The networks best for home use would be Star, Ad hoc, or bus. Ad hoc networks are a form of mesh network with the only difference being that every node connects directly to each other and not through a switch.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Hellenistic philosophy==

Usually, Hellenistic philosophy is described as the period of Western philosophy that developed in the Hellenistic civilization following Aristotle and ending with the beginning of Neoplatonism.

===Hellenistic schools of thought===

====Pythagoreanism and Neopythagoreanism====
'''Pythagoras'''

Pythagoreanism was the system of esoteric and metaphysical beliefs held by Greek philosopher and mathematician Pythagoras of Samos (c.570 – c.495 BCE) and his followers, the Pythagorean cult. Pythagoras (c. 570 BCE-495 BCE) was an early Greek philosopher, mathematician and the founder of a religion called Pythagoreanism. He is famous for his eponymous theorem about right triangles: The sum of the areas of the two squares on the legs (a and b) equals the area of the square on the hypotenuse (c). Little reliable information remains about the life of Pythagoras, to the point that historians some historians attribute some of &quot;his&quot; thoughts to his followers. Whether they were the ideas of the man or a school of thought, the ideals influenced many Greek philosophers (a word said to have been coined by Pythagoras, Greek for a &quot;lover of wisdom&quot;) including Plato. 

Pythagorean thought was dominated by mathematics, and it was profoundly mystical. Pythagorean triangle---and its uses in problem solving]] Pythagoreanism emphasized a belief in mathematics and that numbers are the ultimate philosophical truth. The Pythagoreans are known for their theory of the transmigration of souls, and also for their theory that numbers constitute the true nature of things. They performed purification rites and followed and developed various rules of living which they believed would enable their souls to achieve a higher rank among the gods. Arguably, Pythagoras' most important contribution to society was the Pythagorean Theorem, which states that in any right triangle ABC, where &quot;C&quot; is the hypotenuse, A^2+B^2=C^2. 

Two schools of Pythagorean thought eventually developed, one based largely on mathematics and continuing his line of scientific work(the ''mathēmatikoi'' or &quot;learners&quot;); the other focusing on his more esoteric teachings (the ''akousmatikoi'' or &quot;listeners&quot;), though each shared a part of the other.

Its two main representatives are:

* Pythagoras (570-495 BCE), creator of the Pythagorean theorem, and
* Hippasus (5th century BCE), who is traditionally credited with the discovery of the existence of irrational numbers.

Neopythagoreanism was a school of philosophy reviving Pythagorean doctrines, which was prominent in the 1st and 2nd centuries CE. It was an attempt to introduce a religious element into Greek philosophy, worshiping God by living an ascetic life, ignoring bodily pleasures and all sensuous impulses, to purify the soul.

Its main representatives were:

* Nigidius Figulus (98-45 BCE), who incorporated Stoic elements to esoteric Pythagoreanism,to create Neopythagoreanism.
* Numenius of Apamea (2nd century CE), a forerunner of the Neoplatonists.

====Epicureanism====
Epicurus (341 BCE – 270 BCE) was a materialist philosopher, in the sense that Epicurus placed emphasis on only the tangible things of the Earth. For Epicurus, the purpose of philosophy was to attain the happy, tranquil life, characterized by ataraxia—peace and freedom from fear—and aponia—the absence of pain—and by living a self-sufficient life surrounded by friends, enjoying the simple joys of life instead of pursuing wealth, fame or power. Many of his thoughts were groundbreaking for the time. He taught that pleasure and pain are the measures of what is good and evil; death is the end of both body and soul and should therefore not be feared; the gods do not reward or punish humans; the universe is infinite and eternal; and events in the world are ultimately based on the motions and interactions of atoms moving in empty space.

Epicureanism is a system of philosophy based upon the teachings of Greek philosopher Epicurus, founded around 307 BCE. It viewed the universe as being ruled by chance, with no interference from gods. It regarded absence of pain as the greatest pleasure, and advocated a simple life. It was the main rival to Stoicism until both philosophies died out in the 3rd century CE.

Its main representatives were:

* Epicurus (341-270 BCE). For the founder of Epicurianism, the purpose of philosophy was to attain the happy, tranquil life, characterized by peace and freedom from fear by living a self-sufficient life surrounded by friends.
* Zeno of Sidon (1st century BCE), who held that happiness is not merely dependent upon present enjoyment and prosperity, but also on a reasonable expectation of their continuance and appreciation.

====Cynicism====
[[File:Anisthenes Pio-Clementino Inv288.jpg|thumb|Portrait bust of Antisthenes, Museo Pio-Clementino.]]

The Cynics were an ascetic sect of philosophers beginning with Antisthenes in the 4th century BCE and continuing until the 5th century CE. Their philosophy was that the purpose of life was to live a life of Virtue in agreement with Nature. This meant rejecting all conventional desires for wealth, power, sex, and fame, and by living a simple life free from all possessions. As reasoning creatures, people could gain happiness by rigorous training and by living in a way which was natural for humans. They believed that the world belonged equally to everyone, and that suffering was caused by false judgments of what was valuable and by the worthless customs and conventions which surrounded society. Many of these thoughts were later absorbed into Stoicism.

Its main representatives were:

* Antisthenes (445-365 BCE), the founder of Cynic philosophy; and
* Demetrius (10-80 CE) who wrote: &quot;An easy existence, untroubled by the attacks of Fortune is a Dead Sea.&quot;

====Cyrenaicism====

The Cyrenaics were an ultra-hedonist Greek school of philosophy founded in the 4th century BCE, supposedly by Aristippus of Cyrene, although many of the principles of the school are believed to have been formalized by his grandson of the same name, Aristippus the Younger. The school was so called after the Greek city of Cyrene, the birthplace of Aristippus. The Cyrenaics taught that the only intrinsic good is pleasure, which meant not just the absence of pain, but positively enjoyable sensations. Of these, momentary pleasures, especially physical ones, are stronger than those of anticipation or memory. They did, however, recognize the value of social obligation and that pleasure could be gained from altruistic behaviour. The school died out within a century and was replaced by the philosophy of Epicureanism.

Its main representative was:

* Aristippus of Cyrene (435-360 BCE)

====Platonism and Neoplatonism====
[[File:Plato Silanion Musei Capitolini MC1377.jpg|thumb|Plato: copy of portrait bust by Silanion, Musei Capitolini.]]

Platonism is the philosophy of Classical Greek philosopher Plato (424/423 BCE – 348/347 BCE) which was maintained and developed by his followers. The central concept of Platonism is the distinction between that reality which is perceptible, but not intelligible, and that which is intelligible, but imperceptible; to this distinction the Theory of Forms is essential. The forms are typically described in dialogues such as the ''Phaedo'', ''Symposium'' and ''Republic'' as transcendent, perfect archetypes, of which objects in the everyday world are imperfect copies. In the ''Republic'', the highest form is identified as the Form of the Good, the source of all other forms, which could be known by reason. In the Sophist, a later work, the forms being, sameness and difference are listed among the primordial &quot;Great Kinds&quot;. In the 3rd century BCE, Arcesilaus adopted skepticism, which became a central tenet of the school until 90 BCE when Antiochus added Stoic elements, rejected skepticism, and began a period known as Middle Platonism. In the 3rd century CE, Plotinus added mystical elements, establishing Neoplatonism, in which the summit of existence was the One or the Good, the source of all things; in virtue and meditation the soul had the power to elevate itself to attain union with the One. Platonism had a profound effect on Western thought, and many Platonic notions were adopted by the Christian church which understood Platonic forms as God's thoughts.

Its main representatives were:

* Plato (424/423–348/347 BCE), writer of philosophical dialogues, and founder of the Academy in Athens, the first institution of higher learning in the Western world. Along with his mentor, Socrates, and his student, Aristotle, Plato helped to lay the foundations of Western philosophy and science.
* Speusippus (407-339 BCE)successor to Plato as head of the Academy.
* Xenocrates (396-314 BCE), who taught that virtue produces happiness, but that external goods can minister to it and enable it to effect its purpose.
* Antiochus of Ascalon (130-68 BCE) generator of the phase of philosophy known as Middle Platonism.
* Plutarch (46-120 CE), author of ''Parallel Lives'' and ''Moralia''.



Neoplatonism, or Plotinism, was a school of religious and mystical philosophy founded by Plotinus in the 3rd century CE and based on the teachings of Plato and the other Platonists. Neoplatonism focused on the spiritual and cosmological aspects of Platonic thought, synthesizing Platonism with Egyptian and Jewish theology. They believed that the summit of existence was the One or the Good, the source of all things. In virtue and meditation the soul had the power to elevate itself to attain union with the One, the true function of human beings. It was the main rival to Christianity until dying out in the 6th century.

Its main representatives were:

* Plotinus (205-270 CE), who taught that there is a supreme, totally transcendent &quot;One&quot;, containing no division, multiplicity or distinction; beyond all categories of being and non-being.
* Porphyry (233-309 CE), who wrote ''Isagoge,'' an introduction to logic and philosophy, that became the standard textbook on logic throughout the Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Hellenistic Philosophy&quot; (Wikipedia) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellenistic_philosophy&lt;/ref&gt;

====Peripateticism====

The Peripatetics was the name given to the philosophers who maintained and developed the philosophy of Aristotle (384-322 BCE).  They advocated examination of the world to understand the ultimate foundation of things. The goal of life was the happiness which originated from virtuous actions, which consisted in keeping the mean between the two extremes of the too much and the too little.

Its main representatives were:

* Aristotle (384-322 BCE). His writings were the first to create a comprehensive system of Western philosophy, encompassing morality, aesthetics, logic, science, politics, and metaphysics.
* Strato of Lampsacus (335-269 BCE), who increased the naturalistic elements in Aristotle's thought to such an extent, that he denied the need for an active god to construct the universe, preferring to place the government of the universe in the unconscious force of nature alone.

====Pyrrhonian skepticism====

Pyrrhonian skepticism, was a school of skepticism beginning with philosopher Pyrrho in the 3rd century BCE, and further advanced by Aenesidemus in the 1st century BCE. It advocated total philosophical skepticism about the world in order to attain ''ataraxia'' or a tranquil mind, maintaining that nothing could be proved to be true so we must suspend judgement.

* Pyrrho (365-275 BCE). His theory of the impossibility of knowledge (The impossibility of knowledge, even in regard to our own ignorance or doubt, should induce the wise person to withdraw into themselves) is the first and the most thorough exposition of noncognitivism in the history of thought.
* Timon (320-230 BCE)
* Aenesidemus (1st century BCE)
* Sextus Empiricus (2nd century CE)

====Stoicism====

Stoicism was founded by Zeno of Citium in the 3rd century BCE. Based on the ethical ideas of the Cynics, it taught that the goal of life was to live in accordance with Nature. It advocated the development of self-control and fortitude as a means of overcoming destructive emotions. It was the most successful school of philosophy until it died out in the 3rd century CE.

Its main representatives were:

* Zeno of Citium (333-263 BCE) believed that goodness and peace of mind could be gained from living a life of virtue in accordance with nature.
* Seneca (4 BCE-65 CE), Roman philosopher, statesman, and dramatist.
* Marcus Aurelius (121-180 CE), Roman Emperor and author of the ''Meditations'', a literary monument to a philosophy of service and duty, describing how to find and preserve equanimity in the midst of conflict by following nature as a source of guidance and inspiration.

==Hellenistic sciences==

The military campaigns of Alexander the Great spread Greek thought to Egypt, Asia Minor, Persia, up to the Indus River. The resulting Hellenistic civilization produced seats of learning in Alexandria in Egypt and Antioch in Syria along with Greek speaking populations across several monarchies. Hellenistic science differed from Greek science in at least two ways: first, it benefited from the cross-fertilization of Greek ideas with those that had developed in the larger Hellenistic world; secondly, to some extent, it was supported by royal patrons in the kingdoms founded by Alexander's successors. 

Especially important to Hellenistic science was the city of Alexandria in Egypt, which became a major center of scientific research in the 3rd century BCE. Two institutions established there during the reigns of Ptolemy I Soter (reigned 323 - 283 BCE) and Ptolemy II Philadelphus (reigned 281 - 246 BCE) were the Library and the Museum. Unlike Plato's Academy and Aristotle's Lyceum, these institutions were officially supported by the Ptolemies; although the extent of patronage could be precarious, depending on the policies of the current ruler.

Hellenistic scholars frequently employed the principles developed in earlier Greek thought: the application of mathematics and deliberate empirical research, in their scientific investigations.

In medicine, Herophilos (335 - 280 BCE) was the first to base his conclusions on dissection of the human body and to describe the nervous system.
[[File:Antikythera mechanism.svg|thumb|The Antikythera mechanism.]]

Geometers such as Archimedes (ca. 287 BCE – 212 BCE), Apollonius of Perga (ca. 262 BCE – ca. 190 BCE), and Euclid (ca. 325 BCE – 265 BCE), whose Elements became the most important textbook in mathematics until the 19th century, built upon the work of the Hellenic era Pythagoreans. Eratosthenes used his knowledge of geometry to measure the distance between the Sun and the Earth along with the size of the Earth.

Astronomers like Hipparchus (ca. 190 – ca. 120 BCE) built upon the measurements of the Babylonian astronomers before him, to measure the precession of the Earth. Pliny reports that Hipparchus produced the first systematic star catalog after he observed a new star (it is uncertain whether this was a nova or a comet) and wished to preserve astronomical record of the stars, so that other new stars could be discovered. It has recently been claimed that a celestial globe based on Hipparchus's star catalog sits atop the broad shoulders of a large 2nd-century Roman statue known as the Farnese Atlas.

The level of Hellenistic achievement in astronomy and engineering is impressively shown by the Antikythera mechanism (150-100 BCE). It is a 37-gear mechanical computer which computed the motions of the Sun and Moon, including lunar and solar eclipses predicted on the basis of astronomical periods believed to have been learned from the Babylonians. Devices of this sort are not found again until the 10th century, when a simpler eight-geared luni-solar calculator incorporated into an astrolabe was described by the Persian scholar, Al-Biruni. Similarly complex devices were also developed by other Muslim engineers and astronomers during the Middle Ages.

The interpretation of Hellenistic science varies widely. At one extreme is the view of the English classical scholar, Cornford, who believed that &quot;all the most important and original work was done in the three centuries from 600 to 300 BCE.&quot; At the other is the view of the Italian physicist and mathematician, Lucio Russo, who claims that scientific method was actually born in the 3rd century BCE, to be forgotten during the Roman period and only revived in the Renaissance.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;History of Science in Classical Antiquity&quot; (Wikipedia) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_in_the_Hellenistic_period#Hellenistic_period&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hellenistic astronomy===

====Planetary models and observational astronomy====
[[File:Ptolemaicsystem-small.png|thumb|Renaissance woodcut illustrating the two-sphere model.]]

In classical Greece, astronomy was a branch of mathematics; astronomers sought to create geometrical models that could imitate the appearances of celestial motions. The Eudoxan system used a two-sphere geocentric model, which divided the cosmos into two regions:

* A spherical Earth, central and motionless (the sublunary sphere).
* A spherical heavenly realm centered on the Earth, which may contain multiple rotating spheres made of aether

However, the Eudoxan system had several critical flaws. One was its inability to predict motions exactly. Callippus, a Greek astronomer of the 4th century, attempt to correct this flaw by adding seven spheres to Eudoxus' original 27. But, some flaws persisted: the inability of his models to explain why planets appear to change speed; and its inability to explain changes in the brightness of planets as seen from Earth. Because the spheres are concentric, planets will always remain at the same distance from Earth. This problem was pointed out in Antiquity by Autolycus of Pitane (c. 310 BCE).

Apollonius of Perga (c. 262 BCE–c. 190 BCE) responded by introducing two new mechanisms that allowed a planet to vary its distance and speed: the eccentric deferent and the deferent and epicycle. The deferent is a circle carrying the planet around the Earth. (The word deferent comes from the Latin ferro, ferre, meaning &quot;to carry.&quot;) An eccentric deferent is slightly off-center from Earth. In a deferent and epicycle model, the deferent carries a small circle, the epicycle, which carries the planet. The deferent-and-epicycle model can mimic the eccentric model, as shown by Apollonius' theorem. It can also explain retrogradation, which happens when planets appear to reverse their motion through the zodiac for a short time. Modern historians of astronomy have determined that Eudoxus' models could only have approximated retrogradation crudely for some planets, and not at all for others.

In the 2nd century BCE, Hipparchus, aware of the extraordinary accuracy with which Babylonian astronomers could predict the planets' motions, insisted that Greek astronomers achieve similar levels of accuracy. Somehow he had access to Babylonian observations or predictions, and used them to create better geometrical models. For the Sun, he used a simple eccentric model, based on observations of the equinoxes, which explained both changes in the speed of the Sun and differences in the lengths of the seasons. For the Moon, he used a deferent and epicycle model. He could not create accurate models for the remaining planets, and criticized other Greek astronomers for creating inaccurate models.

Hipparchus also compiled a star catalogue. According to Pliny the Elder, he observed a nova (new star). So that later generations could tell whether other stars came to be, perished, moved, or changed in brightness, he recorded the position and brightness of the stars. Ptolemy mentioned the catalogue in connection with Hipparchus' discovery of precession. (Precession of the equinoxes is a slow motion of the place of the equinoxes through the zodiac, caused by the shifting of the Earth's axis). Hipparchus thought it was caused by the motion of the sphere of fixed stars.

====Heliocentrism and cosmic scales====

In the 3rd century BCE, Aristarchus of Samos proposed an alternate cosmology (arrangement of the universe): a heliocentric model of the solar system, placing the Sun, not the Earth, at the center of the known universe (hence he is sometimes known as the &quot;Greek Copernicus&quot;). His astronomical ideas were not well-received, however, and only a few brief references to them are preserved. We know the name of one follower of Aristarchus: Seleucus of Seleucia.

Aristarchus also wrote a book On the Sizes and Distances of the Sun and Moon, which is his only work to have survived. In this work, he calculated the sizes of the Sun and Moon, as well as their distances from the Earth in Earth radii. Shortly afterwards, Eratosthenes calculated the size of the Earth, providing a value for the Earth radii which could be plugged into Aristarchus' calculations. Hipparchus wrote another book On the Sizes and Distances of the Sun and Moon, which has not survived. Both Aristarchus and Hipparchus drastically underestimated the distance of the Sun from the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Greek astronomy&quot; (Wikipedia) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_astronomy#Hellenistic_astronomy&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hellenistic mathematics===

During the Hellenistic period, Greek mathematics merged with Egyptian and Babylonian mathematics to give rise to a Hellenistic mathematics.

Even though,  mathematical texts written in Greek have been found in Greece, Egypt, Asia Minor, Mesopotamia, and Sicily, Alexandria in Egypt, which attracted mathematics scholars from across the Hellenistic world, mostly Greek and Egyptian, but also Jewish, Persian, Phoenician and even Indian scholars.

Greek mathematician Archimedes of Syracuse (c. 287 BCE – c. 212 BCE) became one of the leading scientists in classical antiquity. He was able to use infinitesimals in a way that is similar to modern integral calculus. Using a technique dependent on a form of proof by contradiction he could give answers to problems to an arbitrary degree of accuracy, while specifying the limits within which the answer lay. This technique is known as the method of exhaustion, and he employed it to approximate the value of π (Pi). In The Quadrature of the Parabola, Archimedes proved that the area enclosed by a parabola and a straight line is 4/3 times the area of a triangle with equal base and height. He expressed the solution to the problem as an infinite geometric series, whose sum was 4/3. In The Sand Reckoner, Archimedes set out to calculate the number of grains of sand that the universe could contain. In doing so, he challenged the notion that the number of grains of sand was too large to be counted, devising his own counting scheme based on the myriad, which denoted 10,000.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Greek Mathematics&quot; (Wikipedia) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_mathematics#Hellenistic&lt;/ref&gt;

=The Economics of Young Democracies:Policies and Performance=
By Nathan Converse and Ethan B. Kapstein, Center for Global Development Working Paper, March 2006

==Introduction==

The second half of the twentieth century may eventually become known as the “age of democracy.” Since the “third wave” of democratization began in 1974, nearly 100 states have adopted democratic forms of government, including, of course, most of the former Soviet bloc nations (Huntington 1991). America policy-makers have expressed the hope that this democratic wave will extend even further, to the Middle East and onward, perhaps reaching China’s shores in the not-too-distant future (“Rice Plans to Encourage Democratization,” 11 October 2005, www.state.gov).

Why do policy-makers care about advancing the cause of democracy? Beyond its contributions to civil liberties and international peace, democratic governance is increasingly seen as being necessary to the achievement of sustained economic development and a better standard of living (Bardhan 1999; Diamond 2005; Halperin, Siegle, and Weinstein 2005). According to Larry Diamond, “a high quality democracy…will be used to generate public goods that stimulate investment and commerce and raise the quality of life” (Diamond 2005). And in a recently published study, Halperin, Siegle and Weinstein claim that, “democracies generally experience more rapid and consistent improvements in the well being of their populations than do autocracies” (Halperin, Siegle and Weinstein 2005, 65).

On the basis of such claims, these and other scholars have advanced the policy recommendation that democratization must play a central role, and perhaps the central role—in both domestic policies and foreign assistance programs that seek to promote sustained economic growth among other objectives. In fact, it appears as if policy-makers have heeded that advice, with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice repeatedly emphasizing the need to promote democracy and only mentioning poverty relief in passing in her speech announcing the creation of a new Director of Foreign Assistance position in her Department (“Remarks At the U.S. Agency for International Development On Foreign Assistance,” 19 January 2006, www.state.gov). Likewise, the new foreign aid program of the United States, the Millennium Challenge Account (MCA), provides funds only to those countries that “rule justly,” and it is plausible that the World Bank under the leadership of Paul Wolfowitz will also move in that direction, tying development assistance to democracy-building more directly. Understanding therelationship between democracy and development therefore goes well beyond an “academic exercise.”
Despite the west’s political commitment to support democratization, the durability of the new democratic age remains an open question. By some accounts, at least half of the world’s youngest democracies—often referred to in the academic literature as being “unconsolidated” or “fragile”—are still struggling to develop their political institutions, and several have reverted back to authoritarian rule. Among the countries in the early stages of democratic institution building are states vital to U.S. national security interests, including Afghanistan and Iraq. Ensuring that the developing world’s democracies survive and prosper is therefore a crucial policy challenge.
The ability of fledgling democracies to maintain popular support depends, at least to some extent, on the ability of their governments to deliver economic policies that meet with widespread approval. But what sorts of economic policies are these, and are they necessarily the same as the policies required for tackling difficult issues of economic stabilization and reform? Conversely, what sorts of economic policies are most likely to spark a backlash against young and fragile democratic regimes? Do the leaders of young democracies face trade-offs as they ponder their electoral and economic strategies?

These are among the questions we explore in this paper, which aims to provide an overview of the monograph we are currently writing on the economics of young democracies. As already noted, we believe these issues assume significant policy relevance in light of recent U.S. (among other bilateral and multilateral) foreign aid initiatives explicitly aimed at promoting democratic consolidation. Evidence that economic performance significantly affects the probability of democratic survival in a given country renders the question of how well the new democracies manage their economies all the more pressing from a policy-making standpoint. Adam Przeworski and colleagues, for example, have found the probability that a young democracy will be overthrown grows ten-fold when the economy contracts two years in a row (Przeworski, et al., 2000:109). The idea that poor economic performance poses a threat to democracy has been supported by a great deal of quantitative work. In an oft-cited study, Rueschemyer, Stephens, and Stephens (1992) demonstrate that economic factors played a decisive role in nearly all the democratic reversals in Latin America between 1920 and 1980. Evidence from opinion surveys also shows that public support for democracy has frayed when economic conditions deteriorate (Haggard and Kaufman 1995).

This paper examines much of what we know about the theory and empirics of economic policy and performance in the consolidation and reversal of newly democratic states. The paper is in four sections. First, by way of background, we examine the hypothesized relationships between democratic politics and economic policy-making. Second, we analyze the findings of several important empirical studies with respect to the economic performance of young democracies around the world. In the third section, we provide some descriptive statistics which indicate how young democracies have fared and are faring in practice, making use of the new dataset that we have compiled (which, among other things, is more up-to-date than the others cited herein). We are particularly interested in comparing the economic performance of those young democracies that successfully consolidate as opposed to those that ultimately fail. Do the data reveal any distinctive economic patterns with respect to democratic consolidation and reversal? We will show that they do. In particular, we find that deteriorating or stagnant economic performance constitutes a red flag or warning signal that the country is at risk of democratic reversal. Moreover, we observe considerable variation in economic performance, suggesting that the design of political institutions in new democracies may have a significant influence on the probability of their survival. The fourth section provides our conclusions and policy recommendations, while a discussion of our dataset and some summary tables are found in the appendices.

===I. The Political Economy of Democracy===

In recent years a growing number of scholars and policy-makers have expressed optimism that democracy and development are mutually reinforcing. In the spring of 2005, for instance, Larry Diamond told an audience in Ghana, “Africa cannot develop without democracy” and asserted that the literature points “clearly” to “a causal effect of democracy on economic growth….” As a consequence, he urged his listeners to shun any thoughts of authoritarian solutions to their economic problems. He suggested that the East Asian miracle, for example, “took place in a historic and regional context that is unlikely to be repeated,” and that it therefore failed to provide a relevant developmental model for contemporary political leaders (Diamond 2005).
What are the channels through which democracy (our definition and list of country cases are found in the appendices) influences economic development? The literature posits several channels or pathways by which politics influences economics that we explore in this section:

First, democracy may influence economic policy through the channels provided by the electoral process;

Second, that influence may be felt through the channels provided by political parties that serve to aggregate voter interests;

Third, economic policy may be shaped through the channels provided by the institutional structure—e.g. presidential vs. parliamentary—that a particular democracy adopts;

Fourth, the age of a democratic regime may influence economic performance, since democratic institutions may take time to develop and mature.

Overall, these inter-locking attributes of a democracy—its electoral system (who gets to vote and which offices are contested), its political parties (how many, which interests are aggregated, and how well they are organized), its institutions (what type), and its age (how long these have been in place)—define its “constitutional political economy.” Indeed, we should emphasize that while many cross-country studies of democracy and economic performance define democracies at the most aggregate or abstract level, the variance among democracies along these four attributes may be of great significance for economic outcomes. In short, the type of democracy may matter no less than democracy itself in terms of delivering sustainedeconomic growth.

===Voters, Elections and Economic Policy===

Competitive elections play a key role in all mature democracies, and central to democratic electoral theory is the presence of a median voter, or “swing voter” whose support is required if a politician is to be elected to office (Downs 1957). By definition, the median voter, who occupies the fifth and sixth income deciles, owns less capital than the average for the nation as a whole, or to put this in the starkest terms we might say that the median voter is poorer than the average voter. This fact is consequential for economic policy and performance, for it suggests that the median voter, whose political support is decisive in contested elections, will demand income redistribution from the rich from her representatives as the price of her support.

Indeed, the demand for income redistribution is at the heart of contemporary political-economy accounts of political regime change, specifically the shift from authoritarian to democratic regimes (Acemoglu and Robinson 2006). In Acemoglu and Robinson (2006),democracy is modeled as a game-theoretic solution to interactions between rich and poor, in that it provides credible, limited redistribution to the poor through the franchise while preserving the property rights of the rich. One empirical problem with this argument, however, is that we do not observe such redistribution in practice, particularly in the world’s young democracies.

Returning to the world of theory, scholars have argued that since the median voter has a powerful incentive to demand redistribution, those with wealth in a democracy will have less incentive to save and to invest, and they may even decide to take their capital to friendlier locales, leaving the country poorer. One frequently posited outcome of this interaction between rich and poor is that democracies inevitably emphasize short-run consumption at the expense of long-run investment, with the result that a country’s growth potential goes unfulfilled (Huntington 1968; Rao 1984). In short, the economic policies of democracies are redistributive toward the median voter and growth is negatively affected as a consequence. One might expect these pressures to be particularly acute in developing countries where the gap between the median voter and those in the upper income deciles in likely to be enormous, and where the median voter may even be lacking in some of the basic necessities of life. This is a claim made by Haggard and Kaufman (1995) for example, and we will return to it below in our discussion of age of democracy.

The electoral influence on economic policy does not simply lead to income redistribution toward the median voter, but it has widespread macroeconomic effects as well. In the process of gaining the support of voters, politicians may be tempted loosen monetary policy and avoid fiscal discipline in order to provide infrastructure and jobs. From this perspective, a balanced budget is seen as a collective good, and no politician is motivated to contribute to it. Instead, she wants other politicians to practice fiscal restraint while she provides her own constituents with both “pork” and low taxes. Since every politician thinks in the same way, the result in a democracy is high spending and low taxation, and for this reason James Buchanan famously argued that democracies will tend toward the creation of budget deficits. Democratic governments inevitably become bloated, and it follows that “a democratic society…will tend to resort to an excessive use of deficit finance…” (Buchanan and Wagner 1978).

The general tendency of democracies to adopt lax fiscal and monetary policies has been more precisely associated with the electoral process through the so-called “political business cycle” (PBC). Economists have long observed that democratically elected politicians have an incentive to stimulate the economy artificially by loosening monetary policy and abandoning fiscal rectitude during the run-up to elections, and this behavior has been formally modeled by opportunistic PBC theories (as opposed to partisan PBC theory, discussed in the next section)Early theories of the opportunistic political business cycle focused on the opportunities arising from an exploitable Phillips curve and a myopic electorate (Alesina et al. 1997: 15), suggesting that competitive elections will generate volatility in employment, inflation, and growth rates. Later work (for example, Rogoff 1990) made the questionable assumption of a myopic electorate unnecessary by positing asymmetric information regarding the incumbent’s competence. These rational opportunistic models note that while both competent and incompetent incumbents can stimulate the economy by stepping-up government spending and expanding the money supply, only the more capable policy-maker can bring about additional economic improvements using superior managerial skills. Thus, the PBC allows competent incumbents to signal their abilities to voters. While the long-run effects of political business cycles on economic performance are unclear, they presumably undermine the level of investment and hence the growth rate by introducing greater volatility into the economy. It worth noting that PBC theories implicitly assume competitive elections, in which a degree of uncertainty exists regarding the outcome—a leader who will certainly be reelected has no reason to signal his managerial competence by stimulating the economy (Block 2002: 6). By implication, a shift from a less democratic government to a more democratic government with greater contestation of public offices implies that political business cycles may be magnified in newly democratizing countries.

Academic models that emphasize the influence of the median voter on economic policy have won a prized spot in the political economy pantheon. But empirical support for the median voter hypothesis is mixed at best, and it has been queried from a theoretical perspective as well, for various reasons. For one thing, since the interests of voters tend to be multi-peaked rather than single-peaked, their ability to hold politicians accountable on particular issues may be doubted. But even in the presence of single-peaked voting, voters may be unable to induce good behavior from their politicians, particularly if the official believes she is likely to lose the next election in any case, say due to exogenous shocks (e.g. an increase in oil prices) that undermine economic growth.

More prominently, Olson famously questioned the ability of individuals to advance their material interests effectively, given the free-rider temptation in the face of collective goods provision (Olson 1965, 1982). For example, while the median voter might wish for income redistribution, she might not be bothered to go out and vote, assuming that others will perform that task and produce the desired outcome. Since individuals face severe organizational impediments due to their preference for free-riding, their political impact might not be very great after all as compared to that of organized interests. Olson suggested instead that small groupswith a shared purpose would be most successful in advancing their political and economic agenda to the extent they had a strong material interest in a particular policy outcome. And among these small, politically active interest groups, private sector business lobbies have won particular attention from scholars.

The relationship between electorally motivated politicians and rent-seeking private sector lobbyists has been summarized in a simple equation by Grossman and Helpman (2002). They argue that:

V = C + aW

Where:

V = votes,

C = campaign contributions, and

a = a parameter term that suggests the trade-off between C and aggregate welfare (W).

Thus, politicians need to win votes but their campaigns are paid for by lobbyists who make contributions in return for desired policies (e.g. tariffs, contracts, or subsidies). By kowtowing too much to the lobbyists, however, the politicians generate welfare-reducing policies that cost them the votes of everyday citizens. They must therefore strike an appropriate balance between lobbyists and voters; still, the private sector interest will be both prominent in policy-making and generally welfare-reducing from an economic standpoint (Grossman and Helpman emphasize the formation of trade policy in their own work).

Olson asserted that these lobbies can play an extremely negative role in the economic performance of nations; indeed, he assigned them a central role in the economic decline of democratic states (1982). For Olson, it was organized interest groups that prevented politicians from implementing welfare-enhancing reforms. Interestingly, whereas Olson tended to view interest group power as being weakest in young democracies, Hellman has demonstrated how organized groups effectively captured the reform process in post-Communist Russia, blocking those reforms that would have led to more openness and competition (Hellman 1998). This observation leads to a more general, empirical set of questions regarding how well organized special interest groups actually are in the world’s young democracies, how much influence they have over policy-making, and what economic policies they seek. This is an area in which much work remains to be done.

In contrast to Olson, some theorists have tried to demonstrate that democracy ameliorates a society’s distributive conflicts and as a result this type of political system is efficiency-enhancing. Rodrik (1999; 2000), for example, elaborates a model in which two interest groups with divergent policy preferences repeatedly interact to formulate policy. If the groups face uncertainty about which will have a superior bargaining position in the future, they can reach an equilibrium in which they compromise, since the costs of making concessions is offset by the future benefits of concessions by one’s opponent when that group is in power. This outcome depends not only on repeated interactions, but also on uncertainty about the groups' future ability to impose their will on their opponent. By introducing such uncertainty through competitive elections, democracy promotes compromise, reducing policy volatility and facilitating better economic performance.

Competitive elections are also expected to be efficiency-enhancing for other reasons. For example, popular discourse, as well as economic theory, has generally viewed the public sector as less efficient than the private due to a dearth of competition in the former. However, democracy has the potential to introduce competition into the public sector, albeit indirectly. Lake and Baum (2001) lay out a theoretical model in which the government is a monopoly provider of public services, and thus restricts supply to drive up price in the form of rents extracted by government officials. They view democracy as a way of rendering the market for public services &quot;contestable,&quot; with candidates for political office being potential entrants threatening to undercut the monopoly provider. In short, by introducing competitive pressures into the public sector, democracy forces the state to supply more and better public services.1

To summarize, one of the central characteristics of democracy is its reliance on competitive elections for choosing political leaders who are accountable to voters. That process has distinctive implications for economic policy, at least some of which have been held by scholars to be quite negative (Bardhan and Yang 2004). In the world’s young democracies, these negative attributes might even be accentuated as political leaders seek to shore up support and build credibility with voters (Keefer 2005). Yet it is not just through the median voter that the economic policies of democracies are shaped; these policies may also be a function of the way in which political parties and institutions aggregate contending interests. We turn to these perspectives in the following sections.

===Political Parties and Economic Policy===

There is a longstanding tradition in the political economy literature linking the political party in power with distinctive approaches to economic policy; this has been called the “partisanship school” of political economy (for reviews, see Drazen 2001 and Rueda n.d.). Briefly, the partisanship school holds that left-wing or social democratic governments will protect the interests of labor and the “working class” while right-wing or conservative governments will protect the interests of those who have accumulated capital. The distinctive economic policy approaches are allegedly made manifest in macroeconomic performance, with social democracies having higher levels of taxation, government spending, and inflation than conservative governments. A related literature modeling partisan political business cycles views the different preferences of left- and right-wing parties for unemployment and inflation as producing macroeconomic fluctuations (Alesina et al. 1997: 45).

As Rueda notes (n.d.), critical to such approaches is the assumption that political parties have “core constituencies” whose interests are paramount in setting the platform and in policy-making should the party form a government. A party’s main challenge, therefore, is to build a “winning coalition” around this core constituency. On the other hand, if the party follows solely the preferences of its core it may well lose election after election (that, of course, could be a perverse outcome of internal party politics). While the winning strategy of coalition-building may temper the more extreme strands of a given economic strategy the overall trajectory remains clear to voters, at least in contrast to that of the rival party. Thus, parties provide voters with clear choices. By “unpacking” political parties, this analysis of electoral politics allows for centrifugal forces within parties, which counteract the drive to appease the median voter, and endogenizes parties’ actual platforms.

It should further be emphasized that the partisanship approach is firmly materialistic, in that it associates core constituencies with economic classes. So far as we are aware, the partisanship school has not applied its model of party behavior to other constituencies, such as religious or ethnic groups. But such non-class-based allegiances are a distinctive feature of many new democracies, and these divisions may become the basis for competitive politics within the democratic setting. In Iraq, for example, political parties seem to be based largely on ethnic groupings, though of course within each ethnic faction one finds further political divisions that are also organized into parties. We note that the effects of these party groupings on economic policy and performance have been little studied; Haggard and Kaufman (1995), for example, rely on traditional, class-based partisanship models in their analysis of the political economy of democratic transitions. This is an area that will certainly attract more research from socialscientists in the years ahead and may lead to a very different view of the interests that political parties represent in domestic politics, and the policies they pursue once in government.

Still other theorists have emphasized that the ideological orientation of the political party in power matters less than the level of institutionalization that characterizes the parties that compete for office. In their study of the political economy of economic reform in 13 countries, Williamson and Haggard (1994) reject the idea that right-wing governments are better suited or even more likely to implement market-oriented reforms. By contrast, they find that the governments are more likely to carry out economic reforms when the party in power enjoys a broad support base. Similarly, Haggard and Kaufman stress the crucial importance of institutions that are capable of channeling conflicts over distribution and policy for the formulation of high-quality economic policy, and conclude that broad-based, cohesive political parties (or stable coalitions of parties) are particularly suited to perform this function. In contrast, they find that fragmented or polarized party systems generally fail to implement welfare-enhancing economic policies (Haggard and Kaufman 1995). We note that developing countries, including young democracies, vary enormously in terms of the degree of institutionalization of political parties and the relationship between party organizations and those who govern. One might say, in short, that what matters from an economic policy perspective is the capacity of parties to link politicians and large groups of voters in a way that enhances policy credibility.2 And that observation, in turn, leads directly to our discussion of democratic institutions and economic policy.

===Democratic Institutions and Economic Policy===

Underlying electoral processes and party structures are the basic democratic institutions established by a nation’s constitution. In discussing the implications of institutional structure for the formation of economic policies, analysts have emphasized the ways in which institutions can check the power of the state to prevent abuses, as well as examining how institutional structure influences policy outcomes. A separate literature has suggested that more abstract democratic institutions—personal freedom, an unfettered press, etc.—generate a dynamism conducive to efficiency and economic development.

Numerous theorists have focused on the way in which democracy’s institutional features positively influence economic performance by putting in place checks and balances. One check results from the fact that incumbents (or their parties) can be held accountable by the public in the next election. Whereas under autocracy, leaders may arbitrarily expropriate property for their own benefit, or government officials may demand bribes without fear of punishment, democracy generates incentives to refrain from such behavior, leading to stronger property rights, greater economic efficiency and less uncertainty (North 1990). Rodrik (1999) builds a model that produces similar results.

Moreover, the separation of powers present in most democracies introduces a further source of checks and balances. Whereas voters can only hold politicians accountable ex post,3 legislatures may block executive excesses ex ante. Particularly relevant to a discussion of economic policy is the existence of unelected institutions designed to buffer certain sets of policies from immediate domestic political pressures. Independent central banks, whose directors are often appointed for relatively long terms of office, insulate macroeconomic policy from potentially destabilizing popular demands. Supreme courts, whose members may serve for life, serve—in theory—as a further bulwark against abuses by legislatures and executives.

Analysis of institutions and their impact on economic policy have extensively explored the impact on policy of differences in the relationship between the fundamental bodies of executive and legislative authority. In particular, parliamentary democracies may be contrasted with presidential systems, in which the chief executive is elected by direct voting and given a more or less independent (from the legislature) power base and set of responsibilities. These differences could have important economic effects. Persson and Tabellini (2002) have pushed this analysis the farthest, developing a number of testable propositions that compare and contrast parliamentary and presidential regimes, viz.:

(1) “Parliamentary regimes will have larger governments than presidential regimes.”

(2) “Presidential regimes should be associated with less rent extraction and lower taxation than parliamentary regimes.”

(3) “Presidential regimes…should also be associated with more targeted programs at the expense of broad spending programs” (Persson and Tabellini 2002, 30).

The rationale for this distinction between presidential and parliamentary regimes in terms of economic policy and performance in part stems from the different checks and balances they introduce. Persson and Tabellini argue that political systems with “a larger concentration of power in parliamentary regimes makes it easier for politicians to collude with each other at the voters’ expense…” (Persson and Tabellini 2001, 4). However, others argue that parliamentary regimes are best suited to check the abusive power of the president, especially in developing countries where legislatures are often weak. As a consequence, developing countries have been urged to avoid strong, presidential models in favor of parliamentary democracy. Parliamentary systems with coalition governments have been held to be the most growth-friendly, as the various factions keep check on each other’s extreme spending tendencies; they therefore “internalize” the benefits of the separation of powers model. Overall, however, it is not clear which regime type—presidential or parliamentary—generates higher levels of long-run growth

Beyond electoral processes and formal institutional structures, other theorists point to the role of more diffuse democratic institutions in promoting market efficiency by inducing the free flow of capital, labor, or information. Early versions of this idea can be found in the work of Marx (Giddens 1971: 51), though it is most often associated with Hayek, Friedman (and Drucker in his 1939 End of Economic Man) and the Austrian School more generally. More recently and formally, North (1990) has hypothesized that markets function most efficiently in democratic societies due to the personal freedom they allow. Similarly, Sen (1994) highlights the way in which the free transmission of information in democracies facilitates efficient outcomes. This line of analysis, then, takes us beyond the formal constitutional political economy of democratic polities and reminds us of the importance of the many attributes associated with liberal democracy in particular, including civil liberties, a free press, and so forth, all of which may be in short supply in the young democracies of the developing world.

Work showing a relationship between democracy and higher productivity provides empirical support to this hypothesis. Przeworski el al. (2000) find that while dictatorships have higher rates of labor force growth, democracies exhibit more rapid total factor productivity growth. Evidence of an association between democracy and higher productivity can also be found in Minier (1998), Krieckhaus (2005), and Rivera-Batiz (2002). That democracies use existing factor endowments more efficiently would appear to support the idea that some of the more diffuse institutions of democracy serve to bolster economic performance.

===Democracies Young and Old: Does Age Matter?===

Much of the literature relating democratic polities to economic policies and outcomes was written in the context of the advanced industrial states. But young democracies in the developing world initial conditions and political circumstances that could render these models less relevant. Young democracies will by definition have less well-developed democratic structures: electoral processes, institutional mandates, and the composition of political parties may all be fluid and heavily contested in the period following democratization. Furthermore, young democracies may lack the traditions of a free press that informs voters with respect to the performance of their politicians, and the educational system may be weak, with entry—especially to higher education—restricted to the elite. Theoretical analysis as well as previous empirical work suggests that while democratization may provide some immediate benefits, some of its salutary impact on economic performance will be mitigated early on, as governments in such countries may have a particularly hard time formulating and executing consistent policies that provide the cornerstones for sustained growth.

Analysis of economic management in young democracies has focused to a large extent on the effects of the uncertainty present in such circumstances. Haggard and Kaufman stress that “uncertainties with respect to the stability of the new democratic order . . . affect the time horizons of both private and public actors,” leading politicians to pursue “policies aimed at managing opposition in the short run while discounting the gains from less popular reform measures” out of concern that political opponents will resort to non-democratic means (Haggard and Kaufman 1995, 152). Keefer (2005) highlights another source of uncertainty: the fact that politicians and political parties in new democracies lack track records, and thus have difficulty making credible campaign promises. This “credibility of commitment” problem fosters clientelism, as incumbents seek the support of any existing patron-client networks and target spending to benefit small groups, with which credibility is more easily built.

Other theorists have noted the time needed to build democratic institutions beneficial to growth, and suggested that young democracies will consequently reap fewer economic rewards. As Papaioannou and Siourounis point out, the adherents of the Austrian school mentioned in the previous section cautioned, “the benefits of democracy will show themselves only in the long run, while its more immediate achievements may well be inferior.” (Hayek quoted in Papaioannou and Siourounis 2004, 4). In Rodrik’s (1999; 2000) model of social cooperation discussed above, democracy facilitates policy stability only after repeated interactions by groups with competing agendas. This perspective implies an initial absence of norms of compromise, which may amplify the challenges arising because “new democratic governments faceexceptionally strong distributive pressures, both from groups re-entering the political arena after long periods of repression and from established interests demanding reassurance” (Haggard and Kaufman 1995, 152). We would therefore expect policy-making in new democracies to be characterized by acrimonious debate and unwillingness to compromise, resulting in policy volatility and impaired economic performance.

Surprisingly, relatively few studies have investigated the relationship between the age of democratic governments and economic performance. This lacuna stems partly from the preference among analysts for pooling data and thus looking at cross-country differences and at the relationship between long periods of democracy and at averages of economic indicators over time (Papaioannou and Siourounis 2004). Consequently, this gap is being filled as time series analysis becomes widespread. Although Przeworski et al. (2000) have a well-known finding that the older a democracy, the less likely it is to be reversed, he and his colleagues find that the age of democracy is not significantly related to economic performance.

Two more recent studies have found that young democracies in fact perform as well or better than more mature regimes. Controlling for other determinants of economic performance, Gasiorowski finds that average growth and inflation in young democracies do not differ significantly from “mature” democracies, no matter what threshold is used to separate these two groups (2000).4 Rodrik and Wacziarg (2004), on the other hand, find that a dummy variable for the first five years following democratic transition is significantly associated with higher economic growth and with lower variance in growth rates.5 Still another study suggests that states may experience slower growth in the first two years following democratization before seeing acceleration in growth (Papaioannou and Siourounis 2004). The fact that the latter analysis looks only at countries that permanently democratized, however, limits its policy relevance, since many of the greatest economic challenges occur in countries that eventually fell back into dictatorship.

Turning to other indicators of economic performance, Keefer finds that longer periods of uninterrupted democracy are associated with lower corruption, public investment, and public employment, as well as with higher provision of public goods ranging from the rule of law tosecondary education (2005).6 By contrast, Lake and Baum, running time series regressions, find that an increase in a given country's level of democracy results in a statistically significant and rapid jump in public service provision, measured by educational enrollment, life expectancy, and a host of other indicators (2001). The different conclusions reached by these different studies demonstrate that how one asks questions about the economic performance of new democracies, as well as the methodology used to answer that question, affects the results obtained.

===Summary===

As a political system, democracy has a number of distinctive attributes that have been posited by scholars to have important economic effects. By way of summary, we highlight the following hypotheses, some of which point us in contradictory directions:

(1) Owing to the influence of the median voter, democracies are more likely to redistribute income than non-democracies. This, in turn, reduces the growth potential of these polities.

(2) Political competition in democracies drives politicians to reduce taxes and increase expenditures; democracies thus tend toward budget deficits.

(3) Elections generate incentives for politically motivated manipulation of economic policy, resulting in a political business cycle.

(4) Owing to the inability of individual voters to organize effectively, public policy in democracies will be shaped powerfully by rent-seeking and welfare-reducing special interest groups.

(5) Democracies will exhibit greater policy consistency, since repeated negotiations over policy facilitate compromise.

(6) By introducing a modicum of competitive pressure into the monopolistic public sector, democracy will result in the provision of more and better public goods.

(7) In order to maintain the support of their core constituencies, political parties will adopt distinctive economic policies both in their platforms and when they achieve power. Left of center parties will favor the interests of labor; right of center parties those of capital.

(8) The presence of broad-based, cohesive political parties is conducive to high-quality economic management, since these are better able to mediate distributional conflicts.

(9) The separation of powers associated with democracy mitigates the potential for governmental abuse, since the different branches of government can check one another.

(10) The economic policies and performance of democracies depends upon whether they have adopted presidential or parliamentary systems of governance. Parliamentary systems will tend to support larger governments than presidential systems, but may reduce the ability of executives to accumulate and abuse power.

(11) The younger the democracy, the more unstable its economic policies and performance.

In the following section, we explore these hypotheses through the lens of the particular public policies that democracies actually adopt.

==II. Economic Policy in Young Democracies==

While democracy may have a direct effect on GDP growth, most studies of the overall democracy and growth relationship envision the former as having various positive or negative impacts on the latter through a variety of different channels, including those highlighted in the previous section: electoral politics, interest groups, institutions, and the age of the regime. This list, however, is far from exhaustive. Scholars have examined numerous other channels through which democracy affects growth (for in-depth discussions of this approach, see Tavares and Wacziarg 2001; Krieckhaus 2005; and Bourgignon and Verdier 2000). The advantages of an analytical approach that focuses on the precise pathways by which democracy influences economic policy and performance are twofold.

First, examining specific channels through which democracy impacts growth avoids some of the methodological pitfalls associated with simply plugging a variable measuring democracy into a standard growth regression. As Baum and Lake note, most studies adopting that approach do put forward some of the theoretical arguments regarding the democracy-growth relationship, but fail to account for the implied multi-colinearity in their econometric work (2003, 335). They cite as an example the argument that democracy encourages growth by rendering property rights more secure. This implies that measures of democracy will be correlated with investment—presumably another variable in the growth regression—since investors face less uncertainty about their returns. 

Investigating the relationship between democracy and specific policies, which in turn impact growth, helps to avoid this misspecification and thus may offer clearer indications of a causal relationship between democracy and economic growth. Second, this methodology provides more concrete guidance to policy-makers, both in developing countries and in industrialized countries seeking to promote development through foreign aid and other policies. Consequently, in this section we examine the specific economic policies that the leaders of young democracies seem to pursue through the lens provided by recent empirical research. We find that this approach indeed produces more clear-cut findings.

===Fiscal Policy===

As already noted in the first section of this paper, it has long been held that democratically elected politicians will seek to minimize taxation while maximizing government spending, and that as a result democracies will tend toward budget deficits. But empirical research suggests that the relationship between democracy and fiscal policy is complex, with some studies finding that democratic governments do not differ in their fiscal policies from non-democratic regimes, while others find that democracies, particularly younger democracies, do tend to have looser fiscal policies.

In a pioneering study that compares and contrasts the economic policies of democracies and non-democracies, Mulligan, Gil, and Sala-i-Martin (2004) find no significant relationship between countries' level of democracy and their average education spending, social security spending, and corporate tax rates, although they do find that more democratic states tend to have somewhat lower average government revenue than less democratic ones.7 Similarly, Satyanath and Subramanian (2004), find no robust relationship between levels of democracy and government consumption as a percent of GDP.8

However, in their broader study of the channels by which democracy affects economic growth, Tavares and Wacziarg (2001) find that the level of democracy is associated with higher government spending9. Similarly, Block (2002) finds that countries with competitive elections tend to exhibit higher current government expenditure than in countries without competitive elections. Further complicating the picture, Keefer (2005) finds a significant negative relationship between the number of years of uninterrupted democracy in a country and the average public sector wage bill as well as public investment (both as a percentage of GDP) over the period.

In fact, these results may not necessarily conflict with one another, due to the differences in the analytical techniques used and in the variables examined. The results of Tavares and Wacziarg (2001) and Keefer (2005) appear most directly relevant to the study of new democracies, the former because their time series regression takes account of within-country variation, and the latter because Keefer employs the age of democracy as an independent variable in his cross country regression. Thus, it would appear that young democracies may exhibit initial increases in public spending possibly followed by a longer-term decline.

===Monetary Policy===

Given its importance to economic well-being at both the macro- and micro-levels, few topics have attracted more research in political economy than the making of monetary policy (Drazen 2001). Monetary policy presents numerous puzzles for researchers, including the failure of some states to control inflation or to regulate the banking system and its money creation function. 

Further, researchers have been attracted to normative questions of institutional design: how does one enhance the credibility of commitment to monetary stabilization in those cases where policy-makers have a poor track record? In seeking to answer both these positive andnormative issues, political economists have explored a wide-range of variables that could influence the making of monetary policy, including the presence or absence of political business cycles and of democratic institutions that constrain (or not) financial profligacy.

In their broad analysis of the relationship between macroeconomic stability and democracy, for example, Satyanath and Subramanian (2004) find that the average level of democracy in a country has a significant and substantial negative association with average money supply growth over the period 1960 to 1990. Following the line of analysis put forward by Rodrik (2000), they attribute this relationship to the superior ability of democratic institutions to mediate distributive conflicts; indeed, more generally, democracy may be conceptualized as a technology for the peaceful resolution of distributive conflicts, which contributes to growth in myriad ways.

More narrowly, in studying monetary policy in Africa, Guillaume and Stasavage (2005) similarly find that democratic institutions enhance the quality of monetary policy-making. They note that monetary policy credibility depends crucially not simply on central bank independence, but on the extent of checks and balances in place to guarantee Central Bank independence. Formal structures such as constitutionally established vetoes can help to put such checks in place, but so can more informal institutions, such as multi-party democracy and the existence of coalition governments. Thus, while they do not test the relationship between better democracy and monetary policy econometrically, the find that higher levels of democracy are one factor facilitating the development of a credible monetary policy.

Although these studies do not directly address the conduct of monetary policy in new democracies, some suggestive implications can be drawn. Both, for example, stress the importance of effective institutions; in the case of Satyanath and Subramanian (2004), these institutions mediate distributive conflicts, while in the case of Guillaume and Stasavage (2005) they check political actors seeking to manipulate policy. Consequently, while democracy may facilitate better monetary policy over the medium and long term, new democracies with nascent institutions could be expected to experience difficulties controlling monetary management. We explore this question in greater detail below as we explore other economic policies that democratic leaders might seek to manipulate for political reasons.

===Exchange Rate Policy===

The choice of exchange rates has become one of the most difficult issues of economic policy facing governments in the post-Bretton Woods era. Faced with the “unholy Trinity” of trade-offs among competing economic objectives, nations must seemingly adopt the least of the evils and hope for the best. The near-continuous cycle of currency crises and exchange rate collapses since the 1970s suggests that the world’s economic managers are far from achieving a stable equilibrium.

Why do states find it so difficult to commit to credible exchange rate policies? Willett (2004) suggests that any analysis of that question must focus on politics. In particular, he asserts that owing to conflicting political pressures—say between interest groups and the median voter—“governments will not always choose policy regimes that are ideal from the standpoint of generating economic efficiency and avoiding crisis…” Alesina and Wagner (2004) find empirical support for this proposition in their study of the relationship between broad measures of institutional quality and exchange rate policy. Specifically, they find that countries with poor institutions tend to attempt to peg their exchange rates, but then fail to maintain the peg. Nonetheless, more fine-grained analysis may help illuminate how political parties and institutions aggregate competing interests within the cockpit of electoral politics, and the exchange rate policies that are generated as a result. We are unaware of any empirical work that takes the sort of theoretical sketch provided by Willett and others and examines it on either a case study or cross-country basis.

Instead, most research compares and contrasts “democracies” and “non-democracies” at the most abstract and aggregate level. Satyanath and Subramanian (2004), for example, use annual average changes in the nominal parallel market exchange rate as a broad measure of macroeconomic stability, noting that this variable reflects not only incorporates domestic factors such as inflation, but also external factors, such as problems with the balance of payments and debt. They find that the level of democracy has a significant and robust negative association with exchange rate volatility, with much larger coefficients than other variables tested, including income inequality and openness to trade. While Satyanath and Subramanian (2004) do not examine exchange rate policy specifically, Block et al. (2002) do attempt to determine whether political considerations impinge on exchange rate management. They find evidence that devaluations are postponed in pre-election periods, presumably to avoid provoking public dissatisfaction by increasing the price of imports.

Tavares and Wacziarg (2001), in contrast, observe no significant relationship between the level of democracy in a country and the black market premium on the exchange rate,10 which they employ as a proxy variable to measure distortion economic policies more broadly. Consequently, while exchange rate volatility may be lower in democracies, it is not because their exchange rate policies are more or less distorted. Clearly, more nuanced research is needed to advance our understanding of the political economy of exchange rate management.

===Public Goods Provision===

If voters have any direct influence in democracy, one might expect it to be felt in the area of public goods provision. Normally, voters want the state to provide education, health care, a clean environment, infrastructure, and an ever-expanding list of goods and services. In a major survey linking democracy and public goods, Lake and Baum (2001) find that public goods provision is not only greater in democracies but is generally qualitatively superior to that in less democratic countries as well. In cross sectional regressions, they find that higher levels of democracy are associated with better education, as measured by a host of indicators including literacy, primary school student-teacher ratios, and the level of enrollment at all grades, and with better health, as measured by life expectancy, mortality, vaccinations, and population per physician, as well as access to healthcare and clean water.11 Lake and Baum (2001) also run time series regressions and find that an increase in a given country's level of democracy results in a statistically significant and rapid jump in public service provision.

These results are also supported by descriptive statistics included in Papaioannou and Siourounis (2004), indicating that democratization yields rapid increases in life expectancy and schooling. Likewise, Tavares and Wacziarg (2001) find that higher levels of democracy are associated with higher average years of secondary schooling. Keefer (2005) also finds that longer periods of uninterrupted democracy are characterized by higher average secondary school enrollment, further bolstering the claim that democracy is associated with better public service provision.

That a positive relationship exists between democracy and the provision of public goods, specifically education and healthcare, appears straightforward. Both cross country and timeseries analyses indicate that greater democracy is associated with more and better educational and health outcomes. The evidence also suggests that even in new democracies, performance in this area tends to improve fairly rapidly. The posited theoretical reason for this apparently strong relationship is the demand of the median voter for such public goods, which of course are paid for by the polity at large. This could also be consistent with a broader political strategy of consolidating young democracies through the delivery of basic services, as well as the Aristotelian idea that since democracies rely on a cadre of educated citizens, they should be expected to invest in human capital. We note that while Persson and Tabellini posit that parliamentary regimes in particular should be relatively more effective at delivering public goods, we are unaware of any explicit comparisons of performance across different institutional structures in the context of the newly democratic states.

===Trade Policy===

Few public policies are more contested in democracies than foreign trade, and probably none have been subject to more research by political economists. With respect to developing countries, one of the major puzzles that has been examined in the literature is the shift to more liberal trade policies during the 1980s and 1990s, which seems surprising in view of the much-touted abilities of protectionist interest groups to block policy changes. In their analysis of this puzzle, Milner and Kubota (2005) find that higher levels of democracy are associated with more liberal trade regimes, particularly in the newer, developing-world democracies.12 Their results are robust to the inclusion of variables measuring other factors frequently cited as causing trade liberalization, such as economic crisis and external pressure. The conclusion they draw follows Mayer (1984) and Rodrik (1998) in suggesting the importance of the median voter. Since the median voter in the developing world profits from intensive use of her labor, she may have a strong interest in increasing labor-intensive exports and capital-intensive imports. While this analysis is plausible, it must be emphasized that these authors do not empirically investigate whether or not the median voter does in fact benefit from trade liberalization. Indeed, evidence on this point is mixed. While Bourguignon and Morrison (1990) find that openness is associated with a reduction and inequality, Kapstein and Milanovic (2003) have shown that the medianvoter in the poorest countries does not benefit economically from globalization, a finding that poses a puzzle for this line of analysis.
Papaioannou and Siourounis include in their examination of the democracy-growth relationship descriptive statistics showing that &quot;democratizations are followed by a substantial increase in international trade . . . &quot; (2004: 10), indicating that the policy changes encountered by Milner and Kubota (2005) produce real increases in trade as a percentage of GDP. This finding is confirmed by Tavares and Wacziarg, who show that a greater degree of democracy is significantly associated with a greater trade-to-GDP ratio. Other research encountering a positive relationship between democracy and trade liberalization includes Dethier et al.’s (1999) study of economic reform in post-Communist countries. In a pooled OLS regression they find that countries' average scores on the Freedom House index are significantly associated with an index of liberalization that includes trade liberalization, domestic price liberalization, and privatization.

The robust finding that more democratic governments tend to have more liberal trade policies suggests that young democracies are likely to liberalize trade with a resulting increase in their trade-to-GDP ratios. However, the reasons for this shift in trade policy and performance have yet to be conclusively determined.

===Privatization===

Privatization of state-owned enterprises has also proved controversial, which is not surprising given that it generally means worker displacement and rising unemployment, as new owners of formerly state-owned enterprises seek to make organizational changes that will enhance efficiency. Does this mean that young democracies, which could be especially motivated to avoid increasing unemployment, are likely to put privatization decisions on hold? Surprisingly, that does not seem to be the case.

In their study of 76 developing countries during the period 1987 to 1994, Biglaiser and Danis (2002) find that the presence of democracy has a substantial and significant positive association with the extent of privatization.13 Indeed, simple averages for each year in theirsample show that democracies privatized more than non-democracies in every year. This relationship holds even when controlling for numerous other factors generally cited as partial determinants of privatization, such as the level of development, the fiscal deficit, and the current account position. They explain their findings by noting that while proposals for privatization in democracies may be met with highly visible protests on the part of such affected groups as workers, within authoritarian regimes it is the executives at state-owned enterprises who will effectively exert pressure from behind closed doors to block privatization. The association between democracy and privatization is supported by the above-mentioned study of post-Communist countries by Dethier et al. (1999), which employs as a dependent variable an index that includes as one of its components privatization of state-owned enterprises.

Further, as Kapstein and Milanovic (2003) have shown, in many new democracies privatization has been associated with the rise of social spending targeted at displaced workers. Rather than assisting the poor or those who are most vulnerable, political actors have sought to win support for privatization and globalization by providing side-payments in the form of unemployment insurance and pension reform, thus permitting them to make the transition to the new, private sector-oriented economies in which their skills may be in high demand. Thus, privatization and other economically disruptive policies may succeed particularly in those democratic settings where they are associated with more generous safety net provision.

===Institutional Quality===

Among their many attributes, democracies are often portrayed as less corrupt and administratively more efficient than non-democracies, and older democracies are posited to be better managed than younger democratic states. Keefer (2005) tests the relationship between the age of democracy and variables he sees as symptomatic of clientelistic behavior, and finds that longer periods of democracy are associated with lower corruption, higher bureaucratic quality, and the rule of law (as well as with higher secondary school enrollment and lower public sector spending, as mentioned above). Numerous other studies support the hypothesis that democracy is associated with lower corruption (Treisman 2000)14 and higher institutional quality (Rivera-Batiz
2002).15 Similarly, Rigobon and Rodrik (2004) find that democracy and the rule of law are mutually reinforcing.16

While much of this literature finds that democracy improves institutional quality only after an extended period of time (Keefer 2005, Treisman 2000), other work has found its effect to be more immediate. In a study of economic performance in post-Communist countries, Beck and Laeven (2005) find that the level of democracy in 1992 is significantly and positively associated with the level institutional development in 1996.17 The theoretical analyses discussed in the previous section, which see democracy as checking abusive government and introducing competitive pressures into the public sector, provide some indication of the causal mechanisms behind these findings. However, further exploration into how and when democratic government produces better institutions, if that is indeed the case, is need.

===The Political Business Cycle===

As discussed in Section I, political business cycle (PBC) theory makes the general claim that electoral schedules influence a country’s economic policies. While the theory of political business cycles suggests that politicians will attempt to manipulate growth to further their chances of reelection, in practice their ability to do this may be severely limited, particularly in developing countries. While increasing the rate of GDP growth with sufficient precision to affect the outcome of an election is a tall order for officials in even the most developed economies, the ability of governments in developing countries to do this is extremely limited due to relatively low levels of monetization, the small size of government expenditure to GDP, and greater vulnerability to external shocks (Schuknecht 1996; Brender and Drazen 2004). It is thus unsurprising that no studies have found that PBCs in developing countries cause growth to change in the periods before or after elections. For example, Schuknecht (1996) finds no association between election periods and changes in output growth.18 Similarly, in a study ofAfrican economies, Block el al. (2002) mention in passing that they find no association between multi-party or founding elections and growth.

Other evidence suggests that this failure to impact aggregate economic performance is not for lack of trying. Block (2002) finds that current expenditure picks up in election years, but only in countries holding competitive elections.19 Consequently, a shift from dictatorship to democracy implies the emergence of a political budget cycles.20 Whereas Block (2002) compares democratic and non-democratic regimes, Block et al. (2003) contrast new democracies with more established ones, and find that political budget cycles—manifested through increased public spending, net claims on government, and seignorage—are more pronounced under newer democratic governments.21 They find that these impacts are amplified when the election in question is a founding election, defined as the first competitive election after a period of non-competitive or no elections. Moreover, founding elections are associated with acceleration of the growth of the money supply (specifically M1). They outline a number of reasons why PBCs might be more pronounced in new democracies. Not only do incumbents who have not been competitively elected likely have more discretion to manipulate the economy, but such leaders have an incentive to fend off any challengers early in order to minimize future competition (Block et al. 2002: 9,12).

The association between new democracies and political business cycles is confirmed by Brender and Drazen (2004), who find that political budget cycles are present only in new democracies. In a sample of 68 democracies from 1960 to 2001, they find that if the sample is narrowed to exclude the first four elections following democratization, all traces of a political budget cycle disappear. By contrast, election year dummies are significantly associated with higher deficits and greater expenditure during the first four elections following democratization.

Including separate dummy variables for the first, second, third, and fourth election following democratization shows that the significance of the election-year declines as the democracy ages.

These studies of the political business cycle suggest that new democracies will undergo an increase in the variability of rates of inflation and money supply growth and in the level and composition of government spending. In addition to the disruptions that these variations cause, they will also likely retard growth in the years after democratization. Ramey and Ramey (1995: 1148) note that volatility in monetary growth and fiscal policy— precisely the variables affected by the political business cycle—significantly lowers growth. Exploring this relationship in detail, Aizenman and Marion (1999) find that volatility in these variables is associated with lower private investment, which presumably hampers growth.

As noted in Section I above, the political business cycle may theoretically enhance economic efficiency, since it allows the electorate to select the most competent candidate, although this result depends on whether or not one assumes that politicians know whether or not they are competent (Persson and Tabellini 2000).22 To date, no one has found evidence of this theoretically possible “efficient PBC.” Consequently, the presence of political business cycles in new democracies, with the concomitantly higher volatility of monetary and fiscal variables and the resulting slower growth, suggests that new democracies may face particular challenges in the formulation of economic policy.

===Summary===

Just as democracies have distinctive political attributes, they also seem to generate some distinctive public policies. Further, the age of democracy seems to matter to economic policy-making, with older democracies performing better than younger democracies across a range of measures. To highlight some of the major findings of the empirical literature, we note that:

(1) Democracies, including young democracies, appear to provide more and better public services to their citizens.

(2) Democracies, including young democracies, are more open to trade than non-democracies, perhaps due to the median voter’s influence.

(3) Democracies, including young democracies, are more likely to privatize their state-owned enterprises than non-democracies.

(4) Democracies have better institutional quality than non-democracies, but older democracies fare better along this dimension than do young democracies.

(5) Politicians in young democracies appear to make extensive use of the political business cycle, introducing macroeconomic volatility into the growth equation.

In the following section, we examine the extent to which these findings are supported by our new data set, which is more up-to-date and includes more cases than most data sets used in the studies cited herein.

==III. Economic Performance of Young Democracies==

In this section we provide an overview of the economic performance of young democracies since 1960. Overall, since 1960 we count 114 total episodes of democratization, 44 of which were reversed at some point; among those that were reversed, several then later underwent second and even third democratization episodes, as indicated by Table 1 below (see Appendix 1 for precise definitions and methodology). Overall, nearly 38 percent of the democratizations that occurred between 1960 and 2003 eventually underwent reversals, ceasing to be democracies for some period of time.23 Cases in which countries underwent democratization for the first time in the post-1960 period had nearly the same rate of reversal (38.6 percent), as those undergoing democratization for the second time (41.7 percent). In contrast, only one of the six cases in which a country democratized for a third time was reversed, while in the single case in which a country underwent a fourth democratization, it was not reversed.

The question that we ask in this section is whether differences can be discerned among those that successfully democratize and those that undergo total reversals. We also wish to see if any regional differences can be found among the world’s young democracies in terms of their economic performance. Overall, our objective is to see whether the descriptive statistics yield any patterns that could be amenable to more precise testing. To this end, we examine the average economic performance of countries in each of the ten years following democratization. As we will see, we believe that some intriguing patterns do indeed emerge. We leave aside issues of specific causality in this working paper, with the intention of addressing this question in our monograph.

Before describing our findings, a brief discussion of our methodology is warranted. Our unit of analysis is young democracies, and as mentioned above, some countries have undergone more than one democratization in the period under study. We have counted each episode of democracy as a separate case. The analysis in this section compares the average performance of cases in which democratization did not undergo a reversal to that of those in which it was ultimately reversed. As is evident from a look at the underlying data included in Appendix 2, the size of the group of new democracies that eventually undergo reversals falls over time, as each year a few countries cease to be democracies. Because we are interested in how new democratic governments manage the economy, it would not make sense to include years in which a country’s government was not democratic.24

The example of Argentina provides an illustration of this methodology. Argentina democratized twice during the period: once in 1973 and again in 1983. These two episodes count in our dataset as two separate young democracies. In the former case, democracy was overthrown in 1976. As a consequence, Argentina from 1973 to 1975 is included in the subgroup of young democracies that are ultimately reversed, but drops out after the second year (i.e. 1973 is year zero, the year of democratization; 1974 is year one; 1975 is year two). The episode of democracy in Argentina that began in 1983 is included in the subgroup of young democracies that were not reversed (with 1983 counting as year zero of democracy, 1984 as year one, and so on).

===Growth===

Contrasting the economic performance of successful new democracies with that of democratizations that were ultimately reversed reveals that growth in the former trends upwards, while the latter shows no clear trend, as Figure 1 demonstrates. Because the initial difference in the average growth rates is statistically significant as are the differences in later years,25 it would appear that growth in unreversed democracies is on average lower in the years immediately following democratization, but overtakes that of reversed democracies around the seventh year after democratization. This finding is particularly interesting in light of those theories discussed in Section I suggesting that democracy takes time to yield economic benefits (Haggard and Kaufman 1995; Keefer 2005, Rodrik 1999, 2000). Young democracies that ultimately undergo total reversals may cut corners early on, avoiding some of the challenges of democratization but forgoing its later benefits.

Figure 2 suggests that rates of investment are also significantly higher in unreversed new democracies than in countries where democracy is overthrown, although in both cases it trends upward. Moreover, the variance of investment falls steadily in unreversed new democracies, while exhibiting no clear trend in countries where democratization is ultimately reversed. The literature focusing on the demands for redistribution unleashed by democracy (Acemoglu and Robinson 2006) casts this pattern in an interesting light. Lower investment may signal misgivings on the part of those holding capital regarding the desirability of democracy, doubts that later translate into support for a return to authoritarianism. In short, after an initial honeymoon period, it appears that investors in some democracies quickly become aware of the fragility or perhaps undesirability of their political system and investment levels stagnate.

===Inflation===

Analysis of inflation in young democracies is complicated by a handful of cases that experienced periods of hyperinflation, with the annual change in consumer prices reaching into the thousands of percent. In the interest of uncovering general trends, we here exclude rates of inflation more than five standard deviations above the average for each subgroup for each year. To cite the most extreme example, Peru in 1990 (ten years after democratization) recorded inflation of nearly 7500 percent. As this is more than eight hundred standard deviations above the average for the “reversals” subgroup ten years after democratization, we exclude this value.26 The trends discussed here are robust to changes in the rule used to exclude extreme values.

Applying this methodology, consumer price inflation in unreversed new democracies is initially high, but trends downward, while inflation in new democracies undergoing reversals shows no clear trend, fluctuating around 15 percent throughout the period. Average rates of inflation converge around the seventh year after democratization, as Figure 3 illustrates. As would be expected, data on the average rate of money supply growth and the average change in the official exchange rate show very similar trends.

These trends are broadly in line with the findings of Block et al. (2003) that democratization is associated with acceleration in the growth of the money supply, but that this slows again as democracy ages. This pattern also lends also credence to the idea, discussed in Section I, that thebenefits of democracy take time to materialize, either because of the uncertainty present under a new political regime or because institution-building takes time. Where these difficulties are confronted early on, economic performance may be initially inferior but later improve, while in cases where they are suppressed, the seeds for later democratic reversal may be planted.

===Government Spending===

Government spending as measured by public consumption as a percentage of GDP is initially about three percentage points higher in democracies that do not undergo total reversals than in those that do, a statistically significant difference. However, while spending trends downward in the former, it rises in the latter, and the two converge roughly nine years after democratization, as can be seen in Figure 4. That no political budget cycle is evident in this data is not surprising, since election schedules differ between the countries in the sample.

These trends could be interpreted to mean that while the state in successful new democracies initially responds to demands for resources from the newly empowered population with relative largesse, it later grows more capable of managing such demands in a fiscally responsible manner. By contrast, governments in countries ultimately undergoing another reversal apparently become less able to assuage such demands, and become gradually more profligate.

===Openness===

Figure 5 suggests that successful new democracies do on average exhibit greater openness to trade than new democracies that are later reversed, as measured by the ratio of imports plus exports over GDP, and once again, the difference is statistically significant, with the null hypothesis of equal average openness rejected in all 11 years. Both groups show an upward trend in openness over the ten years following democratization. This finding is in line with other work indicating that democracy facilitates trade liberalization as well as economic reform more broadly (for example, Milner and Kubota 2005).

===Ethnic Divisions===

Numerous studies have found that a higher degree of ethnic fractionalization is associated with slower economic growth, higher corruption, and low institutional quality (Easterly, Ritzen, and Woolcock 2005; Alesina et al. 2002), suggesting that countries with an above-average degree of ethnic division may face particular difficulties when undergoing democratization. Our data appear to support this proposition. Table 2 suggests that while new democracies with lower levels of ethnic fractionalization on average have a significantly higher rate of economic growth during the first five years prior to democratization, the average growth rates of the two groups converge in the second five-year period after democratization. This would appear to support theories that view democracy's ability to facilitate conflict resolution as salutary for growth. Interestingly, whereas growth rises with democratization in countries with below-average ethnic fractionalization, it falls with democratization in the more ethnically diverse countries, perhaps due to the disruption caused by the airing of ethnic conflicts suppressed during periods of authoritarian rule.

Similarly, young democracies with a lower than average degree of ethnic fractionalization have average rates of investment that are 1-2 percent of GDP higher than those with relatively greater fractionalization. Again, there is some trend towards convergence toward the end of the first ten years following democratization, although the differences between the average rates of investment are statistically significant at the 1 percent level in every year. Analysis of inflation data also lends support to the following hypothesis: that governments of states with higher than average levels of ethnic fractionalization have difficulty managing the economy in the years immediately following democratization, but to some extent master these difficulties over time.

Thus, our data suggest that the level of ethnic fractionalization plays a role in determining how well young democracies are able to deal with the challenges of political development and economic management, with states characterized by a high degree of ethnic division having more difficulty managing the economy in the initial period following the transition from authoritarianism.

===Regional Variations===

Changes in key economic indicators in new democracies follow quite different trajectories in different regions, a finding in line with those of Krieckhaus's (2005) contention that democracy's economic impact varies by region. While we will not pursue here the reasons for this variation in detail—that topic will be fully developed in our monograph on the economics of young democracies—we might simply assert that we do not believe that these differences can be ascribed solely to such “initial conditions” as geography. As Steven Fish has written, “polities undergoing regime change do not necessarily suffer under a tyranny of initial conditions. They make their own fates” (Fish 2001, 82). What this suggests is that democratic institutions and economic policy decisions also matter greatly, and that these are not merely a function of a region’s prior history. They are also a reflection of the ideas that leaders hold, the institutions—e.g. independent central banks—that they do or do not establish, the support they receive from foreign donors, and the possibility of anchoring their economies in a larger entity like the European Union. These hypotheses will be pursued in the monograph version of our work. For now, we will simply summarize the variation that we observe.

In terms of growth, the performance of Eastern European countries differs significantly from that of other new democracies, with output contracting in the first three years after democratization and growth resuming four years after democratization, as is apparent from Figure 6. This sharply different growth trajectory, presumably caused by the specific circumstances of the transition from communism, demonstrates the difficulty in drawing overall conclusions about the economic performance of young democracies and their survival or failure.

Interestingly, average growth for new democracies in Sub-Saharan Africa generally matches and even outperforms that of the other countries in the sample, as Figure 7 illustrates. This result is likely a product of the strong performance of newly independent democracies in the region during the 1960s, a period of stronger growth worldwide. Indeed, if cases classified as new democracies at independence are excluded from the African group, average growth falls by a percentage point or more.

Trends in inflation exhibit similar regional divergences.27 While new democracies in Latin America are plagued by high and volatile inflation, Eastern European nations faced high and variable inflation immediately after the transition to democracy, but this has since moderated. By contrast, average inflation in Africa rarely exceeds 10 percent, as Figure 9 demonstrates. It is worth noting that Africa’s relatively low average inflation was not solely a result of 14 countries’ membership in the CFA Franc zone. While new democracies in this monetary union do exhibit low inflation—under 10 percent on average, consumer price inflation in Sub-Saharan African countries outside of the CFA Franc Zone has averaged under 20 percent, well below the averages seen in Latin America and Eastern European countries in the early years of democracy.

Once again, it would appear that the high inflation in new Eastern European democracies was a consequence of the transition from communism, which they were able to overcome during the first five years following democratization. The Latin American countries' inability to reign in inflation on a consistent basis could be taken as evidence that the region's young democracies have failed to mediate between groups demanding resources, instead resorting to expansionary policies that have periodically produced hyperinflation.

Regional differences are also apparent in public spending, with the four regions with substantial numbers of new democracies having fairly different levels, as is apparent from Figure 9. Few clear trends are apparent, although the persistent regional differences suggest one explanation for the lack of clear conclusions in the literature on public policy and democracy, since many such studies do not include regional dummies (for example, Rivera-Batiz 2002).

===Summary===

This analysis bears out the implications drawn from broader literature on growth and democracy, in particular that new democracies that ultimately undergo reversals under-perform relative to their successful counterparts. Although growth is initially lower in the sustained democratizers, it continually rises over time. By contrast, countries in which democracy is ultimately reversed show a trend of stagnant or falling growth. Similarly, new democracies that do not undergo reversals have higher inflation in the early years, but improve over time. Investment is also lower in democracies that experience reversals, as is trade openness. Government spending also trends upwards in countries where democratization is reversed and trends downward in successful democratizers. 
Overall, it would appear that establishing economic credibility early in the democratic mandate is a difficult task, but once such credibililty is gained, growth accelerates and inflation stabilizes. Where credibility is absent, these variables show no such positive trend. This suggests that discovering the deeper sources of economic policy credibility in young democracies should be a major target of research.

This analysis also demonstrates the need for detailed regional case studies. Growth and inflation evolve in markedly different ways in new democracies in different regions, while regional differences in public spending greatly overshadow changes in spending during the ten years following democratization. Understanding the reasons behind this regional variation will be one of our major tasks in the monograph that we are also writing.

==IV. Conclusions and Policy Recommendations==

There are few greater policy challenges today than ensuring the success of the world’s many unconsolidated democracies. As we have seen, the economic performance of new democracies—and hence the chances of regime survival—has varied along a number of critical variables, including their ability to maintain investment levels, to control the money supply and budget deficits, and to open their economies to foreign trade. We have also seen that regional differences are significant, with Latin American democracies in particular experiencing the most volatility in terms of economic performance. Pursuing the sources of these differences is clearly a crucial task for research.

From a policy perspective, our work makes several points that we believe are relevant to public officials in both developing countries and the industrial world:

First, the evidence suggests that leaders in young democracies often face trade-offs between their electoral and economic reform objectives. The tendency of leaders to exploit the political business cycle in the run-up to elections indicates that in some settings political competition may induce behavior that is inconsistent with the building of strong economic foundations for sustained growth.

Second, the capacity of leaders in new democracies to pilot their economies varies a great deal across countries. This means that “one size fits all” policy solutions are unlikely to be appropriate where democratic consolidation is a fundamental medium-term objective, and that particular country circumstances must be taken into account as the two tracks of economic reform and democracy-building are pursued.

Third, foreign aid donors must recognize the richness of the democratic experience around the world and the various forms that it takes. While some of the academic literature suggests, for example, that parliamentary regimes may be more growth-enhancing than presidential systems, that work hardly provides a conclusive basis for preferring one type of democracy over the other. Still, the potential costs and benefits of different electoral and institutional systems are worth full consideration as new democracies shape their constitutional political economy.

Fourth, our analysis of the economic performance of new democracies strongly suggests that deteriorating or stagnant economic performance constitutes a red flag or warning signal that the country is at risk of political reversal. Poor economic performance—low growth, high inflation, etc.—during the first five years following a democratization is not necessarily cause for alarm. However, if that performance does not pick up or deteriorates, democracy is at greater risk of being overthrown. Although the direction of causality remains to be settled—does failure to improve economic performance discredit the regime, or is such performance a symptom of weak institutions?—new democracies plagued by negative growth and high inflation, and which fail to undertake such necessary reforms as trade liberalization and privatization, merit the attention of foreign aid donors who seek to promote democratic consolidation.

NOTES

1 This argument, it will be observed, rings of the “fiscal federalism” literature which argues that federalist systems introduce competition into the public sector by allowing economic agents to “vote with their feet,” forcing local governors to restrain their personal rent-seeking and provide the public services that people actually want. However, questions may be raised about the economic benefits of political decentralization in those developing countries where government institutions are too weak to provide many of the public goods that citizens demand.

2 We thank Phil Keefer for emphasizing this point.

3 Notwithstanding recent instances of electorates unwilling to wait until the next election to unseat incumbents, as in Ecuador, Bolivia, Argentina, Thailand, and the Philippines.

4 Gasiorowski (2000) employs a dataset of his own construction, which classifies 97 countries as democratic, semi-democratic, or authoritarian in each year from independence through 1992.

5 Rodrik and Wacziarg (2004) analyze data from 154 countries. They look specifically at the average rate of GDP growth in the five years following democratization.

6 Rather than treating each country in each year as an observation, Keefer treats each episode of uninterrupted democracy as an observation and averages the values of the dependent variables over the episode. He uses data from 1975 to 2000. He classifies as democracies regimes with a top score on the Legislative and Executive Indices of Electoral Competition from the World Bank’s Database on Political Institutions. Indicators of corruption, bureaucratic quality, and the rule of law are from Political Risk Service’s International Country Risk Guide.

7 Mulligan, Gil, and Sala-i-Martin (2004) average the country's Polity IV score over the 30-year period to measure democracy.

8 Satyanath and Subramanian (2004) employ the average of the Polity IV variable measuring the level of constraints on the executive to measure the level of democracy in a country during the period in question.

9 Note that they use Freedom House ratings.

10 The premium is defined as the difference between the black market rate and the official rate, divided by the official rate.

11 Baum and Lake (2001) use the overall Polity III score to measure the level of democracy.

12 Milner and Kubota (2005) measure democracy using the Polity IV score, and run time series cross-sectional regressions to test its relationship with openness, as measured by both the unweighted average tariff rate and the Sachs-Warner dummy variable. They analyze a sample of 100 countries over the period 1970 to 1999.

13 Biglaiser and Danis (2002) use the Polity IV score to construct a dummy variable that classifies countries as either democratic or non-democratic. They measure the level of privatization in a country with a variable consisting of thevalue of privatizations in a given year divided by the state-owned enterprises' share of GDP in the previous year multiplied by the current year’s GDP.

14 Treisman (2000) uses Transparency International’s perceived corruption index to measure corruption. He obtains like results employing the Freedom House rating and Przeworski et al.’s classification.

15 Rivera-Batiz (2002) studies this relationship using a sample of 115 countries and employing pooled OLS regression, averaging the variables' values over the period 1950 to 1990. He measures democracy with the Freedom House index, and institutional quality using the index constructed by Hall and Jones (1999), which combines the Political Risk Service institutional quality index with the Sachs-Warner dichotomous measure of openness.

16 Rigobon and Rodrik (2004) define democracy in terms of the Polity IV score.

17 Beck and Laeven (2005) use the Polity IV score for constraints on the executive in 1992 as their measure of democracy. They assess institutional quality using an index that includes corruption, the rule of law, regulatory quality, and government effectiveness, among other things

18 Schuknecht (1996) examines a sample of 35 developing countries between 1970 and 1992.

19 Block examines a sample of 69 developing countries. As independent variables, he selects indices of electoral competitiveness and democracy (both taken from the World Bank’s Database of Political Institutions) as well as a dummy variable for election years. On the assumption that leaders facing reelection will boost current expenditure, which tends to more immediately benefit voters, Block employs current expenditure as a share of total central government expenditure as the dependent variable.

20 Interestingly, whereas Keefer (2005) finds that the proportion of public spending devoted to investment will fall as democracies mature, Block (2002) finds evidence that electoral contestation is associated with a fall in public investment as a share of GDP. These results are not necessarily contradictory, since investment as a share of the government budget may rise while falling as a percentage of GDP. Nonetheless, their logic conflicts on a theoretical level: Keefer views public investment as a prime avenue for clientelistic channeling of jobs and money to supporters, whereas Block sees current expenditure as the easiest way to direct public resources to supporters.

21 Block et al. (2002) use a sample of 44 Sub-Saharan African countries for the period 1980 to 1995 and employ as independent variables an election-year dummy and a dummy for competitive elections.

22 In this model, if politicians think they are competent, then they will attempt to ramp up spending or stimulate the economy. By contrast, if a politician knows he is incompetent the costs of macroeconomic manipulation to him personally will outweigh the gains from trying to trick voters into believing he is competent.

23 Some of the new democracies that were not totally reversed did undergo minor democratic reversals. While we do not discuss such cases separately here, we will do so in our monograph. For a more detailed discussion of this issue, see Appendix 1.

24 This may at first glance generate concerns about attrition bias; however, this would only undermine our findings if the democracies undergoing reversals during the period in question exhibited better economic performance than those countries that remained democracies for the first ten years after democratization. That various studies (most notably Przeworski et al. 2000) have found that the countries with low or negative growth are more likely to undergo reversals suggests that our findings are not driven by attrition bias. Indeed, if only countries in which democracy endured for at least 10 years, but was eventually reversed, are included in the reversals group, the general relationships described continue to hold.

25 The null hypothesis that the average growth rates for the two groups are equal can be rejected at the 5 percent level in 6 of the 11 years. References to statistical significance in this section refer to t-tests of the difference between means of independent samples.

26 The instances of hyperinflation excluded are: Argentina (1984-5,88-91), Bolivia (1984-5), Brazil (1988–94), Nicaragua (1990-1), Peru (1988–90), Armenia (1994), Belarus (1993-4), Bulgaria (1997), Lithuania (1993), Romania (1993, 1997), and Ukraine (1993-5).

27 Whereas we excluded cases of hyperinflation from the discussion of inflation above, in this subsection, we have included these episodes. The fact hyperinflation occurred in two particular regions suggests it is an important part of the regional story, and should not be left out.

* The first argument is a ''target register'' which value is affected by the instruction.
* The second argument is the source value register.

==Availability==
The LGR instruction is 64-bit, and is only available on the 370 series and z/System.  It will cause an opcode exception on the 360 series.

==Operation==
The LGR instruction copies a 64-bit value from the register specified by the second argument to the register specified by the first argument.

Condition codes are not changed.

Register 0 is valid for either register and is not ignored as in some other instructions.

==Exceptions and Faults==
* 360 Series: Opcode Exception
* 370 Series and zSystem: None.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello!

This chapter could have improved some by specifying that _dragShape should be of wkdShape.

It is funny, reading articles like this, you think you are specified everything to do, this is not the case here.

I had to add the inclusion of WKDShape as well.

It really should be a little bit more specific &quot;do this&quot; and &quot;do that&quot; whith what, and where to put it.

All a great tutorial, but it could have improved with some graphics, like class diagrams and such.

'''LH''' - Load Halfword - Opcode 48 - RX format Instruction (32 Bit)

==Format==
:LH 2,N2
:LH 11,106(8,10)

The specific syntax is
:LH ''target register'',''offset''(''index register'',''base register'')
Where the ''offset'', ''index register'' and ''base register'' values will be determined automatically by the assembler if the [[360_Assembly/360_Instructions/USING|USING]] pseudo-instruction has been used, and the target address label used is within 4096 bytes of the value of some base register.
==Opcode==
{{360 opcode RX|48}}
==Availability==
The LH instruction is available on all models of the 360, 370 and z/System.  

==Operation==
The LH instruction reads a 16-bit integer value from the memory address specified by the argument and puts it in the low 16 bits of the target register specified by the first argument. The remainder of the register is unchanged.

The source argument address must be aligned to a half-word boundary (i.e. 2 bytes) or an exception will occur. The Condition Code field in the Program Status Word is not changed.

==Exceptions and Faults==
* The source address must be within the range of valid memory or an operation exception occurs. 
* The source address must be aligned to a halfword boundary  or an address exception occurs. 
* The storage key for the source address must be the same as the current process (or the process must be privileged with a key of zero) or a memory protect violate exception occurs.

'''LA''' - Load Address - Opcode 41 - RX format Instruction (32 Bit)

==Format==
:LA 2,N2
:LA 11,106(8,10)

The specific syntax is
:LA ''target register'',''offset''(''index register'',''base register'')
If a label is used instead of explicit index and base register and offset, then the ''offset'', ''index register'' and ''base register'' values will be determined automatically by the assembler if the [[360_Assembly/360_Instructions/USING|USING]] pseudo-instruction has been used, and the target address label used is within 4095 bytes of the value of some base register.

|colspan=2|(12 bits)&lt;br&gt;''offset''&lt;br /&gt;'''0..FFF'''
|}

* The first argument is a ''target register'' which value is affected by the instruction.
* The second argument is the address to be resolved.
* The ''base_register'' and ''index_register'' values are 0 to 15.  The offset value is 0 to 4095. If either or both base and index registers are specified as 0, the value of that register is presumed to contain 0.
* This is a 32-bit instruction, and only uses the low 32 bits of the register when a program is running in 64-bit address mode; the high bits remain unchanged.
* Of the 31 bits, bit 0 is always cleared by this instruction. In 24-bit mode; bits 1-7 are also cleared.

==Availability==
The LA instruction is available on all models of the 360, 370 and z/System.  
==Condition code==
This instruction does not alter the condition code.

==Usage==
The LA instruction has three general uses.
* To set a register to an immediate value from 0 to 4095 (use register 0 for the base and index registers and the amount to add as the displacement).
* To add an immediate value from 1 to 4095 to any register except 0, either use register 0 for the index register, and the same register for the base and target registers, or use register 0 as the base register and the same register for the index and target registers, and the amount to add to that register as the displacement.
* To set a register to any value up to 2^31 in 31-bit or 64-bit mode, or 2^24 in 24-bit mode. Use whichever register has the desired amount as the base (or index) register, if there is an additional amount to add, the value in an index (or base) register may be used, and, if desired, this may also be increased by the displacement address.
* If the displacement is 0 and either (1) the base register is 0, and the index and target registers are the same (and are any register except 0), or (2) the index register is 0 and the base and target registers are the same (and any register except 0), the instruction is effectively a no-op (equivalent to an instruction to add 0 to the specified register).
* If the displacement address, base and index registers are all zero, it zeros the target register (although the XR or SR instruction with both arguments the same would be faster and use less memory).

Note that unlike most instructions, the LA instruction is used to place a value into a register; the resulting address does not have to correspond to an actual address and is not checked for validity. Overflow cannot occur as the top bit of the result is always set to 0, and in 24-bit mode, the top 7 bits of the result are set to 0.

The LA instruction ''could'' be used to clear the value of a register by using 0 for the base, index and displacement values; the actual value in register 0 would not be used and the register would be zeroed. However, the [[360_Assembly/360_Instructions/SR|SR]] or [[360_Assembly/360_Instructions/XR|XR]] instruction with the same register number for both arguments will zero a register faster and produces a shorter instruction.

==Operation==
The LA instruction computes either a 31-bit value (if the program is running in 31-bit or 64-bit address mode) or a 24-bit value from the address specified by the second argument and stores it in the register specified by the first argument, clearing the high bit (0) in 31-bit or 64-bit mode, and the high byte (bits 0-7) in 24-bit mode.  The address is computed by using the base-displacement value of the address.  The address value, from 0 to 4095, is added to the value of the contents of the base register (unless it is register 0, then it is presumed to contain zero).  To this is added the value of the contents of the index register (unless it is register 0, then it is also presumed to contain zero). In 31-bit or 64-bit mode, the high bit is forced to 0. In 24-bit mode, the high byte is forced to 0.  This total is then stored in the target register.  This value does not have to be a valid address; while the LA instruction is often used to compute an address, it can be used to set the value of a register, e.g. a way to increment register 1 by 1 is the following:

: LA 1, 1(0,1)
Or to increment register 7 by 5
: LA 7, 5(0,7)

In some cases, the LA instruction is used to create addressing for program segments larger than 4095 bytes, by arranging a second register to point 4096 bytes after the first:&lt;br/&gt;
 ROUTINE  CSECT
          BALR  12,0
          USING *,12,11
          LA    11,4095(0,12)      Register 0 explicitly stated as the index register
          LA    11,1(11)           Register 0 is implied for the Index register
In the above case, register 12 is the base register for the first 4096 bytes of the routine, and register 11 is the base register for the portion of the program above 4096 bytes.

==Exceptions and Faults==
None. The address being generated is not checked for validity, and because in all modes (24-bit, 31-bit or 64-bit), bit 0 is always cleared, overflow cannot occur.

=== Development Cooperation and Knowledge Sharing ===
[[File:Global Agenda.jpg|thumb|The Global Agenda for Development]]
Knowledge sharing is an activity through which information, skills and expertise are exchanged among people or the members of a community or within an organization.  Development actors recognize that knowledge constitutes an essential resource for development and that knowledge sharing is indispensable for networking and advocacy.  Nevertheless, information sharing continues to be a major challenge since many organizations consider their know-how to be a personal strategic asset for keeping a competitive advantage in fund-raising activities.

This handbook, along with the [[Development Cooperation Handbook/The video resources linked to this handbook|linked audiovisual media]], is:
* a testimony of the beauty and power of knowledge sharing,
* an action that contrasts the ideologies of the clash of civilizations,
* a meeting ground for different experiences of social responsibility, 
* a workshop for the renewal of faith, hope and commitment.
The [[Development Cooperation Handbook/The Vrinda Project|partners]] that help in collecting and distributing the resources of this handbook share a sense of &quot;[[Development Cooperation Handbook/Our role as individuals|world citizenship]]&quot;, a [[Development Cooperation Handbook/Communication and Knowledge Management/The relational content of communication/the social games#the positive sum game|positive-sum-game]] approach to inter-community relationships and a vision of our &quot;Earth as a Common Home&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;

For those who accept this invitation, welcome on board!

      <text xml:space="preserve">== '''Benefits of moderate aerobic exercise on Amyotrophic lateral Sclerosis''' ==

=== Background ===
Amyotrophic lateral Sclerosis (ALS) also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease is a degenerative disorder of specific nerve cells of the spinal cord, brain stem and the brain itself that affects the upper and lower parts of the body. Amyotrophic lateral Sclerosis is the most common disease in a group of diseases known as Motor Neuron Disease (MND). It is a neurological disease that selectively affects the nerves of the body which are specifically known as motor neurons. Motor neurons are cells that control voluntary muscle action and help us preform everyday actions such as walking, speaking, breathing, swallowing and general movement of the body. Being a neuron muscular disease, once Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis reaches the majority of neurons there is nothing exercise can do as the patient is completely bed ridden through partial or complete paralysation.&lt;ref&gt;Lui, A.J. and Byl, N.N. (2009) A systematic review of the effect of moderate intensity exercise on function and disease progression in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Journal of Neurological Physical Therapy 33, 68-87&lt;/ref&gt;


=== Risk and symptoms of Amyotrophic lateral Sclerosis ===
ALS generally strikes patients of middle age (25 to 55) and is more often found in men than women. In the initial stages of ALS symptoms can be so slight that they are often overlooked. The earliest symptoms are weakness and/or muscle atrophy.Yet this can often be disguised if a person does physical activity as they perceive it as just natural fatigue. Other initial symptoms include muscle fasciculation (twitching), cramping or muscle stiffness and slurred or nasal speech. These symptoms can come in any particular order and will depend on which motor neurons in the body are damaged first. &lt;ref&gt;Lopes de Almeida, J. P., Silvestre, R., Pinto A. C., and de Carvalho, M. (2012) Exercise and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.  Neurological Sciences 33, 9-15.&lt;/ref&gt; As symptoms progress each part of the body beginnings slowing down and eventually reaches a parasitic state. From this stage death is inevitable. In recent years more and more neurologists are stating that “Physical inactivity could expose people with ALS to even greater health risks, and exercise in moderation can bring the benefits of exercise while minimizing the risk of worsening their conditions”. When you look into it, there is no stone cold evidence that exercise can actually do damage to patients yet there is evidence for the benefits.


=== Aerobic exercise benefits for Amyotrophic lateral Sclerosis ===
Exercise is used to improve health, maintain fitness and is important as a means of physical rehabilitation. In relationship to Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, moderate aerobic exercise is vital in two important ways. The first way is for prolonging the symptoms from multiplying and the second is for the prevention of the disease all together. Between the years of 1992 and 2011 five major studies where done suggesting that Aerobic exercise played a major role in prolonging of ALS symptoms and the increased quality of life. These studies are as followed:

* '''1992:''' scientist discovered that short moderate aerobic exercise boosted the levels of neurotrophins in the brain. Neurotrophin are a substance of the brain that protects motor neurons and triggers growth of new motor neurons.
* '''1995:''' studys where done in which rats did moderate running exercise each day for one week. It was found that these rats had doubled levels of BDNF (brain derived neurotrophic factor)&lt;ref&gt; Itoh, H, Ohkuwa, T, Yamamoto, T, Sato, Y, Miyamura, M, and Naoi, M. (1998) Effects of endurance physical training on hydroxyl radical generation in rat tissues, Life Sciences 63, 1921-1929&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''2000:''' researchers found that increase levels of neurotrophin following moderate aerobic exercise actually helped protect the brain in rats from injury or neuron diseases. &lt;ref&gt; Itoh, H, Ohkuwa, T, Yamamoto, T, Sato, Y, Miyamura, M, and Naoi, M. (1998) Effects of endurance physical training on hydroxyl radical generation in rat tissues, Life Sciences 63, 1921-1929&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''2003-2005:''' two groups of rats with ALS were tested. The first group did moderate running exercise over the space of several weeks while the second group did moderate swimming over the same amount of time. Both sets of groups came back with positive results. In the first group it was reported that moderate running actually increased the lifespan of rats with ALS. While in the second group it was found that swimming significantly delayed clinical onset and dropped losses of motor neurons in the spinal cord by almost 50%. &lt;ref&gt;Kirkinezos, I.G, Hernandez, D., Bradley, W.G. and Moraes, C.T (2003) Regular exercise is beneficial to a mouse model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Annals of Neurology 53, 804-807&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''2011:''' researchers found that aerobic exercise not only increased neurotrophins but had the potential to keep the power on in the motor nerves by increasing the amount of oligodendrocytes in the brain and spinal cord. Oligodendrocytes are cells of the brain and spinal cord that supply critical energy to mitochondria keeping the energy flowing in distal axon and nerve terminals. They do this by making up the myelin sheath which extends and speeds up the functioning of the neurons.This meant that symptoms decreased and the quality of life increased. &lt;ref&gt; Nave, K.A. (2010) Myelination and the trophic support of long axons. Nature Reviews Neuroscience 11. 275-283 &lt;/ref&gt;

These tests showed that through moderate aerobic exercise both neurotrophins and Oligodendrocytes are increased or maintained allowing for a decrease in the rate of destruction of motor neurons. This meaning that the onset of the diseases was a lot less severe and allows patients to live longer and healthier lives. It is important to note that aerobic exercise does not reverse the disease but only delays the onset.

=== Moderate aerobic exercise activities suited for Amyotrophic lateral Sclerosis  === 
Moderate aerobic exercise activities are vital when attempting to prolong the onset of ALS, recommeded exercises are:   
* walking
* swimming 
* stationary cycling
It is important that these exercises are all done at 60 to 65% of a persons oxygen output, last no longer than 30 minutes and are partaken at least 3 times a week. This intensity allowed weakened muscles to preform exercise without overworking or damaging them and promotes the increase of protective substances in the brain and spinal cord. By doing this exersice it keeps fast twitch muscles active and oxidates them slowing down the process of atrophy. It also found that patients had significant signs of reduced functional decline and increased post rehabilitation survival. &lt;ref&gt;Neeper, S.A., Goauctemez-Pinilla, F., Choi, J. and cotman, C. (1995) Exercise and neurotrophins. Nature 373, 109&lt;/ref&gt;. While swimming significantly delayed clinical onset and dropped losses of motor neurons in the spinal cord by almost 50%.

=== Further reseach ===
Further research is being done to find out more about the effects of aerobic exercise in ALS patients. Testing still needs to be done on how different intensities may affect the disease and if resistance exercise can play a role. But what we are sure of is that any form of moderate aerobic exercise weather it is swimming, running or cycling can have a positive result rather than no exercise at all. It can increase the neurotrophins and oligodendrocytes in the brain and spinal cord allowing for a reduced functional decline and increased survival rate.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The ideas used in cryptography have been used to create a large number of protocols.

The original application of these ideas was secret hiding --
Alice wanted to send a message to Bob,
but Alice and Bob didn't want anyone else to know exactly what the message said.

More recently, many &quot;cryptographic protocols&quot; have been developed
that do useful things *other* than secret hiding.

Some cryptographic protocols make secret hiding better or more convenient in some way --
* key-agreement protocols such as Diffie-Hellman key exchange
* Message authentication

(FIXME: say something here about commutative ciphers)

Other cryptographic protocols and cryptography-related ideas are used to improve on non-cryptographic systems:
* Early &quot;everyone in favor, hold up their hands while I count&quot; voting systems don't hide any secrets; end-to-end auditable voting systems (which internally use cryptographic ideas) are arguably better.
* mental poker
* convergent encryption
* digital signatures
* version identifiers in Mercurial and git.
* error-detection and error-correction codes.
* the rsync protocol
* verifiable computing
* various ideas for improving (non-secret) email to reduce the amount of spam, such as hashcash, Sender ID, DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM), etc.

In particular, the first fully homomorphic encryption was announced in 2009 by Craig Gentry.
It is widely expected that homomorphic encryption will make it relatively easy to do things that were previously considered impossible or infeasible.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Phishing is sending an e-mail that legitimately to be from an organization or (bank, PayPal, eBay…) but is indeed from a fake a phisher. This e-mail activity is to try to receive private personnel information such as log in passwords bank account information and so on. These e-mails will sometimes have links in them to click on and bring you to a seemingly legitimate web site. Instead of an official web site you are actually being brought to the phishers web site. This is referred to as web site spoofing. To get the victim to click on the link is usually done by saying something to the effect of their accounts needs to be updated. Many individuals can become prey to this type of e-mail. To stay protected from this type of activity it is important to be aware of any e-mail stating that they are from a certain company. It’s best to be safe and check with the company by phone rather than click through a web site link in an e-mail. It’s also important to find the phone number of the company in a different place other than the e-mail you just received. These are just a few tips to help keep your information safe.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Importance of Business Writing Skills ==
Communication skills, including writing, are one of the most important transferrable skills that students should learn when they are in college.&lt;ref&gt;Importance of Good Writing Skills in the Workplace ''[http://smallbusiness.chron.com/importance-good-writing-skills-workplace-10931.html]''&lt;/ref&gt; Most professions require high competency in written communication. It could be a chance for one to shine or hinder one's success. With emails, memos, letters, texts and even Tweets, most people spend a fair amount of time at work communicating via the written word. Whether you are messaging a colleague, writing to your manager, crafting the company newsletter, or writing a press release to the media, your writing skills can boost or hinder your career easily, even if you do not have a “writing” profession. Basically, writing skills make a difference in how you come across.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Through business writing exercises, students learn to convey messages and ideas in a concise way. Concise and self-explanatory messages help increase productivity at the workplace as they save time by eliminating the need to ask for further instructions. Good writing reflects not only the credibility of the writer but also projects a positive image for the company. 

== Academic Writing vs. Business Writing ==
Unlike academic writing, where ideas are explored and length is encouraged, business writing needs to be clear and concise. Business writing takes place in many forms, as categorized in internal and external communications; the major differences between academic writing and business writing are as followed:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.instructionalsolutions.com/blog/bid/61931/Business-Writing-vs-Academic-Writing&lt;/ref&gt;
# Writing at work focuses on problem solving. 
# Work-related writing targets multiple audiences with different perspectives. 
# Writing at work may be read by unknown readers. 
# Writing produced at work can be used indefinitely and can be used in legal proceedings. 
# The format for work documents varies greatly from the format for academic documents. 
Typically, business writing are taught in the English department with by professors or technical professionals. The course can be taught as undergraduate lower level coursework with emphasis on practical work or writing projects. 

== Writing Across the Workplace ==
Communication in the workplace may be categorized into internal and external purposes. Depending on the nature of work, these two categories demand different writing styles and structures. Therefore, students should be taught to identify the elements of the communication before they begin writing. 
* Writer: The encoder or the party that creates a message through writing
* Audience: The decoder or the party that receives a message and interprets it accordingly
* Medium: The channel in which a message is communicated (examples: print, electronic, broadcast)
* Noise: The interference that could potentially distort the transmission of a message
* Context: The circumstance under which a message is created, including the writer's and audience's frame of references 

=== Internal Communications ===
Internal communications is the function responsible for the dissemination of information within an organization. Memo, business letters, internal publications, e-mails, internal announcements and promotions, etc. are examples of internal communications. Modern communication technologies today have greatly enhanced the feasibility of communication in the workplace by allowing real-time and asynchronous writing. Hence, it is important for students to learn how to work with others when writing for internal purposes. Students can experience collaborative writing in the classroom using MUD (Multi-user Domains) or open-access web applications such as Google Drive and Wiki. Following is an example of in-class activity that incorporates collaborative writing:

==== Lesson in Collaborative Writing and Editing ====
[[File:Students in a computer lab.jpg|thumbnail|right|Students write synchronously in collaborative exercise.]]
This copyediting exercise needs to be conducted in classroom with sufficient computers for all students, or students can bring their own laptop or tabloid computers to class. Break students into groups of five. You may choose a MUD application that you are more comfortable working with. For explanation purposes, Google Docs is used as the collaborative tool in this activity. Ask students to create an account on Google if they have not already have a user account. You should have several sample memos that are already saved on your Google Drive. Depending on the number of students in class, you need to have at least one memo for each group. Use the sharing feature on Google Docs to allow access for students to edit the sample memo assigned to their groups. Ask students to utilize the chat and comment features to communicate synchronously as they edit the text together. When the activity is over, conduct a class discussion about the pros and cons in collaborative writing practices and how to maximize productivity through collaborative writing. 

=== External Communications ===
Corporate branding, public relations, investor relations, marketing and publicity, advertising, sales, promotions, event announcements, media and press releases are practices of external communications. Writing for external communications is usually audience-directed and aims to build corporate identity. Another objective of such writing is to sell a product or service provided by the company. Students should practice persuasive writing that fits into various media, including radio, television, press, and the Internet. The following is an activity that can be used to teach business writing pertaining to external communications:

==== Lesson in Marketing Writing ====
For this exercise, students can work individually or in small groups. Give students an item (it can be a stationary, electronic gadget, or other items you can find in the classroom) and tell them to write an advertisement that sells it in a magazine. Students should identify the target market/audience, determine selling strategy, develop copy/text, and provide explanations for their creative plan. Students can use online open-source programs such as [http://picnik.com/ Picnik] and [http://pixlr.com/editor/ Pixlr] to create marketing materials for the item they are selling. Have students vote on their most favorite creative work by the end of the session. The purpose of this activity is to let student explore the marketing writing process and experience writing for external communications.

=== Writing for Crisis Communication ===
Crisis communication can be for either internal or external purposes. It is sometimes considered a sub-specialty of both the public relations profession and business continuity that is designed to protect and defend an individual, company, or organization facing a public challenge to its reputation.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crisis_communication&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for crisis communication should focus on communicating urgency and possible solutions to react upon. Students can be given a problem situation whereby they plan a mock strategic outline through writing. 

== Stay Professional ==
Students tend to sway from their objective when they are not adept in business writing. Aside from practicing to write with clarity and completeness, teachers should remind students to reserve some acts of professional courtesy in their writing. As business writing is increasingly getting into shorthand fashion, students must learn to avoid sloppiness in their writing. It can be troublesome if messages become too abrupt or incomplete and thus causing misunderstanding. Even if it was an email, the writer should take time to check spellings and write in complete sentences. Whenever necessary, graphical elements can help to better explain a message than lengthy paragraphs.

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Background =

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) refers to a class of diseases that impact on the normal functioning of the heart and/or blood vessels. CVD is comprised of many diseases including;

*Ischaemic heart disease.
*Stroke.
*Coronary heart disease.
*Myocardial infarction.
*Hypertension.
*Rheumatic heart disease&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

CVD is the the leading cause of death within Australia, resulting in 32% of deaths nationally during 2007-2008 with the majority of these deaths  a result of Ischaemic heart disease and stroke. 3.5 million Australians are currently living with one or more CVD conditions and prevalence increases significantly with increasing age. 19% of 45-54 year olds compared to 62% of 75+ years old are currently living with CVD&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

Non-modifiable risk factors such as age and family history are strong predictors of CVD. Modifiable risk factors include; smoking, physical inactivity, poor diet and obesity&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.


==Physical Activity and Cardiovascular Disease==


Increasing physical activity and decreasing sedentary behaviour will reduce a individual's risk of Cardiovascular disease. A combination of aerobic and resistance training completed with moderate intensity will assist in:
*Decreasing fat mass.
*Increased cardiovascular adaptations.
*Increased strength and functional capacity.
*Increased quality of life. 
*Greater prospect of exercise program adherence&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.

=Sedentary Behaviour=


Increased sedentary behaviour has been shown to increase CVD mortality risk, with a strong association between time spent sitting and mortality. The highest mortality rate is demonstrated in sedentary individuals who are also obese. Decreased glucose tolerance, alterations to lipo-protein lipase activity and cardiac changes are related to an increased CVD mortality rate resulting from sedentary behaviour&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;.

=Aerobic Training=


Aerobic training can lead to adaptations within the cardiovascular system that help protect itself from CVD. Aerobic exercise decreases body fat, decreases plasma triglycerides and increases cardiac output. Aerobic training adaptations are highly beneficial for decreasing CVD risk and reversing known risk factors such obesity and high blood pressure&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;.

=Resistance Training=


Resistance training develops strength, endurance and physical capacity. These benefits are very important in older populations as it allows maintenance of independence, decreased disability and a greater quality of life. Resistance training also adds variety to an exercise program which can help facilitate adherence&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;. Resistance training has been indicated to be safe for all populations if correct loads, exercise selection and techniques are used. Light loads and utilising machines are encouraged in the initial stages of the exercise program to allow development of basic strength and technical understanding of movements&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,6&lt;/sup&gt;.

=Potential Complications=


Extremely vigorous exercise without prior experience can be detrimental to cardiovascular health in individuals with moderate to high risk levels. Myocardial infarction may be induced due to immense cardiovascular stress&lt;sup&gt;3,7&lt;/sup&gt;.

Resistance training with heavy loads also increases blood pressure and stresses the cardiovascular system. Correct breathing and lifting techniques assist in minimising blood pressure increases during resistance training&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;.

=Physical Activity Recommendations=


Medical advice should be obtained from a GP prior to commencement of a physical activity regime. Medical screening can determine a individual's CVD risk and the appropriate level of physical activity intensity. Medical clearance should then be passed on to the supervising fitness professional.  

Training should be predominantly aerobic based to maximise cardiovascular adaptations with an additional resistance training component for strength and functional capacity development. Programs should be tailored to individual needs based on age, current fitness level and risk factors.  


&lt;big&gt;Aerobic training&lt;/big&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
| '''Frequency''' || 3-5 sessions per week.
|-
| '''Intensity''' || Moderate intensity activities.
|-
| '''Time''' || Aim for 30 minutes or more each day (can be completed throughout the day).
|-
| '''Type''' || Brisk walking ideal for initial training before moving on to moderate intensity activities such as jogging. Non-weight bearing exercises such as swimming and cycling for obese. 
|}



&lt;big&gt;Resistance training&lt;/big&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
| '''Frequency''' || 1-2 sessions per week.
|-
| '''Intensity''' || 1-2 sets, 10+ repetitions, 8-12 exercises per session. Load of around 40% 1RM.
|-
| '''Time''' || 30-45 minutes per session.
|-
| '''Type''' || Alternate upper body and lower body exercises to minimise fatigue ensuring appropriate movement and breathing techniques are used. 
|}


Individuals at higher risk should be supervised by a fitness professional and sessions should not be undertaken alone. Medications should be continued and the supervising fitness professional should be aware of current medication use. Training in extremely hot conditions should also be avoided.

Training should be ceased immediately if the individual feels shortness of breath, light-headedness, chest pain, chest tightness or an irregular heartbeat.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=OSI Model=
The Open Systems Interconnection(OSI) model is a theoretical model of networking that organizes network functions into seven layers (physical, data link, network, transport, session, presentation, and application) and specifies the communication interfaces between the OSI model layers and network endpoints utilizing various protocols.  Although the model is theoretical the seven layers provide standardized functions that take place at each layer. The model is designed so that a layer serves the layer above it and is served by the layer below it.[[File:Osi-model.png|thumb|OSI Model]]

==Layers==

===Layer 1: physical layer===
The physical layer defines electrical and physical specifications for devices. In particular, it defines the relationship between a device and a transmission medium, such as a copper or optical fiber cable|fiber optical cable. This includes the layout of Lead (electronics)|pins, voltages, line Characteristic impedance|impedance, cable specifications, signal timing, network hub|hubs, repeaters, network card|network adapters, host adapter|host bus adapters (HBA used in storage area networks) and more.

===Layer 2: data link layer===
The data link layer provides the functional and procedural means to transfer data between network entities and to detect and possibly correct errors that may occur in the physical layer. Originally, this layer was intended for point-to-point and point-to-multipoint media, characteristic of wide area media in the telephone system. Local area network architecture, which included broadcast-capable multi-access media, was developed independently of the ISO work in IEEE 802|IEEE Project 802. IEEE work assumed sublayer-ing and management functions not required for WAN use. In modern practice, only error detection, not flow control using sliding window, is present in data link protocols such as Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP), and, on local area networks, the IEEE 802.2 Logical link control|LLC layer is not used for most protocols on the Ethernet, and on other local area networks, its flow control and acknowledgment mechanisms are rarely used. Sliding window flow control and acknowledgment is used at the transport layer by protocols such as Transmission Control Protocol|TCP, but is still used in niches where X.25 offers performance advantages.

===Layer 3: network layer===
The network layer provides the functional and procedural means of transferring variable length data sequences from a source host on one network to a destination host on a different network (in contrast to the data link layer which connects hosts within the same network), while maintaining the quality of service requested by the transport layer. The network layer performs network routing functions, and might also perform fragmentation and reassembly, and report delivery errors. router (computing)|Routers operate at this layer, sending data throughout the extended network and making the Internet possible. This is a logical addressing scheme – values are chosen by the network engineer. The addressing scheme is not hierarchical.

===Layer 4: transport layer===
The transport layer provides transparent transfer of data between end users, providing reliable data transfer services to the upper layers. The transport layer controls the reliability of a given link through flow control, segmentation/desegmentation, and error control. Some protocols are state- and connection-oriented. This means that the transport layer can keep track of the segments and retransmit those that fail. The transport layer also provides the acknowledgement of the successful data transmission and sends the next data if no errors occurred.

===Layer 5: session layer ===
The session layer controls the dialogues (connections) between computers. It establishes, manages and terminates the connections between the local and remote application. It provides for Duplex (telecommunications)|full-duplex, half-duplex, or Simplex communication|simplex operation, and establishes checkpointing, adjournment, termination, and restart procedures. The OSI model made this layer responsible for graceful close of sessions, which is a property of the Transmission Control Protocol, and also for session checkpointing and recovery, which is not usually used in the Internet Protocol Suite. The session layer is commonly implemented explicitly in application environments that use remote procedure calls. On this level, Inter-Process (computing)|Process communication happen (SIGHUP, SIGKILL, End Process, etc.).

===Layer 6: presentation layer===
The presentation layer establishes context between application-layer entities, in which the higher-layer entities may use different syntax and semantics if the presentation service provides a mapping between them. If a mapping is available, presentation service data units are encapsulated into session protocol data units, and passed down the stack.

===Layer 7: application layer===
The application layer is the OSI layer closest to the end user, which means that both the OSI application layer and the user interact directly with the software application. This layer interacts with software applications that implement a communicating component. Such application programs fall outside the scope of the OSI model. Application-layer functions typically include identifying communication partners, determining resource availability, and synchronizing communication. When identifying communication partners, the application layer determines the identity and availability of communication partners for an application with data to transmit. When determining resource availability, the application layer must decide whether sufficient network or the requested communication exist. In synchronizing communication, all communication between applications requires cooperation that is managed by the application layer.

=TCP/IP Model=
The developers of the TCP/IP protocol suite created their own architectural model to help describe its components and functions.  This model is similar to the OSI model except it is a four layer standard compared to the seven layer of the OSI model.  Because the four layers account for all 7 layers of functions in the OSI model, each layers function is not as strictly defined in this model.[[File:Application Layer.png|thumb|Model Comparisons]]

Worldwide, over one-third of [[Exercise_as_it_relates_to_Disease/The_benefits_of_exercise_for_reducing_symptoms_of_polycystic_ovarian_syndrome_(PCOS)|reproductive age women]] are obese (body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m2)and another 29% are overweight (BMI 25.0-29.9 kg/m2). Once a woman is pregnant, both maternal and fetal risks are increased by high maternal BMI. Pregnancy-associated morbidity and mortality are higher in obese women than in normal-weight women &lt;ref&gt;

==Workload of Exercise==

During the first trimester of pregnancy, it is vital to avoid laying flat on the back or standing in a particular spot for a long period of time. This may result in blood flow restriction to the foetus. High intensity exercise should also be avoided as it will increase core body temperature, increasing temperature of the foetus. However, light walks, aqua aerobics, light strength and conditioning exercises is recommended to aid back to accommodate with weight gain during the second and third trimester. 

Exercise intensity may be increased during the second and third trimester. 30 minute training sessions 3 times a week, during weeks 11 to 14 on the borg scale is said to be optimal. Heart rate is not an accurate measure of exercise intensity as basal heart rate will increase during pregnancy. Increasing intensity of the exercise will not always be beneficial to the mother or the foetus. Knowledge on optimal exercise routines and intensity for each trimester of the pregnancy should be obtained. Recent studies have shown training too often may result to giving birth to a smaller sized baby. Training at too high intensities may put too much stress on joints and pelvic floor muscles. Pelvic floor muscles supports the weight of the unborn baby and controls urination and bowl movements. Extra pressure can lead to urine being passed involuntarily because of a more relaxed pelvic floor.

== Exercises to avoid while pregnant ==
During pregnancy, avoid sports and activities with increased risk of falling. 
include:
* Contact sports or activities that carry a risk of falling (such as trampolining, rollerblading, downhill snow skiing, horse riding and basketball)
* Competition sports – depending on the stage of pregnancy, the level of competition and your level of fitness
* 
* After about the fourth month of pregnancy, exercises that involve lying on your back – the weight of the baby can slow the return of blood to the heart. Try to modify these exercises by lying on the side.
* 
* In the later stages of pregnancy, activities that involve jumping, frequent changes of direction and excessive stretching (such as gymnastics).
* 
* If you're not sure whether a particular activity is safe during pregnancy, check with your healthcare professional.

=== '''What is Cerebral Palsy?''' ===
Cerebral Palsy is an umbrella term given to a group of disorders that affect movement[1]. It is a physical disability caused by an abnormality or non-progressive lesion which has damaged the developing brain, usually prior to birth and although it is a permanent condition it is not unchanging[1].

=== '''Possible Causes''' ===
:* Complications at birth, asphyxia (lack of oxygen)&lt;ref&gt;Cerebral Palsy Alliance; date visited 20/10/12; http://www.cerebralpalsy.org.au/&lt;/ref&gt;
:* Combination of events causing injury to a babies developing brain[1]
:* In most cases, brain damage occurs in the uterus or before 1 month old[1]
:* Stroke most common cause in babies after 1 month old[1]
:* Stroke occurs spontaneously or from surgical or heart problems[1]

=== '''Diagnosis''' ===
Cerebral Palsy is often very difficult to diagnose and generally requires repeated tests before it can be officially diagnosed[1]. Parents are usually the ones who first become aware that something is wrong when their child is not reaching the established [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_development_stages developmental milestones]. Once alerted doctors will take and carefully examine a full medical history of the child and then monitor the child's movements and muscle tone&lt;ref&gt;How is Cerebral Palsy Diagnosed?, last updated 09/2009, viewed 17/10/12, http://www.mychildwithoutlimits.org/?page_id=04AECCDA-C111-5304-45D35BF814B7F724&amp;r=1&lt;/ref&gt;. Observation of the babies [http://www.cerebralpalsy.org.au/about-cerebral-palsy/basic-guide-to-cerebral-palsy/diagnosing-cerebral-palsy/general-movements-assessment general movements], whether they have very relaxed, loose muscle or tight, stiff muscle and if they have any postural preferences will help with the diagnosis. Once this has been done the child must be monitored to insure it is not a more serious progressive disorder before the diagnosis of Cerebral Palsy can be made[2].

=== '''Prevention Methods''' ===
Currently there is no total way to prevent or cure cerebral palsy[1], however two methods have been developed to reduce the severity of cerebral palsy:
:* Magnesium Sulphate: given to pregnant women when they are at risk of having a pre-term birth[1]. This can help protect the unborn child from brain damage which can lead to cerebral palsy[1].
:* Cooling Cap: This is used when new born babies that have suffered brain damage, due to lack of oxygen before birth[1]. The cooling cap aims to reduce the impact of the brain damage[1].

=== '''Treatment''' ===
There is no clear treatment for cerebral palsy, however research development in brain plasticity has given hope to those with the condition[1]. The brain's plasticity allows for injured areas of the brain to be taken over by another section, by compensating for the injured area[1]. In the future it is hopeful that gene and stem cell therapy may be used, even before a baby is born to repair damaged cells of the brain that would generally lead to cerebral palsy[1].

=== '''Recommendations''' ===
==== Physical Therapy ====
Studies have shown that resistive exercises could be positive in muscle strengthening in cases where muscle weakness causes dysfunction. Training was found to increase strength and improve motor activity in individuals with cerebral palsy&lt;ref&gt;K. W. Krigger, M.D, M.E.D; Cerebral Palsy: An Overview&lt;/ref&gt;.

==== Resistance Exercises ====
Resistance training may aid in the amount of knee crouch during gait by focusing on strengthening the quadriceps. A study showed that children with cerebral palsy were significantly weaker in the quadriceps and hamstrings than those without&lt;ref&gt;D. L. Damiano, C. L. Vaughan, M. E. Abel; Muscle response to heavy resistance exercise in children with spastic cerebral palsy&lt;/ref&gt;. By following a training program, the quadriceps strength was improved at all three angles of knee flexion as a result of the resistance training[4]. Quadricpes weakness was shown to be major contributor in crouch gait, and by strengthening the quadrcipes with resistive exercises may contribute to the treatment of cerebral palsy[4].

In order to have normal motor control, a certain amount of strength must be present, individuals with cerebral palsy lack this strength and as a result, their motor function is affected&lt;ref&gt;D. L. Damiano, M. F. Abel; 1998; Functional Outcomes of strength training in spastic cerebral palsy&lt;/ref&gt;. Increasing strength on the lower limbs was shown to positively affects gait and increase free walking velocity[5]. Continuing a training program focusing on strength in the lower limbs would be beneficial to improving walking cadence and velocity[5]. A strength training program could enhance the motor function of those with cerebral palsy, focusing on the larger muscle groups first, such as the quadriceps and hamstrings to enahance the ability to walk.

==== Aquatic Exercises ====
Aquatic exercises may be very beneficial for individuals with cerebral palsy. This is due to the buoyancy of the water minimising the influence of gravity and providing more postural support, as well as reducing the levels of joint loading and impact on the joints, providing a gentler environment for individuals with cerebral palsy&lt;ref&gt;M. Kelly, J. Darrah; 2007; Aquatic Exercise for Children with Cerebral Palsy&lt;/ref&gt;. The added benefit of aquatic exercises is the resistive forces of buoyancy and viscous drag, giving a variety of aerobic and strengthening activities that can be modified to accomodate different levels of motor function to people with cerebral palsy[6]. Although there are positive elements to aquatic exercise for people with cerebral palsy, there are factors that must be considered before exercise can begin[6]. They are:
:* Adequate intensity, duration, and frequency (this will depend on this severity of the condition)[6]
:* Will a group environment be more beneficial than training individually[6]
:* Pool environment is suitable and safe[6]

=== '''Safety Considerations''' ===
People with Cerebral Palsy are highly susceptible to falls and in some cases seizures. Take these points into consideration while exercising:
:* Ensure there is adequate support available in the area such as hand rails or walkers
:* Remove any objects from the area which may present as a hazards, such as benches and weights
:* Take extra care if walking through wet, slippery areas such as around a pool

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Osteoporosis: The Silent Disease =
Osteoporosis is a disease that causes the bones to become brittle and fragile due to a reduction in density and quality of bone matrix. These changes cause a large increase in the risk of fractures, there are often no signs of osteoporosis until the first fracture. This is why it is referred to as &quot;The Silent Disease&quot;. Osteoporosis is a disease often seen among the elderly. This is due to the changes in bone remodeling as we age. During early adulthood bone matrix is at its most dense, as we age bone matrix is absorbed while new matrix is formed, this is normally an even equation. Unfortunately as we age this equation can become unbalanced leading to a greater pace of bone absorption compared to the formation of new matrix, this is the cause of osteoporosis. 

Men and women over the age of 60 are at a higher risk of osteoporosis and while it is a disease associated with age it is still possible to develop at a younger age. Osteoporosis is diagnosed through a Bone Mineral Denisty (BMD) test. The most commonly used BMD test is DXA (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry) which is similar to an X-ray but can detect changes in bone loss. A list of all types of tests can be found in the recommended readings. Osteoporosis is diagnosed against a set of threshold values created by the World Health Organisation (WHO). Osteoporosis is diagnosed when a person’s BMD is equal to or more than 2.5 standard deviations below this value.  
== Connection Between Resistance Training and Osteoporosis ==

Resistance Training or weight lifting has been shown to provide benefits to many different types of athletes in regards to strength, power, endurance and hypertrophy gains although is not of common practice in the older population. It is a type of training normally undertaken by the younger population with association to specific sport development programs. Wolff's law states that stress or mechanical loading applied to the bone via the muscle and tendons has a direct effect on bone formation and remodeling. While resistance training has been shown to have an improvement on various athletic performances it can also extend into benefits with everyday life activities.

The goal of resistance training in regards to osteoporosis is to maintain or increase BMD and therefore reduce the chance of suffering a fracture. Resistance training has been shown to improve BMD in site specific areas and should therefore be targeted at areas that reduce the like hood of falls. Targeted muscle areas should include all major muscle groups of both lower and upper extremities in order to help increase BMD of all major bones such as hips and the lumbar spine which are at high risk of fractures and if fractured can lead to devastating consequences such as surgery, loss of function and death.

== Physical Activity Guidelines to Prevent/Manage Osteoporosis ==

When prescribing exercise programs for individuals with high risk of fractures such as those suffering from osteoporosis, with particular emphasis on the elderly, there are certain precautions and tests that should be conduced before undertaking exercise in avoid unforeseen calamities.
 
==== Precautions &amp; Safety Concerns ====

* Ensure the individual has sought advice from a medical professional and has been cleared to undertake the program.
* Make sure the individual is under the supervision of a trained instructor to ensure proper use and technique of equipment and exercises are taking place.
* Reduce the risk factors of falls associated in physical activity environments such as dim lights, scattered objects and loose carpet or flooring. 
* Depending on the additional needs of the individual in regards to vision and hearing the use of trochanteric pads may need to be arranged.
* Ensure that any medication taken will not effect or cause risk factors when physical activity is undertaken.

==== Recommended Physical Activity ====
When designing exercise programs for individuals with osteoporosis special attention and awareness of their like hood to suffer fractures needs to be kept in mind. Any resistance training session should start with a warm up and end with a cool down while incorporating some form of flexibility training. Increases in flexibility has been heavily linked with reduced falls risk. 

Resistance training should be undertaken at a minimum of two sessions per week containing a variety of 8 to 10 different exercises per session. Three sets of each exercise should be performed with 8 to 12 repetitions. It is recommended that the individual begins the program starting at 50% of the 1 repetition max with the goal of obtaining  85% of their 1 repetition max through repetitions. Despite these recommendations the goal of any program should be long term adherence to the program, which will have the greatest benefit overall.

[[w:Phytopathology|Phytopathology]] is the study of of plant diseases.

==Root rot==
'''Root rot''' is a condition that occurs, because of poor aeration and microbial, especially water mold problems. Dead roots allow rot to spread throughout the plant. This can be a result of inadequate oxygenation, sanitation and stagnation. It is usually lethal, since there is no certain effective treatment. The effectiveness of predator fungus remains in question.

The excess water makes it very difficult for the roots to get the air that they need, causing them to decay.

Root rot is commonly caused by members of the [[w:water mold|water mold]] genus ''[[w:Phytophthora|Phytophthora]]''. Perhaps the most aggressive is [[w:Phytophthora cinnamomi|''P. cinnamomi'']]. [[w:Spore|Spore]] from root rot causing agents do contaminate other plants, but the rot cannot take hold unless there is adequate moisture. Spores are not only airborne, but are also carried by insects and other [[w:arthropod|arthropod]].

A plant with root rot will not normally survive, but can often be [[w:Plant propagation|propagated]] so it will not be lost completely. Plants with root rot should be removed and destroyed.

Root rot can occur in [[w:hydroponics|hydroponic]] applications, if the water is not properly [[w:water aeration|aerated]]. This is usually accomplished by use of an air pump with an air diffuser, or by allowing water to drain away from appropriate hydroculture systems frequently on a time cycle. Problems associated with poor water aeration were principal reasons for the development of aeroponics.

[[File:Fine Bubble Aeration.jpg|thumb|right|Fine bubble aeration]]
'''Oxygenation''' is important to the [[w:sustainability|sustainability]] of a hydroculture [[w:ecosystem|ecosystem]]. Plant roots, aerobic bacteria, hydrophytes, fish and or other aerobic organisms and tissue require oxygenation.

Insufficient oxygen ([[w:hypoxia (environmental)|environmental hypoxia]]) may occur in water or substrate, creating a hazardous environment for [[w:aerobic organism|aerobic organism]]s and tissue. Deoxygenation increases the relative population of [[w:anaerobic organism|anaerobic organism]]s such as certain [[w:bacteria|bacteria]], resulting in root rot, [[w:fish kill|fish kill]]s and other adverse events. Increasing the concentration of aerobic conditions provides a a healthy hydroculture [[w:balance of nature|ecosystem]].

Water aeration is required in water bodies that suffer from anoxic conditions. Aeration can be achieved by using an air pump with a diffuser, or by surface agitation from a fountain or spray-like device to allow for oxygen exchange at the surface and the release of noxious gases such as carbon dioxide, methane or hydrogen sulfide.

[[w:Oxygen saturation|Dissolved oxygen (DO)]] is a major contributor to water quality. Not only do fish and other aquatic animals need it, but oxygen breathing aerobic bacteria decompose organic matter. When oxygen concentrations become low, anoxic conditions may develop which can decrease the ability of the water body to support life.

==Hypoxia==
'''[[w:Hypoxia (environmental)|Hypoxia]]''', or '''oxygen depletion''', is a phenomenon that occurs in aquatic environments as dissolved oxygen ('''DO'''; molecular oxygen dissolved in the water) becomes reduced in concentration to a point where it becomes detrimental to aquatic organisms living in the system. Dissolved oxygen is typically expressed as a percentage of the oxygen that would dissolve in the water at the prevailing temperature and salinity (both of which affect the solubility of oxygen in water; see [[w:oxygen saturation|oxygen saturation]] and [[w:underwater|underwater]]).  An aquatic system lacking dissolved oxygen (0% saturation) is termed anaerobic, [[w:Reducing environment|reducing]],  or '''[[w:Anoxic waters|anoxic]]'''; a system with low concentration&amp;mdash;in the range between 1 and 30% saturation&amp;mdash;is called '''hypoxic''' or '''dysoxic'''. Most fish cannot live below 30% saturation. A &quot;healthy&quot; aquatic environment should seldom experience less than 80%. The '''exaerobic''' zone is found at the boundary of anoxic and hypoxic zones.

==Aeration methods==
[[File:Water Fountains.jpg|thumb|right]]
Here are ways of infusing air into the nutrient solution and aquaponic tank. Also, keeping the plant roots suspended above the nutrient solution is beneficial, since there is a limit to the amount of oxygen saturation that can be contained in water.

===Fountains===
Fountains aerate by pulling water from the surface of the water and propelling it into the air.

This process utilizes air-water contact to transfer oxygen. As the water is propelled into the air, it breaks into small droplets. Collectively, these small droplets have a large [[w:surface area|surface area]] through which oxygen can be transferred. Upon return, these droplets mix with the rest of the water and thus transfer their oxygen back to the ecosystem.

Fountains are a popular method of surface aerators because of the aesthetic appearance that they offer. However, most fountains are unable to produce a large area of oxygenated water.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tucker&quot;&gt;Tucker, Craig. &quot;Pond Aeration.&quot; [https://srac.tamu.edu/index.cfm/event/getFactSheet/whichfactsheet/183/ Pond Aeration SRAC Factsheet 3007]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fine bubble aeration===
[[Image:Fine Bubble Diffuser (Tube).jpg|right|thumb]]
Fine bubble aeration is an efficient way to transfer oxygen into water.
Attached to the unit are a number of diffusers. These bubbles are known as ''fine bubbles''. The [[w:United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] defines a fine bubble as anything smaller than 2mm in diameter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.epa.state.il.us/water/conservation/lake-notes/lake-aeration.pdf| format=PDF| title=Lake Aeration and Circulation| publisher= Illinois Environmental Protection Agency| accessdate=13 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fine bubble diffused aeration is able to maximize the surface area of the bubbles and thus transfer more oxygen into water per bubble. Additionally, smaller bubbles take more time to reach the surface so not only is the surface area maximized but so are the number of seconds each bubble spends in the water, allowing it more time to transfer oxygen to the water. As a general rule, smaller bubbles and a deeper release point will generate a greater oxygen transfer rate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Taparhudee, Wara 2002&quot;&gt;Taparhudee, Wara. &quot;Applications of Paddle Wheel Aerators and Diffused-Air System in Closed Cycle Shrimp Farm System.&quot; 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, almost all of the oxygen dissolved into the water from an air bubble occurs when the bubble is being formed. Only a negligible amount occurs during the bubbles transit to the surface of the water. This is why an aeration process that makes many small bubbles is better than one that makes fewer larger ones. The breaking up of larger bubbles into smaller ones also repeats this formation and transfer process. &lt;ref&gt;http://users.vcnet.com/rrenshaw/do.html&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the drawbacks to fine bubble aeration is that the membranes of ceramic diffusers can sometimes clog and must be cleaned in order to keep them working at their optimum efficiency. Also, they do not possess the ability to mix as well as other aeration techniques, such as coarse bubble aeration.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tucker&quot;/&gt;

===Drain===
In certain types of hydroculture, such as [[w:Ebb and flow|flood drain systems]], water can be cycled to frequently drain away from the hydroculture system. Plant roots suspended in air provides them aeration that can not be accomplished by allowing plant roots to be saturated in water.

==Measurement==
{{See|w:Cubic feet per minute}}&lt;!--oxygen transfer efficiency (OTE)--&gt;
In [[w:water|aquatic]] environments, '''oxygen saturation''' is a relative measure of the amount of [[w:oxygen|oxygen]] (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) dissolved in the water.  Supersaturation can sometimes be harmful for organisms and cause [[w:decompression sickness|decompression sickness]]. '''Dissolved oxygen''' ('''DO''') is measured in standard solution units such as millilitres O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; per liter (ml/L), [[w:Mole (unit)|millimoles]] O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; per liter (mmol/L), milligrams O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; per liter (mg/L) and moles O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; per cubic meter (mol/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;).  For example, in freshwater under atmospheric pressure at 20°C, O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; saturation is 9.1&amp;nbsp;mg/L.

Information systems in the consumer industry: a customer approach



Franco Miotto

'''''''''Introduction'''





This work is addressed to everyone who asks himself what will be, in the near future, the information needs for the consumer industry. This paper is thus addressed to people working in information technology, marketing, organization or general management. Their interest will be over the whole book and, particularly, in the chapters regarding the general objective and solutions architecture for the industry and retail environment.

This works derives from various personal experiences out of which I chose the two real cases which are presented in the initial chapters: in both cases the real problem was to shift the company information focus from the support of internal processes to the analysis and evaluation of the market scenario in which the companies were acting.

One of the problems I had to cope while doing this job is to be sure to use a methodology which would help me taking into consideration every part of the problem, not forgetting any aspect. 

The method is one of the aims of the book.

From a presentation point of view, I decided to start from the real cases and then get to the abstraction, not vice versa; it seems to me easier to understand. This is the reason why the case studies are quoted initially; they should help the reader to face the more “formal” discussions with an operational attitude, not as just “principia”.



Generally I think that, after the pure automation phase (accounting, MRP etc.), information technology will need to help industries to approach the complete cycle of customer needs. This will mean taking into consideration processes with a very little syntactic content but very common: informational unstructured scenarios. I think that these processes are the one that will give us some better prediction information models and also improve our operational and control tools.



I am sure that his work has plenty of ingenuities, methodological and language mistakes but, as I found no literature on these topics, I decided to use it as a request for help so that we can make a better service to our general “customer”.

'''The company''': this case history is about a middle sized industry in the market of apparel and fashion.

The total business is fairly split between production of fabric and underwear, especially beach wear.

The company was historically a weaving site and the apparel part was created to fill the period of the year when fabric production was low. 

The company was created by a single person, a fairly typical situation, and grew up on such a one-person organizational schema. As time passed and markets changed, this model showed its limits and the whole company was suffering poor sales. Everybody was feeling that something new was needed but there was no clear model to follow or copy. The company was slowly losing all its assets: market as well as culture, including human expertise in management, control and operations.

The market: as you might have guessed the main part of the customers belong to two different categories:

# Other companies buying fabric
# Retailers buying underwear and beachwear.

We are thus talking about two different classes of customers with two different sales channels (direct sales vs. sales agents) and different habits. Geographically the company was selling mainly in Italy with little or no foreign turnaround.

From the “marketing” point of view the two parts had a completely different approach:

# The “fabric” department had very little “brand awareness” as the product was thought for a technical market  where the customers are specialists
# The “underwear” department had a definite need for “brand recognition” as this is a large part of the final sale.

The existing information system: as it often happens the actual IT was the result of many years overlapping without the possibility of a real radical rethinking. This was due to two major reasons:

Any radical reorganization of the IT system would have meant discussing the real essence of the company both in scopes and in structure

The IT manager did not have the organizational strength and will to pursue such a task, a job which would have meant criticizing actual high class managers.

The whole situation was also worsened by the fact that the new line of business (“the underwear”) started as a result of another company acquisition. 

All of these factors lead to the existence of two different systems, almost non compatible and with double costs in terms of maintenance and development; worse of all the existence of two technical worlds created the idea that two different companies were acting and that no synergies were possible.

Control system was also a problem as the two systems used different coding and taxonomy so a third system had to exist to aggregate the final data.

Economical perspectives: the international market context and production methods were driving the company to a slow decline in spite of local situation like crisis of recoveries. The whole business model had to be redesigned and the IT was a problem for this. 

First of all the company needed to understand what was important and what was not; this information  was not in the IT capabilities as the system was the image of the company situation and it could not merge internal information with external signals also because people working in it was too busy in getting it going on the operational side.



'''The turn point''' of the situation came when a new CEO was appointed. He decided to analyze every process to create a more elastic and homogeneous company structure. This decision put the top manager in a very delicate position: he could have been the successful innovator, the visionary leader or the excuse for a failure. Particularly in one-man company (level 2 of the Greiner model) product and direct processes are so deeply tangled that any structure variation is seen as an “offense” to the history of the enterprise and these changes are not considered as rational necessities for the company health. Service processes, and IT especially, are not felt as “communication needs” as this job was done by the founder as a physical person. Obviously we all know that is one of the deepest reasons why that communication model (the one-man company) cannot raise over a certain dimension and therefore cannot gain certain dimensional efficiencies.  



With the help of an advisor the new CEO has looked into the problem of updating the IT system and his first problem was to decide which kind of approach was to use:

'''The content approach''': this is the most common approach and it start from defining the typical parameters connected to:

* Technology situation: both technical and functional (HW, SW, user requests coverage etc.)
* Consultancy situation: both related to the existence of “best practices” in the field and to the presence of players (consultancy firms) available
* Project content: typically you tend to copy the actual requirement schema because it is what users ask for
* Timing: months to years horizons
* Objective: to a have a more flexible and usable platform; an updated environment.

'''The functional approach''': this approach starts from a different point of view: “we want to improve customer service” where “the customer” is both the internal user but mainly the external sales customer as this last one certifies the company in the market. So, for each process, we it was necessary to define:

* The customer: who is he? (both known and potential)
* The service: what does this mean? product, attention, social needs
* The product: what the expectations of the customer (the standard we want) as a function of reliability, availability, fashion alignment.
* Esteem needs: achievement, attention, recognition 
* Social needs: belonging, recognized interaction
* How do we define and how do we measure these needs?
* How do we acquire these informations?

The main purpose of this approach is to define some quantitative parameters for a business model with particular attention to the idea of “customer service”.



This second approach was really appreciated also for its “push” attitude on people who had somehow lost what the market really asked for, even though this analysis requires, as an assumption, that a customer knows what he wants, a “mature” approach, and this, by itself, is a statement to be demonstrated.

The first real step was then to figure out what the customer real needs were, differentiating them from what were historically thought them to be or from what were perceived by the various intermediate acting agents. The basic idea was to compare which information were in the IT system and which one were needed to be really customer compliant as to decide which way to invest in the general company information system.

On the external customers, the real steps which followed began with

* Identify “representative customer” by the sale force
* Check whether these customers were really representative of the whole internal market by defining the selection criteria for a sample
* Make an interview to “random customer”, “statistically sample customer” and “representative customers”
* Collect their needs and cross table the results.

The beginning was a disaster, the general attitude was:

Sales people: customers are an asset of “my” division; it is only me who should talk to them

Marketing people: the product is “right”; it is the customer who does not understand it (!).

The CEO skill was to be able to maintain the right direction and get everybody to understand that the company could only grow if it would face the real changing world, avoiding closures and blind behaviors; a formal check is something which is in the nature of improving processes.

As a result of this phase it turned out that the important parameter to be fixed was “time-to-market”: both the fabric and the underwear department could not compete with far-east productions in terms of prices so, assuming that quality was perceived as “sufficient” (therefore a correct positioning on the market) the request was for small production quantities which were to be available quickly.

From the company point of view, this meant:

# A better information system connection
# A better relation system between customer and vendor
# A product industrial design which could allow a quicker response
# A different industrial relation management for customer who need products with a long lead time
# A better forecasting and projection system.

This whole analysis was then enlarged to non-covered channels like e-commerce and direct retail.



'''The solution approach: obliterate or improve'''. This question has been raised so many times by the times of Hammer and Davenport and we know that it has no general answer but it must be correctly posted in the real context. This pragmatic approach must also keep into consideration that the smaller the company the more important is the role of individual physical persons which are themselves “organizational customers” with their background of Maslow needs.

Inside the company the process started requesting each key employee how he felt about the idea of “customer” whether internal or external. We then reversed the question and asked everyone how he felt as being a “customer”, which kind of expectations he had, whether fulfilled or not. In this way we arrived to define a map of “needs”. We then matched these “needs” with their coverage both declared (by the function) and perceived (by the customer).

The difficulties we found, at this stage, were essentially two:

* The capacity of “customer”  and “supplier” to estimate the importance and the coverage of problems; aggressive users tent to impose small problems as important mainly to show that were important people while passive persons would adapt to uneasy situations for the sake of peace
* The difficulty in accepting the idea that, being the company a whole system, the total result is the combination of all parts running well and not just a sum of parts each running at its own speed.

The fact that external consultants were involved helped people to question themselves as well as gave the company an external evaluation of specific professional capability.

In this analysis period the IT group showed its greatest limits as it was trying to support individual needs without having the chance of harmonizing the whole system. Individual requests were pushing into specific directions so the general feeling was that of a waste of time and money. From the outside we can say that it was just a representation of the company situation but to the inside this was the excuse for the falling efficiency.





'''The final choice''': as we said the CEO found himself in the middle of 

* The outside world and the its dynamics
* The needs of the internal operators and especially of the owner.

The way he chose included:

* Making the situation clear to everybody including the owner
* Understanding the stakeholder needs and make them the strategic goals
* Formally analyze the market needs
* Define the organizational model including the operational role and responsibility of the stakeholder
* Getting all the human resources through a processes of upgrading their attitude to “customer service”
* Define the instruments to control both the “service” and economic indicators of each department.

As far as the IT department the choice was:

# Simplify the existing reporting processes as much as possible so that the actual technical infrastructure would last some time allowing the company to concentrate on other projects
# Invest very much on instruments related to “company critical” issues like
* Style research
* Product design and management
* Technical product definition
* Market analysis
* CRM
# Define a strategy to clear out the dependence of the company from a few IT people who actually could not be changed and get the user to accept some minor cut in service level as a function of a clearer general view on the whole system. This part was to support the company up to the change of the system in a medium time period (2-3 years), mainly through a process of data and process definition.


= A case study of reengineering of information systems – retail. =
The company:  this case study is about a small-medium sized apparel company retail division. This company, as it often happens, started on the idea of a specific line of products and later approached the retail channel in a naive way.  The retail story began with the need of liquidating the company surplus in a company outlet; this was not enough so the company approached the outlets circuit. At this point it did happen that the product offer was not balanced to make a good service to the customer so the company had the need to work with the stock channel to get rid of what was left over.

By that time the company thought it has developed a culture of “retail” so it made a decision to approach the wholesale market with mono-brand locations and/or shop-in-shop experience in the department stores.

Almost always such a change implies a large item offer so the initial “product” idea spread over a “total look” vision with its corresponding design and production problems.

The company we are talking about moved from an offer of about 150 samples to about 500 pieces thus multiplying by three the whole paperwork.

The retail division had a target of about 50 sales point, searched by a consultant and interiorly designed by a fashion architect.



The market: the company operated in the casual sportswear mainly on jackets. Geographical distribution was worldwide but mainly rich eastern countries and emerging countries, due to the average price of the product. The “ideal” customer belonged to a fairly rich class, he liked sportswear and he was fairly aggressive. The style actually intended to be aggressive enough to be chosen both by young and older people.



The existing retail IT system was originally chosen to support the initial outlet, so its main features were:

* Low cost
* Little and clear functionalities
* One level architecture (shops and main)
* single cash register in a shop
* Written and maintained by a near located, “friend” software house.

Quite a few problems had been solved on a “quick” solution attitude as volumes were small, no general approach.

The whole situation was worsened by the fact that no user came from a structured culture environment so they tent to solve their problems on an unstructured, personal way.

When the whole phenomena grew bigger two very dangerous behaviors came up:

# The stockholder thought: “if it works for four it will work for five etc.”
# The software house used to say: “I am willing to grow up with you: tell me what you want and I will do it.”

The company was really pushing the instrument over its project limits patching it over and over.



The economical situation: mainly due to the international crisis the company was financially overexposed and the shop system was a real weight to the balance sheet: out of a dozen shops existing only two or three were profitable, another two or three run even and the rest were both losing money and creating end-of-season unsold inventory. These numbers also did not take into account hidden costs that the company had to sustain to help the shop system; costs which are difficult to pin out but that are often consistent.  I am talking about time spent by “structure” people like accounting and/or logistics to help the whole system run.



The turn point came when an outside consultancy firm had to investigate the economical situation on behalf of a new possible stakeholder. The problem was not so much the retail policy as a principle but the way it had been implemented. The company culture was industrial and everybody used to think to “customers” as being wholesaler, which means professionals, and not final customers.

Even if a retail manager and a merchandiser existed, real decisions were made by people coming from “product” oriented people so many the whole process was still very “fashion” and “industry”.



'''The functional approach''': to evaluate correctly the job to be done we went through a dimensional analysis of the needs of the retail department customers including all the aspects of “product”; “subjective” and “social” aspects.

For every view we tried to find as many “objective” data as possible trying to avoid preconceptions. This job was guided by an external consultant, a right choice in my opinion, as we thought that no internal resource could be enough professionally detached to guarantee a correct evaluation.

First thing the company did was to separate needs: wholesale and final customers. This meant almost doubling the job but it allowed checking whether the requests of the retail channel (both wholesaler and property shop) matched with the “real” final customer wishes.

Physically the job has been done through check lists compiled by hired personnel both in the case of retailer and of final customers. Actually final customers were divided into two major categories: customers contacted in shops (already aware of the brand) and people looking at apparel shop windows (apparel keen but not especially on the brand).

Every interview was then graded according to the expectation of satisfaction both as need and as answer to it. The complete results and the exact form of the questions are not public, what we can derive are the changes the company did in its customer policies.

Question sheet results: as far as final customers are concerned we found that:

* Product - aesthetics and fashion alignment: the product was perceived as “fashion” but “middle low class” and definitely not “high class” as the company thought it was. Competitors were quite different from what the company dreamed they were. Some product categories were “identified” while other were considered “useless”
* Product - reliability: quality was recognized but the price was considered too high
* Product – availability: very low, even if much paper presentation was made on the product, the real possibility to find the item in the shops was low. Part of the problem related also to the fact that the company had decided not to offer on the web a certain number of “flagship” items 
* Subjective – recognition: sales people “customer service ” attitude was judged barely sufficient
* Subjective – attention: sales people technical support counseling was perceived as not sufficient and this contributed heavily to the perception of a middle low class brand
* Subjective – empathy: obviously related to individual sales people but, on the average, not very high; the brand was definitely not felt like “friendly”
* Social – belongness: a strong feeling of group belonging was felt
* Social - distinction: fulfillment of this need is low, probably due to inadequate CRM systems.

For retailer the results were:

* Product - aesthetics and fashion alignment: the product was perceived as “average”; the rating was better than the one given by final customers
* Product - reliability: good, little commercial returns and very few items with quality problems
* Product – availability: medium/ low due to poor respect of delivery dates 
* Subjective – recognition: quite good, the “retail” customer service was considered very effective
* Subjective – attention: low, customer perceived some sort of company haughtiness
* Subjective – empathy: obviously related to individual agents but, on the average, sufficient
* Social – belongness: no  group feeling existed for retailers
* Social - distinction:  low, probably due to inadequate CRM systems.

'''Company actions''': based on the results we just quoted, the company decided to

* Product offering returned to about 150-200 pieces for wholesaler and a further set of about 100 pieces distributed only in company stores. These last set of garments were essentially variations on existing garments, to simplify the design phase.  The whole set could then cover the “total-look” scenario for the shops and satisfy brand-keen customers.
* Advertising:  this moved into two directions. The first one tried to re-position the brand in a “high class” section via the relations with testimonials and events. The second activity (fashion and newspapers) was addressed only to the countries where a distribution network existed and not everywhere; only one new foreign market was to be pursued each year.
* Company shops: only economical justified shops stayed open, with the new product offering. As far as new openings were concerned the strategy was to create mixed companies with local operators. These new middle-sized shops were addressed mainly on the sales of the well known products (jackets) and there was a one year starting period to reach balance break even, and no more.
* External wholesalers: the company recognized their importance and created a contact and support groups with the idea of improve their brand loyalty.
* Agents: the company cleared that a new attitude was needed: they were to become not only customer-order collector but also product and “prospect customers” proposers. Quite a few agents did not accept and interrupted their business relation with the company; the major criticism was that there was no longer an independent agent role but that we were talking of company show rooms and methods. This was one of the most difficult parts of the whole project. 
* Company shops sale personnel: a long process of selection and education is still taking place to reach the correct standard in human relations and technical knowledge.
* Shop customer service: it became the real guideline of the retail division. Every aspect has been re-analyzed: from shop lay-out to packaging to personnel clothing and attitude. Mock customers are evaluating each site randomly and their results are discussed monthly at company level and twice-a-year with shop managers.
* Main IT system: the upgrade on this was very limited and it concerned almost only the quality of basic data regarding customer needs like delivery dates or quality indexes
* Retail IT system: this system has been changed very heavily. The operational part has been upgraded to a new instrument and also, even more important, new CRM systems have been introduced regarding both classical topics, like fidelity cards, and new topics like known and unknown person recognition. The possibility to follow the path inside the shop and on the front windows gave the opportunity to improve internal paths and increment the time passers-by would stop in front of the shop.

Generally speaking the reengineering is still going on but the results, up to now, are very encouraging  in terms of customer service and of sales point balance break even where all the company shops are now correctly placed.

= Introduction to methodology =



Starting from the two real case studies we saw, now we want to analyze, at the highest level, the information needs for the processes of a consumer company. This will help us in defining the whole context of data and procedures to be informationally represented. Once we have done this step we can then match the existing coverage with the actual IT system.



In this work I will specifically speak about clothing industry but the method is valid also for other companies and specially for those where “customer care” is a goal and not only an instrument.

It might happen that the customer is not conscious of his needs but then, I think, we should pursue a “maieutic” process of extraction more than the induction of a new need. In this vision of business, agents and retailers are part of the “extended” enterprise as they transmit the idea of “service”.

The reason why I chose the apparel world is that, among companies which operate on physical goods, most probably is the one which best fits the “service” idea in terms of

* Volume of goods and informations
* Changing ratio for the product
* Low unitary value for the product
* Different ways of approaching the final customers
* Difference between “customer” (retailer) and “consumer” (2 decision levels).

Anyway I tried to be as general as possible and you could think of applying this method even to politics as a “service” industry to people.

 Before getting into the phase of analysis, I would like to consider something we quickly quoted: apparel sales are usually made in shop with the help of an employee. From the point of view of producers the “customer” is the retailer or some people in its organization (eg department store) while the “real” market is the end-user.  The employee actually has a very important role in addressing the choice but he is also a fundamental vehicle for the satisfaction of the esteem needs of the “real customer”.

From an information point of view, the employee is a problem as it creates a “human” bias on the sales data (he addresses the sale) and also, sometimes, he forces his opinions into the information system. The same problem exists in the process of selling the garments to the retailers: the agent can be himself a source of information errors.   

 

As my goal is to help defining a model for an information system, to be later translated into technical instruments, I need to define data, states and processes into detail. This is a huge work and I decided to stop at first level; this is not an ERP detail analysis which would be unrealistic. Sometime I go deeper in the analysis when I think that the actual topic has not been fully cleared.



'''Analysis Methodology'''

As analysis practice is not so clear and defined, I tried to use a methodological approach as general as possible using technique of system and process analysis.



Let us define “system” as an ordered set of organized elements all of them aimed at a certain goal. These elements can include physical objects (hardware, software), people, informations, instruments etc.

The representation of a physical system can be made via a dynamic picture (processes) or a static picture (states). A process can be defined as the passage between states (initial and final) of a system; the “state” is the photograph of a system in a steady situation. 

According to the nature of the content, we can divide processes in information-bound (eg document handling) and physical object related (service) ones. In the first group the information and physical process coincide. As far as the second case is concerned let us make an example related to the industrial world: we can define the state (space and time location of goods: logistic view) or the changing process (goods transformation: industrial view).

The associated information system, related to the physical one, must define the context, the initial state and the transformation rules (processes).



Here we are interested in defining the abstract model (information model in our case) of the real system (natural of artificial) which we call physical system. The representation has its meaning in the context defined by variables and metrics which relate the variables to physical data. Context is defined by the choice of variables and their physical significance; state by the initial values (inventory etc.) and process by the measurement quantities (inventory movements etc.).

Informations (context meaningful data) are itself object of some form of treatment: we classify information “functions” into retrieval, storage, transmission, transformation and presentation.

Just for the sake of completeness we quote the conceptual problem of “measure” problem in its two faced aspects of the need of a measuring instrument and of the fact that the measuring action could change the measured system.

We need also to remind that we have been talking about “semantic ontologies” (which means that these rules belong to a general schema including variables and metric systems) while we know that in the global information world there are plenty of unstructured semantics with many informations inside but with a high grade of difficulty in using them.



In this work, we are interested in “business processes” which are artificial processes representing functions related to the activity of a business company. These processes, not like natural systems, do not work on deterministic laws where, once you know the initial state and the total input, the total output of the system is pre-determined. We are talking about social systems in different cultural environments and related to unpredictable events so the output, at most, can only be generally forecasted and not galileianly determined. 

In this chapter more than trying to represent the processes in formally correct a usable language (a task for methodologies like UML), I would like to approach the problem of a methodology to be sure that every aspect of a information problem has been taken into consideration; I am looking how to define all the aspects of an industrial general process, a fashion one in our case.

We already saw that to define the information system we need to individuate the values of the variables related both to the state and to the process; in my experience this passes through the analysis of what I call the “information dimensions” where a dimension is an independent set of information data.

From a practical point of view we have to ask ourselves a set of questions about the initial state and about what happens in the system. The questions I asked myself are:

* What: what is the content of the process; which indicators are chosen and measured in the process
* How: how do I collect and treat informations (state), how does the process happen. This dimension includes the problem of the measuring methods, of the change of indicators (eg six-sigma method) and of the choice of the representation language for a coherent formalism
* Who: the definition of the actors in the process and their representation in terms of informations
* Where: which are the location of the processes; initial, actual and results places? In a global system these places can be very far away so you have to consider time-shift, different languages (presentation) and culture
* When: the time the process starts (initial state), lives and finishes so that parameters are in the final state (remember that people are components of the system)
* How much: what is the change in the variables; both internal and context variables
* Why: the reason why the process happens: internal laws (initial stability of the system) and external (context need).

Out of all these questions the most peculiar one is certainly “Why” as sometimes it is related to external laws or habits and sometimes it relates to internal reasons of order and efficiency. Again these last considerations show that we are not operating in a “classical” deterministic world.

 The “how much” dimension relates the process to the physical reality (remember we are trying to write some sort of “semantics” of physical processes). We should be able to separate really meaningful variables which actually change during the process assuming that, quite often, the change is only a statistical change and the sample is in the limit of the De Moivre (see example) theorem.



It might happen that some dimension coincides: for example imagine the physical process of an apple falling form a tree. In this case the “what” and the “where” of the process are the same as the process is exactly the fall of the apple; this does not mean that we can confuse

“where” as a geographical context and

“where” as a content of the process.

From the point of view of methodology all the dimensions should be taken into consideration and, in special case, some of them coincide.

As we said, we are talking about systems which are not completely deterministic, like classical physics; space-time homogeneity is to be considered a lucky case and not a general situation. This implies that reversibility of processes is not guaranteed, sometime it is even forbidden; so certain technical instruments (compensation handlers) cannot be given for granted.



''' The company goal: a real problem.'''

We assume that a fashion company goal is to create value via improving the level of the apparel worn in the surrounding world which, by itself, is the target market for the company itself. This gets real through four fundamental processes:

* '''Ability to perceive and categorize customer needs'''
* '''Ability to rationalize and interpreter customer needs'''
* '''Ability to satisfy customer needs'''
* '''Ability to explain its capability in satisfying the needs.'''

The way to solve this major task is the full stream of the industrial project with all its aspects: marketing, sales, production, logistics, and structure.

In the marketing books we can see underlined the meaning of the 4P (product, price, place, promotion) which means getting the right product, at the right price, in the right place at the right moment  and tell this opportunity to the customer.

 From an information point of view, this analysis leaves us with more than one open question, the most important: what does “right” means? How can we measure such a quantity? Someone says that it will be the market response to determine whether or not the choice was “right” but this is an answer  “a posteriori”; what a company needs is a correct, or at least “best guess”, forecast “a priori”.



Customer needs: fundamentals

 Before advancing further I think we should clear out what “customer needs” are.

Psychologist  Abraham Maslow indicated a hierarchy of needs into 5 levels:

Physiological needs (air, water, nourishment, sleep)

Safety (medical insurance, job security, peace)

Social needs (friends, group belonging, give and receive love)

Esteem (self-respect, achievement, recognition, reputation)

Self-actualization (truth, justice, wisdom, meaning)

Once a need is mostly satisfied it no longer motivates and the next higher need takes place.

As far as clothing are concerned 

* The first level is never taken into account
* The second level concerns “utilitarianism” which means the basic role of garments as defense from environment (cold etc.). In the rich society this needs is getting less and less important because of many factors (the heating systems, cars) which modify the relation between human body and environment. This need is still very important into technical clothing (work, sport) where functionality is predominant
* In the third level I would introduce personal feeling (cashmere hand feeling, valentino’s red, leather smell) and the sensation we feel when we fit well
* In the fourth level I think we can fit the social factor of recognition in the act of buying the garment (actual sale moment) or in the belonging to a “group” with its distinctive signs. Some authors tent to underline the first aspect but the actual rise in the internet sales seems to contradict them. Another argument supporting the after-sale group belonging experience is related to the expanding business of counterfeiting which could indicate how much people need to be “brand dependent”
* The fifth point, in my opinion, includes a real shopping experience in which the customer is recognized as an individual and his needs are fulfilled in a mature and respectful way.

Personally I think that the rating of the various needs depend not only on the person himself but also on the context (time, place and mood) which, by itself is not a scientific variable.

  

Customer needs: practice

What we really want to do is zeroing the difference between customer expectations and the perception of the product/service quality of what he has bought; in this case we have satisfied our customer who thinks he has paid the correct price for what he buys.

Referring  to the quality service models via multidimensional hierarchical analysis (Dabholkar) or to gap analysis model (Parasumaran et alt.) and integrating other variables, we must satisfy quality parameters related to:

* Product: actual variables ( aesthetical/design  level, fashion update)
* Product: reliability (quality of components and handwork, company reliability)
* Product: availability where and when it is requested
* Subjectivity: problem solving capability (punctuality, flexibility, quality problems solving)
* Subjectivity: reassurance capability (competence, kindness, credibility)
* Subjectivity : empathy
* Sociality: group belonging
* Sociality: individual recognition.

As we said before, customer satisfaction is a multi-faced operation and we must never forget that the “customer” is “the important person” and not only a “product” accessory, even for the best products. On the other hand, we do not want to “sell dreams” with no product around as, once the sale euphoria passed, we would have an unsatisfied customer and no customer retention in future time.

As far as the “social” part of the company-customer business relation we keep into consideration the difference between “style” and “fashion” (Espinoza  - MIT Media Lab). “Style” is a principal component in group identity so, maybe in a costly way, it can be copied from someone outside the “group”. To keep it difficult for externals to keep updated with the group dynamics, the code must be continuously changed and this give rise to the “fashion” phenomena. Now we understand how “fashion” is something related to the internal of a group while “style” relates to an outside value for the group culture. When a new “style” reaches a critical mass it gets accepted into social culture and some new break point are looked for.

This topic becomes very important when we talk about information systems (in the wide sense) for the social aspect.



Data importance

From a survey we did in a group of generic customers, we found that the relative importance of the various factors in the buying action is





Product: actual variables ( aesthetical/design  level, fashion update)    6,3

Product: availability where and when it is requested    9,0

Product: reliability (quality of components and handwork, company reliability)    7,0

Subjectivity: problem solving capability (punctuality, flexibility, quality problems solving)    7,3

Subjectivity: reassurance capability (competence, kindness, credibility)    7,3

Subjectivity : empathy    6,6

Sociality: group belonging    5,9

Sociality: individual recognition.    6,3





It is important to point out that these values are related to a sample of customers in the field of apparel so its value is significant only in this field.



Methodologies for a solution

Actual methods for solving the customer needs are now essentially two:

# Industry: start from customer  requirements and designing the whole industrial process (design, production, logistic) to fulfill the need
# Trade: choosing globally and offering locally what the retailer thinks is the best solution for the customer need.

These approaches, obviously, have some common aspects but also some special features that we shall discuss later.   

= General processes =

Let us now analyze the processes which exist in both methodologies.

== Ability to perceive and categorize customer needs ==

In this process, the system is the environment “company – potential customer” where the customer is the owner, more or less conscious, of his needs. The goal of the process is to share this information with the company.

'''Why''' should we try to perceive the need? The answer lies in an agnostic approach on other people needs. In my opinion a company role is not to believe to be the truth depositary but to be the instrument for maybe extracting and solving customers requests.

'''Who''' acts in the process of need perception? Three kind of people act: who has the need (the customer), who collects the need, who transmits the need.   

Feeling the need, the customer is the person who explicitly raises the request (demand driven) or who owns the hidden need who is to be extracted (supply driven).

We can categorize our customers into:

* Well known customers, person we know via a history of relations (fidelity cards or so); among these customers we care particularly about customers who have shown to be statistically significant in terms of representation of the whole customer set
* Unknown or random customers
* Potential customers: among these we could include people belonging to social groups which we consider target for our product, people looking at shop windows or people coming and not buying anything (prospects).

It is obvious that there are different marketing strategies on the three groups: in the first case we want to keep our customer and increase cross-selling or up-selling. In the second situation we want to make our customers loyal, in the third case we want to reduce entry barriers.

Collecting customer needs: I think we can individuate three kinds of people, the first one is someone whose job is to “feel” the market in its wider sense (society, various environments), sometime they are called “cool hunters” or scouts. The second group is formed by the agents who work together with retailers: their view is wider than the single retailer but is narrower and more precise than the one of the scout. The last group is made by sale executives who are actually in contact with specific customers so they have a clear, definite view of a limited request.

Transmitting the information: it would be easy to say that these people are the same that collects it, but it is not true in my experience. This function is often felt as a secondary job so it is delegated to another person, an assistant, done in the spare time or even worse hidden as felt part of the person assets. This attitude implies a great loss of quality in the information transmitted to the company.

'''What''' is a need, what does a customer looks for. Let us start by classifying this dimension on three values:

* Defined needs: specific requests of a definite object  (raincoat, wind jacket) maybe connected in a new environment (eg long gloves for snowboarders)
* Semi-structured requests: more general than the former one, yet not very precise. One possible example could be “something like that jacket but the fur around the hood” or “slightly longer or shorter”. This kind of requests, mainly regarding the product, are often expressed in a sign, non-verbal language so they are very difficult to collect and transmit
* Geographical or context needs: particular colors related to a culture or a “glamour” trend better than an understatement. These are examples of customer needs difficult to receive and use but very rich in informations.

In this dimension we have actually analyzed only product needs, we can use the same detail level also for the other levels of needs (internal esteem, social and self-actualization needs). As far as I know there is no research going on this topic which seems very interesting and largely unknown.

'''Where''': about the place the need occurs. There is definitely a relation between the “where” and the class of needs (defined, semi-structured or context); we can recognize:

* Shops: these are the places where there is an explicit interaction with the customer regarding well structured needs. This is a very important information asset
* Shop windows or shop routings: we are talking about potential customers who do not interact explicitly, this is an important patrimony of informations fairly unstructured and difficult to catch and categorize
* Competitors: we are looking at customer needs through what the competitors are offering; it is like looking at the solution and trying to guess the problem. This becomes important when competitors have access at context we cannot get into, for example far away markets
* General geographical distribution: the most general and also the most difficult situation to analyze; as an example you can think about the fact that there is no accepted taxonomy in the fashion business.

As far as the definition of the collection and storage of data, the problem is now shifting form technology problems to the definition of an accepted semantic of data.

'''How'''. To understand how we can perceive customer needs let us consider how these needs show out. We can think of three kinds of externalization:

* Conscious personal needs like an explicit request to a sale operator
* Unconscious personal needs like taking a garment in my hand, looking at it and putting it back
* Social needs like a new “fashion”.

How do we perceive these needs: for each kind we must think of a way to define the elementary information (the state) so we need

* Instruments for sales support, both real and missed
* Instruments for context analysis
* Instruments for competitors analysis
* Instrument for social trend analysis.

Specially talking about the first process, we must be very careful about the easiness of use and the precision of the instrument as the actual operator sometime works in a “normal” situation and sometime in a changed environment like “sales” or “rush times”. Another topic to be considered is related to the significance of the data we are collecting:

* Does an observed customer behave like an ignorant one?
* The data I am getting are biased by the collection process?

At the moment I think these can be considered smaller problems compared to the fact that now we have no data.

 Last but not least there might be a problem on context bias: if we collect data in a luxury shop we shall have a “luxury” view of the problem, same thing for a low income customer environment. This obviously becomes a problem in inter-class analysis while it is not so bad if the company target is parallel to the sample set.

'''When''' do we collect informations and do we use them?

Using the data schema we just defined, we can say that

* Geographical or context needs have a longer time horizon than the specific product; could be one or two years
*  Semi-structured requests are looking mainly a few months in advance, from one season to another; they seems a slightly shorter “time to market” of what is accepted today
* Defined needs are typically immediate in their nature; the ideal would be to answer as soon as the need arise.

Data collection time is definitely related to the nature and horizon of the need but we can post it, more or less, in the sale period and consider a large period dependence on the level of the signal.

 Usage is again related to the class of need and has a strong period dependence the shorter the horizon is.

'''How many signals''' should I collect and how significant must they be?

This is a three sided problem: a problem of method, a problem of measured content and a problem of reference value.

Let us face the method problem: if a customer exclaims “beautiful” in front of a garment the statistical variance of the variable “beauty” is equal to the value of the variable itself so the information is not very reliable. De Moivre’s theorem tells us that the variance of the sample is related to the variance of the population sample as the reciprocal of the square root of the dimension of the sample. Four people saying “beautiful” are twice more reliable than one customer and begin to be statistically significant.

As far as the content of the variables we want to measure, they have to allow you to create a predictive model so they must be objective oriented. Let us make an example: sales turnaround during full price periods and during sales. If we make this analysis in mono-brand shops this becomes an indicator of price correctness between different categories as the offer stays the same and only the price changes so if the trousers percentage sales increases it means that people thought that trousers were too expensive. If the same statistics was run in a multi-brand wholesaler this could be an indicator of “among-brand” competition.

This last example introduce us to the third problem: the value of a measured variable has to be properly fit in its context. A large fur company made a large error some time ago when its sales rose quite lot in one period. This was due mainly to a large competitor’s problem but the signal was interpreted as a growing trend. The fact was that the company did not take into account the fact that the whole fur-coat market was in a steady/declining situation so the raise was to be explained as temporary phenomena.

This dimension can thus be summarized as the capacity of collecting “good” data on significant variables and fit them in the right context.

'''Methods and instruments''': the collection of data is a very difficult process from an operational point of view. 

* Defined needs, as we said these needs exist only for known customers in well defined places. Almost all sales point have instruments for operational processes (inventory movement, invoices, cash accounting), some of these products also have limited CRM functions mainly for after sale care (fidelity cards, recalls). A few of them also have options for supporting sales planning both a budget point of view and from a space/path analysis. As far as I know there is no common solution for requests and lost sales analysis.
* Semi-structured requests related to occasional or unknown customers. In my opinion this is an uncovered field as no specific instrument is available. I read about one experience of customers wearing RFID bracelets to follow their path inside the sale room but it seems to be abandoned (I would not have liked it). Video analysis for figure recognition, apart from privacy problems, is not yet fully available.  
* Geographical or context needs: This is a huge and extremely interesting information problem.  It relates to the capacity of analyzing socially open spaces to get signals of “trends” which might appear. As far as I know there is nothing like this existing at the moment. An interesting approach would take into consideration TV and movie pictures: they are biased by the choice of the costumes director but they can be analyzed more and more, till when the algorithm gives acceptable result.

'''

== Ability to understand, rationalize and interpreter customer needs ==



In this case the context system to be considered is the company and the process goal is to share the data perceived by the marketing department with the design, industrialization, production and logistic departments (industry) or purchase department (retail)  which are the ones who have to propose a company realistic solution.

'''Why''': the existence of this process is related to the need of  converting  general  into company  useful data; we need to translate context events into an internal useful language.

'''Who''': people can be involved in this process both as process and state definition resources. As we shall discuss later (How) methods can be various and this implies that the relative importance of the various actors is quite different. Going back to the various roles, we can point:

* People supplying data are the same collecting them or market search external companies
* People rationalizing customer needs: marketing, product or market managers as this is a very delicate operation which needs high technology competence and market knowledge. Maybe  a better name could be “product/service” analyst.
* People interpreting: in the fashion-product environment they are called “stylists” and they merge context, unstructured, informations with marketing data with a view for a long time horizon.

The relative role of these people is obviously related to the company market positioning: in a luxury company the stylist role is prevalent compared to the same in a large mass market enterprise.

 People using these data are people in the design and supply chain of the company.

'''What'''. As we said customer need is made up of physical objects (the product),subjective aspects (personal esteem) and social requests.

As far as product requests we can divide between “upgrading” , variations on existing themes, and “innovation”  which relate to requests which did not exist or did not have an answer in the former technological context. This last need is the most difficult one to satisfy as it implies the ability to interpreter social sign which could have an impact on future customer desires.

Subjective needs can be divided into “Basic” messages related to the “universal” nature of man, for example ease-of-use, comfort, functionality and “culture related” messages linked to the context the man lives in, for example color choice and matching which are very related to the society the consumer lives in.

Social messages: our aim is to be able to quantify social attention and recognition and social reputation.

At the moment these are very vague parameters.

'''Where'''. As far as the geographical location where the process exists we must keep track of two aspects:

where the process actually takes place, mainly the company main site, and where the process results are used, typically we are talking about the localization of the results. At the moment the most common ways to proceed on the topic include either local analysis and central strategic consolidation or central analysis and local adaption. Unfortunately both solutions tend to have a “time to market” too long and this reduces the competitiveness of the system, we shall get back on this.

'''How'''. As soon as we start talking about analyzing data, so that they become information, the first thought is about data-warehousing, data-mining and, eventually, knowledge management. In reality we are now trying to rationalize and interpret needs and not hidden or explicit correlations. The problem is thus quite bigger and it must include also informations different from what we have in our standard information systems.   From a methodological point of view we can divide analysis into 

* Rational: taxonomies and  abstraction/interpretation methods and instruments. This last group include projections (defined schema and historical data) and previsions (new schemas on historical data)
* Semi-quantitative: analysis of competitors, market semantic analysis
* Irrational or context analysis.

 Usually all methods are taken into consideration as we try to avoid theoretical models which could be not complete or intuition with no relation with reality.

It could be very interesting, at the moment I know of no tries, using heuristic techniques for the solution of interpretation models; I guess model are still not formal enough.

'''''''''When'''.  From the time point of view we must consider two different horizons: the analysis period and the time the results are meaningful. 

As a rule of thumb it is correct that the analysis should be done at the same time of the data collection as it might turn out that some data are incomplete or wrong. 

The validity of the result, for the physical part, is related to the total lead time of the product we are considering while it is not clear how long our analysis is valid when we talk about customer service, it could be interesting analyzing this.

'''How much'''. This dimension is always very difficult to quantify. Let us go back to the Maslow pyramid: how much do I need to satisfy level 2 (product) before moving to level 3 (personal needs) ? We assume that this percentage does not need to be 100% as once the homeostatic equilibrium of the lower level is reached, attention will move to the upper level. The point is: solving the lower at 80% and the upper at 50% (assuming that you succeed in measuring it) is better than 90%-40%?

I think it is a company choice to be made.

Altogether we must estimate the need for

* product in terms of which is our reference market, its dimension, our positioning (the quota) and  how much does our product satisfy the market in terms of price/performance
* personal/social aspects: how important and how much do we satisfy them.

'''Instruments'''. Now that we went through all the dimensions of the process of “Ability to understand, rationalize and interpreter customer needs” we can have a look at the state of art as far as available instruments. We can group them into

* Analytical methods: based on known and recursive data
** Algorithmical and or statistical: at least statistically precise
** Heuristic: model not totally defined
* Contextual methods: using common sensations, even if not measurable and recursive
** Brainstorming
** Top-down or bottom-up methods.
* Individual methods: related to a particular man-environment situation, very often give non-reproducible results, eg. Zen ispiration.

 As a personal opinion, even though different methods could be seen as provocative to some people (think of a physicist who should use a zen approach), as long as this process gives usable results is should be accepted anyway. Human beings have being using gravity as a force and apples kept falling long before Newton quantified the mathematical model. Man was using heuristic models to create manufacts.  In field of social science maybe we shall never have a Galilean, recursive model  but this does not mean that we must not get better use of data to be informations.



   

= Industrial processes =



A possible way to satisfy customer needs is to use specific processes. This means designing, industrializing, planning and producing garments which satisfy the need.

The group of customer we address can be various, it might vary from a single person (make to order) to a homogenoeus set of people on which we make some sort of “average” consideration; if I am talking about well-off teen-agers I need to make different evaluations and  reasonings from a middle-age low income group.



== Ability to satisfy the customer need. ==

The context is the system customer-company; the process goal is to satisfy all the requests starting from the fact that we know them. In this case the information system is a support system, not a core topic.

'''Why'''. We think that satisfying the customer will give immediate return and future perpestive to the company.

'''What'''. The expected results of the process include

* Product: an increase in physical appeal, reliability and availability of the product; a better looking, better quality and easier to find product.
* Subjectivity needs: a better customer care and satisfaction
* Social needs: a better customer group recognition and individual attention, the customer perception of the company as “trusted partner”.

Obviously these results need to be measured on customer expectation.

'''Who'''. People involved in customer satisfaction includes

* Product: design, industrialization, production, logistics
* Personal needs: sales, after sales, CRM executives, retail 
* Social needs: promotion, brand managment, public relations.

'''How'''. This point is about techniques to be used for cusotmer satisfaction.

In the product area we are concerned about the processes quoted as “direct” in the Porter chain value model. This area is surely the most studied in organizational modeling, we can quote various methodologies from BPR to Kaizen. It is surely not the goal of this work  to get into this problem, better authors then me have worked on this and you can refer to them. 

Personel needs: the studies concerning this area, in my opinion, are not as structured as in the former area.  As far as I know individual aspects of this field have been evaluated but in a stand-alone context, not in a complete customer relation view. The topics we are talking about concern

Customer centrality and adaption to the market

Product availability impact on sales

Sale channel competence and friendliness

After sales service impact

Customer relation management

Direct approach importance: the shop relation

Customer social needs are, in my knowledge, not the object of quantitative studies. This might depend on the fact that data collection is very difficult, so we are still at the level of hypothesis and specific experience collection. We are talking about:

“group” creation and belonging: brand nature and the role of promotion

brand management  and group life-cycle

public relations and their results

“personal” service.

'''Where''' does the process take place: I think we can define the place where the customer is the location where the process starts. Obviously the cusotmer can be anywhere in the world so we must take this into account. The rest of the process may then take place 

Product: in the stylist studio, in the technical, industrial, loistic and retail areas depending on the specific subprocess

Subjectivity needs: sales, customer service and retail areas

Social needs: anywhere as customers can be everywhere.

All these areas must be informationally connectable.

'''When'''. As for the geographical aspects also for the time-related variables the sinchronicity is very important; if you are late in a subprocess there is little chance that you will be able to recover afterwards. This is the deep meaning when “time to market” has been chosen as the critical variable in the next future, speeding up every single phase might give you the elasticity to cope with unforecasted events which might have disastreous effects.

The real problem, in my opinion, is to balance the time associated with each subprocess.

Product: the total lead time, from the idea to the availabilty, in the fashion wholesale world, lasts about 8-9 months; this period is actually deeply questioned by e-commerce and its related attitude.

Subjectivity: we can think of

Pre-sales (contacts, reciprocal knowledge)

Sales

After sales (recal and custom loyalty).

These process mainly happen on a few months horizon, a slightly longer period than the product cycle.

Social needs. The process of creating a “group” is fairly quick, the real problem is keeping the “group” alive through many years. In this process the “customer attention and recognition” can only start once you have created the “group” so it takes even longer.

'''How Much'''. The metric we use is about 

Product: Aestethic, quality, availability, cost and accepted price 

Subjectivity needs: service, reassurance, empathy

Social needs: how much does the “group” means, how much am I reconized inside the “group”.

As far as the “product” indeces there are quantitative data available related to quality (Aql methodology, number of returns), availability (question sheets and lost sales) and price positioning (sales to full price ratio). As far as I know there are no indeces related to aestetichs, maybe only the number of collection presented  items which never got produced.

Speacking about “service indeces” we have to divid “service quality” and “satisfaction index” (Oliver 1997).  The first is related to external indeces and standard measuring techniques (SERVQUAL, SERVPERF) while the second is related to customer perception. The fact that customer gets in the analysis of the index, introduces two further variables related to time (quality has a fairly long horizon, perception short) and space (consumers in different countries and context have different perception of “satisfaction”).

As far as I know there are no quantitative analysis related to “group belonging” or “group recognition”.

'''Instruments'''

The most well known instruments existing today surely cover the areas of product definition  (PDM) and production controlling (ERP); there are good instruments in forecasting, CRM and sales support.

Getting into details and assuming these are my personal opinions:

Product definition: there are good products helping the product definition (style, PLM, model marking, quality control) and they support time-phased georaphy problems via distributed workflows

* Production processes: definitely the best studied and supported area; you can find instruments (ERPs) very well done both on the theoretical foundaments and technical aspects. The only doubts are about their operational easiness and friendliness.
* Distribution instruments: not at the same level as the ERP but on the right way to be there.

Subjectivity needs support instruments:

* Customer relation: some good CRM package is available but it is still a long way to go to be really complete
* After sale support: it is considered the sales minor process so it has not been developed so much
* Retail. Very good in the operational aspects, not so much for the remaining subprocesses.

Customer social needs: available instruments are essentially question papers statistically analysed; there is no automatic data collection.

Talking about information systems I would like to return to a concept which I think very important. As customers are distributed all over the world, particular care must be taken at every level of integration, not just the technical one (Miotto etc.) if we want to avoid dangereous misunderstandings. Information integration is usually underestimated even though it is well known (Davenport) the importance that information technology had in process disintermediation.

  

== Ability to communicate the capacity of satisfying the need ==

The system is the customer-company environment; the process goal is the fact that the customer ( “group of customers”  to be addressed by my “solution”) is aware that a solution to his needs exists.

'''Why'''. We want the customer to be really aware of the existence of a solution of its limits because real customer service is respectful of customer identity and does not mislead facts.

'''What''' do I communicate, what is the content of the process.

* The knowledge of product content: aesthetics, reliability, availability and price/performance
* The fact that it is really that “product” that satisfies his need (whether primitive or induced)
* The context knowledge about expectation satisfaction, something like saying “come with us and you will be all right”
* The “group” belonging and brand identification
* The “group” recognition.

Regarding this last point we must be very careful about privacy issues, to know each person individually means knowing a lot of informations about him and this might not be compliant with local laws and/or create relation problems with the customer as he feels controlled and classified.

'''Who '''is involved in the process. The customer is the “receiving” (destination, output) part of the process and the company is the active (input) part. Obviously when we talk about customer we must keep in mind all the categories we have been talking about (known, unknown, potential) and calibrate methods and politics for each group.

'''Where''' does the process take place. As we noted companies and customers can be anywhere so the process must be geographically distributed. As far as places where the process takes place we can recognize:

Product: media and PR (testimonials etc.)

Subjectivity: direct sales channel (retail), indirect sales channel (wholesaler), other various channels including word of mouth 

Social: media, retail and PRs.

'''How '''we communicate the information.

Product: direct advertising (I show the product and associate it at human sense), indirect advertising (for example technical people explain characteristics, I get attracted by the person and through him I get to the product); comparative advertising.

Subjectivity: service advertising ( we show our customer service level), the level of professionalism and availability of our sales executive, the product context (packaging, advertising campaign), the service context (POP material, shop furniture and look).

Social promotion: social involvement (e.g. Toscani’s photos per Benetton), fashion shows, licensing, media, internet community, sales point formats, sponsoring; everything which helps creating a “group”. For “group recognition” we must think in terms of personal service.

'''When'''. The time factor in communication is quite different for each need:

Product: the timing is related to the availability (shop, internet or other); it is useless and wrong to communicate a capacity which does exist in reality so it is very important to synchronize ability to communicate and satisfaction capacity

Subjectivity main issue is “trust” which is a long asset to create and a quick one to be destroyed; its time scale is even longer than fashion and style as it might get through different stages of the company; usually it is years long

Social issues, in my opinion, are linked to the idea of “styles”; they are linked to “cultural break” and easiness of information exchange has deeply changed the time scale which I would indicate in a two-three years  period.

'''How much''' we need to communicate means defining the quantity of actions related to each former dimension. In the next chapter we shall propose a view where this dimension is actually related to the evaluation of the cost/return I have in each combination of variables. We know that evaluating the cost is feasible, not easy but usually can be done, while evaluating the return is very hard and it is usually done through side indicators like sale increase. I think there is a lot of work to be done in evaluating measurable parameters.

'''Instruments''': we partially quoted them in the “how” paragraph, we are talking about publicity and PRs. As far as I know there are no instruments, now, able to quantify, as an example, the return of the investment of a fashion show in terms of social impact on the knowledge of a “brand”.

 

== Industry: the architecture of the solution ==

To organize what we have been saying up to now, we have to create a schema including, for each process, every possible combination of the information dimensions we have been considering. Some of these combinations might be nonexistent like “sure needs of potential customers”. 

As an example of the operational method we can have tables like this one:

{| class=&quot;prettytable&quot;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

|
&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

|
&lt;center&gt;Need data collection&lt;/center&gt;

|

|
&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

|
&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

|
&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

|
&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

|-
|
&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

|
&lt;center&gt;'''''Product'''''&lt;/center&gt;

|
&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

|
&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

|
&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

|
&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

|-
|
&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

|
&lt;center&gt;'''''Subjectivity'''''&lt;/center&gt;

|
&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

|
&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

|
&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

|
&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

|-
|
&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

|
&lt;center&gt;'''''Sociality'''''&lt;/center&gt;

|
&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

|
&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

|
&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

|
&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Imagine the first process of need data collection,  here we can ask ourselves which are the needs 

Of a well known customer

Collected by a sale executive who transmit them

Semi-structured needs

Collected in a shop

With a very clear question

At the beginning of a sale campaign

Which means that we are considering one of all possible combinations of parameters.

Later in the book we shall get check how many are the meaningful combinations (Appendix A).

 In this way we are segmenting the total information problem in “cells” each of which has its own individual analysis of states and processes parameters. 

In this method we are not really taking into consideration the “when” and “why” dimension. The “when” variable is related to the variation of the schema in time: an open issue. The “why” parameter, at the top level, is human related and, in my opinion, has the basic meaning of the actual nature of economical enterprise, but this is also an open issue.



This schema reminds us of the phase-space in statistical mechanics where the cell weight is not even but it is related to the weight the company gives to it in its strategy. As in statistical mechanics the content of the cell is a function of both the initial state and the state variation rule (the process), assuming a first order non explicit time dependence. 

As far as the cost of cell fulfillment we can imagine a curve like this:



Where the cost to satisfy 100% is very high. The growth coefficient depends on the nature of the cell and it should be the result of specific analysis which locate the cell in the total analysis space.

When we talk about the value and the cost of a analysis cell we must not forget the reliability of the data we are using in terms of data collection, methods and people involved. This makes things very difficult when you think of a global solution so most companies, in my opinion have been using two side methods:

* What do other people do ( market driven policies)
* What is it going to happen if  I don’t do this (scare of “not doing”).

The method I propose, not forgetting the associated difficulties, is to break down the problem into specific cells and define local strategies in a wider architecture.

I really think that a complete semantic ontology of all cells, including time and space dependence, is a non realistic result so I propose a local approach using also heuristic techniques.

'''The company strategic plan then becomes'''

* '''Assigning a value to each cell of the “customer needs” phase space'''
* '''Trying to associate a cost to the fulfillment of that cell'''
* '''Maximize the the phase space covered with the constraint of the company total resources and define the attitude regarding the cells which are not considered for this moment.'''

From an information system point of view, in practice we need to quantify, for each cell,

The weight it has, related to company strategy

The value of information relative to the cell based on a definite metric system

The cost of getting that information.

The total combination gives the information scenario for the company. 

The time factor shows its importance both in fact that the context keeps changing and also in the fact that no company starts from scratch; usually there is an  information patrimony specially in the areas of product needs satisfaction (sales and production). The critical strategy factor now becomes the ability to choose the best solution for choosing the variation of customer phase space as to reach the best overall coverage.

From a practical point of view we start from the highest level four processes, get down to the individual cells and determine the actual company value, the cost of maintenance  and the cost of upgrading.





''It could be interesting to compare the structure of this analysis with the deployment of software projects. The phases of needs collection and rationalization is very well known in the enterprise software production while it is very little formalized in manufacturing.  On the other end the phase of capability communication is much more developed in the industry context.''

  
= Retail Processes =



We define “retail” as the set of processes which satisfy the availability need in a customer related space-time context. The difference between this set and the previous one is 

# The subject of the process, the retailer, does not satisfy the need starting from designing and projecting the answer from scratch but he tries to solve the problem choosing the  solution, among those on the market, which he thinks will better fit customer requests (sales methodology)
# The relation between retailer and final customer is much more “direct” than in the industrial case so many “non product” aspects are more important.

We can see the retail process from three different point of view:

# Final customer: form this point of view “retail” is simply the availability  in a “local” form; needs and data collection are the same as for the industrial environment
# Retailer: problems concern both to satisfy customers (purchasing and selling) and to relate to the context 
#  Context: this relates to how “retail processes” exist in the society both as time phased phenomena (geography = shops, shopping centers; communication etc.) and structure (fiscal and legal compliances)

From the customer point of view “retail” is a service process centered around the actual sale moment but we must remember that it really consists of before sale, actual sale and after sale (preparation, actuation and conclusion).

'''Process Analysis: the customer point of view'''

We know that, generally speaking, customer needs are:

Product        Aesthetics, reliability, availability

Subjectivity    Problem solving, reassurance, empathy

Sociality    group belonging, individual recognition



And that, for each need, direct processes imply:

* Data collection for all the data levels and views
* Analysis and method rationalization to be more efficient and precise
* Satisfaction given by the fulfillment of the need of the real product or of feeling
* Communication which means the ability to communicate the possibility of satisfaction.

The actual need coverage is through the balancing of these factors.

 From the market point of view, the weight of each parameters corresponds to the positioning of the company in the market share.

In the following table we can see how a group of users has quantified their expectations as a function of the sales channel

== Process analysis: the retailer point of view ==



 From the point of view of a retailer, the definite question is:

“why does a customer comes to me and how can I satisfy him ‘”

Which means “which are the customer needs and why does he feel that I can satisfy them ?”.

In the world of retail the contact is not with a “customer” but with a “specific customer”, this means that subjective and social needs are very much stressed compared to anonymous relations. It happens that shops may live on “local” emotional realities (mono or multibrand wholesalers) , some other times they have a more “diffuse” approach (department stores, large distribution). 

The birth of a “sales project”, to satisfy a particular customer need at any level of Maslow scale, then is the result of a sales enterprise which evaluates the market opportunities in terms of the lack of a product in a certain area/time, the availability of structures (shops), a new sales method or the existence of an unexploited sociality.

We start from our daily experience to group elementary processes into categories; this will help us in the functional analysis of the retail system.  Processes are sets of actions which satisfy needs whether these needs concern customers, retailers or the context. We assume that, if a process exists, it must have some meaning otherwise it would not exist any longer. Not every possible process exists or, sometime, we are not aware that it exists.

Our methodology starts from listing the processes and then looking for their value on customer needs; we must be very careful to distinguish between “real” value and “customer perceived” value; customer are only interested, and ready to pay for,  in the second ones while there could be processes (eg finance control)   which have no value for the final customer but are very important for the retailer. We shall be using the “perceived value” parameter.

To be completely correct from a methodological point of view we should define each process to the very detail, in fact we adapt to evaluate the cost/effectiveness of a process, this means that the value of a process is a function of 

* The relative importance of the customer need (what I satisfy)
* The perceived value of the solution: the expectation (how much I satisfy it).

In the following tables:

Processes are grouped by areas

Coding is such that

Effect on the process: H = high, M = medium, L = low, blank = not applicable

Grouping level: C = customer, G = group, T = context

Area: P = product, S = subjectivity, C = sociality, O = organization, F = fiscal

== Customer need – process existence relation ==



Let us look at the processes we just quoted (remind that needs belong only to the final customer); to fulfill them we need to operate on three different levels (not to be confused with operating entities):

* Single customer
* Customer group : customers of one specific sale point which means how the local retailer organizes the service
* Context: general aspects of service which means how is the general service defined, how to handle general topics ranging from product presentation to fiscal procedures.

The “retail” system does not consists only of processes related to customer relation but it has to cope with many levels of activities; this is the meaning of the “group” attribute in the former table.



Retail support systems: the information processes.

We speak explicitly of “support” and not of software because,  as you can saw from the process listed, the content is not a pure “data” parameters but if often connects to physical or psychological aspects.

We also saw that final customer  and retailer needs somehow differ both in content and in relative weight. 

From an industry point of view the retailer is “the customer” and this is why we need to understand which are the needs he needs to satisfy and he is willing to pay if satisfied.

We can think of retailer needs general schema as:

What we derive from this table is that “single”, “final” customer needs have been largely disappointed in the industrial attitude; companies tend to focalize on “customer groups” as their ability to solve needs is essentially related to product/social  and not to subjectivity capabilities.

This aspect of the end customer need is mainly covered by the “retail” structure.



To be methodologically correct we should now take into consideration all the 32 cells; out of these only 6 (“customer group”, data collection and analysis) have already been taken into consideration in the industrial analysis. In the following pages we shall group some cells to avoid being too long even though we realize that we make a methodological approximation.



'''''''''Customer processes'''

Personal needs are, by definition, very “personal” so they need a very “local” application of general principles stated by the company. The information content is actually very little formalized: we are moving in a very unexplored field.

'''''Product: data collection, analysis and satisfaction'''''

We are talking about the behavior of a specific customer in a specific sale situation: a very elementary context.

* What: we are looking at the relation between the customer and the garment he is evaluating;
* How: which are the parameters to decide “will the garment fit the customer expectations ?”  or even better: “will the garments satisfy the customer need?”
* Who: the actors involved in the process = the customer and the retailer
* Where does the process take place?  typically a real shop but it could be a virtual one
* When does the concurrence of product/customer occurs ? presence of both customer and product
* How much is the customer need satisfied: this is perhaps the most difficult parameters to measure directly
* Why: this the company strategy.

Assuming that we want to satisfy customer need, I think that the only information instrument which can be used is the sales executive capacity to support requests on product (fashion, quality)  and customer (decision process). Time length and variability of relation, in my opinion, make impossible for a formal information system to be really useful.

Measuring system can only be indirect through a total evaluation of the sale executive.  

'''''Product: communication'''''

The aim of this process is to make the specific customer understand that it is possible to help him in choosing the right product. Assuming that we think that the correct local instruments are sales executive, we want the customer to trust sales executive in their knowledge of product and can help him in determining the product coverage of his needs.

* What: sale executive product competence
* How: must be explicit and customer must recognize it
* Who: the information instrument is the sale executive or, at most, the store manager
* Where: in the sale area, this means physical availability of the vendor
* When: during real and prospect sales
* How much: as far as I know there is actually no formal system of measuring this process, maybe through customer interview
* Why: because it satisfies the customer.

As far as information supports, we must give the actual instrument (the sale executive) the knowledge he needs both on the product he is selling and on competitors so that he can help the customer to judge correctly the answer to his needs.

'''''Subjectivity: data collection, analysis and satisfaction'''''

We are  talking about elementary processes which concern ability to answer, personal assurance and empathy to a particular customer.

* What: as we are discussing of very individual, peculiar data. I think that the signals and the collection method are very difficult to categorize, we could try to classify the results. From a practical point of view we should define the results we want and leave to the sale executive the method to collect the data regarding customer individual feeling etc.
* How:  we could start from classifying (based on our experience) customer approach and check the results of possible general support standards we offer
* Who: people involved are sales executive and store managers (control level)
* Where: every possible customer relation, mainly in sales area
* When: before, during and after the sale
* How much: a possible measure of unit could be store manager evaluation
* Why: because customer must be at ease from a human relation point of view.

Information support: The sale executive must be empathetic with the specific customer so he must fit his way of acting to the actual situation. Information content must then relate to the sociological world of sales and, eventually, to the social and fashion trends.

'''''Subjectivity: communication'''''

* What: we want to communicate that a customer feels at ease in a particular context. It is a very personal phenomena and it is related mainly to the sale executive empathy, to the sale place format and to the brand image.
* How: the most important means I know of are word-of-mouth messaging and architecture design
* Who: mainly the sale executive, also every other company employee
* Where: mainly the shop but also the general social context
* When: it is important to note that both actual sales but also prospect and possible sales are extremely important for this topic
* How much: I think that only customer interviews can be a measuring instrument
* Why: to get returning customers.

This topic is fairly delicate because customer expectations can be very different from company policy and very often we saw a large gap between the two approaches.

'''''Sociality: data collection, analysis and satisfaction'''''

* What: the content of this point is about the customer feeling himself recognized and accepted
* How:  the whole process starts from customer receiving and recognition which must be precise. In the case of recognition this can be done through formal instruments (fidelity cards) or informal ones (the sales executive memory). In any case there must be standard procedures for each case.
* Who: this is mainly a sales executive job
* Where:  Typically the sales area; it is an interesting topic to understand what this means in a distributed location (internet)
* When: always, during real or prospect sales
* How much: a possible way of measuring this data could be the number of visit a customer does whether they became a real sale or not
* Why: to create a nicer environment for our customers.

From an information system point of view the first problem is related to customer recognition. Sometimes we can find some sort of “fake” personal recognition (eg intimate friendship) which annoys the customer, the real cases I can think of are either related to the high luxury environment, where quite a few customers are well known from social news, or small local retail with a consolidated personal knowledge of the customers. In other contexts we must rely on some personal interactions supported by CRM systems not to loose company knowledge.

'''''Sociality: communication'''''

* What: we are talking about the fact that a customer knows he will be recognized and helped
* How: on this topic we can think of formal communication systems like advertising but my opinion is that the best way is word-of-mouth and group diffusion
* Who: people involved are mainly sales executives and store managers
* Where: the sales place and the logical surroundings 
* When: during the whole relation with the customer (pre, actual and after sale)
* How much: a possible indicator could be the number of contacts; both ways and any possible content
* Why: because it helps satisfying the customer.

The information object includes the content (“welcome”),  the form (direct or indirect message) and the destination (actual or prospect customers).

 


== Group processes ==

Customer group needs are those industry relates to. As far as data collection and analysis processes, we can refer to the first part of the book as we are talking about collecting and categorize common customer needs; retail is a different way of solving them.

'''Product – satisfaction.'''

* What: the topic is about product availability  in the whole time cycle including after sales. We should divide the process in purchasing, stocking, shelf availability and after sales. Problems concern offer analysis, purchasing operational, sales space limitation as we assume that bulk storage is not a retail problem; the whole system is the retail industrial chain. 
* How: operations through subprocesses of purchasing, exhibition, sales and after sales service.
* Who: people involved includes merchandiser, buyers, sales executive and customer service.
* Where: any site of the company
* When: we can estimate a few months period
* How much: the whole process is so large that I think the only summary indicators we can use is the economical turnaround of the enterprise unit (shop etc.); subprocesses can be individually measured.
* Why: this is seen as the real nature of the retail structure, could not be the only one.

Customer satisfaction is “the process” of a retail system as it has to conjugate market availability and specific customer request. From an information point of view it asks for a huge amount of informations (see appendix B).

'''Product – communication'''

What: we are talking about the process which makes the customer understand that, in that place and at the right moment, he will find the answer to his product needs (group level). We thus deal with an information content.

How: we can use formal systems (commercials, press, window presentation) or informal (word-of-mouth) in large social contexts and personal systems (human relations) in limited environments.

Who: usually we cope with professionals in large scales and sales executive in small environment.

Where: Social contexts mean the whole society, up to world scale, and especially in aggregation area while small environment means essentially shops.

When: product satisfaction is not a one shot process, it needs to be created before and fed also after sale, this means that communication has to be time calibrated.

How much: without any communication product access is essentially stochastic so we can have  a first guess relating amount of communication to sales increase.

Why: because it might be that the customer doesn’t know that we can solve his need.

This whole topic should  be analyzed by itself.

'''Subjectivity  - satisfaction'''

* What: in this group we can identify a few topics. We can identify the role of the sales executive (technical expertise, personal attitude, follow up), customer-context relations (shop image, goods location and availability), customer-company relation (commercial, shop windows). They are all the result of how the company has imagined its relation with the customer.
* How: customer satisfaction can thus be a result of how we support
** Sale executive competence both on product and relation
** Context design and product merchandising
** Space positioning, visual merchandising and commercial.
* Who: persons involved include sales executive and sales structure managers to project the sale process
* Where: both in the shop and in the company studios
* When: a real sale experience does not last a moment, we must create a long lasting customer relation
* How much: I think one of the parameters we should consider is customer retention and find a way to measure it (eg fidelity cards)
* Why: we want to satisfy every aspect of our customers.

Informations related to this process are various and need a separate study.

'''Subjectivity – communication'''

What: this topic is about how we can communicate our ability in satisfying customer subjectivity

* How: 
** sales executive: after the specific training, we must communicate our employees ability in a formal way to the market (group of customers)
** customer – context: after the design of a comfortable shop environment we must be very strict in assuring that the standard is kept
** customer-company: like before we must underline our ability in individual attention.
* Who:  people involved include sales executive and communicators.
* Where: we must act any place a prospect can be but especially near shops, as to use take advantage of existing structures.
* When: we are not talking of a specific product so there is no definite time zone, it is a continuous job with peaks when no specific product is to be advertized
* How much: I think we could use the number of visiting people in our shops as an indicator
* Why: to cover any aspect of subjectivity need.

The information request set is too large to be analyzed here, further studies are needed.

''' Sociality – satisfaction'''

This process is concerned with smaller groups of customers than those addressed by industry, retail is more “locally” concerned either from a geographical (customer in a certain area) or from a social (customer of a certain type) point of view.

* What: the aim is to create a sense of belonging so that the customer refers to the shop, also maybe not for purchasing
* How: the attachment may be induced either directly (direct marketing) or indirectly (social signs)
* Who: it is usually a PR person working on these topics
* Where: the place is related to the sale method (place or market type)
* When: the time base is fairly long as it implies personal involvement
* How much: a possible parameter to measure such a process could be the number of visit, whether for purchase or not, to the company locations
* Why: it is not so easy to create the “social” concept of the retailer, especially for multi-brand retailers who do not share a company support.

Let get into more details for this area. Our analysis could take into consideration:

Customer reasoning:

What qualifies myself from the context?

How much does belonging to that group cost ?   

Which are the group identities and testimonials?

How can I avoid being considered “standard” and yet belong to the group?

Retailer reasoning

How much does it cost to create the “group”?

How much does it cost to maintain the “group identity”?

How much do I get in terms of new customers or upsales form the “group”?

Generally which is the “group” trade off?

I think we can look at two possible ways of approaching the problem:

Internal: a “group” needs to have times and places it can exists (like happy hours in bars etc.) and archetypes it can recognize, testimonials defining the “group characters”

External: a “group” needs symbols like shopping bags or reserved events.

From an information point of view we can measure

Customer retention both in number and quantity

New customers entries

PR costs.

These data are very difficult to obtain as they are much perturbed by product data, at the moment I do not know of reliable analysis on this topic.

'''Sociality – communication'''

While industry communication is essentially based on product, retail communication underline the idea of service, of problem solving. This idea implies that it is more of a institutional then technical communication.

* What: I want to tell people that my “group” is a “happy community” and you can join it.
* How: the mean is related to the market I am heading, no general rule.
* Who: the person who acts is mainly a PR, the customer receives.
* Where: the main targets are customers and prospects so it has to be evaluated where to spend the money; internet is a world situation
* When: if you act just once it is dangerous: the customer asks himself why of these expenses; the “group” communication has be lasting in time as it connect people and it has to create trustworthiness 
* How much: let us divide customers and prospects. Customer are to be steadily reminded, the parameter we could measure is customer retention. Prospects are to be invited, we could neasure new entries as a function of expenses.

The informations we need to control are various and often not explicit : imagine we talk of teen-agers buying clothes. Clothes are not just a way of dressing,  it is also a request for meeting similar. This means that a shop is a meeting point and it has to fulfill this need so that the teen-ager likes to stay in the shopping area. Places where you can only buy, in my opinion, have little chance against the web-offer, on the other hand satisfaction places are more expensive than normal shops.

From an information point of view the problem is thus to quantify the ratio between the capacity of satisfying customer social need and economical balance.

  


== Context processes ==



Context processes group all those operations which have no direct relation with the customer so these processes create no customer perceived value but are necessary for enterprise functioning.

A rough classification could divide them into “fiscal” processes (related to external existing rules and laws) and “organizational” (related to process “best practices” in the business area).

Context process are the one which are best known from an informational point of view as they derive either from formal rules (fiscal) or from repetitive experience (organizational); they are also the best information system supported processes. It is not the aim of this paper to describe more deeply this set of processes; I only would like to point out that, as they create no customer value, they must be considered a pure cost driver and the information system goal should be to satisfy the enterprise need reducing these costs. Typically this goal is achieved using methodologies as standard as possible introduced in the company via education and/or consultancy.

== Retail: the solution architecture ==



As we discussed in the industry part of this paper, in retail also we can create a schema for the set of processes related to the company information strategy. The matrix needs-functions is the retail phase space where each cell has its own cost and value; the complete figure is the company positioning strategy.

Some of these cells need to analyzed at a more specific level (eg group-product  satisfaction) ì; we should then sum the subprocesses cost to derive the total cell cost while the value is available only at a upper level.

We can think at the “true value” of the need as the product of the need importance multiplied by the channel expectation for the market we are operating, we find a result like the following table:

Based on this schema,  a retailer, as long has he decided which one is his operating channel, can find the relative value of customer need, his problem is now to decide “how much do I want to invest in satisfying this request”.

As we saw, each of these cell is made of many elementary processes with its own contribution to the final cost; this allows us to derive total cost as the sum of the whole solution.

The information technology goal is both to detail the information content and the analysis of a single subprocesses and to reduce the cost of each of the processes  itself using technology in the right way (where possible).

It is obvious that we start from processes which have the highest customer value so that they have  a quicker return.

= Conclusion =



The aim of this work is look for a schema in the structure of information  processing in a consumer industry. Personally I think we can recognize four types of consumer industry:

Physical goods with industrial origin (apparel, shoes, cars)

Physical goods for personal satisfaction (perfumes)

Services (non material goods) with industrial origin (security)

Services for personal satisfaction (films, bodycare).

Foe each type of industry organizational best practices, KPIs and data collection instruments have been defined but I believe that, up to now, information systems have developed only a local coverage related  to immediate needs or to the existence of a single cell information model. 

Looking at the whole information context it turns out that quite a few cell have information characteristics (timing, number of data, algorithms) that make a complete formal model unfeasible to exist. It turns out more useful to adopt a simplifying  approach and reengineer the process.

Sometimes the general approach is not possible also because it might happen that you are still defining the  elementary process. In particular there are many cells not covered by information models and instruments; most of these situation occurs from historical priorities or from lack of technical instruments.

In my opinion we could derive that

I think that, actually, the whole part related to customer subjectivity and sociality is left to the retailer experience and intuition. This attitude implies that satisfaction indexes are bound to be very inaccurate and inefficient. 

Obviously the relative weight of the various cells is related to the context we are working and, up to now, the “product” cells have been the most important.

In a globalized world were access to product will be eased by technical instruments, other factors will become more and more important so we shall get to analyze them.

We also need to stress that subjectivity and sociality assume a fairly different meaning in the internet world and this aspect is completely unknown at the moment.

'''Processes – customer group level''': here we can have more “general” (eg sale market analysis, purchasing) and more “specific”  topics (eg shop emotional paths definition); this might change the level of standardization we can find. Let us consider a fundamental retail need:

Customer group level: product-satisfaction.

In this part we consider the processes regarding availability of the product for the whole time period, including after sale. We can spot the following subprocesses:

* Market offer analysis
* Purchasing
* Stock management
* Sales area availability
* After sale behavior.

Assuming that request analysis (what does the customer group wants) has already been done, we want to use those informations.

'''Market offer analysis'''

In this process we match what the market offers with what our customers want. This process mainly takes place in two different ways:

Catalogue analysis

Physical analysis

''Catalogue analysis''

* What: we want to find, in the market we have access (first constraint), the product which best gets near to our objective in terms of
** Nature (clothing type and category)
** Technological properties (composition etc)
** Aesthetical and fashion parameters
** Price range
** Supplier characteristics (reliability etc.)
* How: this process used to be, and partially still is, fulfilled via information channels like technical papers or physical agents
* When: the search is made essentially when a new collection is introduced so there is little time for changing and this creates markets rigidities
* Where: a multibrand retailer has limited possibilities to make real geographical analysis, we are talking of a fairly strict constraint on this point
* Who: the real actor is the buyer, in small entities this corresponds very often to the seller
* How much: with the actual information systems this process is fairly slow, we might think of using, as a measuring parameters, the number of suppliers taken into consideration
* Why: we want to increase the knowledge of the market offer

This is a process in which there are very large possibilities of increasing the information quality, maybe standardizing the offer methodology; the problem seems to be related to multibrand confusion.

Physical analysis

* What: in this process the retailer checks the correspondence  of initial informations and controls certain unavailable data (garment fit, fabric real color)
* How: the process takes place where the physical garment is available (fairs, show rooms) 
* When: the time must be compatible with market requests 
* Where: as said, in fairs, show rooms or agents information points
* Who: people involved includes buyers and offering companies
* How much: it could be interesting measuring the distance between the catalogue offering and the real offer; we should interview the customers
* Why: to reduce wasted times

The information system support for this process is, in my knowledge, near to zero. The goal could be a historical feedback system for operators.

''Purchasing''

This process begins after product choice and includes operations related to purchase order creation and control. It is a standard industrial process which we only quote quickly without even getting into details like quotation, offer and order confirmation. 

* What: it is the process of defining the characteristics of the supply in terms
** Physical: goods to be delivered, place and date of delivery, delivery context (packing, labeling etc.)
** Non physical: terms of payment, quality standard, information data.
* How: operational aspect of the purchase order (paper, electronic data interchange)
* When: purchase order can be made in various moments: fairs, later back home
* Where: as before it depends on customer/supplier organization
* Who: entities involved include customer, supplier and, sometimes, third parties like agents or credit companies 
* How much: process dimension could not be related to the economical amount (think of small boutiques buying many codes and little quantities) but we could think in terms of SKUs
* Why: it is a steady state both from the physical and the information point of view.

From the information systems point of view, this is one of the best known process and there is plenty of knowledge on it.

''Stock management''

In this process, after we have chosen and ordered the garments, we are to keep track of the physical location.

* What: the process is about knowing where the goods are; they could be at the supplier, in transit, in the warehouse or in the sale area
* How: our system must help us in giving the situation both at the moment and in the next future (eg passage from transit to warehouse)
* When: the system must be available always and must give response on inventories at any time
* Where: the process must support people anywhere it is needed, both locally (shops, warehouses) and remote (company headquarter)
* Who: there are operational actors (shop executives, warehouse employee) and control people 
* How much: it is obvious that precision is a must; sometime fiscal limits are law defined
* Why: sales points are part of a larger system designed for customer satisfaction.

We need an information system which gives you the situation in any part of the customer dedicated world (supplier, logistics, shops); at the moment we are not yet in this situation.

''Sales area availability''

This point is about the way goods are to be shown so that customer probabilities, to find what he is looking for, get higher.

* What: as we know what the inventory is, we need to balance space vs. goods and to define exposition priorities (paths and areas)
* How: the choices we make must match customer needs and quantities taking into consideration that we might have to cope with missing quantities to be filled in the future
* When: the matching process between goods and space is obviously related to goods availability (spaces are generally fixed on the short term) and to customer visit frequency. It is usually considered a two-three weeks period.
* Where: where the sale takes place
* Who: usually it a is a visual merchandiser job, in smaller sales entities it is a senior sale executive job
* How much: department stores have long studied this problem, it is not in the aim of this paper to get into it
* Why: no doubt a good explosion helps the customer in finding what he is looking for.

From an information point of view, data concern customer and product presence (actual and future), customer revisit attitude and product appeal on the local market.

''After sale behavior.''

To satisfy the customer we must also project to implement after sale behaviors. After sale has two main components: returns and follow-up.

Returns

* What: we are essentially dealing with garments with quality standards not as expected
* How: returns are mainly processed via a shop physical hand back and the substitution with another garment or a refund
* How much: timing is mainly law defined and it might last from a few days (unsatisfaction) to months (quality problems)
* Where: the return process usually happens where the sale process took place
* Who: acting people include the customer, the retailer and the garment company
* How much: it is easy to be measured and, obviously, should be as little as possible
* Why: because this process is somehow part of the sale process, it is a side effect

Follow up

* What: this process help us in defining our new sales standards, it should measure the difference between the relation perception at the sale moment and later in time
* How: we must identify customer correspondence between customer expectation and real result
* Where: we have to be able to re-reach our customers where they stay
* Who: this process is available only for trackable customers so we much try to increase this number
* How much: to be statistically significant
* Why: to drive future sales processes

As far as information system is concerned, returns is a typical summary process so it needs operational and control systems while follow-up is also an analytical process.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Pathos represents an appeal to the audience's emotions. Pathos is a communication technique used most often in rhetoric (where it is considered one of the three modes of persuasion, alongside ethos and logos), and in literature, film and other narrative art.

Emotional appeal can be accomplished in a multitude of ways:

* by a metaphor or story telling, common as a hook
* by a general passion in the delivery and an overall emotion and sympathies of the speech or writing as determined by the audience. The pathos of a speech or writing is only ultimately determined by the listeners/readers.

Arguing that the city shouldn't demolish the park to build a mall because it would make adorable puppies sad is an example of an argument that uses pathos. Inherent to the argument is the notion that people love happy adorable puppies and hate adorable puppies to be sad.

A stroke occurs when there is a sustaining disruption of blood flow within the brain. Depending on where the disruption occurs, the death of specialized cells will cause severe disabilities in mental cognition, motor control, or speech&lt;ref name=&quot;WHO&quot;&gt;World Health Organization (2005). WHO STEPS Stroke Manual: The WHO STEPwise approach to stroke surveillance. Geneva, World Health Organization.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Ischemic Stroke - A blood clot from a distant blood vessel breaks off, travels to the brain and blocks a small blood vessel (embolic). Alternatively, the blood vessel becomes so narrow that blood cannot pass through it (caused by atherosclerosis)(thrombotic)&lt;ref name=&quot;WHO&quot;/&gt;
* Haemorrhagic Stroke – A blood vessel in the brain bursts (caused by thinning of vessel lining) (Intracerebral). Otherwise, bleeding occurs in the area surrounding the brain (not in the brain tissue)(subarachnoid)&lt;ref name=&quot;WHO&quot;/&gt;

===Causes of Stroke&lt;ref name=&quot;Weerd&quot;/&gt;:===
* Abnormal blood cholesterol and lipoprotein levels
* Hypertension and atherosclerotic lesions within blood vessels
* Diabetes, high inflammatory responses, carotid artery disease and other chronic cardiovascular diseases	
These comorbidities significantly increase the chances of a stroke, and stem from risk factors such as &lt;ref name=&quot;Gordon&quot;&gt;Gordon, N. et al. (2004) ‘Physical Activity and Exercise Recommendations for Stroke Survivors: An American Heart Association Scientific Statement’ Journal of the American Heart Association.

==Recommendations for Effective Exercise Rehabilitation:==
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Exercise     !! Recommended Activity from The American Heart Association and the National Heart Foundation of Australia &lt;ref name=&quot;Gordon&quot;/&gt;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Briffa&quot;&gt;Briffa, T. et al. (2006) National Heart Foundation of Australia physical activity reccomendations for people with cardiovascular disease. Sydney. National Heart Foundation of Australia&lt;/ref&gt; 
|-
| Aerobic || 30 mins of moderate intensity  (walking, riding), on most days of the week
|-
| Resistance || Low to moderate intensity 2-3 days a week targeting weakened muscles  
|}
Before undertaking exercise, the patient must be prescreened.  Current medication, range of mobility, strength and associated comorbidities must be considered in devising a supervised exercise program.

==Improving Compliance:== 
* Involvement and support from the patients family and social interaction &lt;ref name=&quot;Gordon&quot;/&gt;
* Psychological state (a positive outlook) and an interest in prescribed exercises will lead to increased motivation
* Altering activities to reduce exercise-related pain caused from comorbidities 
* Catering to patient’s daily schedule (associated time restraints)

Annotations to '''''The Complete Peanuts: 1983 to 1984''''' by Charles M. Schulz (Fantagraphics Books, 2011. ISBN 1606995235)

*p.&amp;nbsp;102 (August 24, 1983) As the strip indicates, the French term ''esprit de l'escalier'' translates as &quot;wit of the stairway&quot;. Schulz used French terms several times during the course of his strip, mainly during its later half, and all of them were authentic.
*p. 144 (November 29, 1983)  The motion picture ''[[w:Flashdance|Flashdance]]'' was released in April 1983 in the United States and enjoyed a large success at the box office.  Bill Melendez released an animated parody of it (and of other dance films) in April 1984, under the title ''[[w:It's Flashbeagle, Charlie Brown|It's Flashbeagle, Charlie Brown]]''.
*p. 151 (December 16, 1983)  It seems that Sally's script refers to the Christmas carol [[w:Hark! The Herald Angels Sing|&quot;Hark! The Herald Angels Sing&quot;]], well known in English speaking countries.
*p. 156 (December 27, 1983)  &quot;Snowperson&quot;: political correctness in the early 80s had gone quite far in its attempts to erase gender-biased expressions from the common language.   At that time, many tried to be gender-neutral to the point of sacrificing clarity, for example in sentences such as &quot;Every man/woman shall don his/her life jacket and report to the steward/stewardess nearest to him/her.&quot;  Some common nouns disappeared at that time, for example, &quot;fireman&quot; was replaced by &quot;firefighter.&quot;   In a somewhat related gag, [[w:Jim Unger|Jim Unger]] in his cartoon ''[[w:Herman (comic strip)|Herman]]'' had a sales clerk telling a customer: &quot;We live in a very strange era,&quot; with in the background a banner saying &quot;Grandperson clocks.&quot;
*p. 193 (March 23, 1984)  There is a &quot;Highland Park&quot; and a &quot;Selby Avenue&quot; in Saint Paul, Minnesota.  Schulz lived at the corner of Selby and Snelling, where his father's barber shop was also located.
*p. 220 (May 25, 1984)  &quot;Playing trivia&quot;:  Trivia games started in the early 80s, with [[w:Isaac Asimov|Isaac Asimov]]'s ''[[w:Super Quiz|Super Quiz]]'' possibly being the first of them in 1982.  They became very popular by the mid-80s.
*p. 240 (July 9, 1984)  &quot;[[w:Girls Just Want to Have Fun|Girls Just Want to Have Fun]]&quot; was a popular song in early 1984, sung by [[w:Cyndi Lauper|Cyndi Lauper]].
*p. 255 (August 14, 1984)  &quot;Roy Hobbs&quot;: Although the novel ''[[w:The Natural|The Natural]]'', by Bernard Malamud, was released in 1952, [[w:The Natural (film)|the movie based on it]] was produced and released only in 1984.

Annotations to '''''The Complete Peanuts: 1985 to 1986''''' by Charles M. Schulz (Fantagraphics Books, 2011. ISBN 1606995723)

*p.&amp;nbsp;xi (Foreword by Patton Oswald)  &quot;Snoopy even adds a new make-believe character to his repertoire (...) a bowtie-wearing, bowler-topped attorney.&quot;   That sentence is misleading, as the attorney persona of Snoopy in fact appeared many years before 1985/1986.

*p.&amp;nbsp;47 (April 19, 1985)  It seems Snoopy is cured of the &quot;weed claustrophobia&quot; that plagued him in 1956.  See the strips of October 27, November 3, and November 6 to 9 of that year.

*p.&amp;nbsp;94 (August 7, 1985).     A &quot;punker&quot; is &quot;a punk rock  musician or a devotee of punk rock  or punk  styles.&quot;. They were especially prevalent during the late 70's and 80's.

*p.&amp;nbsp;94-95 (August 7, 1985-August 9, 1985)    Although the term &quot;mallies&quot; doesn't actually exist, the type of people Schulz was referring to did. In the 80's, and still today, there are several people who can be possibly referred to as &quot;mallies&quot;.

*p.&amp;nbsp;97 (August 12, 1985)  [[w:Yuppie|YUPpies]] (from &quot;Young Urban Professional&quot;) defined the 1980s more than any other social group.  Their way of life (expensive tastes and professional ambition) was fueled by the financial and economic optimism of the era and was the subject of many books, movies, and television series (''[[w:The Bonfire of the Vanities|The Bonfire of the Vanities]]'', ''[[w:Family Ties|Family Ties]]'', ''[[w:Wall Street (1987 film)|Wall Street]]''). 
  
*p.&amp;nbsp;127-128 (October 23, 1985-October 25, 1985) &quot;The Lone Eagle&quot;, as the first strip of this series explicitly indicates, was Charles Lindbergh, who, as this strip also indicates, made the first nonstop solo flight from New York to Paris. Snoopy's &quot;Lone Beagle&quot; outfit is also his World War One Flying Ace outfit as well.

*p.&amp;nbsp;128 (October 26, 1985)    Wayne Gretzky is a Canadian former professional ice hockey player and former head coach. The joke is that Rerun's helmet looks like a hockey mask.

*p.&amp;nbsp;128 (October 27, 1985) One of the rare instances where an adult's speech appears in Peanuts.

*p.&amp;nbsp;131 (November 1, 1985)   &quot;Beagle Blaster&quot; refers to ghetto blasters, an 80's slang term referring to &quot;a large, powerful portable radio, especially as carried and played by a pedestrian or used outdoors in an urban area.&quot;.

*p.&amp;nbsp;133-134 (November 6, 1985-November 9, 1985) Halley's Comet, officially designated 1P/Halley, is the best-known of the short-period comets and is visible from Earth every 75–76 years. Halley is the only short-period comet that is clearly visible to the naked eye from Earth, and thus the only naked-eye comet that might appear twice in a human lifetime. Other naked-eye comets may be brighter and more spectacular, but will appear only once in thousands of years. As this strip series explicitly indicates, Sally has the date at least a month too early, and the comet's actual arrival was on February 1986.

*p.&amp;nbsp;170 (February 1, 1986)    ''She has what is known as a ten-speed..'' A ten speed is &quot;a system of gears having ten forward gear ratios, especially on a bicycle. &quot;. These types of bikes were particularly popular during the 70's and 80's.

*p.&amp;nbsp;174 (February 9, 1986)  The poems Snoopy writes down are plays on a classic love poem that may be traced at least as far back as to the following lines written in 1590 by Sir Edmund Spenser from his epic ''The Faerie Queene'' (Book Three, Canto 6, Stanza 6):

:It was upon a Sommers shynie day,
:When Titan faire his beames did display,
:In a fresh fountaine, farre from all mens vew,
:She bath'd her brest, the boyling heat t'allay;
:She bath'd with roses red, and violets blew,
:And all the sweetest flowres, that in the forrest grew.

The version Snoopy is lampooning is the most popular one:

:Roses are red,
:Violets are blue,
:Sugar is sweet,
:And so are you.

*P. 175 (February 10, 1986)  About the political correctness of the 1980s concerning gender bias in language, see also the strip of December 27, 1983.

*P. 175-176, 178-179 (February 10, 1986-February 15, 1986, and February 16, 1986 -February 21, 1986)   As the series explicitly indicates, the flu Snoopy(as the World War One Ace)catches is the great influenza epidemic of 1918-1919. As it also states, before it ended in 1919, twenty million people had died from the disease.. The armistice that was to mark the end of World War One that was mentioned February 19, was also signed during those years of death and disease.

*P. 178 (February 19, 1986) &quot;The war is over!!&quot;  Actually, the war is not over for Snoopy's pilot persona.  It will return to fight on October 4, 1986.

*p. 179 (February 22, 1986) The national anthem of the Unites States of America is the Star Spangled Banner, of which lyrics come from &quot;Defence of Fort McHenry&quot;, a poem written in 1814 by the 35-year-old lawyer and amateur poet, Francis Scott Key, after witnessing the bombardment of Fort McHenry by the British Royal Navy ships in Chesapeake Bay during the Battle of Fort McHenry in the War of 1812. The poem was set to the tune of a popular British song written by John Stafford Smith for the Anacreontic Society, a men's social club in London. &quot;The Anacreontic Song&quot; (or &quot;To Anacreon in Heaven&quot;), with various lyrics, was already popular in the United States. Set to Key's poem and renamed &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot;, it would soon become a well-known American patriotic song. With a range (tessitura) of one and a half octaves, it is known for being difficult to sing. Although the poem has four stanzas, only the first is commonly sung today. &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; was recognized for official use by the Navy in 1889, and by President Woodrow Wilson in 1916, and was made the national anthem by a congressional resolution on March 3, 1931 (46 Stat. 1508, codified at 36 U.S.C. § 301), which was signed by President Herbert Hoover. Before 1931, other songs served as the hymns of American officialdom. &quot;Hail, Columbia&quot; served this purpose at official functions for most of the 19th century. &quot;My Country, 'Tis of Thee&quot;, whose melody is identical to &quot;God Save the Queen&quot;, the British national anthem, also served as a de facto anthem. Following the War of 1812 and subsequent American wars, other songs would emerge to compete for popularity at public events, among them &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot;.

*p.&amp;nbsp;184 (March 5, 1986) &quot;Baby on Bike&quot; is a reference to the rising popularity of &quot;Baby on Board&quot; warning signs in the 1980s.

*p. 185 ((March 7, 1986) This strip is a little bit confusing, as at first glance it appears that Snoopy is talking in the last panel. However, on closer inspection, it is revealed that it is in fact the body of Snoopy talking. One of the possible hint to this is the scrunched up line directing the thought balloon to its bearer that only Snoopy's body parts have.
 
*p.&amp;nbsp;188 (March 15, 1986)  James Gould Cozzens was, as this strip indicates, the author of &quot;By Love Possessed&quot;.

*p.&amp;nbsp;192 (March 23, 1986) Medic is slang for doctor.

*p.&amp;nbsp;195 (March 30, 1986) The definition of the word &quot;ganglion&quot; Linus is referring to is the less known one, meaning &quot;a small lump most commonly on the hand or foot&quot;.

*p.&amp;nbsp;202-203 (April 15, 1986) ''What have we done to Fort Zinderneuf?!'' Fort Zinderneuf is the main setting of the 1966 film ''Beau Geste'' and the 1924 novel it is based on.

*p.&amp;nbsp;208 (April 28, 1986-May 3, 1986) The Maypole Dance that is celebrated in U.S. in Secondary or High School dances as part of a May Day celebration are nearly identical to that celebrated in the United Kingdom. Often the Maypole dance will be accompanied by other dances as part of a presentation to the public.The earliest use of the Maypole in America occurred in 1628, where William Bradford, governor of New Plymouth, wrote of an incident where a number of servants, together with the aid of an agent, broke free from their indentured service to create their own colony, setting up a maypole in the center of the settlement, and behaving in such a way as to receive the scorn and disapproval of the nearby colonies, as well as an official officer of the king, bearing patent for the state of Massachusetts. The May Queen or Queen of May is a term which has two distinct but related meanings, as a mythical figure and as a holiday personification. This series is referring to the latter, the May Queen who is a girl who must ride or walk at the front of a parade for May Day celebrations. She wears a white gown to symbolize purity and usually a tiara or crown. Her duty is to begin the May Day celebrations. She is generally crowned by flowers and makes a speech before the dancing begins. Certain age groups dance round a Maypole celebrating youth and the spring time.

*p. 274 (October 1, 1986) The first balls were made of natural materials, such as an inflated pig bladder, sometimes inside a leather cover, which has given rise to the slang term &quot;pigskin&quot;. Modern balls are designed by teams of engineers to exacting specifications, with rubber or plastic bladders, and often with plastic covers. Various leagues and games use different balls, though they all have one of the following basic shapes:

|    a sphere: used in Association football and Gaelic football
|    a prolate spheroid
|        either with rounded ends: used in the rugby codes and Australian football
|        or with more pointed ends: used in American football and Canadian football

The precise shape and construction of footballs is typically specified as part of the rules and regulations. The oldest football still in existence, which is thought to have been made circa 1540, was discovered in the roof of Stirling Castle, Scotland, in 1981. The ball is made of leather (possibly from a deer) and a pig's bladder. It has a diameter of between 14–16 cm (5.5–6.3 in), weighs 125 g (4.4 oz) and is currently on display at the Smith Art Gallery and Museum in Stirling.

*p. 277 (October 8, 1986) A zamboni is an ice resurfacer, which is a vehicle used to clean and smooth the surface of an ice sheet, usually in an ice rink. The first ice resurfacer was developed by Frank Zamboni in 1949 in the city of Paramount, California. Zamboni /zæmˈboʊni/ is an internationally registered trademark, though the term is often used as a generic colloquialism for any ice resurfacer.

*p. 283 (October 22, 1986) Fog is a 1916 poem by Carl Sandburg that reads:
:THE FOG comes
:on little cat feet.

* p.301 (December 3, 1986) This the last appearance of Tapioca Pudding.

*p.&amp;nbsp;308, 310 (December 19, 1986-December 20, 1986, and December 22, 1986, and  December 24, 1986)      This unnamed kid closely resembles Shermy, a character who disappeared in the year 1976.

This demonstrates how to make a [[w:Rainwater tank|rain-barrel]]. Components of instruction will be separated so a rain-barrel can be made to the builder's preference. Hopefully, [[w:Rainwater harvesting|rainwater harvesting]] can come in handy for a ''rainy day'' or [[w:drought|drought]]. The assembler and user are responsible for drinking water safety.

A rain-barrel is useful in developing nations or regions where clean water may not be available. Rain water is relatively pure, still precautions need to be taken for sanitation and health safety. Mosquito larva and other organisms need to be kept out. Bacteria, protists or other microbes can develop inside the rain-barrel, so proper heat sanitation treatment in a cooking container may be necessary before consumption.

Be mindful of: air pollution, potential acid rain, proper disinfection, maintenance, [[w:drought|extended drought conditions]] including [[w:desertification|desertification]], [[w:Purified water#Health effects of drinking purified water|lack of minerals in water]], rain collection surface and other variables. The project assembler and users of the rain-barrel are responsible for drinking water health safety and avoiding shortages.

==Common materials==
* food-grade [[w:barrel|barrel]] or new plastic garbage can (non-cancerous made material)
* 1/2 male brass valve
* 1/2 pvc threaded coupling
* 1/2 [[w:o-ring|o-rings]] (make connections watertight)
* 1/2 in [[w:hole saw|hole-saw]] with guiding drill (can be used on a properly sized hex bit hand screwdriver)
Threaded fittings with o-rings eliminate or reduce the need for pipe cement.
If the desired threaded fitting is not available in pvc form, galvanized or brass fittings will connect to pvc fittings. Any metallic connector should be non-lead.

==Drinking water connection==
Use a 1/2in hole saw to cut a hole on the bottom side of the rain-barrel. Put an o-ring on the valve, insert it in the hole. Put on the other o-ring from inside the plastic can, then thread on the female 1/2in pvc coupling.

If plumbing is connected, prevent unsanitary conditions from backing up into or siphoning into the water-barrel: a check-valve, and precaution to keep the connected piping or tubing off the ground and away from unsanitary conditions are desired.

==Overflow==
Use the hole saw to cut a hole on the side near the top of the plastic can out of the way of the lid. Put an o-ring on the male threaded coupling, then insert it through the inside of the hole, from the inside. Put an o-ring on the coupling from the outside of the lid. Put a 1/2in (faucet type) strainer inside the 1/2 elbow. Thread the 1/2 elbow on the coupling, facing it down when done.

==Additional water-barrels==
Near the bottom side of both rain-barrels, drill a 1/2in hole. The water-level of the connected rain-barrels will remain in equilibrium. If the connection is made too high, the water from one barrel will not be able to empty into the other. For each rain-barrel use threaded couplings, with an o-ring on each side of the water-barrel walls. Flexible pvc tubing with appropriate connectors between containers is ideal.

Each additional rain-barrel can be made with only one hole drilled in it, because the multiple connections can be made externally with Tee or Cross fittings. This simplifies closing off the drain connection by fitting on a threaded plug, if this secondary barrel is wanted for another purpose. Two connection points per secondary barrel can be made optionally.

==Lid==
Use the lid, not the can, for inflow to the water-barrel from gutters or other collection surface.

==Foundation==
Rain-barrels can be upright partially below ground, or it can be on cement blocks. If the water barrel is partially below ground, the top of the water barrel must be above the highest potential flood level, to avoid sewage or other contamination, and a pump may have to be used. All connections, especially below potential flood level, must be watertight. Sand can be used for the foundation, to prevent initial shifting of the water-tank to prevent it from breaking. Once it is settled, this is unlikely to be a problem. Bricks may be built around it for aesthetic purposes, or for keeping it out of view.

This tutorial discusses different representations of local rotations in Unity. It is based on {{Cg Programming Unity SectionRef|Vertex Transformations}}.

This is the first of a few tutorials that demonstrate useful functionality of Unity that is not directly associated with shaders. Therefore, the presented code is in JavaScript.  

== Unity's Euler Angles ==
If you create a GameObject and select it, the '''Inspector''' will show three values X, Y, Z under '''Transform &gt; Rotation'''. These are three Euler angles measured in degrees. (More precisely spoken, they are one possible set of three Tait-Bryan angles, or nautical angles or Cardan angles, since they describe rotations about three different axes while “proper Euler angles” would describe a set of three angles that describe three rotations where two rotations are about the same axis.)

In JavaScript you can access these three angles as the &lt;code&gt;Vector3&lt;/code&gt; variable [http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/ScriptReference/Transform-localEulerAngles.html &lt;code&gt;Transform.localEulerAngles&lt;/code&gt;]. The documentation states that the angles represent — in this order — a rotation by Z degrees about the z axis, X degrees about the x axis, and Y degrees about the y axis. More precisely spoken, these are rotations about the fixed(!) axes of the parent object (or the world axes if there is no parent object). Since these rotations use fixed axes, they are also called “extrinsic rotations”.

These three angles can describe any rotation of an object in three dimensions. In the case of &lt;code&gt;Transform.localEulerAngles&lt;/code&gt; they actually describe the orientation of an object relative to the parent's coordinate system (or the world's coordinate system if there is no parent). Rotation in the sense of a rotating motion is discussed below.

In aviation, Euler angles are used when the orientation of a plane is specified relatively to the fixed axes of the ground (e.g. a tower of an airport) as illustrated in the figure above. In this case, they are called “bank” (corresponding to Z), “elevation” (corresponding to X), and “heading” (corresponding to Y). The following JavaScript code can be attached to an object to set the Euler angles in terms of these names. (In the '''Project''' view select '''Create &gt; Javascript''', double-click it to open it, copy &amp; paste the code from below into the script, and drag the script from the '''Project''' view over the game object in the '''Hierarchy''' view, then select the game object and find the public variables of the script in the '''Inspector'''.) 
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
@script ExecuteInEditMode() 
#pragma strict

public var bankZ : float;
public var elevationX : float;
public var headingY :float;

function Update() 
{
   transform.localEulerAngles = 
      Vector3(elevationX, headingY, bankZ);
}
&lt;/source&gt;
Interact with the three variables in the '''Inspector''' to get familiar with their meaning. You could start with all three angles set to 0. Then change bank, elevation, and heading (in this order) and observe how the object rotates about the parent's (or world's) z axis (the blue axis in Unity) when changing bank, about the parent's x axis (red) when changing elevation, and about the parent's y axis (green) when changing heading.

==Computing the Rotation Matrix==
In order to establish the connection with the elementary model matrices in {{Cg Programming Unity SectionRef|Vertex Transformations}}, this subsection presents how to compute a rotation matrix from the three angles X, Y, Z (or θ, ψ, and φ).

The 4×4 rotation matrix &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{R}_{z}(\varphi)&lt;/math&gt; for a rotation by an angle φ (= Z) about the z axis is:

&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{R}_{z}(\varphi) = \left[ \begin{matrix}
\cos\varphi &amp; -\sin\varphi &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
\sin\varphi &amp; \cos\varphi &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 
\end{matrix} \right]&lt;/math&gt;

The first two coordinates of the leftmost column can be understood as the rotation of the vector (1,0) by an angle &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;, which results in the rotated vector &lt;math&gt;(\cos\varphi, \sin\varphi)&lt;/math&gt;. (The illustration uses the angle ''t''; thus, the result is &lt;math&gt;(\cos t, \sin t)&lt;/math&gt;.) Similarly, the first two components of the next column can be understood as the rotation of the vector (0,1) by the angle &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; with the result &lt;math&gt;(-\sin\varphi, \cos\varphi)&lt;/math&gt;. 

Analogously, the 4×4 rotation matrix &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{R}_{x}(\theta)&lt;/math&gt; for a rotation by an angle θ (= X) about the x axis is:

&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{R}_{x}(\theta) = \left[ \begin{matrix}
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; \cos\theta&amp; -\sin\theta &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; \sin\theta &amp; \cos\theta&amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 
\end{matrix} \right]&lt;/math&gt;

And the 4×4 rotation matrix &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{R}_{y}(\psi) &lt;/math&gt; for a rotation by an angle ψ (= Y) about the y axis is:

&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{R}_{y}(\psi) = \left[ \begin{matrix}
 \cos\psi &amp; 0 &amp; \sin\psi &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 1&amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
-\sin\psi &amp; 0 &amp; \cos\psi&amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 
\end{matrix} \right]&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the sign of the sine terms depend on some conventions. Here we use the conventions of Unity.

These three matrices have to be combined in one matrix product to form the total rotation. Since (column) vectors are multiplied from the right to transformation matrices, the first rotation &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{R}_{z}(\varphi)&lt;/math&gt; has to be in the rightmost place and the last rotation &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{R}_{y}(\psi)&lt;/math&gt; has to be in the leftmost place. Thus, the correctly ordered matrix product is:

&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{M}_\text{rotation}(\varphi, \theta, \psi) = \mathrm{R}_{y}(\psi) \mathrm{R}_{x}(\theta) \mathrm{R}_{z}(\varphi)&lt;/math&gt; 

The matrix &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{M}_\text{rotation}(\varphi, \theta, \psi)&lt;/math&gt; can then be multiplied with other elementary transformations matrices to form the model matrix as discussed in {{Cg Programming Unity SectionRef|Vertex Transformations}}.

In Unity, you could compute a 4×4 matrix &lt;code&gt;m&lt;/code&gt; for the Euler angles &lt;code&gt;X, Y, Z&lt;/code&gt; in this way (quaternions are discussed in more detail below):
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
var m : Matrix4x4 = Matrix4x4.TRS(Vector3(0,0,0), 
   Quaternion.Euler(X, Y, Z), Vector3(1, 1, 1));
&lt;/source&gt;

[[File:No gimbal lock.png|200px|thumb|right|No gimbal lock: the axes of the three gimbals are different.]]
[[File:Gimbal lock.png|200px|thumb|left|Gimbal lock: the axes of two gimbals are parallel.]]
==Gimbal Lock==
One interesting feature of Euler angles (and one reason why Unity and most other graphics applications don't use them internally) is that they can result in a situation that is called “gimbal lock”. In this situation, two of the rotation axes are parallel and, therefore, only two different rotation axes are used. In other words, one degree of freedom is lost. This happens with Unity's Euler angles if the 1st rotation (the elevation about the x-axis) is X = ±90°. In this case, the z axis is rotated onto the y axis; thus, the (rotated) first rotation axis is the same as the (fixed) third rotation axis. 

The situation is easily constructed with the script from above if you set the elevation angle to 90° or -90°.

[[File:Rollpitchyawrob.jpg|200px|thumb|right|An articulated robot: the rotations about z, y, and x are referred to as yaw, pitch, and roll. (In the main text, these axes are labeled y, x, and z.)]]
==Moving Rotation Axes==
In some cases, for example robotics, it is more interesting to work with moving rotation axes (i.e. intrinsic rotations) instead of the fixed rotation axes (i.e. extrinsic rotations) discussed so far. Usually, the rotation relative to the base of the robot is referred to as “yaw”, the up-down rotation of the arm as “pitch”, and the next rotation as “roll”. Since the joints are rotated by each rotation, a description of rotations with moving rotation axes is required.

Fortunately, there is a simple equivalence: the extrinsic rotations specified by Z, X, and Y correspond to the following three intrinsic rotations (in this order): a rotation about the y axis by Y (“yaw”), a rotation about the rotated x axis by X (“pitch”), and a rotation about the rotated z axis by Z (“roll”). In other words, the rotation angles for moving rotation axes are the same as for fixed rotation axes if they are applied in reverse order (Y, X, Z instead of Z, X, Y). For most people, this equivalence is not intuitive at all; however, you might gain a better understanding by playing with the following script that lets you specify yaw, pitch, and roll.

&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
@script ExecuteInEditMode() 
#pragma strict

public var yawY : float;
public var pitchX : float;
public var rollZ :float;

function Update() 
{
   transform.localEulerAngles = 
      Vector3(pitchX, yawY, rollZ);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

[[File:Axis.png|200px|thumb|right|Aircraft principal axes: yaw, pitch, and roll.]]

==Roll, Pitch, and Yaw in Aviation==
Roll, pitch, and yaw are also used to describe the orientation of vehicles; see the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axes_conventions#Frames_mounted_on_vehicles Wikipedia article on “Axes Conventions”]. Moreover, the principal axes of an aircraft are also called roll (z axis in Unity), pitch (x axis in Unity), and yaw (y axis in Unity). These axes are always fixed to the aircraft; thus, rolling, pitching, and yawing always refers to rotations about these aircraft principal axes regardless of the orientation of the aircraft. The mathematics of these rotations is therefore different from the Euler angles of the same name. In fact, the rotation about aircraft principal axes is more similar to the rotation about arbitrary axes discussed next.

==Rotation about an Axis by an Angle==
As mentioned in {{Cg Programming Unity SectionRef|Vertex Transformations}}, the rotation matrix for a rotation about a normalized axis &lt;math&gt;(x, y, z)&lt;/math&gt; by an angle α is:

&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{M}_{\text{rotation}}(x,y,z,\alpha) = \left[ \begin{matrix}
(1-\cos\alpha) x\,x + \cos\alpha    &amp; (1-\cos\alpha) x\,y - z \sin\alpha   &amp; (1-\cos\alpha) z\,x + y \sin\alpha  &amp; 0 \\
(1-\cos\alpha) x\,y + z \sin\alpha  &amp; (1-\cos\alpha) y\,y + \cos\alpha     &amp; (1-\cos\alpha) y\,z - x \sin\alpha  &amp; 0 \\
(1-\cos\alpha) z\,x - y \sin\alpha  &amp; (1-\cos\alpha) y\,z + x \sin\alpha   &amp; (1-\cos\alpha) z\,z + \cos\alpha    &amp; 0 \\
0                                   &amp; 0                                    &amp; 0                                   &amp; 1 
\end{matrix} \right]&lt;/math&gt;

Fortunately, this matrix is almost never needed when working with Unity. Instead, the object's local “rotation” can be set to a rotation about &lt;code&gt;axis&lt;/code&gt; by &lt;code&gt;angle&lt;/code&gt; in degrees in this way:
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
@script ExecuteInEditMode() 
#pragma strict

public var angle : float;
public var axis : Vector3;

function Update() 
{
   transform.localRotation = 
      Quaternion.AngleAxis(angle, axis);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Actually, this sets the orientation of the object relative to its parent (or to the world if there is no parent). In order to rotate about a given axis at a given angular velocity in degrees per second, the function &lt;code&gt;Transform.Rotate&lt;/code&gt; can be used:

&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
#pragma strict

public var degreesPerSecond : float;
   // angular speed
public var axis : Vector3;

function Update() 
{
   transform.Rotate(axis, 
      degreesPerSecond * Time.deltaTime,
      Space.Self);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;degreesPerSecond&lt;/code&gt; is an angular speed, which specifies how fast the object is rotating. However, &lt;code&gt;Transform.Rotate&lt;/code&gt; requires the rotation angle in degrees. To compute this angle, the angular speed has to be multiplied with the time (in seconds) that has passed since the last call to &lt;code&gt;Update&lt;/code&gt;, which is &lt;code&gt;Time.deltaTime&lt;/code&gt;.

Furthermore, &lt;code&gt;Transform.Rotate&lt;/code&gt; takes a third argument that specifies the coordinate system in which the rotation axis is specified: either &lt;code&gt;Space.Self&lt;/code&gt; for the object's local coordinate system or &lt;code&gt;Space.World&lt;/code&gt; for the world coordinate system. With &lt;code&gt;Space.Self&lt;/code&gt; we can easily simulate rolling, pitching, and yawing by specifying the axes (1,0,0) for pitching,(0,1,0) for yawing, and (0,0,1) for rolling.
 
==Quaternions==
As you might have noticed in the code above, Unity is using quaternions (actually normalized quaternions) to represent rotations. For example, the variable &lt;code&gt;Transform.localRotation&lt;/code&gt; is of type &lt;code&gt;Quaternion&lt;/code&gt;. 

In some sense, quaternions are simply four-dimensional vectors with some special functions. Normalized quaternions of length 1 correspond to rotations and are easy to construct when you know the normalized rotation axis (''x'', ''y'', ''z'') and the rotation angle α. The corresponding quaternion ''q'' is just:

&lt;math&gt;q = (x_q, y_q, z_q, w_q) = (x \sin(\alpha/2), y \sin(\alpha/2), z \sin(\alpha/2), \cos(\alpha/2))&lt;/math&gt;

In Unity, however, you can just use the constructor &lt;code&gt;Quaternion.AngleAxis(alpha, Vector3(x, y, z))&lt;/code&gt; with alpha in degrees to construct the normalized quaternion. (See the previous subsection for an example.)

Conversely, a normalized quaternion ''q'' with components &lt;math&gt;(x_q, y_q, z_q, w_q)&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to a rotation by the angle &lt;math&gt;2 \arccos(w_q)&lt;/math&gt;. The direction of the rotation axis can be determined by normalizing the 3D vector &lt;math&gt;(x_q, y_q, z_q)&lt;/math&gt;. In Unity, you can use the function &lt;code&gt;Quaternion.ToAngleAxis&lt;/code&gt; to compute the corresponding axis and angle.

As normalized quaternions correspond to rotations, they also correspond to rotation matrices. In fact, the product of two normalized quaternions corresponds to the product of the corresponding rotation matrices in the same order. Computing the product of two quaternions is actually a bit tricky but in Unity you can just use the &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; operator. In the case of products of quaternions (and also inverse quaternions), it is therefore useful to think of a quaternion as “something like a rotation matrix” instead of a four-dimensional vector.

For example, the code for the rotation at a given angular speed about an axis in the object's local coordinate system would require to multiply — in this order — the previous rotation matrix (which specifies the previous orientation) with the new (incremental) rotation matrix. The quaternion for the previous orientation is &lt;code&gt;transform.localRotation&lt;/code&gt; and the new incremental quaternion is called &lt;code&gt;q&lt;/code&gt; in this code:

&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
#pragma strict
 
public var degreesPerSecond : float;
   // angular speed
public var axis : Vector3;
 
function Update() 
{
   var q : Quaternion = Quaternion.AngleAxis(
      degreesPerSecond * Time.deltaTime, axis);
   transform.localRotation = 
      transform.localRotation * q;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

If the quaternion product in the last line is changed to
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
   transform.localRotation = 
      q * transform.localRotation;
&lt;/source&gt;
it corresponds to applying the incremental rotation in the parent's coordinate system (or the world's coordinate system if there is no parent) just like one would expect for applying a rotation matrix after transforming the vertices into the parent's coordinate system. (Remember that matrix products should be read from right to left because column vectors are multiplied from the right.) 

At least in computer graphics, (normalized) quaternions are therefore rather harmless and never more complicated than rotation matrices or axis-angle representations (depending on the context). Their specific advantages are that they show no gimbal lock (as opposed to Euler angles), they can be easily combined by multiplication (as opposed to Euler angles and the angle-axis representation of rotations), and they are easy to normalize (as opposed to the orthogonalization of rotation matrices). Therefore, most graphics applications use quaternions internally to represent rotations — even if Euler angles are used in the user interface.

== Summary ==
In this rather theoretical tutorial, we have looked at:
* Unity's Euler angles for extrinsic rotations (i.e., elevation, heading, and bank).
* Unity's Euler angles for intrinsic rotations (i.e., pitch, yaw, and roll).
* The axis-angle representation of rotations.
* The quaternion representation of rotations.

      <comment>/* Prepare the environment */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Velvet practical: Part 1 ==
This practical will cover the following items:
* Compile Velvet
* Single end
* K-mer length
* Coverage cut-offs
* Whole genome sequence as input???

=== Prepare the environment ===

First make sure that you are in your home directory by typing:

'''cd'''

and making absolutely sure you're there by typing:

'''pwd'''

Now create sub-directories for this and the two other velvet practicals. All these directories will be made as sub-directories of a directory for the whole course called NGS. For this you can use the following commands:

'''mkdir -p NGS/velvet/{part1,part2,part3}'''

 # The -p tells mkdir (make directory) not to worry if a parent directory is missing.
 # That is, if a sub-diectory cannot be made because its parent directory does not exist,
 # just make the parent directory  first rather than reporting an error.
 # The “one at a time” approach would be:
 mkdir NGS
 mkdir NGS/velvet
 mkdir NGS/velvet/part1
 mkdir NGS/velvet/part2
 mkdir NGS/velvet/part3

After creating the directories, examine the structure and move into the directory ready for the first velvet exercise by typing:

'''ls -R NGS;

'''cd NGS/velvet/part1; pwd;'''

=== Downloading and Compile Velvet ===
You can find the latest version of velvet at:
	
http://www.ebi.ac.uk/~zerbino/velvet/

You could go to this URL and download the latest velvet version, or equivalently, you could type the following, which will download, unpack, inspect, compile and execute your locally compiled version of velvet:

&lt;code&gt;'cd ~/NGS/velvet/part1; pwd;

cp ~/NGS/Data/velvet_1.2.07.tgz . ;

tar xzf ~/NGS/Data/velvet_1.2.07.tgz;

ls -R; cd velvet_1.2.07;

make velveth velvetg;

./velveth''' &lt;/code&gt;

Take a look at the executables you have created. They will be displayed as green by the command:

&lt;code&gt; ls --color=always; &lt;/code&gt;

 The switch '''--color''', instructs that files be coloured according to their type.
 This is often the default. Here we are just being cautious. 
 The '''=always''' is included as colouring is usually suppressed in scripts.
 If you run this exercise using the script provided, just '''--color''' would not be enough.
 '''--color=always''' insists on file colouring even from a script.

Have a look of the output the command produces and you will see the following parameters passed into the compiler:

'''“MAXKMERLENGTH=31”''' and '''“CATEGORIES=2”'''

This indicates that the default compilation was set for De Bruijn graph KMERs of maximum size 31 and to allow a maximum of just 2 read categories. You can override these, and other, default configuration choices using command line parameters. Assume, you want to run velvet with a KMER length of 41 using 3 categories, velvet needs to be recompiled to enable this functionality by typing:

&lt;code&gt; make clean; make velveth velvetg MAXKMERLENGTH=41 CATEGORIES=3;
./velveth &lt;/code&gt;

velvet can also be used to process SOLID colour space data. To do this you need a further make parameter. With the following command clean away your last compilation and try the following parameters:

&lt;code&gt; make clean; make MAXKMERLENGTH=41 CATEGORIES=3 color
./velveth_de &lt;/code&gt;

For a further description of velvet compile and runtime parameters please see the velvet Manual: https://github.com/dzerbino/velvet/wiki/Manual

== Single ended read assembly ==
 The data you will examine is from '''''Staphylococcus aureus''''' USA300 which has a genome of around 3MB.
 The reads are  Illumina and are unpaired, also known as single-end library. 
 Even though you have carefully installed velvet in your own  workspace, we will use a pre-installed version. 
 The data needed for this section can be obtained from the Sequence Read Archive (SRA). 
 For the following example use the run data SRR022825 and SRR022823 from the SRA Sample SRS004748.
 The SRA experiment could be viewed by setting your browser to the URL:
 	
 '''http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/SRS004748'''

The following exercise focuses on velvet using single-end reads, how the available parameters effect an assembly and how to measure and compare the changes.
To begin with, first move back to the directory you prepared for this exercise, create a new folder with a suitable name for this part and move into it. The command to download the file from the internet would be:

&lt;code&gt; wget ftp://ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/SRR022/SRR022825/SRR022825.fastq.gz &lt;/code&gt;

&lt;code&gt; wget ftp://ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/SRR022/SRR022823/SRR022823.fastq.gz &lt;/code&gt;

or if you had the files installed locally, just create soft links to the files. Continue by copying (or typing):

&lt;code&gt; cd ~/NGS/velvet/part1

mkdir SRS004748 

cd SRS004748

pwd

ln -s ~/NGS/Data/SRR022825.fastq.gz . 

ln -s ~/NGS/Data/SRR022823.fastq.gz . 

ls -l

&lt;/code&gt;

 You are ready to process your data with velvet, which is a compressed fastq file. Velvet has two main components:
 velveth -used to construct, from raw read data, a dataset organised in the fashion expected by the second component, velvetg.
 velvetg -the core of velvet where the de Bruijn graph assembly is built and manipulated.
 You can always get further information about the usage of both velvet programs by typing velvetg or velveth in your terminal.

Now run velveth for the reads in '''SRR022825.fastq.gz''' and '''SRR022823.fastq.gz''' using the following options:

	- A de Bruijn graph k-mer of 25 

	- An output directory called run_25

&lt;code&gt; velveth run_25 25 -fastq.gz -short SRR022825.fastq.gz SRR022823.fastq.gz &lt;/code&gt;

'''velveth''' talks to itself for a while and ends with some files in the output directory. Move into the output directory '''run_25''' and take a look around at what '''velveth''' had done so far. The UNIX command less allows you to look at output files (press q for quit). Just in case you still need a hint:

&lt;code&gt; cd run_25; 

ls -l;

head Sequences;
&lt;/code&gt;

Now move one directory level up and run velvetg on your output directory, with the commands:

&lt;code&gt; cd ..

time velvetg run_25 &lt;/code&gt;

Move back into your results directory to examine the effects of velvetg:

&lt;code&gt; cd run_25; ls -l; &lt;/code&gt;

FOR YOU: once you run the command above:
*Q1: What extra files do you see in the folder run_25?
*Q2:What do you suppose they might represent?
*Q3: In the Log file in run_25, what is the N50?

 N50 statistic: Broadly, it is the median (not average) of a sorted data set using the length of a set of sequences.
 Usually it is the length of the contig whose length.
 When added to the length of all longer contigs, makes a total greater that half the sum of the lengths of all contigs. 
 Easy, but messy – a more formal definition can be found here:
 	
 http://www.broadinstitute.org/crd/wiki/index.php/N50

Backup the contigs.fa file and calculate the N50 (and the N25,N75) value with the command:

&lt;cpde cp contigs.fa contigs.fa.0 &lt;/code&gt;

YOU now try:

&lt;code gnx -min 100 -nx 25,50,75 contigs.fa &lt;/code&gt;

*Q4. Does the value of N50 agree with the value stored in the Log file?	
*Q5. If not, why do you think this might be?

 In order to improve our results, take a closer look at the standard options of velvetg by typing 'velvetg' without parameters.
 For the moment focus on the two options -cov_cutoff and -exp_cov. 
 Clearly -cov_cutoff will allow you to exclude contigs for which the kmer coverage is low, implying unacceptably poor quality. 
 The -exp_cov switch is used to give velvetg an idea of the coverage to expect. 
 If the expected coverage of any contig is substantially in excess of the suggested expected value,
 maybe this would indicate a repeat. 
 For further details of how to choose the parameters, go to 'Choice of a coverage cutoff': 	
   http://wiki.github.com/dzerbino/velvet/

Briefly, the '''Kmer''' coverage (and much more information) for each contig is stored in the file '''stats.txt''' and can be used with R to visualize the coverage distribution. Take a look at the '''stats.txt''' file, start R, load and visualize the data using the following commands:

&lt;code&gt; R

library(plotrix) 

data &lt;- read.table(&quot;stats.txt&quot;, header=TRUE)

x11()

weighted.hist(data$short1_cov, data$lgth, breaks=0:50)&lt;/code&gt;

A weighted histogram is a better way of visualizing the coverage information, because of noise (lot of very short contigs). You can see an example output below:

[[File:DeNovoVelvet Fig1.JPG|thumb|left|Figure1: weight histogram showing the coverage information]]

After choosing the expected coverage and the coverage cut-off, you can exit R by typing:

&lt;code&gt; q()

n
&lt;/code&gt;

 The weighted histogram suggests to me that the expected coverage is around 14 and that everything below 6 is likely to be noise. 
 Some coverage is also represented at around 20, 30 and greater 50, which might be contamination or repeats (depending on the dataset), but at the moment this should not worry you. 
 To see the improvements, rerun velvetg first with -cov_cutoff 6 and after checking the N50 use only / add -exp_cov 14 to the command line option. 
 Also keep a copy of the contigs file for comparison:

&lt;code&gt; cd ~/NGS/velvet/part1/SRS004748
time velvetg run_25 -cov_cutoff 6
# Make a copy of the run
cp run_25/contigs.fa run_25/contigs.fa.1

time velvetg run_25 -exp_cov 14
cp run_25/contigs.fa run_25/contigs.fa.2

time velvetg run_25 -cov_cutoff 6 -exp_cov 14
cp run_25/contigs.fa run_25/contigs.fa.3
&lt;/code&gt;

* Q6.What is the N50 with no parameter:	
* Q7.What is the N50 with -cov_cutoff 6:	
* Q8.What is the N50 with -exp_cov 14:	
* Q9.What is the N50 with -cov_cutoff 6 -exp_cov 14:	
* Q10Did you notice a variation in the time velvetg took to run? If so, can you explain why that might be?

You were running velvetg with the given '''-exp_cov''' and '''-cov_cutoff''' parameters. Now try to experiment using different cut-offs, expected parameters and also explore other settings (e.g. -max_coverage, -max_branch_length, -unused_reads, -amos_file, -read_trkg or see velvetg help menu).

 In particular, look at the -amos_file parameter which instructs velvetg to create a version of the assembly that can be
 processed and viewed with a program called AMOS Hawkeye. 
 Another  program, called tablet, can also understand and display the AMOS file. 
 For now, we will take a look at tablet.

Run velvetg with just -cov_cutoff 6 but requesting an amos file:

&lt;code&gt; velvetg run_25 -cov_cutoff 6 -amos_file yes &lt;/code&gt;

Now take a swift look at the assembly with tablet:

&lt;code&gt; tablet run_25/velvet_asm.afg &amp; &lt;/code&gt;

velvet_asm.afg being the file velvetg made is response to the inclusion of the -amos_file yes switch. tablet will take quite a bit of memory and you can safely ignore the complaints from tablet. Once the file has loaded, select one of the longer contigs.
Note the lack of Read information and the one dimensional nature of the contig display. Close down tablet when you have seen enough.
Now rerun velvetg adding the additional parameter -exp_cov 7 with no need to save any files as the amos file needs to be changed.
Now rerun velvetg adding the additional parameter -exp_cov 14 with no need to save any files as the AMOS file needs to be changed.

&lt;code&gt; velvetg run_25 -cov_cutoff 6 -exp_cov 14 -amos_file yes &lt;/code&gt;

Again, view the amos file with tablet:

&lt;code&gt; tablet run_25/velvet_asm.afg &amp; &lt;/code&gt;

Select a longish contig as before and explore the display options before close down table.
FOR YOU:
*Q11. Why do you think there was read information only for the second use of tablet?	
*Q12. You may have noticed velvetg took a little longer with -exp_cov 14 on. Does this make sense ?

If you want to explore the behaviour of velvet even further, you could experiment with the following.

Reduce the sequence coverage by only choosing one input file for the assembly e.g. SRR022825.fastq.gz

Increase the sequence coverage by downloading further files from the same ENA sample SRS004748 (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/SRS004748).

FOR YOU: How did the N50 change by 
*Q13. reducing the coverage?	
*Q14. increasing the coverage?

'''Preface''' 

''for Nicole Delaittre''

This book is about the inverse problems that take its roots in medical imaging such as electrical impedance tomography (EIT) and similar imaging methods from geophysics with applications to the oil &amp; gas production industry. The study was motivated by the practical needs of non-destructive and non-intrusive methods for imaging of hidden objects such as internal human/animal organs or Earth's natural resources.

The inverse problems are formulated as the mathematical problems of recovering the coefficients of differential/difference systems of equations from data about their solutions. These problems are opposite in some sense to the forward problems of evaluating functions. The study of the inverse problems is well suited for computer simulations and many classical and current mathematical problems can be restated with ease as inverse problems. 

The techniques of study and solutions of the inverse problems considered in this book allow one to &quot;see inside&quot; the objects using data about the sound waves and electro-magnetic fields observed at the boundary or outside the object.

The following construction plays an important role in studying the graphs properly embedded into surfaces. One considers an embedded into a [[Wikipedia:Surface | surface]] (2D manifold) finite graph w/vertices each w/exactly four neighbors. The union of edges of such graph is equal to a union of closed curves on the surface, called '''geodesics'''. The faces of the graph can be two-colored. 

[[File:Morphedchessboard(1).jpg|thumb|Example of a medial graph on a surface]]

The corresponding graph ''G'' and its dual ''G&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;'' can be obtained by putting vertices in all faces of the same color and connecting two vertices by an edge if the corresponding faces of the [[Wikipedia:Medial graph| medial graph]] ''M(G)'' have a common corner. Note that ''M(G)=M(G&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;)''.

One cam modify the construction accordingly for the case of an embedded graph w/boundary by allowing vertices of the medial graph to have one neighbor.

The following transformations of the geodesics of the medial graph ''M(G)'' are similar to the [[Wikipedia:Reidemeister move | Reidemeister moves]] of the knot theory. They correspond to the ''Y-Δ'' transformations of the graph ''G'' and ''G&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;''.

[[File:Geodesics moves (1).jpg|450px|center |The three moves of geodesics curves]]

The following matrix consists of the distances (the smallest number of jumps across the geodesics or the edge distance in ''M&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;(G)'') between boundary faces of the medial graph below.

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix}
 0 &amp; 1  &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 2 &amp; 1 \\
 1 &amp; 0  &amp; 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 &amp; 3 &amp; 2 \\
 2 &amp; 1  &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 &amp; 3 \\
 3 &amp; 2  &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 \\
 2 &amp; 3  &amp; 2 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 \\
 3 &amp; 4  &amp; 3 &amp; 2 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 2 \\
 2 &amp; 3  &amp; 4 &amp; 3 &amp; 2 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\
 1 &amp; 2  &amp; 3 &amp; 4 &amp; 3 &amp; 2 &amp; 1 &amp; 0
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
[[File:Medial graphs (1).jpg|center|500px |Two examples of boundary isometric medial graphs with 4 and 5 geodesics]]

'''Exercise (*).''' Prove that the distances between boundary faces of an embedded medial graph are invariant under the geodesics moves.

The geodesics of the medial graph form an arrangement of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudoline#Other_types_of_arrangement| pseudo-lines] if 

* none of them intersect itself
* none of them is a closed curve
* no two of them intersect more than once

'''Exercise (***).''' Prove that ''(a)'' one can recover a planar medial graph ''M(G)'', up to the moves, from the distances between its boundary faces, ''(b)'' every planar medial graph ''M(G)'' can be moved into an arrangement of pseudo-lines without changing the distance matrix.

(Hint). Look for the pattern
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix}
k+1 &amp; k \\
k &amp; k+1
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

in the matrix of boundary distances.

The following min-cut max-flow result was formulated w/help of Derek Jerina, a student of REU summer school on inverse problems at the University of Washington.

'''Exercise (**).''' Prove that the ranks of submatrices of the matrix of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator of a planar graph w/natural boundary determine the shortest distances between the boundary faces of its medial graph, and therefore determine the planar graph up to a finite sequence of [[On 2D Inverse Problems/Y-Δ and star-mesh transforms|Y-Δ transformations]].

(Hint.) It follows from the determinant identity in the section [[On 2D Inverse Problems/Special matrices| Special matrices]] that the ranks of the submatrices count the numbers of disjoint paths connecting boundary nodes of the planar graph.

It was proved in [DeV1], [DeV2], [GDV] and [CIM] that if the medial graph of a planar network w/natural boundary is an arrangement of pseudo-lines then the conductivities of its edges are uniquely determined by its Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator and can be found by a layer stripping algorithm.

Let &lt;math&gt;\{a_k\}&lt;/math&gt; be a set of ''n'' positive numbers. The Stieltjes [[Wikipedia: Continued fraction| continued fraction]] is an expression of the form, see [KK] &amp; also [JT],

: &lt;math&gt;\beta_a(z) = a_nz + \cfrac{1}{a_{n-1}z + \cfrac{1}{ \ddots + \cfrac{1}{a_1 z} }}&lt;/math&gt;

or its reciprocal

: &lt;math&gt;\beta^*_a(z) = \frac{1}{\beta_a}.&lt;/math&gt;

The function defines a rational ''n''-to-''1'' map of the right half of the complex plane onto itself, 

: &lt;math&gt;\beta_a,1/\beta_a:\mathbb{C^+}\xrightarrow[]{n\leftrightarrow 1}\mathbb{C^+},&lt;/math&gt;

since

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases}
Re(z_1), Re(z_2) &gt; 0 \implies Re(z_1+z_2) &gt; 0, \\
Re(z) \implies Re(1/z) &gt; 0, \\
Re(z) &gt; 0, a &gt; 0 \implies Re(az) &gt; 0.
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

'''Exercise(***).''' Use the mapping properties of a Stieltjes continued fractions to prove that it's a rational functions w/a zero or a pole at the origin w/simple, symmetric, interlacing zeros and poles lying on the imaginary axes and that the above properties characterize the continued fractions.

'''Exercise(**).''' Prove that the continued fractions have the following representation:
 
: &lt;math&gt;\beta_a(z) = z(\xi_{\infty} + \sum_k\frac{\xi_k}{z^2+\theta_k^2}),
&lt;/math&gt;

where

: &lt;math&gt;
\xi_{\infty}, \xi_k \mbox{ and } \theta_k, k\in\mathbb{N}
&lt;/math&gt;

are non-negative real numbers and the converse of the statement is true.

The function &lt;math&gt;\beta_a&lt;/math&gt; is determined by the pre-image set &lt;math&gt;\Mu=\{\mu_k\}&lt;/math&gt; (of size ''n'', counting multiplicities) of the point {''z = 1''}, since

: &lt;math&gt;
\beta_a(z) = \frac{p(z^2)}{zq(z^2)}=1 \iff p(z^2)-zq(z^2) = 0,
&lt;/math&gt;

and a complex polynomial is determined by its roots up to a multiplicative constant by the ''fundamental theorem of algebra''.

Let &lt;math&gt;\sigma_l&lt;/math&gt; be the elementary symmetric functions of the set &lt;math&gt;\Mu&lt;/math&gt;. That is,
:&lt;math&gt;
\prod_k (z-\mu_k) = \sum_k \sigma_{n-k} z^k.
&lt;/math&gt;

Then, the coefficients &lt;math&gt;a_k&lt;/math&gt; of the continued fraction are the pivots in the [[Wikipedia:Gauss-Jordan elimination| Gauss-Jordan elimination]] algorithm of the following ''n'' by ''n'' square [[Wikipedia:Hurwitz matrix|Hurwitz matrix]]:

:&lt;math&gt; H_\Mu = \begin{pmatrix}
\sigma_1 &amp; \sigma_3 &amp; \sigma_5 &amp; \sigma_7 &amp; \ldots &amp; 0\\
1 &amp; \sigma_2 &amp; \sigma_4 &amp; \sigma_6&amp; \ldots &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; \sigma_1 &amp; \sigma_3 &amp; \sigma_5&amp; \ldots &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; \sigma_2 &amp; \sigma_4&amp; \ldots &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; \sigma_1 &amp; \sigma_3&amp; \ldots &amp; 0\\
\vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots&amp; \ddots&amp; \vdots\\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0&amp; \ldots&amp; \sigma_n\\
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
and, therefore, can be expressed as the ratios of monomials of the determinants of the blocks of &lt;math&gt;\Mu&lt;/math&gt;. 

'''Exercise (**).''' Prove that 

:&lt;math&gt;
a_1 = 1/ \sigma_1, 

a_2 = \frac{\sigma_1^2}{\det\begin{pmatrix}\sigma_1 &amp; \sigma_3
\\ 1 &amp; \sigma_2
\end{pmatrix}},

a_3 = \frac{\det
\begin{pmatrix}\sigma_1 &amp; \sigma_3 
\\ 1 &amp; \sigma_2 \end{pmatrix}^2}{\sigma_1\det
\begin{pmatrix}\sigma_1 &amp; \sigma_3 &amp; 0 
\\ 1 &amp; \sigma_2 &amp; \sigma_4 
\\ 0 &amp; \sigma_1 &amp; \sigma_3
\end{pmatrix}}, \ldots
&lt;/math&gt;

''' Exercise (*).''' Use the previous exercise to prove that
:&lt;math&gt;
\prod_k a_k = \frac{1}{\prod_k \mu_k} = 1/\sigma_n.
&lt;/math&gt;

'''Exercise (**).''' Let ''A'' be a diagonal matrix with the alternating in sign diagonal entries: 
: &lt;math&gt;
A =
\begin{pmatrix}
 \pm a_1     &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \ldots &amp; 0 \\
 0     &amp; \mp a_2 &amp; 0 &amp; \ldots &amp; 0 \\
 0     &amp; 0 &amp; \ddots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\
 \vdots    &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; -a_{n-1} &amp; 0 \\
 0     &amp; 0  &amp; \ldots &amp; 0 &amp; a_n \\
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

and ''D'' the ''(0,1)''-matrix

:&lt;math&gt;
D =
\begin{pmatrix}
 0     &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; \ldots &amp; 0 \\
 1     &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; \ldots &amp; 0 \\
 0     &amp; 1 &amp; \ddots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\
 \vdots    &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\
 0     &amp; 0  &amp; \ldots &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\
\end{pmatrix}
.
&lt;/math&gt;

Prove that

: &lt;math&gt;
\beta_a(\mu) = 1 \iff \mu \in \sigma(A^{-1}D) = \sigma(DA^{-1}).
&lt;/math&gt;

That is 

: &lt;math&gt;
const(p(z^2)-zq(z^2)) = \rho_{A^{-1}D}(z)=\rho_{DA^{-1}}(z).
&lt;/math&gt;

'''Exercise (*).''' Find the constant in the equation above.

== [[ User:Daviddaved/Summary | Summary ]] ==

: The main object of study of this book is the relationship between local and global properties of two-dimensional manifolds (surfaces) and embedded graphs. The dimension of the unknown parameter fits the dimension of the data of the measurements in several important instances of the inverse problems. Also, two-dimensional setting has an additional structure, due to the duality between harmonic functions on embedded graphs and manifolds and the connection to special matrices. The context of the inverse problems provides a unified point of view on the work of many great mathematicians. Some of the problems simplify significantly in the graph theoretical setting, but their solutions nevertheless convey the main ideas of the solutions for their continuous analogs. These are some of the main motivations for writing this book. Even though there are references to many mathematical areas in this book, it is practically self-contained, and is intended for the use by a wide audience of people interested in the subject.
== [[ User:Daviddaved/Basic definitions and background | Basic definitions and background]] ==

This chapter gives the definitions and the overview of the main mathematical objects that are involved in the inverse problems of our interest. These include the domains of definitions of the functions and operators, the boundary and spectral data and interpolation/extrapolation and restriction techniques.

Let ''a_i'' be a set of ''n'' points in the complex unit disc.
The corresponding '''Blaschke product''' is defined as 

:&lt;math&gt;B(z)=\prod_k\frac{|a_k|}{a_k}(\frac{a_k-z}{1-\overline{a_k}z}).&lt;/math&gt;

If the set of points is finite, the function defines the ''n''-to-''1'' map of the unit disc onto itself, 

:&lt;math&gt;f:\mathbb{D}\xrightarrow[]{n\leftrightarrow 1}\mathbb{D}.&lt;/math&gt;

If the set of points is infinite, the product converges and defines an automorphism of the complex unit disc, given the Blaschke condition 

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_k (1-|a_k|) &lt;\infty.&lt;/math&gt;

The following fact will be useful in our calculations:

Let ''{b&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;}'' be a set of ''n'' points in the complex unit disc ''D''. The corresponding [[Wikipedia:Blaschke product| Blaschke product]] is defined as

Let &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{\Delta(\Omega)} = \{\lambda_k\} &lt;/math&gt; be the set of Dirichlet eigenvalues for the domain &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;. That is, the set of [[Wikipedia:Eigenvalues| eigenvalues]] of the following [[Wikipedia:Dirichlet problem| Dirichlet problem]] for the [[Wikipedia:Laplace operator| Laplace operator]]:

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases}
\Delta u + \lambda u = 0, \\
u|_{\partial \Omega} = 0.
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

Since the system above is self-adjoint, the eigenvalues are positive. Two domains are said to be '''[[isospectral]]''' if they have the same Laplacian eigenvalues. One can then state the inverse problem of describing the equivalence classes of the isospectral relationship, that is the question in the title of this section, see [K], and its discrete analog for networks:

Let

: &lt;math&gt;L(G)=\begin{pmatrix} A &amp; B \\ B^T &amp; C \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

be the '''[[Wikipedia:Kirchhoff matrix| Kirchhoff matrix]]''' of a network ''G'' w/boundary w/''N'' interior vertices. The submatrix ''C'' is semi-positive definite and, therefore, has the singular value decomposition:

: &lt;math&gt;
C = VDV^{-1}=VDV^T=\sum_{k=1}^N\lambda_k v_k v_k^T
&lt;/math&gt;

Then the matrix of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator can be written as

: &lt;math&gt;
\Lambda(G) = A - BC^{-1}B^T = A - (BV)D^{-1}(BV)^T = A - \sum_{k=1}^N \frac{Bv_k (Bv_k)^T}{\lambda_k}.
&lt;/math&gt; 

The matrix ''A'' contains the information about connections bw/boundary nodes of the network ''G'', the diagonal matrix ''D'' has the '''[[Laplacian eigenvalues]]''' of the network ''G'' on its diagonal, and the vectors ''Bv&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' are discrete analogs of normal derivatives of the Laplacian eigenvalues of ''G''. The matrix of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator is, therefore, completely determined by the these vectors and matrices.

'''Exercise (*).''' Prove that the inverse problem with the boundary and spectral data, described above, can be reduced to the inverse problem of Calderon.

The construction in the section [[User:Daviddaved/Printed Version/Two new spectral theorems|&quot;Two   spectral theorems&quot;]] provides a counterexample for uniqueness in an inverse spectral problem.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The following physical model of a vibrating inhomogeneous string (or string w/with beads) by Krein provides mechanical interpretation for the study of [[On 2D Inverse Problems/Stieltjes continued fractions| continued fractions]], see [GK]. The model is one-dimensional, and  it arises as a restriction of ''n''-dimensional inverse problems with rotational symmetry.

The string is represented by a non-decreasing positive mass function ''m(x)'' on a possibly infinite interval ''[0, l]''. The right end of the string is fixed. The ratio of the forced oscillation to an applied periodic force @ the left end of the string is the function of frequency, called coefficient of '''dynamic compliance''' of the string, see [KK] and [I2].

The small vertical vibration of the string is described by the following differential equation:

: &lt;math&gt;
\frac{1}{\rho(x)}\frac{\partial^2 f(x,\lambda)}{\partial x^2}=\lambda f(x, \lambda),
&lt;/math&gt;

where 

: &lt;math&gt;
\rho(x) = \frac{dm}{dx}
&lt;/math&gt;

is the density of the string, possibly including atomic masses. One can express the coefficient in terms of the fundamental solution of the ODE:

: &lt;math&gt;
H(\lambda) = \frac{f'(0,\lambda)}{f(0,\lambda)},
&lt;/math&gt;

where, &lt;math&gt; f(l,\lambda) = 0. &lt;/math&gt;

A fundamental theorem of Krein and Kac, see [KK] &amp; also [I2], essentially states that an analytic function H(&lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;) is the coefficient of dynamic compliance of a string if and only if the function 

: &lt;math&gt;
\beta(\lambda) = \lambda H(-\lambda^2)
&lt;/math&gt;

is an analytic automorphism of the right half-plane ''C&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;'', that is real on the real line. The theorem of Herglotz completely characterizes such functions by the following integral representation:

&lt;math&gt;
\beta(\lambda) = \sigma_{\infty}\lambda + \frac{\sigma_0}{\lambda} + \int_0^{\infty}\frac{\lambda(1+x^2)d\sigma(x)}{\lambda^2+x^2},
&lt;/math&gt;

where,

&lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is a positive [[Wikipedia:Measure (mathematics)| measure]] of bounded variation on the half-line &lt;math&gt;(0,\infty)&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Exercise(**).''' Use the theorem above, Fourier transform and a change of variables to characterize the set of Dirichlet-to-Neumann maps for a unit disc with rotation independent conductivity.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The following inverse problem stated by Calderon has many potential practical applications and had received a lot of attention in the past decades, see [Uh]. This is the problem of recovering the conductivity of a body from its Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator. 

Given a domain with positive measurable function on it, the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator connects the Dirichlet and Neumann boundary values of &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt;-harmonic functions in &lt;math&gt;H^1(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt;, defined on the domain. It is a pseudo-differential operator of order ''1''.

: &lt;math&gt;
\Lambda:H^{1/2}(\partial\Omega)\rightarrow H^{-1/2}(\partial\Omega)
&lt;/math&gt;

One can only recover one number (an integral of reciprocal of conductivity) in 1D.
The problem is overdetermined in dimensions higher than ''2''. It was settled in these cases @ [KV] &amp; [SU].

The dimensions of the measurement parameter and the unknown one fit precisely in the case of 2D. It was recently proved that the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map uniquely determines the conductivity in a 2D simply connected bounded domain if the conductivity is in a weighted space including differentiable functions in [N], and if it's measurable and bounded from ''0'' and infinity in [AP].

: &lt;math&gt;
0 &lt; 1/c &lt; \gamma &lt; c &lt; \infty.
&lt;/math&gt;

In the ''2D'' case one can make sense of the operator for '''measurable''' conductivities (vs. differentiable), (see [AP]), using the [[Wikipedia:Hilbert transform| Hilbert transform]], defined later in the book, b/w the boundary values of harmonic functions and their conjugates.

In this book the problem is also stated for the planar electrical networks, that allows a different approach for solution of the inverse problem through discretization technique, that was implemented by Druskin et al. @ Schlumberger-Doll Research, see [BDK] and [BDMV].

==Background==

A cardiac transplant involves the surgical placement of a donor’s healthy heart into the recipient with end-stage heart disease. Some diseases linked with heart transplants are those such as cardiomyopathy and heart failure.&lt;ref&gt; Cardiothoracic Surgery - Patient’s Guide to Heart Transplant Surgery http://www.cts.usc.edu/ht-pg-exercise.html &lt;/ref&gt;  

Heart Transplants are surgeries of life-saving technology which was started as a radical experimental surgery in 1984 which now plays a detrimental role in end-stage heart disease patients.  Since 1984, The St. Vincent’s Hospital of Sydney, The Royal Children’s in Melbourne, Royal Perth Hospital, and The Prince Charles Hospital in Brisbane and The Alfred in Melbourne have offered heart transplant programs.&lt;ref&gt; The international society of heart and lung transplantation guidelines for the care of heart transplant recipients – Long term care of heart transplant recipients. (Aug 6, 2010) http://www.ishlt.org &lt;/ref&gt; 

==Benefits of Exercise==

Exercise can assist post-cardiac transplant recipients by: &lt;ref&gt; Durstine, Larry  J., Moore, Geoffrey E., Painter, Patricia L., Roberts, Scott O., (2009). ACSM’s Exercise Management for Persons with Chronic Diseases and Disabilities. Ed.3. p99-106&lt;/ref&gt;
:* '''Decreased''' blood lactate concentrations at the given work rate
:* '''Improved''' aerobic characteristics of skeletal muscle
:* '''Improved''' endothelial function
:* '''Decreased''' resting heart rate and blood pressure
:* '''Increased''' VO2 peak and VO2 at ventilator threshold 
:* '''Increased''' muscle force production
:* '''Increased''' bone mineral density 
:* '''Prevention''' of steroid-induced muscle wasting and weakness



Cardiac Transplant patients can have decreased results post surgery if:&lt;ref&gt; Durstine, Larry  J., Moore, Geoffrey E., Painter, Patricia L., Roberts, Scott O., (2009). ACSM’s Exercise Management for Persons with Chronic Diseases and Disabilities. Ed.3. p99-106&lt;/ref&gt;
:* Inactivity before surgery
:* Reduced aerobic characteristics of skeletal muscle
:* Decreased skeletal muscle mass and force production
:* Pulmonary diffusion abnormalities
:* Left ventricular dysfunction

==Resistance and Cardiovascular Exercise Guidelines==

Recommended exercise programs are progressive and aimed in:&lt;ref&gt; The international society of heart and lung transplantation guidelines for the care of heart transplant recipients – Long term care of heart transplant recipients. (Aug 6, 2010) http://www.ishlt.org &lt;/ref&gt;
:* improving cardiorespiratory fitness 
:* improve muscle endurance and force production
:* re-establish self efficacy and improve quality of life

===Resistance Training Goals===
:* Low to moderate intensity exercise; 1-2 sets of 10-15reps &lt;ref&gt; Durstine, Larry  J., Moore, Geoffrey E., Painter, Patricia L., Roberts, Scott O., (2009). ACSM’s Exercise Management for Persons with Chronic Diseases and Disabilities. Ed.3. p99-106&lt;/ref&gt;
:* 2-4 days per week &lt;ref&gt; Durstine, Larry  J., Moore, Geoffrey E., Painter, Patricia L., Roberts, Scott O., (2009). ACSM’s Exercise Management for Persons with Chronic Diseases and Disabilities. Ed.3. p99-106&lt;/ref&gt;
:* Arm exercises should not be started until full healing after sternotomy (2 months) &lt;ref&gt; Durstine, Larry  J., Moore, Geoffrey E., Painter, Patricia L., Roberts, Scott O., (2009). ACSM’s Exercise Management for Persons with Chronic Diseases and Disabilities. Ed.3. p99-106&lt;/ref&gt;
:* Within 2 months of surgery; patients should feel increased muscle strength and endurance of the legs; and beginning resistance work on the upper body &lt;ref&gt; Durstine, Larry  J., Moore, Geoffrey E., Painter, Patricia L., Roberts, Scott O., (2009). ACSM’s Exercise Management for Persons with Chronic Diseases and Disabilities. Ed.3. p99-106&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aerobic Training Goals===
:* 15 – 60 minute sessions &lt;ref&gt; Durstine, Larry  J., Moore, Geoffrey E., Painter, Patricia L., Roberts, Scott O., (2009). ACSM’s Exercise Management for Persons with Chronic Diseases and Disabilities. Ed.3. p99-106&lt;/ref&gt;
:* 4 -7 days per week at 40-80% VO2 max &lt;ref&gt; Durstine, Larry  J., Moore, Geoffrey E., Painter, Patricia L., Roberts, Scott O., (2009). ACSM’s Exercise Management for Persons with Chronic Diseases and Disabilities. Ed.3. p99-106&lt;/ref&gt;
:* After 6 months, recipients should have increase cardiovascular fitness and improvements against risk factors such as insulin sensitivity etc. &lt;ref&gt; Durstine, Larry  J., Moore, Geoffrey E., Painter, Patricia L., Roberts, Scott O., (2009). ACSM’s Exercise Management for Persons with Chronic Diseases and Disabilities. Ed.3. p99-106&lt;/ref&gt;

==Considerations and Precautions==
While research has shown the safety of resistance and cardiovascular exercises; professional advice should be taken:&lt;ref&gt; Cardiothoracic Surgery - Patient’s Guide to Heart Transplant Surgery http://www.cts.usc.edu/ht-pg-exercise.html &lt;/ref&gt; 
:* discuss physical activity with your doctor or physiotherapist to determine what may be appropriate 
:* do not exercise or stop immediately if unwell, dizzy, lightheaded, faint, cold sweats, nausea or chest pain 
:* do not begin to exercise if you are having a episode of rejection
:* avoid exercise in extreme temperatures or conditions &lt;ref&gt; The international society of heart and lung transplantation guidelines for the care of heart transplant recipients – Long term care of heart transplant recipients. (Aug 6, 2010) http://www.ishlt.org &lt;/ref&gt;

Ensure to monitor all medications; as it can cause some disruptions to exercise – seek medical advice.

[[File:Autismbrain.jpg|thumb|Autism as it Effects the Brain]]
Autism is a neurological disorder that occurs across a spectrum of impairments and can include behaviours showing difficulties in social interaction and communication. Typical autism behaviours can also result in self-stimulating and aggressive, repetitive behaviours. Autism is generally known as Autism Spectrum Disorder as specific types of Autism may vary across a spectrum and can include Autistic Disorder, Asperger's Disorder and Pervasive Developmental Disorder. There are no known causes for Autism.&lt;ref name=&quot;NINDS&quot;&gt; National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, 2012, http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/autism/detail_autism.htm &lt;/ref&gt;.

Sufferers of Autism face three main areas of difficulty that include: 
* Impairment in social interaction 
* Impairment in communication
* Restricted and repetitive interests, activities and behaviours
Major symptoms of Autism and Autism Spectrum Disorders are self-stimulatory behaviours such as nodding, fidgeting and other agitative behaviours. Literature shows that these self-stimulatory behaviours interfere with further development of social behaviours and learning. There are three main diagnoses for a person with an Autism Spectrum Disorder, being Autistic Disorder, Asperger's Disorder and Pervasive Development Disorder. Diagnoses varies on the symptoms observed, and key development limitations observed, such as delay in social, communication and behavioural development. Other repetitive and agitative behaviours may be observed..&lt;ref name=&quot;NINDS&quot;&gt; National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, 2012, http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/autism/detail_autism.htm &lt;/ref&gt;

== Exercise as Treatment for Autism ==
Whilst Autism is a disorder that can effect an individual's capacity to perform exercise, exercise has been shown to have significant benefits for social interactions, communication skills and repetitive behaviours. Structured aerobic exercise has been proven to provide a major role in controlling self-stimulating behaviours &lt;ref&gt;Watters, A. M., &amp; Watters, W. E. (1980). Decreasing self-stimulatory behavior with physical exercise in a group of autistic boys. Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders, 10, 379–387&lt;/ref&gt;. Exercise in persons with autism has also reduced aggressive behaviours &lt;ref&gt;Allison D.B., Basile V.C., MacDonald R.B. (1991). Brief report: Comparative effects of antecedent exercise and lorazepam on the aggressive behavior of an autistic man. Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders. 21(1), pp. 89-94&lt;/ref&gt;, self-injurious behaviours,unproductive behaviours and has been shown to improve attention span, work performance and on task behaviours.&lt;ref&gt;Bachman, J. E., &amp; Fugua, R. W. (1983). Management of inappropriate behaviors of trainable mentally impaired students using antecedent exercise. Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis, 16, 477–484&lt;/ref&gt;

Exercise is also used as therapy in persons with Autism Spectrum Disorders to help improve motor skills and sensory integration. These therapies improve the proprioceptive system, vestibular system, motor coordination and skill development.

Persons with Autism Spectrum Disorders also have a greater risk of becoming overweight due to their limited motor functioning. Increasing physical activity in persons with Autism reduces the risk over becoming overweight and other associated comorbidities.&lt;ref&gt;Dawson, G., 2012, Sports, Exercise and the Benefits of Physical Activity for Persons with Autism, http://www.autismspeaks.org/science/science-news/sports-exercise-and-benefits-physical-activity-individuals-autism &lt;/ref&gt;. 

=== Exercise Recommendations for Autism ===
Certain exercise can improve proprioception in persons with Autism Spectrum Disorders. Developing coordination through exercise activity can assist proprioception and general coordination. Activities to benefit proprioception include swimming, playing with weights, use of a trampoline and pushing or playing with large objects.

Autism sufferers generally reduce self-stimulating behaviour during low (50-65% Maximum Heart Rate) intensity exercise. This reduces self-stimulating behaviours immediately for up to 90 minutes. 10 - 20 minute low intensity exercise sessions up to 5 times a week are proven to be beneficial. &lt;ref&gt;Schmitz, S, Exercise as a Means to Reduce Sterotypic Behaviours Among Children and Adolescents with Autism, 2012, http://youthsports.rutgers.edu/documents/EXERCISING.pdf &lt;/ref&gt;. Long term benefits from these exercise programs have also been proven.

Exercise therapy recommended also includes activities which stimulate the vestibular system. Whilst each person with autism may have a different reaction to sensory motion, exercises recommended include back and forth movements including trampolining can assist in improving balance and coordination both during exercise and during normal activities &lt;ref&gt;Autism Help, 2012, http://www.autism-help.org/family-physical-exercise-autism.htm&lt;/ref&gt;.

Activities such as swimming and obstacle courses should be prescribed to improve skill development. Obstacle courses with incorporated activities such as skipping, hopscotch and throw and catch can imrove sensory integration and hand eye coordination.

The National Center on Health, Physical Activity and Disabilities &lt;ref name=&quot;NCPAID&quot;&gt;National Center on Health, Physical Activity and Disability, 2012, http://www.ncpad.org/315/1928/Autism~and~Considerations~in~Recreation~and~Physical~Activity~Settings&lt;/ref&gt;
suggests exercise prescription has greatest effect when it is:
* Set up on a consistent routine
* Predictable activity
* Set up with minimal distractions and sensory overload
* Instructed visually not verbally
* Shorter for those with limited concentration
* Safe as individuals may not be aware of risk

=== Limitations and Considerations ===
Considerations to incorporate when prescribing exercise for a person with Autism include: 
Sensory hypoactivity or hyperactivity, which is partly due to the impairment of the sensory cortex, a problem in a large number of individuals who suffer from Autism. This means that exercise programs should incorporate activities that will not distress or alarm the person with Autism. Activities should be prescribed to make the person with Autism feel comfortable at all times.
Communicating exercise prescription to a person with Autism Spectrum Disorder is a further limitation. Visual cues and instructions should be given, to minimise difficulty processing verbal communication. 

Activities should be prescribed as not to overstimulate the Autistic person, as overstimulated can result in increased self-stimulating behaviours and aggressive behaviours.&lt;ref&gt;Elliot*, R. O., Dobbin, A. R., Rose, G. D., &amp; Soper, H. V. (1994). Vigorous, aerobic exercise versus general motor training activities: Effects on maladaptive and
stereotypic behaviors of adults with both autism and mental retardation. Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders, 24, 565–576.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Osteoporosis: The Silent Disease ==
Osteoporosis is a disease that causes a reduction in density and quality of bone matrix. These changes cause large increase in the risk of fractures, there are often no signs of osteoporosis until the first fracture.&lt;ref name=&quot;doman&quot; &gt; &quot;What is Osteoporosis?&quot; Author:iofbonehealth. Retrieved from http:http://www.iofbonehealth.org/what-osteoporosis-0 &lt;/ref&gt;. Osteoporosis is a disease often seen among the elderly. During early adulthood bone matrix is at its most dense, as we age bone matrix is absorbed while new matrix is formed, this is normally an even equation. Unfortunately as we age this equation can become unbalanced leading to a greater pace of bone absorption, this is the cause of osteoporosis.&lt;ref&gt; &quot;Osteoporosis, falls and exercise&quot; Author:Agustín Meléndez-Ortega. Retrieved from http://http://http://link.springer.com.ezproxy1.canberra.edu.au/article/10.1007/s11556-007-0027-9/fulltext.html &lt;/ref&gt;.


Men and women over the age of 60 are at a higher risk of osteoporosis. Osteoporosis is diagnosed through a Bone Mineral Denisty (BMD) test. The most commonly used BMD test is DXA (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry) which can detect changes in bone loss.&lt;ref name=&quot;doman&quot; &gt; &quot;What is Osteoporosis?&quot; Author:iofbonehealth. Retrieved from http:http://www.iofbonehealth.org/what-osteoporosis-0 &lt;/ref&gt;. Osteoporosis is diagnosed against a set of threshold values created by the World Health Organisation (WHO). Osteoporosis is diagnosed when a person’s BMD is equal to or more than 2.5 standard deviations below this value. &lt;ref name=&quot;doman&quot; &gt; &quot;What is Osteoporosis?&quot; Author:iofbonehealth. Retrieved from http:http://www.iofbonehealth.org/what-osteoporosis-0 &lt;/ref&gt;.  
== Connection Between Resistance Training and Osteoporosis ==
[[File:Bone_density_scanner.jpg|left|thumb|150px|Bone density scanner can be used to diagnose osteoporosis]]
Resistance Training has been shown to provide many benefits to athletes although is not of common practice in the older population. Wolff's law states that stress or mechanical loading applied to the bone via the muscle and tendons has a direct effect on bone formation and remodeling. Benefits of resistance training include gains in strength, endurance and maintenance/gains in BMD. These benefits can impact hugely on functionality for the elderly making tasks such as carrying groceries or getting up and down stairs easier to achieve.&lt;ref&gt; &quot;The effects of progressive resistance training on bone density: a review&quot; Author:LAYNE, JENNIFER E.; NELSON, MIRIAM E.. Retrieved from http:http://zh9bf5sp6t.scholar.serialssolutions.com/?sid=google&amp;auinit=JE&amp;aulast=Layne&amp;atitle=The+effects+of+progressive+resistance+training+on+bone+density:+a+review.&amp;id=doi:10.1097/00005768-199901000-00006&amp;title=Medicine+and+science+in+sports+and+exercise&amp;volume=31&amp;issue=1&amp;date=1999&amp;spage=25&amp;issn=0195-9131 &lt;/ref&gt;. 
 

The goal of resistance training in regards to osteoporosis is to maintain or increase BMD and therefore reduce the chance of suffering a fracture. Resistance training has been shown to improve BMD in site specific areas and should therefore be targeted at areas of high fracture risk such as the hips and lumbar spine. Targeted muscle areas should include all major muscle groups of both lower and upper extremities in order to help increase BMD of all major bones. &lt;ref&gt; &quot;Physical approach for prevention and treatment of osteoporosis&quot; Author:Ana Paula Rebucci Lirani-Galvão; Marise Lazaretti-Castro Retrieved from http:http:http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S0004-27302010000200013&amp;script=sci_arttext &lt;/ref&gt;.

== Physical Activity Guidelines to Prevent/Manage Osteoporosis ==
[[File:BCRL.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Bench Press is one example of resistance exercise]]
When prescribing exercise programs for individuals with high risk of fractures such as those suffering from osteoporosis, with particular emphasis on the elderly, there are certain precautions and tests that should be conduced before undertaking exercise in avoid unforeseen calamities.
 
==== Precautions &amp; Safety Concerns ==== 
* Ensure the individual has sought advice from a medical professional and has been cleared to undertake the program.
* Make sure the individual is under the supervision of a trained instructor to ensure proper use and technique of equipment and exercises are taking place.
* Reduce the risk factors of falls associated in physical activity environments such as dim lights, scattered objects and loose carpet or flooring. 
* Depending on the additional needs of the individual in regards to vision and hearing the use of trochanteric pads may need to be arranged.
* Ensure that any medication taken will not effect or cause risk factors when physical activity is undertaken.&lt;ref&gt; &quot;Preventing Falls in the Elderly&quot; Author:K.R. Tremblay Jr, C.E. Barber Retrieved from http:http://www.ext.colostate.edu/pubs/consumer/10242.html &lt;/ref&gt;.

==== Recommended Physical Activity ====
When designing exercise programs for individuals with osteoporosis special attention and awareness of their like hood to suffer fractures needs to be kept in mind. Any resistance training session should start with a warm up and end with a cool down to ensure maximum muscle recovery. Resistance training should be undertaken at a minimum of two sessions per week containing a variety of exercises. Three sets of each exercise should be performed with 8 to 12 repetitions. It is recommended that the individual begins the program starting at 50% of the 1 repetition max with the goal of obtaining  85% of their 1 repetition max through repetitions. In addition to these recommendations the goal of any program should be long term adherence to the program, which will have the greatest benefit overall.&lt;ref&gt; &quot;Exercise recommendations
for osteoporosis&quot; Author:Mark R Forwood, Judy A Larsen Retrieved from http:http://web.archive.org/web/20060820094416/http://anzbms.org.au/resources/policies/osteo_exercise.pdf &lt;/ref&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== What is Metabolic Syndrome? ===
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_Syndrome ''Metabolic Syndrome''] is a cluster of risk factors, a number of which can occur at the same time. These risk factors include, but are not limited to: 
:* Central Obesity or BMI &gt; 30;
:* Increased Triglycerides (&gt;1.7nM);
:* Increased Fasting Plasma Glucose (&gt;5.6nM);
:* Increased Blood Pressure (&gt;130/85 mmHg); and
:* Increased Body Mass Index (&gt;30).
Following the diagnosis of Metabolic Syndrome, treatment may initially involve low intensity exercise therapy as an intervention&lt;sup&gt;[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17332786/?tool=pmcentrez 1]&lt;/sup&gt;, followed by Diet&lt;sup&gt;[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22587821/?tool=pmcentrez 2]&lt;/sup&gt; Pharmacotherapy and potentially Surgery.
=== What about the Prevalence of Metabolic Syndrome? ===
All of the risk factors comprising Metabolic Syndrome have existed for a long period of time, however it has only been recently that world organisations have started to create a succinct definition for what constitutes Metabolic Syndrome and develop prevalence data. The prevalence of individual risk factors varies amongst populations and therefore so to does Metabolic Syndrome. Physical activity levels, population age, diet and genetic structure all influence the prevalence of each risk factor and consequently Metabolic Syndrome. Irrespective of all of these underlying influences, the increased prevalence of Metabolic Disease worldwide has and will lead to negative health outcomes on a large personal, social and financial scale.&lt;sup&gt;[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15158523/?tool=pmcentrez 3]&lt;/sup&gt;
=== What is Short Duration, High Intensity Exercise? ===
For general purposes, High Intensity Exercise can be defined as brief periods of high-intensity exercise intermixed with periods of recovery at a lower intensity, compared to a more conservative approach generally used for exercise prescription that would usually involve Continuos Low-Moderate Intensity Exercise. &lt;sup&gt;[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22587821/?tool=pmcentrez 4]&lt;/sup&gt; This can be quantified as heart rates measuring &gt;90% of recorded heart rate maximum. 
=== What are the benefits of Short Duration, High Intensity Exercise in relation to Metabolic Syndrome? ===
In a world where time is a rare commodity, Short Duration, High Intensity Exercise provides a time effective way to reap the many benefits of exercise. The reasoning behind using High Intensity Exercise in both healthy and clinical populations, is that the segments of high intensity work promote greater adaptations via increased cellular stress and allow untrained individuals to conduct a higher rate of work than would otherwise be possible during Steady State or Low - Moderate Intensity Exercise. This is predominantly due to the short duration and corresponding recovery periods. &lt;sup&gt;[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17332786/?tool=pmcentrez 4]&lt;/sup&gt; Some research indicates that Short Duration, High Intensity exercise may even be superior to Moderate Intensity Exercise&lt;sup&gt;[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15179103//?tool=pmcentrez 5]&lt;/sup&gt;. Some benefits include, but are not limited to:
:* Improved Anthropometrics (&lt;Waist circumference);
:* Decreased Fasting Plasma Glucose;
:* Improved Insulin sensitivity; and
:* Decreased Blood Pressure.

=== Recommendations: How can Short Duration, High Intensity Exercise be used as an Intervention? ===
With appropriate guidance and a structured training plan, High Intensity Exercise can be comprised of a variety training modes both individually and in combination. These include, but are not limited to:
:* Resistance Training;
:* Walking;
:* Running;
:* Swimming; and
:* Cycling.
Once selected, individually or in combination, exercises could be performed, as an example, in a simple format of 4 x 4 Minute intervals at 90% Heart Rate Maximum, followed by periods of 3 Minute recovery at 70% Heart Rate Max&lt;sup&gt;[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18606913/?tool=pmcentrez 6]&lt;/sup&gt;. This presents an opportunity for an exercise session that is of shorter duration and broader variety, which may in turn create greater exercise compliance.
=== Precautions ===
Although current research has shown it is safe and effective to participate in Short Duration, High Intensity Exercise&lt;sup&gt;[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21747296/?tool=pmcentrez 7]&lt;/sup&gt;, the following steps should be considered before participating:
:* Consult your General Practitioner for the most appropriate way to manage Metabolic Syndrome; and
:* Seek guidance from an appropriately qualified practitioner, such as an Exercise Physiologist.
=== Conclusion ===
Whilst it remains controversial which mode of exercise yields the most beneficial adaptations and is the most effective for reducing the impact of Metabolic Syndrome, recent research indicates that Short Duration, High Intensity Exercise reaps many of the same, if not more benefits than Continuous Low-Moderate Exercise.

[[File:CAVE Crayoland.jpg|200px|thumb|left|User in a CAVE. The user's head position is tracked and the graphics on the walls are computed for this tracked position.]]
This tutorial discusses off-axis perspective projection in Unity. It is based on {{Cg Programming Unity SectionRef|Vertex Transformations}}. No shader programming is required since only the view matrix and the projection matrix are changed, which is implemented in JavaScript.

The main application of off-axis perspective projection are virtual reality environments such as the CAVE shown in the photo. Usually, the user's head position is tracked and the perspective projection for each display is computed for a camera at the tracked position such that the user experiences the illusion of looking through a window into a three-dimensional world instead of looking at a flat display.

[[File:Picture_plane_projection.png|200px|thumb|right|Off-axis projection is characterized by a camera position S that is not on the symmetry axis of the view plane.]]
=== Off-Axis vs. On-Axis Perspective Projection ===
On-axis projection refers to camera positions that are on the symmetry axis of the view plane, i.e. the axis through the center of the view plane and orthogonal to it. This case is discussed in {{Cg Programming Unity SectionRef|Vertex Transformations}}.

In virtual reality environments, however, the virtual camera often follows the tracked position of the user's head in order to create parallax effects and thus a more compelling illusion of a three-dimensional world. Since the tracked head position is not limited to the symmetry axis of the view plane, on-axis projection is not sufficient for most virtual reality environments.

Off-axis perspective projection addresses this issue by allowing for arbitrary camera positions. While some low-level graphics APIs (e.g. older versions of OpenGL) supported off-axis projection, they had much better support for on-axis projection since this was the more common case. Similarly, many high-level tools (e.g. Unity) support off-axis projection but provide much better support for on-axis projection, i.e. you can specify any on-axis projection with some mouse clicks but you need to write a script to implement off-axis projection.

=== Computing Off-Axis Perspective Projection ===

Off-axis perspective projection requires a different view matrix and a different projection matrix than on-axis perspective projection. For the computation of the on-axis view matrix, a specified view direction is rotated onto the ''z'' axis as described in {{Cg Programming Unity SectionRef|Vertex Transformations}}. The only difference for an off-axis view matrix is that this “view direction” is computed as the orthogonal direction to the specified view plane, i.e. the surface normal vector of the view plane. 

The off-axis projection matrix has to be changed since the edges of the view plane are no longer symmetric around the intersection point with the (technical) “view direction.”  Thus, the four distances to the edges have to be computed and put into a suitable projection matrix. For details, see the description by Robert Kooima in his publication [http://csc.lsu.edu/~kooima/pdfs/gen-perspective.pdf “Generalized Perspective Projection”]. The next section presents an implementation of this technique in Unity.

=== Camera Script ===
The following script is based on the code in Robert Kooima's publication. There are very few implementation differences. One is that, in Unity, the view plane is more easily specified as a built-in Plane object, which has corners at (±5, 0, ±5) in object coordinates. Furthermore, the original code was written for a right-handed coordinate system while Unity uses a left-handed coordinate system; thus, the result of the cross product has to be multiplied with -1. Another difference is that the rotation of the camera's GameObject and the parameter &lt;code&gt;fieldOfView&lt;/code&gt; are used by Unity for view frustum culling; therefore, the script should set those values to appropriate values. (These values have no meaning for the computation of the matrices.) Unfortunately, this might cause problems if other scripts (namely the script that sets the tracked head position) are also setting the camera rotation. Therefore, this estimation can be deactivated with the variable &lt;code&gt;estimateViewFrustum&lt;/code&gt; (at the risk of incorrect view frustum culling by Unity).

&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
// This script should be attached to a Camera object 
// in Unity. Once a Plane object is specified as the 
// &quot;projectionScreen&quot;, the script computes a suitable
// view and projection matrix for the camera.

         q.SetLookRotation((0.5 * (pb + pc) - pe), vu); 
             // look at center of screen
         camera.transform.rotation = q;

         // set fieldOfView to a conservative estimate 
         // to make frustum tall enough
         if (camera.aspect &gt;= 1.0)
         { 
            camera.fieldOfView = Mathf.Rad2Deg * 
               Mathf.Atan(((pb-pa).magnitude + (pc-pa).magnitude) 
               / va.magnitude);
         }
         else 
         {
             // take the camera aspect into account to 
             // make the frustum wide enough 
             camera.fieldOfView = 
                Mathf.Rad2Deg / camera.aspect *
                Mathf.Atan(((pb-pa).magnitude + (pc-pa).magnitude) 
                / va.magnitude);
         }	
      }
   }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

To use this script, choose '''Create &gt; Javascript''' in the '''Project''' view, double-click the new script to edit it, and copy &amp; paste the code from above into it. Then attach the script to your main camera (drag it from the '''Project''' view over the camera object in the '''Hierarchy''' view). Furthermore, create a Plane object ('''GameObject &gt; Create Other &gt; Plane''' in the main menu) and place it into the virtual scene to define the view plane. Deactivate the '''Mesh Renderer''' of the Plane in the '''Inspector''' to make it invisible (it is only a placeholder), but make sure that the front face of the plane is always facing the camera. Select the camera object and drag the plane object to '''Projection Screen''' in the '''Inspector'''. The script will be active when the game is started. Add the line
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
@script ExecuteInEditMode() 
&lt;/source&gt;
at the top of the code to make the script also run in the editor.

There are a couple of limitations of this implementation in Unity:
*To keep the script simple, it assumes that the front face of the plane (the face that is visible when backface culling is active) is facing the camera. 
*The camera preview in the Scene view doesn't take the changed projection matrix into account and is therefore no longer useful.
*The built-in skybox system also doesn't take the changed projection matrix into account and is therefore also no longer useful. (See {{Cg Programming Unity SectionRef|Skyboxes}} for an alternative way of implementing skyboxes.) 
*There are probably further parts of Unity that ignore the new projection matrix and that therefore are unusable in combination with this script.

=== Summary ===
In this tutorial, we have looked at:
* uses of off-axis perspective projection and differences to on-axis perspective projection
* the computation of view and projection matrices for off-axis perspective projection
* an implementation of this computation and its limitations in Unity

If you want to know more 
* about the on-axis view matrix and the on-axis projection matrix, you should read the description in {{Cg Programming Unity SectionRef|Vertex Transformations}}.
* about the implemented algorithm, you should read Robert Kooima's publication [http://csc.lsu.edu/~kooima/pdfs/gen-perspective.pdf “Generalized Perspective Projection”].

== A customer approach ==
This work is addressed to everyone who asks himself what will be, in the near future, the information needs for the consumer industry. This paper is thus addressed to people working in information technology, marketing, organization or general management. Their interest will be over the whole book and, particularly, in the chapters regarding the general objective and solutions architecture for the industry and retail environment.

This works derives from various personal experiences out of which I chose the two real cases which are presented in the initial chapters: in both cases the real problem was to shift the company information focus from the support of internal processes to the analysis and evaluation of the market scenario in which the companies were acting.

One of the problems I had to cope while doing this job is to be sure to use a methodology which would help me taking into consideration every part of the problem, not forgetting any aspect. 

The method is one of the aims of the book.

From a presentation point of view, I decided to start from the real cases and then get to the abstraction, not vice versa; it seems to me easier to understand. This is the reason why the case studies are quoted initially; they should help the reader to face the more “formal” discussions with an operational attitude, not as just “principia”.

Generally I think that, after the pure automation phase (accounting, MRP etc.), information technology will need to help industries to approach the complete cycle of customer needs. This will mean taking into consideration processes with a very little syntactic content but very common: informational unstructured scenarios. I think that these processes are the one that will give us some better prediction information models and also improve our operational and control tools.

I am sure that his work has plenty of ingenuities, methodological and language mistakes but, as I found no literature on these topics, I decided to use it as a request for help so that we can make a better service to our general “customer”.

'''The company''': this case history is about a middle sized industry in the market of apparel and fashion.

The total business is fairly split between production of fabric and underwear, especially beach wear.

The company was historically a weaving site and the apparel part was created to fill the period of the year when fabric production was low. 

The company was created by a single person, a fairly typical situation, and grew up on such a one-person organizational schema. As time passed and markets changed, this model showed its limits and the whole company was suffering poor sales. Everybody was feeling that something new was needed but there was no clear model to follow or copy. The company was slowly losing all its assets: market as well as culture, including human expertise in management, control and operations.

The market: as you might have guessed the main part of the customers belong to two different categories:

# Other companies buying fabric
# Retailers buying underwear and beachwear.

We are thus talking about two different classes of customers with two different sales channels (direct sales vs. sales agents) and different habits. Geographically the company was selling mainly in Italy with little or no foreign turnaround.

From the “marketing” point of view the two parts had a completely different approach:

# The “fabric” department had very little “brand awareness” as the product was thought for a technical market  where the customers are specialists
# The “underwear” department had a definite need for “brand recognition” as this is a large part of the final sale.

The existing information system: as it often happens the actual IT was the result of many years overlapping without the possibility of a real radical rethinking. This was due to two major reasons:

Any radical reorganization of the IT system would have meant discussing the real essence of the company both in scopes and in structure

The IT manager did not have the organizational strength and will to pursue such a task, a job which would have meant criticizing actual high class managers.

The whole situation was also worsened by the fact that the new line of business (“the underwear”) started as a result of another company acquisition. 

All of these factors lead to the existence of two different systems, almost non compatible and with double costs in terms of maintenance and development; worse of all the existence of two technical worlds created the idea that two different companies were acting and that no synergies were possible.

Control system was also a problem as the two systems used different coding and taxonomy so a third system had to exist to aggregate the final data.

Economical perspectives: the international market context and production methods were driving the company to a slow decline in spite of local situation like crisis of recoveries. The whole business model had to be redesigned and the IT was a problem for this. 

First of all the company needed to understand what was important and what was not; this information  was not in the IT capabilities as the system was the image of the company situation and it could not merge internal information with external signals also because people working in it was too busy in getting it going on the operational side.

'''The turn point''' of the situation came when a new CEO was appointed. He decided to analyze every process to create a more elastic and homogeneous company structure. This decision put the top manager in a very delicate position: he could have been the successful innovator, the visionary leader or the excuse for a failure. Particularly in one-man company (level 2 of the Greiner model) product and direct processes are so deeply tangled that any structure variation is seen as an “offense” to the history of the enterprise and these changes are not considered as rational necessities for the company health. Service processes, and IT especially, are not felt as “communication needs” as this job was done by the founder as a physical person. Obviously we all know that is one of the deepest reasons why that communication model (the one-man company) cannot raise over a certain dimension and therefore cannot gain certain dimensional efficiencies.  

With the help of an advisor the new CEO has looked into the problem of updating the IT system and his first problem was to decide which kind of approach was to use:

'''The content approach''': this is the most common approach and it start from defining the typical parameters connected to:

* Technology situation: both technical and functional (HW, SW, user requests coverage etc.)
* Consultancy situation: both related to the existence of “best practices” in the field and to the presence of players (consultancy firms) available
* Project content: typically you tend to copy the actual requirement schema because it is what users ask for
* Timing: months to years horizons
* Objective: to a have a more flexible and usable platform; an updated environment.

'''The functional approach''': this approach starts from a different point of view: “we want to improve customer service” where “the customer” is both the internal user but mainly the external sales customer as this last one certifies the company in the market. So, for each process, we it was necessary to define:

* The customer: who is he? (both known and potential)
* The service: what does this mean? product, attention, social needs
* The product: what the expectations of the customer (the standard we want) as a function of reliability, availability, fashion alignment.
* Esteem needs: achievement, attention, recognition
* Social needs: belonging, recognized interaction
* How do we define and how do we measure these needs?
* How do we acquire these informations?

The main purpose of this approach is to define some quantitative parameters for a business model with particular attention to the idea of “customer service”.

This second approach was really appreciated also for its “push” attitude on people who had somehow lost what the market really asked for, even though this analysis requires, as an assumption, that a customer knows what he wants, a “mature” approach, and this, by itself, is a statement to be demonstrated.

The first real step was then to figure out what the customer real needs were, differentiating them from what were historically thought them to be or from what were perceived by the various intermediate acting agents. The basic idea was to compare which information were in the IT system and which one were needed to be really customer compliant as to decide which way to invest in the general company information system.

On the external customers, the real steps which followed began with

* Identify “representative customer” by the sale force
* Check whether these customers were really representative of the whole internal market by defining the selection criteria for a sample
* Make an interview to “random customer”, “statistically sample customer” and “representative customers”
* Collect their needs and cross table the results.

The beginning was a disaster, the general attitude was:

Sales people: customers are an asset of “my” division; it is only me who should talk to them

Marketing people: the product is “right”; it is the customer who does not understand it (!).

The CEO skill was to be able to maintain the right direction and get everybody to understand that the company could only grow if it would face the real changing world, avoiding closures and blind behaviors; a formal check is something which is in the nature of improving processes.

As a result of this phase it turned out that the important parameter to be fixed was “time-to-market”: both the fabric and the underwear department could not compete with far-east productions in terms of prices so, assuming that quality was perceived as “sufficient” (therefore a correct positioning on the market) the request was for small production quantities which were to be available quickly.

From the company point of view, this meant:

# A better information system connection
# A better relation system between customer and vendor
# A product industrial design which could allow a quicker response
# A different industrial relation management for customer who need products with a long lead time
# A better forecasting and projection system.

This whole analysis was then enlarged to non-covered channels like e-commerce and direct retail.

'''The solution approach: obliterate or improve'''. This question has been raised so many times by the times of Hammer and Davenport and we know that it has no general answer but it must be correctly posted in the real context. This pragmatic approach must also keep into consideration that the smaller the company the more important is the role of individual physical persons which are themselves “organizational customers” with their background of Maslow needs.

Inside the company the process started requesting each key employee how he felt about the idea of “customer” whether internal or external. We then reversed the question and asked everyone how he felt as being a “customer”, which kind of expectations he had, whether fulfilled or not. In this way we arrived to define a map of “needs”. We then matched these “needs” with their coverage both declared (by the function) and perceived (by the customer).

The difficulties we found, at this stage, were essentially two:

* The capacity of “customer”  and “supplier” to estimate the importance and the coverage of problems; aggressive users tent to impose small problems as important mainly to show that were important people while passive persons would adapt to uneasy situations for the sake of peace
* The difficulty in accepting the idea that, being the company a whole system, the total result is the combination of all parts running well and not just a sum of parts each running at its own speed.

The fact that external consultants were involved helped people to question themselves as well as gave the company an external evaluation of specific professional capability.

In this analysis period the IT group showed its greatest limits as it was trying to support individual needs without having the chance of harmonizing the whole system. Individual requests were pushing into specific directions so the general feeling was that of a waste of time and money. From the outside we can say that it was just a representation of the company situation but to the inside this was the excuse for the falling efficiency.

'''The final choice''': as we said the CEO found himself in the middle of 

* The outside world and the its dynamics
* The needs of the internal operators and especially of the owner.

The way he chose included:

* Making the situation clear to everybody including the owner
* Understanding the stakeholder needs and make them the strategic goals
* Formally analyze the market needs
* Define the organizational model including the operational role and responsibility of the stakeholder
* Getting all the human resources through a processes of upgrading their attitude to “customer service”
* Define the instruments to control both the “service” and economic indicators of each department.

As far as the IT department the choice was:

# Simplify the existing reporting processes as much as possible so that the actual technical infrastructure would last some time allowing the company to concentrate on other projects
# Invest very much on instruments related to “company critical” issues like
* Style research
* Product design and management
* Technical product definition
* Market analysis
* CRM
# Define a strategy to clear out the dependence of the company from a few IT people who actually could not be changed and get the user to accept some minor cut in service level as a function of a clearer general view on the whole system. This part was to support the company up to the change of the system in a medium time period (2–3 years), mainly through a process of data and process definition.

The company:  this case study is about a small-medium sized apparel company retail division. This company, as it often happens, started on the idea of a specific line of products and later approached the retail channel in a naive way.  The retail story began with the need of liquidating the company surplus in a company outlet; this was not enough so the company approached the outlets circuit. At this point it did happen that the product offer was not balanced to make a good service to the customer so the company had the need to work with the stock channel to get rid of what was left over.

By that time the company thought it has developed a culture of “retail” so it made a decision to approach the wholesale market with mono-brand locations and/or shop-in-shop experience in the department stores.

Almost always such a change implies a large item offer so the initial “product” idea spread over a “total look” vision with its corresponding design and production problems.

The company we are talking about moved from an offer of about 150 samples to about 500 pieces thus multiplying by three the whole paperwork.

The retail division had a target of about 50 sales point, searched by a consultant and interiorly designed by a fashion architect.

The market: the company operated in the casual sportswear mainly on jackets. Geographical distribution was worldwide but mainly rich eastern countries and emerging countries, due to the average price of the product. The “ideal” customer belonged to a fairly rich class, he liked sportswear and he was fairly aggressive. The style actually intended to be aggressive enough to be chosen both by young and older people.

The existing retail IT system was originally chosen to support the initial outlet, so its main features were:

* Low cost
* Little and clear functionalities
* One level architecture (shops and main)
* single cash register in a shop
* Written and maintained by a near located, “friend” software house.

Quite a few problems had been solved on a “quick” solution attitude as volumes were small, no general approach.

The whole situation was worsened by the fact that no user came from a structured culture environment so they tent to solve their problems on an unstructured, personal way.

When the whole phenomena grew bigger two very dangerous behaviors came up:

# The stockholder thought: “if it works for four it will work for five etc.”
# The software house used to say: “I am willing to grow up with you: tell me what you want and I will do it.”

The company was really pushing the instrument over its project limits patching it over and over.

The economical situation: mainly due to the international crisis the company was financially overexposed and the shop system was a real weight to the balance sheet: out of a dozen shops existing only two or three were profitable, another two or three run even and the rest were both losing money and creating end-of-season unsold inventory. These numbers also did not take into account hidden costs that the company had to sustain to help the shop system; costs which are difficult to pin out but that are often consistent.  I am talking about time spent by “structure” people like accounting and/or logistics to help the whole system run.

The turn point came when an outside consultancy firm had to investigate the economical situation on behalf of a new possible stakeholder. The problem was not so much the retail policy as a principle but the way it had been implemented. The company culture was industrial and everybody used to think to “customers” as being wholesaler, which means professionals, and not final customers.

Even if a retail manager and a merchandiser existed, real decisions were made by people coming from “product” oriented people so many the whole process was still very “fashion” and “industry”.

'''The functional approach''': to evaluate correctly the job to be done we went through a dimensional analysis of the needs of the retail department customers including all the aspects of “product”; “subjective” and “social” aspects.

For every view we tried to find as many “objective” data as possible trying to avoid preconceptions. This job was guided by an external consultant, a right choice in my opinion, as we thought that no internal resource could be enough professionally detached to guarantee a correct evaluation.

First thing the company did was to separate needs: wholesale and final customers. This meant almost doubling the job but it allowed checking whether the requests of the retail channel (both wholesaler and property shop) matched with the “real” final customer wishes.

Physically the job has been done through check lists compiled by hired personnel both in the case of retailer and of final customers. Actually final customers were divided into two major categories: customers contacted in shops (already aware of the brand) and people looking at apparel shop windows (apparel keen but not especially on the brand).

Every interview was then graded according to the expectation of satisfaction both as need and as answer to it. The complete results and the exact form of the questions are not public, what we can derive are the changes the company did in its customer policies.

Question sheet results: as far as final customers are concerned we found that:

* Product - aesthetics and fashion alignment: the product was perceived as “fashion” but “middle low class” and definitely not “high class” as the company thought it was. Competitors were quite different from what the company dreamed they were. Some product categories were “identified” while other were considered “useless”
* Product - reliability: quality was recognized but the price was considered too high
* Product – availability: very low, even if much paper presentation was made on the product, the real possibility to find the item in the shops was low. Part of the problem related also to the fact that the company had decided not to offer on the web a certain number of “flagship” items
* Subjective – recognition: sales people “customer service ” attitude was judged barely sufficient
* Subjective – attention: sales people technical support counseling was perceived as not sufficient and this contributed heavily to the perception of a middle low class brand
* Subjective – empathy: obviously related to individual sales people but, on the average, not very high; the brand was definitely not felt like “friendly”
* Social – belongness: a strong feeling of group belonging was felt
* Social - distinction: fulfillment of this need is low, probably due to inadequate CRM systems.

For retailer the results were:

* Product - aesthetics and fashion alignment: the product was perceived as “average”; the rating was better than the one given by final customers
* Product - reliability: good, little commercial returns and very few items with quality problems
* Product – availability: medium/ low due to poor respect of delivery dates
* Subjective – recognition: quite good, the “retail” customer service was considered very effective
* Subjective – attention: low, customer perceived some sort of company haughtiness
* Subjective – empathy: obviously related to individual agents but, on the average, sufficient
* Social – belongness: no  group feeling existed for retailers
* Social - distinction:  low, probably due to inadequate CRM systems.

'''Company actions''': based on the results we just quoted, the company decided to

* Product offering returned to about 150-200 pieces for wholesaler and a further set of about 100 pieces distributed only in company stores. These last set of garments were essentially variations on existing garments, to simplify the design phase.  The whole set could then cover the “total-look” scenario for the shops and satisfy brand-keen customers.
* Advertising:  this moved into two directions. The first one tried to re-position the brand in a “high class” section via the relations with testimonials and events. The second activity (fashion and newspapers) was addressed only to the countries where a distribution network existed and not everywhere; only one new foreign market was to be pursued each year.
* Company shops: only economical justified shops stayed open, with the new product offering. As far as new openings were concerned the strategy was to create mixed companies with local operators. These new middle-sized shops were addressed mainly on the sales of the well known products (jackets) and there was a one year starting period to reach balance break even, and no more.
* External wholesalers: the company recognized their importance and created a contact and support groups with the idea of improve their brand loyalty.
* Agents: the company cleared that a new attitude was needed: they were to become not only customer-order collector but also product and “prospect customers” proposers. Quite a few agents did not accept and interrupted their business relation with the company; the major criticism was that there was no longer an independent agent role but that we were talking of company show rooms and methods. This was one of the most difficult parts of the whole project.
* Company shops sale personnel: a long process of selection and education is still taking place to reach the correct standard in human relations and technical knowledge.
* Shop customer service: it became the real guideline of the retail division. Every aspect has been re-analyzed: from shop lay-out to packaging to personnel clothing and attitude. Mock customers are evaluating each site randomly and their results are discussed monthly at company level and twice-a-year with shop managers.
* Main IT system: the upgrade on this was very limited and it concerned almost only the quality of basic data regarding customer needs like delivery dates or quality indexes
* Retail IT system: this system has been changed very heavily. The operational part has been upgraded to a new instrument and also, even more important, new CRM systems have been introduced regarding both classical topics, like fidelity cards, and new topics like known and unknown person recognition. The possibility to follow the path inside the shop and on the front windows gave the opportunity to improve internal paths and increment the time passers-by would stop in front of the shop.

Generally speaking the reengineering is still going on but the results, up to now, are very encouraging  in terms of customer service and of sales point balance break even where all the company shops are now correctly placed.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Information systems in the consumer industry}}
Starting from the two real case studies we saw, now we want to analyze, at the highest level, the information needs for the processes of a consumer company. This will help us in defining the whole context of data and procedures to be informationally represented. Once we have done this step we can then match the existing coverage with the actual IT system.

In this work I will specifically speak about clothing industry but the method is valid also for other companies and specially for those where “customer care” is a goal and not only an instrument.

It might happen that the customer is not conscious of his needs but then, I think, we should pursue a “maieutic” process of extraction more than the induction of a new need. In this vision of business, agents and retailers are part of the “extended” enterprise as they transmit the idea of “service”.

The reason why I chose the apparel world is that, among companies which operate on physical goods, most probably is the one which best fits the “service” idea in terms of

* Volume of goods and informations
* Changing ratio for the product
* Low unitary value for the product
* Different ways of approaching the final customers
* Difference between “customer” (retailer) and “consumer” (2 decision levels).

Anyway I tried to be as general as possible and you could think of applying this method even to politics as a “service” industry to people.

 Before getting into the phase of analysis, I would like to consider something we quickly quoted: apparel sales are usually made in shop with the help of an employee. From the point of view of producers the “customer” is the retailer or some people in its organization (e.g. department store) while the “real” market is the end-user.  The employee actually has a very important role in addressing the choice but he is also a fundamental vehicle for the satisfaction of the esteem needs of the “real customer”.

From an information point of view, the employee is a problem as it creates a “human” bias on the sales data (he addresses the sale) and also, sometimes, he forces his opinions into the information system. The same problem exists in the process of selling the garments to the retailers: the agent can be himself a source of information errors.   

 

As my goal is to help defining a model for an information system, to be later translated into technical instruments, I need to define data, states and processes into detail. This is a huge work and I decided to stop at first level; this is not an ERP detail analysis which would be unrealistic. Sometime I go deeper in the analysis when I think that the actual topic has not been fully cleared.

'''Analysis Methodology'''

As analysis practice is not so clear and defined, I tried to use a methodological approach as general as possible using technique of system and process analysis.

Let us define “system” as an ordered set of organized elements all of them aimed at a certain goal. These elements can include physical objects (hardware, software), people, informations, instruments etc.

The representation of a physical system can be made via a dynamic picture (processes) or a static picture (states). A process can be defined as the passage between states (initial and final) of a system; the “state” is the photograph of a system in a steady situation. 

According to the nature of the content, we can divide processes in information-bound (e.g. document handling) and physical object related (service) ones. In the first group the information and physical process coincide. As far as the second case is concerned let us make an example related to the industrial world: we can define the state (space and time location of goods: logistic view) or the changing process (goods transformation: industrial view).

The associated information system, related to the physical one, must define the context, the initial state and the transformation rules (processes).

Here we are interested in defining the abstract model (information model in our case) of the real system (natural of artificial) which we call physical system. The representation has its meaning in the context defined by variables and metrics which relate the variables to physical data. Context is defined by the choice of variables and their physical significance; state by the initial values (inventory etc.) and process by the measurement quantities (inventory movements etc.).

Informations (context meaningful data) are itself object of some form of treatment: we classify information “functions” into retrieval, storage, transmission, transformation and presentation.

Just for the sake of completeness we quote the conceptual problem of “measure” problem in its two faced aspects of the need of a measuring instrument and of the fact that the measuring action could change the measured system.

We need also to remind that we have been talking about “semantic ontologies” (which means that these rules belong to a general schema including variables and metric systems) while we know that in the global information world there are plenty of unstructured semantics with many informations inside but with a high grade of difficulty in using them.

In this work, we are interested in “business processes” which are artificial processes representing functions related to the activity of a business company. These processes, not like natural systems, do not work on deterministic laws where, once you know the initial state and the total input, the total output of the system is pre-determined. We are talking about social systems in different cultural environments and related to unpredictable events so the output, at most, can only be generally forecasted and not galileianly determined. 

In this chapter more than trying to represent the processes in formally correct a usable language (a task for methodologies like UML), I would like to approach the problem of a methodology to be sure that every aspect of an information problem has been taken into consideration; I am looking how to define all the aspects of an industrial general process, a fashion one in our case.

We already saw that to define the information system we need to individuate the values of the variables related both to the state and to the process; in my experience this passes through the analysis of what I call the “information dimensions” where a dimension is an independent set of information data.

From a practical point of view we have to ask ourselves a set of questions about the initial state and about what happens in the system. The questions I asked myself are:

* What: what is the content of the process; which indicators are chosen and measured in the process
* How: how do I collect and treat informations (state), how does the process happen. This dimension includes the problem of the measuring methods, of the change of indicators (e.g. six-sigma method) and of the choice of the representation language for a coherent formalism
* Who: the definition of the actors in the process and their representation in terms of informations
* Where: which are the location of the processes; initial, actual and results places? In a global system these places can be very far away so you have to consider time-shift, different languages (presentation) and culture
* When: the time the process starts (initial state), lives and finishes so that parameters are in the final state (remember that people are components of the system)
* How much: what is the change in the variables; both internal and context variables
* Why: the reason why the process happens: internal laws (initial stability of the system) and external (context need).

Out of all these questions the most peculiar one is certainly “Why” as sometimes it is related to external laws or habits and sometimes it relates to internal reasons of order and efficiency. Again these last considerations show that we are not operating in a “classical” deterministic world.

 The “how much” dimension relates the process to the physical reality (remember we are trying to write some sort of “semantics” of physical processes). We should be able to separate really meaningful variables which actually change during the process assuming that, quite often, the change is only a statistical change and the sample is in the limit of the De Moivre (see example) theorem.

It might happen that some dimension coincides: for example imagine the physical process of an apple falling form a tree. In this case the “what” and the “where” of the process are the same as the process is exactly the fall of the apple; this does not mean that we can confuse

“where” as a geographical context and

“where” as a content of the process.

From the point of view of methodology all the dimensions should be taken into consideration and, in special case, some of them coincide.

As we said, we are talking about systems which are not completely deterministic, like classical physics; space-time homogeneity is to be considered a lucky case and not a general situation. This implies that reversibility of processes is not guaranteed, sometime it is even forbidden; so certain technical instruments (compensation handlers) cannot be given for granted.

''' The company goal: a real problem.'''

We assume that a fashion company goal is to create value via improving the level of the apparel worn in the surrounding world which, by itself, is the target market for the company itself. This gets real through four fundamental processes:

* '''Ability to perceive and categorize customer needs'''
* '''Ability to rationalize and interpreter customer needs'''
* '''Ability to satisfy customer needs'''
* '''Ability to explain its capability in satisfying the needs.'''

The way to solve this major task is the full stream of the industrial project with all its aspects: marketing, sales, production, logistics, and structure.

In the marketing books we can see underlined the meaning of the 4P (product, price, place, promotion) which means getting the right product, at the right price, in the right place at the right moment  and tell this opportunity to the customer.

 From an information point of view, this analysis leaves us with more than one open question, the most important: what does “right” means? How can we measure such a quantity? Someone says that it will be the market response to determine whether or not the choice was “right” but this is an answer  “a posteriori”; what a company needs is a correct, or at least “best guess”, forecast “a priori”.

Customer needs: fundamentals

 Before advancing further I think we should clear out what “customer needs” are.

Psychologist  Abraham Maslow indicated a hierarchy of needs into 5 levels:

Physiological needs (air, water, nourishment, sleep)

Safety (medical insurance, job security, peace)

Social needs (friends, group belonging, give and receive love)

Esteem (self-respect, achievement, recognition, reputation)

Self-actualization (truth, justice, wisdom, meaning)

Once a need is mostly satisfied it no longer motivates and the next higher need takes place.

As far as clothing are concerned 

* The first level is never taken into account
* The second level concerns “utilitarianism” which means the basic role of garments as defense from environment (cold etc.). In the rich society this needs is getting less and less important because of many factors (the heating systems, cars) which modify the relation between human body and environment. This need is still very important into technical clothing (work, sport) where functionality is predominant
* In the third level I would introduce personal feeling (cashmere hand feeling, valentino’s red, leather smell) and the sensation we feel when we fit well
* In the fourth level I think we can fit the social factor of recognition in the act of buying the garment (actual sale moment) or in the belonging to a “group” with its distinctive signs. Some authors tent to underline the first aspect but the actual rise in the internet sales seems to contradict them. Another argument supporting the after-sale group belonging experience is related to the expanding business of counterfeiting which could indicate how much people need to be “brand dependent”
* The fifth point, in my opinion, includes a real shopping experience in which the customer is recognized as an individual and his needs are fulfilled in a mature and respectful way.

Personally I think that the rating of the various needs depend not only on the person himself but also on the context (time, place and mood) which, by itself is not a scientific variable.

  

Customer needs: practice

What we really want to do is zeroing the difference between customer expectations and the perception of the product/service quality of what he has bought; in this case we have satisfied our customer who thinks he has paid the correct price for what he buys.

Referring  to the quality service models via multidimensional hierarchical analysis (Dabholkar) or to gap analysis model (Parasumaran et alt.) and integrating other variables, we must satisfy quality parameters related to:

* Product: actual variables ( aesthetical/design  level, fashion update)
* Product: reliability (quality of components and handwork, company reliability)
* Product: availability where and when it is requested
* Subjectivity: problem solving capability (punctuality, flexibility, quality problems solving)
* Subjectivity: reassurance capability (competence, kindness, credibility)
* Subjectivity : empathy
* Sociality: group belonging
* Sociality: individual recognition.

As we said before, customer satisfaction is a multi-faced operation and we must never forget that the “customer” is “the important person” and not only a “product” accessory, even for the best products. On the other hand, we do not want to “sell dreams” with no product around as, once the sale euphoria passed, we would have an unsatisfied customer and no customer retention in future time.

As far as the “social” part of the company-customer business relation we keep into consideration the difference between “style” and “fashion” (Espinoza  - MIT Media Lab). “Style” is a principal component in group identity so, maybe in a costly way, it can be copied from someone outside the “group”. To keep it difficult for externals to keep updated with the group dynamics, the code must be continuously changed and this give rise to the “fashion” phenomena. Now we understand how “fashion” is something related to the internal of a group while “style” relates to an outside value for the group culture. When a new “style” reaches a critical mass it gets accepted into social culture and some new break point are looked for.

This topic becomes very important when we talk about information systems (in the wide sense) for the social aspect.

Data importance

From a survey we did in a group of generic customers, we found that the relative importance of the various factors in the buying action is

Product: actual variables ( aesthetical/design  level, fashion update)    6,3

Product: availability where and when it is requested    9,0

Product: reliability (quality of components and handwork, company reliability)    7,0

Subjectivity: problem solving capability (punctuality, flexibility, quality problems solving)    7,3

Subjectivity: reassurance capability (competence, kindness, credibility)    7,3

Subjectivity : empathy    6,6

Sociality: group belonging    5,9

Sociality: individual recognition.    6,3

It is important to point out that these values are related to a sample of customers in the field of apparel so its value is significant only in this field.

Methodologies for a solution

Actual methods for solving the customer needs are now essentially two:

# Industry: start from customer  requirements and designing the whole industrial process (design, production, logistic) to fulfill the need
# Trade: choosing globally and offering locally what the retailer thinks is the best solution for the customer need.

These approaches, obviously, have some common aspects but also some special features that we shall discuss later.

Let us now analyze the processes which exist in both methodologies.

== Ability to perceive and categorize customer needs ==

In this process, the system is the environment “company – potential customer” where the customer is the owner, more or less conscious, of his needs. The goal of the process is to share this information with the company.

'''Why''' should we try to perceive the need? The answer lies in an agnostic approach on other people needs. In my opinion a company role is not to believe to be the truth depositary but to be the instrument for maybe extracting and solving customers requests.

'''Who''' acts in the process of need perception? Three kind of people act: who has the need (the customer), who collects the need, who transmits the need.   

Feeling the need, the customer is the person who explicitly raises the request (demand driven) or who owns the hidden need who is to be extracted (supply driven).

We can categorize our customers into:

* Well known customers, person we know via a history of relations (fidelity cards or so); among these customers we care particularly about customers who have shown to be statistically significant in terms of representation of the whole customer set
* Unknown or random customers
* Potential customers: among these we could include people belonging to social groups which we consider target for our product, people looking at shop windows or people coming and not buying anything (prospects).

It is obvious that there are different marketing strategies on the three groups: in the first case we want to keep our customer and increase cross-selling or up-selling. In the second situation we want to make our customers loyal, in the third case we want to reduce entry barriers.

Collecting customer needs: I think we can individuate three kinds of people, the first one is someone whose job is to “feel” the market in its wider sense (society, various environments), sometime they are called “cool hunters” or scouts. The second group is formed by the agents who work together with retailers: their view is wider than the single retailer but is narrower and more precise than the one of the scout. The last group is made by sale executives who are actually in contact with specific customers so they have a clear, definite view of a limited request.

Transmitting the information: it would be easy to say that these people are the same that collects it, but it is not true in my experience. This function is often felt as a secondary job so it is delegated to another person, an assistant, done in the spare time or even worse hidden as felt part of the person assets. This attitude implies a great loss of quality in the information transmitted to the company.

'''What''' is a need, what does a customer looks for. Let us start by classifying this dimension on three values:

* Defined needs: specific requests of a definite object  (raincoat, wind jacket) maybe connected in a new environment (e.g. long gloves for snowboarders)
* Semi-structured requests: more general than the former one, yet not very precise. One possible example could be “something like that jacket but the fur around the hood” or “slightly longer or shorter”. This kind of requests, mainly regarding the product, are often expressed in a sign, non-verbal language so they are very difficult to collect and transmit
* Geographical or context needs: particular colors related to a culture or a “glamour” trend better than an understatement. These are examples of customer needs difficult to receive and use but very rich in informations.

In this dimension we have actually analyzed only product needs, we can use the same detail level also for the other levels of needs (internal esteem, social and self-actualization needs). As far as I know there is no research going on this topic which seems very interesting and largely unknown.

'''Where''': about the place the need occurs. There is definitely a relation between the “where” and the class of needs (defined, semi-structured or context); we can recognize:

* Shops: these are the places where there is an explicit interaction with the customer regarding well structured needs. This is a very important information asset
* Shop windows or shop routings: we are talking about potential customers who do not interact explicitly, this is an important patrimony of informations fairly unstructured and difficult to catch and categorize
* Competitors: we are looking at customer needs through what the competitors are offering; it is like looking at the solution and trying to guess the problem. This becomes important when competitors have access at context we cannot get into, for example far away markets
* General geographical distribution: the most general and also the most difficult situation to analyze; as an example you can think about the fact that there is no accepted taxonomy in the fashion business.

As far as the definition of the collection and storage of data, the problem is now shifting form technology problems to the definition of an accepted semantic of data.

'''How'''. To understand how we can perceive customer needs let us consider how these needs show out. We can think of three kinds of externalization:

* Conscious personal needs like an explicit request to a sale operator
* Unconscious personal needs like taking a garment in my hand, looking at it and putting it back
* Social needs like a new “fashion”.

How do we perceive these needs: for each kind we must think of a way to define the elementary information (the state) so we need

* Instruments for sales support, both real and missed
* Instruments for context analysis
* Instruments for competitors analysis
* Instrument for social trend analysis.

Specially talking about the first process, we must be very careful about the easiness of use and the precision of the instrument as the actual operator sometime works in a “normal” situation and sometime in a changed environment like “sales” or “rush times”. Another topic to be considered is related to the significance of the data we are collecting:

* Does an observed customer behave like an ignorant one?
* The data I am getting are biased by the collection process?

At the moment I think these can be considered smaller problems compared to the fact that now we have no data.

 Last but not least there might be a problem on context bias: if we collect data in a luxury shop we shall have a “luxury” view of the problem, same thing for a low income customer environment. This obviously becomes a problem in inter-class analysis while it is not so bad if the company target is parallel to the sample set.

'''When''' do we collect informations and do we use them?

Using the data schema we just defined, we can say that

* Geographical or context needs have a longer time horizon than the specific product; could be one or two years
*  Semi-structured requests are looking mainly a few months in advance, from one season to another; they seems a slightly shorter “time to market” of what is accepted today
* Defined needs are typically immediate in their nature; the ideal would be to answer as soon as the need arise.

Data collection time is definitely related to the nature and horizon of the need but we can post it, more or less, in the sale period and consider a large period dependence on the level of the signal.

 Usage is again related to the class of need and has a strong period dependence the shorter the horizon is.

'''How many signals''' should I collect and how significant must they be?

This is a three sided problem: a problem of method, a problem of measured content and a problem of reference value.

Let us face the method problem: if a customer exclaims “beautiful” in front of a garment the statistical variance of the variable “beauty” is equal to the value of the variable itself so the information is not very reliable. De Moivre’s theorem tells us that the variance of the sample is related to the variance of the population sample as the reciprocal of the square root of the dimension of the sample. Four people saying “beautiful” are twice more reliable than one customer and begin to be statistically significant.

As far as the content of the variables we want to measure, they have to allow you to create a predictive model so they must be objective oriented. Let us make an example: sales turnaround during full price periods and during sales. If we make this analysis in mono-brand shops this becomes an indicator of price correctness between different categories as the offer stays the same and only the price changes so if the trousers percentage sales increases it means that people thought that trousers were too expensive. If the same statistics was run in a multi-brand wholesaler this could be an indicator of “among-brand” competition.

This last example introduce us to the third problem: the value of a measured variable has to be properly fit in its context. A large fur company made a large error some time ago when its sales rose quite lot in one period. This was due mainly to a large competitor’s problem but the signal was interpreted as a growing trend. The fact was that the company did not take into account the fact that the whole fur-coat market was in a steady/declining situation so the raise was to be explained as temporary phenomena.

This dimension can thus be summarized as the capacity of collecting “good” data on significant variables and fit them in the right context.

'''Methods and instruments''': the collection of data is a very difficult process from an operational point of view. 

* Defined needs, as we said these needs exist only for known customers in well defined places. Almost all sales point have instruments for operational processes (inventory movement, invoices, cash accounting), some of these products also have limited CRM functions mainly for after sale care (fidelity cards, recalls). A few of them also have options for supporting sales planning both a budget point of view and from a space/path analysis. As far as I know there is no common solution for requests and lost sales analysis.
* Semi-structured requests related to occasional or unknown customers. In my opinion this is an uncovered field as no specific instrument is available. I read about one experience of customers wearing RFID bracelets to follow their path inside the sale room but it seems to be abandoned (I would not have liked it). Video analysis for figure recognition, apart from privacy problems, is not yet fully available.
* Geographical or context needs: This is a huge and extremely interesting information problem.  It relates to the capacity of analyzing socially open spaces to get signals of “trends” which might appear. As far as I know there is nothing like this existing at the moment. An interesting approach would take into consideration TV and movie pictures: they are biased by the choice of the costumes director but they can be analyzed more and more, till when the algorithm gives acceptable result.

'''

== Ability to understand, rationalize and interpreter customer needs ==

In this case the context system to be considered is the company and the process goal is to share the data perceived by the marketing department with the design, industrialization, production and logistic departments (industry) or purchase department (retail)  which are the ones who have to propose a company realistic solution.

'''Why''': the existence of this process is related to the need of  converting  general  into company  useful data; we need to translate context events into an internal useful language.

'''Who''': people can be involved in this process both as process and state definition resources. As we shall discuss later (How) methods can be various and this implies that the relative importance of the various actors is quite different. Going back to the various roles, we can point:

* People supplying data are the same collecting them or market search external companies
* People rationalizing customer needs: marketing, product or market managers as this is a very delicate operation which needs high technology competence and market knowledge. Maybe  a better name could be “product/service” analyst.
* People interpreting: in the fashion-product environment they are called “stylists” and they merge context, unstructured, informations with marketing data with a view for a long time horizon.

The relative role of these people is obviously related to the company market positioning: in a luxury company the stylist role is prevalent compared to the same in a large mass market enterprise.

 People using these data are people in the design and supply chain of the company.

'''What'''. As we said customer need is made up of physical objects (the product),subjective aspects (personal esteem) and social requests.

As far as product requests we can divide between “upgrading”, variations on existing themes, and “innovation”  which relate to requests which did not exist or did not have an answer in the former technological context. This last need is the most difficult one to satisfy as it implies the ability to interpreter social sign which could have an impact on future customer desires.

Subjective needs can be divided into “Basic” messages related to the “universal” nature of man, for example ease-of-use, comfort, functionality and “culture related” messages linked to the context the man lives in, for example color choice and matching which are very related to the society the consumer lives in.

Social messages: our aim is to be able to quantify social attention and recognition and social reputation.

At the moment these are very vague parameters.

'''Where'''. As far as the geographical location where the process exists we must keep track of two aspects:

where the process actually takes place, mainly the company main site, and where the process results are used, typically we are talking about the localization of the results. At the moment the most common ways to proceed on the topic include either local analysis and central strategic consolidation or central analysis and local adaption. Unfortunately both solutions tend to have a “time to market” too long and this reduces the competitiveness of the system, we shall get back on this.

'''How'''. As soon as we start talking about analyzing data, so that they become information, the first thought is about data-warehousing, data-mining and, eventually, knowledge management. In reality we are now trying to rationalize and interpret needs and not hidden or explicit correlations. The problem is thus quite bigger and it must include also informations different from what we have in our standard information systems.   From a methodological point of view we can divide analysis into 

* Rational: taxonomies and  abstraction/interpretation methods and instruments. This last group include projections (defined schema and historical data) and previsions (new schemas on historical data)
* Semi-quantitative: analysis of competitors, market semantic analysis
* Irrational or context analysis.

 Usually all methods are taken into consideration as we try to avoid theoretical models which could be not complete or intuition with no relation with reality.

It could be very interesting, at the moment I know of no tries, using heuristic techniques for the solution of interpretation models; I guess model are still not formal enough.

'''''''''When'''.  From the time point of view we must consider two different horizons: the analysis period and the time the results are meaningful. 

As a rule of thumb it is correct that the analysis should be done at the same time of the data collection as it might turn out that some data are incomplete or wrong. 

The validity of the result, for the physical part, is related to the total lead time of the product we are considering while it is not clear how long our analysis is valid when we talk about customer service, it could be interesting analyzing this.

'''How much'''. This dimension is always very difficult to quantify. Let us go back to the Maslow pyramid: how much do I need to satisfy level 2 (product) before moving to level 3 (personal needs) ? We assume that this percentage does not need to be 100% as once the homeostatic equilibrium of the lower level is reached, attention will move to the upper level. The point is: solving the lower at 80% and the upper at 50% (assuming that you succeed in measuring it) is better than 90%-40%?

I think it is a company choice to be made.

Altogether we must estimate the need for

* product in terms of which is our reference market, its dimension, our positioning (the quota) and  how much does our product satisfy the market in terms of price/performance
* personal/social aspects: how important and how much do we satisfy them.

'''Instruments'''. Now that we went through all the dimensions of the process of “Ability to understand, rationalize and interpreter customer needs” we can have a look at the state of art as far as available instruments. We can group them into

* Analytical methods: based on known and recursive data
** Algorithmical and or statistical: at least statistically precise
** Heuristic: model not totally defined
* Contextual methods: using common sensations, even if not measurable and recursive
** Brainstorming
** Top-down or bottom-up methods.
* Individual methods: related to a particular man-environment situation, very often give non-reproducible results, e.g. Zen ispiration.

 As a personal opinion, even though different methods could be seen as provocative to some people (think of a physicist who should use a zen approach), as long as this process gives usable results is should be accepted anyway. Human beings have being using gravity as a force and apples kept falling long before Newton quantified the mathematical model. Man was using heuristic models to create manufacts.  In field of social science maybe we shall never have a Galilean, recursive model  but this does not mean that we must not get better use of data to be informations.

A possible way to satisfy customer needs is to use specific processes. This means designing, industrializing, planning and producing garments which satisfy the need.

The group of customer we address can be various, it might vary from a single person (make to order) to a homogenoeus set of people on which we make some sort of “average” consideration; if I am talking about well-off teen-agers I need to make different evaluations and  reasonings from a middle-age low income group.

== Ability to satisfy the customer need. ==

The context is the system customer-company; the process goal is to satisfy all the requests starting from the fact that we know them. In this case the information system is a support system, not a core topic.

'''Why'''. We think that satisfying the customer will give immediate return and future perpestive to the company.

'''What'''. The expected results of the process include

* Product: an increase in physical appeal, reliability and availability of the product; a better looking, better quality and easier to find product.
* Subjectivity needs: a better customer care and satisfaction
* Social needs: a better customer group recognition and individual attention, the customer perception of the company as “trusted partner”.

Obviously these results need to be measured on customer expectation.

'''Who'''. People involved in customer satisfaction includes

* Product: design, industrialization, production, logistics
* Personal needs: sales, after sales, CRM executives, retail
* Social needs: promotion, brand management, public relations.

'''How'''. This point is about techniques to be used for customer satisfaction.

In the product area we are concerned about the processes quoted as “direct” in the Porter chain value model. This area is surely the most studied in organizational modeling, we can quote various methodologies from BPR to Kaizen. It is surely not the goal of this work  to get into this problem, better authors then me have worked on this and you can refer to them. 

Personel needs: the studies concerning this area, in my opinion, are not as structured as in the former area.  As far as I know individual aspects of this field have been evaluated but in a stand-alone context, not in a complete customer relation view. The topics we are talking about concern

Customer centrality and adaption to the market

Product availability impact on sales

Sale channel competence and friendliness

After sales service impact

Customer relation management

Direct approach importance: the shop relation

Customer social needs are, in my knowledge, not the object of quantitative studies. This might depend on the fact that data collection is very difficult, so we are still at the level of hypothesis and specific experience collection. We are talking about:

“group” creation and belonging: brand nature and the role of promotion

brand management  and group life-cycle

public relations and their results

“personal” service.

'''Where''' does the process take place: I think we can define the place where the customer is the location where the process starts. Obviously the customer can be anywhere in the world so we must take this into account. The rest of the process may then take place 

Product: in the stylist studio, in the technical, industrial, loistic and retail areas depending on the specific subprocess

Subjectivity needs: sales, customer service and retail areas

Social needs: anywhere as customers can be everywhere.

All these areas must be informationally connectable.

'''When'''. As for the geographical aspects also for the time-related variables the sinchronicity is very important; if you are late in a subprocess there is little chance that you will be able to recover afterwards. This is the deep meaning when “time to market” has been chosen as the critical variable in the next future, speeding up every single phase might give you the elasticity to cope with unforecasted events which might have disastreous effects.

The real problem, in my opinion, is to balance the time associated with each subprocess.

Product: the total lead time, from the idea to the availability, in the fashion wholesale world, lasts about 8–9 months; this period is actually deeply questioned by e-commerce and its related attitude.

Subjectivity: we can think of

Pre-sales (contacts, reciprocal knowledge)

Sales

After sales (recal and custom loyalty).

These process mainly happen on a few months horizon, a slightly longer period than the product cycle.

Social needs. The process of creating a “group” is fairly quick, the real problem is keeping the “group” alive through many years. In this process the “customer attention and recognition” can only start once you have created the “group” so it takes even longer.

'''How Much'''. The metric we use is about 

Product: Aestethic, quality, availability, cost and accepted price 

Subjectivity needs: service, reassurance, empathy

Social needs: how much does the “group” means, how much am I recognized inside the “group”.

As far as the “product” indeces there are quantitative data available related to quality (Aql methodology, number of returns), availability (question sheets and lost sales) and price positioning (sales to full price ratio). As far as I know there are no indeces related to aestetichs, maybe only the number of collection presented  items which never got produced.

Speacking about “service indeces” we have to divid “service quality” and “satisfaction index” (Oliver 1997).  The first is related to external indeces and standard measuring techniques (SERVQUAL, SERVPERF) while the second is related to customer perception. The fact that customer gets in the analysis of the index, introduces two further variables related to time (quality has a fairly long horizon, perception short) and space (consumers in different countries and context have different perception of “satisfaction”).

As far as I know there are no quantitative analysis related to “group belonging” or “group recognition”.

'''Instruments'''

The most well known instruments existing today surely cover the areas of product definition  (PDM) and production controlling (ERP); there are good instruments in forecasting, CRM and sales support.

Getting into details and assuming these are my personal opinions:

Product definition: there are good products helping the product definition (style, PLM, model marking, quality control) and they support time-phased georaphy problems via distributed workflows

* Production processes: definitely the best studied and supported area; you can find instruments (ERPs) very well done both on the theoretical foundaments and technical aspects. The only doubts are about their operational easiness and friendliness.
* Distribution instruments: not at the same level as the ERP but on the right way to be there.

Subjectivity needs support instruments:

* Customer relation: some good CRM package is available but it is still a long way to go to be really complete
* After sale support: it is considered the sales minor process so it has not been developed so much
* Retail. Very good in the operational aspects, not so much for the remaining subprocesses.

Customer social needs: available instruments are essentially question papers statistically analysed; there is no automatic data collection.

Talking about information systems I would like to return to a concept which I think very important. As customers are distributed all over the world, particular care must be taken at every level of integration, not just the technical one (Miotto etc.) if we want to avoid dangereous misunderstandings. Information integration is usually underestimated even though it is well known (Davenport) the importance that information technology had in process disintermediation.

  

== Ability to communicate the capacity of satisfying the need ==

The system is the customer-company environment; the process goal is the fact that the customer ( “group of customers”  to be addressed by my “solution”) is aware that a solution to his needs exists.

'''Why'''. We want the customer to be really aware of the existence of a solution of its limits because real customer service is respectful of customer identity and does not mislead facts.

'''What''' do I communicate, what is the content of the process.

* The knowledge of product content: aesthetics, reliability, availability and price/performance
* The fact that it is really that “product” that satisfies his need (whether primitive or induced)
* The context knowledge about expectation satisfaction, something like saying “come with us and you will be all right”
* The “group” belonging and brand identification
* The “group” recognition.

Regarding this last point we must be very careful about privacy issues, to know each person individually means knowing a lot of informations about him and this might not be compliant with local laws and/or create relation problems with the customer as he feels controlled and classified.

'''Who '''is involved in the process. The customer is the “receiving” (destination, output) part of the process and the company is the active (input) part. Obviously when we talk about customer we must keep in mind all the categories we have been talking about (known, unknown, potential) and calibrate methods and politics for each group.

'''Where''' does the process take place. As we noted companies and customers can be anywhere so the process must be geographically distributed. As far as places where the process takes place we can recognize:

Product: media and PR (testimonials etc.)

Subjectivity: direct sales channel (retail), indirect sales channel (wholesaler), other various channels including word of mouth 

Social: media, retail and PRs.

'''How '''we communicate the information.

Product: direct advertising (I show the product and associate it at human sense), indirect advertising (for example technical people explain characteristics, I get attracted by the person and through him I get to the product); comparative advertising.

Subjectivity: service advertising ( we show our customer service level), the level of professionalism and availability of our sales executive, the product context (packaging, advertising campaign), the service context (POP material, shop furniture and look).

Social promotion: social involvement (e.g. Toscani’s photos per Benetton), fashion shows, licensing, media, internet community, sales point formats, sponsoring; everything which helps creating a “group”. For “group recognition” we must think in terms of personal service.

'''When'''. The time factor in communication is quite different for each need:

Product: the timing is related to the availability (shop, internet or other); it is useless and wrong to communicate a capacity which does exist in reality so it is very important to synchronize ability to communicate and satisfaction capacity

Subjectivity main issue is “trust” which is a long asset to create and a quick one to be destroyed; its time scale is even longer than fashion and style as it might get through different stages of the company; usually it is years long

Social issues, in my opinion, are linked to the idea of “styles”; they are linked to “cultural break” and easiness of information exchange has deeply changed the time scale which I would indicate in a two-three years  period.

'''How much''' we need to communicate means defining the quantity of actions related to each former dimension. In the next chapter we shall propose a view where this dimension is actually related to the evaluation of the cost/return I have in each combination of variables. We know that evaluating the cost is feasible, not easy but usually can be done, while evaluating the return is very hard and it is usually done through side indicators like sale increase. I think there is a lot of work to be done in evaluating measurable parameters.

'''Instruments''': we partially quoted them in the “how” paragraph, we are talking about publicity and PRs. As far as I know there are no instruments, now, able to quantify, as an example, the return of the investment of a fashion show in terms of social impact on the knowledge of a “brand”.

 

== Industry: the architecture of the solution ==

To organize what we have been saying up to now, we have to create a schema including, for each process, every possible combination of the information dimensions we have been considering. Some of these combinations might be nonexistent like “sure needs of potential customers”. 

As an example of the operational method we can have tables like this one:

{| class=&quot;prettytable&quot;
|-
|
&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

|
&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

|
&lt;center&gt;Need data collection&lt;/center&gt;

|
&lt;center&gt;Analysis&lt;/center&gt;

|

|-

|
&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

|
&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

|
&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

|
&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

|
&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

|-
|
&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

|
&lt;center&gt;'''''Product'''''&lt;/center&gt;

|
&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

|
&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

|
&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

|
&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

|-
|
&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

|
&lt;center&gt;'''''Subjectivity'''''&lt;/center&gt;

|
&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

|
&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

|
&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

|
&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

|-
|
&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

|
&lt;center&gt;'''''Sociality'''''&lt;/center&gt;

|
&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

|
&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

|
&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

|
&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Imagine the first process of need data collection,  here we can ask ourselves which are the needs 

Of a well known customer

Collected by a sale executive who transmit them

Semi-structured needs

Collected in a shop

With a very clear question

At the beginning of a sale campaign

Which means that we are considering one of all possible combinations of parameters.

Later in the book we shall get check how many are the meaningful combinations (Appendix A).

 In this way we are segmenting the total information problem in “cells” each of which has its own individual analysis of states and processes parameters. 

In this method we are not really taking into consideration the “when” and “why” dimension. The “when” variable is related to the variation of the schema in time: an open issue. The “why” parameter, at the top level, is human related and, in my opinion, has the basic meaning of the actual nature of economical enterprise, but this is also an open issue.

This schema reminds us of the phase-space in statistical mechanics where the cell weight is not even but it is related to the weight the company gives to it in its strategy. As in statistical mechanics the content of the cell is a function of both the initial state and the state variation rule (the process), assuming a first order non explicit time dependence. 

As far as the cost of cell fulfillment we can imagine a curve like this:

Where the cost to satisfy 100% is very high. The growth coefficient depends on the nature of the cell and it should be the result of specific analysis which locate the cell in the total analysis space.

When we talk about the value and the cost of an analysis cell we must not forget the reliability of the data we are using in terms of data collection, methods and people involved. This makes things very difficult when you think of a global solution so most companies, in my opinion have been using two side methods:

* What do other people do ( market driven policies)
* What is it going to happen if  I don’t do this (scare of “not doing”).

The method I propose, not forgetting the associated difficulties, is to break down the problem into specific cells and define local strategies in a wider architecture.

I really think that a complete semantic ontology of all cells, including time and space dependence, is a non realistic result so I propose a local approach using also heuristic techniques.

'''The company strategic plan then becomes'''

* '''Assigning a value to each cell of the “customer needs” phase space'''
* '''Trying to associate a cost to the fulfillment of that cell'''
* '''Maximize the phase space covered with the constraint of the company total resources and define the attitude regarding the cells which are not considered for this moment.'''

From an information system point of view, in practice we need to quantify, for each cell,

The weight it has, related to company strategy

The value of information relative to the cell based on a definite metric system

The cost of getting that information.

The total combination gives the information scenario for the company. 

The time factor shows its importance both in fact that the context keeps changing and also in the fact that no company starts from scratch; usually there is an  information patrimony specially in the areas of product needs satisfaction (sales and production). The critical strategy factor now becomes the ability to choose the best solution for choosing the variation of customer phase space as to reach the best overall coverage.

From a practical point of view we start from the highest level four processes, get down to the individual cells and determine the actual company value, the cost of maintenance  and the cost of upgrading.

''It could be interesting to compare the structure of this analysis with the deployment of software projects. The phases of needs collection and rationalization is very well known in the enterprise software production while it is very little formalized in manufacturing.  On the other end the phase of capability communication is much more developed in the industry context.''

We define “retail” as the set of processes which satisfy the availability need in a customer related space-time context. The difference between this set and the previous one is 

# The subject of the process, the retailer, does not satisfy the need starting from designing and projecting the answer from scratch but he tries to solve the problem choosing the  solution, among those on the market, which he thinks will better fit customer requests (sales methodology)
# The relation between retailer and final customer is much more “direct” than in the industrial case so many “non product” aspects are more important.

We can see the retail process from three different point of view:

# Final customer: form this point of view “retail” is simply the availability  in a “local” form; needs and data collection are the same as for the industrial environment
# Retailer: problems concern both to satisfy customers (purchasing and selling) and to relate to the context
#  Context: this relates to how “retail processes” exist in the society both as time phased phenomena (geography = shops, shopping centers; communication etc.) and structure (fiscal and legal compliances)

From the customer point of view “retail” is a service process centered around the actual sale moment but we must remember that it really consists of before sale, actual sale and after sale (preparation, actuation and conclusion).

'''Process Analysis: the customer point of view'''

We know that, generally speaking, customer needs are:

Product        Aesthetics, reliability, availability

Subjectivity    Problem solving, reassurance, empathy

Sociality    group belonging, individual recognition

And that, for each need, direct processes imply:

* Data collection for all the data levels and views
* Analysis and method rationalization to be more efficient and precise
* Satisfaction given by the fulfillment of the need of the real product or of feeling
* Communication which means the ability to communicate the possibility of satisfaction.

The actual need coverage is through the balancing of these factors.

 From the market point of view, the weight of each parameters corresponds to the positioning of the company in the market share.

In the following table we can see how a group of users has quantified their expectations as a function of the sales channel

== Process analysis: the retailer point of view ==

 From the point of view of a retailer, the definite question is:

“why does a customer comes to me and how can I satisfy him ‘”

Which means “which are the customer needs and why does he feel that I can satisfy them ?”.

In the world of retail the contact is not with a “customer” but with a “specific customer”, this means that subjective and social needs are very much stressed compared to anonymous relations. It happens that shops may live on “local” emotional realities (mono or multibrand wholesalers), some other times they have a more “diffuse” approach (department stores, large distribution). 

The birth of a “sales project”, to satisfy a particular customer need at any level of Maslow scale, then is the result of a sales enterprise which evaluates the market opportunities in terms of the lack of a product in a certain area/time, the availability of structures (shops), a new sales method or the existence of an unexploited sociality.

We start from our daily experience to group elementary processes into categories; this will help us in the functional analysis of the retail system.  Processes are sets of actions which satisfy needs whether these needs concern customers, retailers or the context. We assume that, if a process exists, it must have some meaning otherwise it would not exist any longer. Not every possible process exists or, sometime, we are not aware that it exists.

Our methodology starts from listing the processes and then looking for their value on customer needs; we must be very careful to distinguish between “real” value and “customer perceived” value; customer are only interested, and ready to pay for,  in the second ones while there could be processes (e.g. finance control)   which have no value for the final customer but are very important for the retailer. We shall be using the “perceived value” parameter.

To be completely correct from a methodological point of view we should define each process to the very detail, in fact we adapt to evaluate the cost/effectiveness of a process, this means that the value of a process is a function of 

* The relative importance of the customer need (what I satisfy)
* The perceived value of the solution: the expectation (how much I satisfy it).

In the following tables:

Processes are grouped by areas

Coding is such that

Effect on the process: H = high, M = medium, L = low, blank = not applicable

Grouping level: C = customer, G = group, T = context

Area: P = product, S = subjectivity, C = sociality, O = organization, F = fiscal

== Customer need – process existence relation ==

Let us look at the processes we just quoted (remind that needs belong only to the final customer); to fulfill them we need to operate on three different levels (not to be confused with operating entities):

* Single customer
* Customer group : customers of one specific sale point which means how the local retailer organizes the service
* Context: general aspects of service which means how is the general service defined, how to handle general topics ranging from product presentation to fiscal procedures.

The “retail” system does not consists only of processes related to customer relation but it has to cope with many levels of activities; this is the meaning of the “group” attribute in the former table.

Retail support systems: the information processes.

We speak explicitly of “support” and not of software because,  as you can saw from the process listed, the content is not a pure “data” parameters but if often connects to physical or psychological aspects.

We also saw that final customer  and retailer needs somehow differ both in content and in relative weight. 

From an industry point of view the retailer is “the customer” and this is why we need to understand which are the needs he needs to satisfy and he is willing to pay if satisfied.

We can think of retailer needs general schema as:

What we derive from this table is that “single”, “final” customer needs have been largely disappointed in the industrial attitude; companies tend to focalize on “customer groups” as their ability to solve needs is essentially related to product/social  and not to subjectivity capabilities.

This aspect of the end customer need is mainly covered by the “retail” structure.

To be methodologically correct we should now take into consideration all the 32 cells; out of these only 6 (“customer group”, data collection and analysis) have already been taken into consideration in the industrial analysis. In the following pages we shall group some cells to avoid being too long even though we realize that we make a methodological approximation.

'''''''''Customer processes'''

Personal needs are, by definition, very “personal” so they need a very “local” application of general principles stated by the company. The information content is actually very little formalized: we are moving in a very unexplored field.

'''''Product: data collection, analysis and satisfaction'''''

We are talking about the behavior of a specific customer in a specific sale situation: a very elementary context.

* What: we are looking at the relation between the customer and the garment he is evaluating;
* How: which are the parameters to decide “will the garment fit the customer expectations ?”  or even better: “will the garments satisfy the customer need?”
* Who: the actors involved in the process = the customer and the retailer
* Where does the process take place?  typically a real shop but it could be a virtual one
* When does the concurrence of product/customer occurs ? presence of both customer and product
* How much is the customer need satisfied: this is perhaps the most difficult parameters to measure directly
* Why: this the company strategy.

Assuming that we want to satisfy customer need, I think that the only information instrument which can be used is the sales executive capacity to support requests on product (fashion, quality)  and customer (decision process). Time length and variability of relation, in my opinion, make impossible for a formal information system to be really useful.

Measuring system can only be indirect through a total evaluation of the sale executive.  

'''''Product: communication'''''

The aim of this process is to make the specific customer understand that it is possible to help him in choosing the right product. Assuming that we think that the correct local instruments are sales executive, we want the customer to trust sales executive in their knowledge of product and can help him in determining the product coverage of his needs.

* What: sale executive product competence
* How: must be explicit and customer must recognize it
* Who: the information instrument is the sale executive or, at most, the store manager
* Where: in the sale area, this means physical availability of the vendor
* When: during real and prospect sales
* How much: as far as I know there is actually no formal system of measuring this process, maybe through customer interview
* Why: because it satisfies the customer.

As far as information supports, we must give the actual instrument (the sale executive) the knowledge he needs both on the product he is selling and on competitors so that he can help the customer to judge correctly the answer to his needs.

'''''Subjectivity: data collection, analysis and satisfaction'''''

We are  talking about elementary processes which concern ability to answer, personal assurance and empathy to a particular customer.

* What: as we are discussing of very individual, peculiar data. I think that the signals and the collection method are very difficult to categorize, we could try to classify the results. From a practical point of view we should define the results we want and leave to the sale executive the method to collect the data regarding customer individual feeling etc.
* How:  we could start from classifying (based on our experience) customer approach and check the results of possible general support standards we offer
* Who: people involved are sales executive and store managers (control level)
* Where: every possible customer relation, mainly in sales area
* When: before, during and after the sale
* How much: a possible measure of unit could be store manager evaluation
* Why: because customer must be at ease from a human relation point of view.

Information support: The sale executive must be empathetic with the specific customer so he must fit his way of acting to the actual situation. Information content must then relate to the sociological world of sales and, eventually, to the social and fashion trends.

'''''Subjectivity: communication'''''

* What: we want to communicate that a customer feels at ease in a particular context. It is a very personal phenomena and it is related mainly to the sale executive empathy, to the sale place format and to the brand image.
* How: the most important means I know of are word-of-mouth messaging and architecture design
* Who: mainly the sale executive, also every other company employee
* Where: mainly the shop but also the general social context
* When: it is important to note that both actual sales but also prospect and possible sales are extremely important for this topic
* How much: I think that only customer interviews can be a measuring instrument
* Why: to get returning customers.

This topic is fairly delicate because customer expectations can be very different from company policy and very often we saw a large gap between the two approaches.

'''''Sociality: data collection, analysis and satisfaction'''''

* What: the content of this point is about the customer feeling himself recognized and accepted
* How:  the whole process starts from customer receiving and recognition which must be precise. In the case of recognition this can be done through formal instruments (fidelity cards) or informal ones (the sales executive memory). In any case there must be standard procedures for each case.
* Who: this is mainly a sales executive job
* Where:  Typically the sales area; it is an interesting topic to understand what this means in a distributed location (internet)
* When: always, during real or prospect sales
* How much: a possible way of measuring this data could be the number of visit a customer does whether they became a real sale or not
* Why: to create a nicer environment for our customers.

From an information system point of view the first problem is related to customer recognition. Sometimes we can find some sort of “fake” personal recognition (e.g. intimate friendship) which annoys the customer, the real cases I can think of are either related to the high luxury environment, where quite a few customers are well known from social news, or small local retail with a consolidated personal knowledge of the customers. In other contexts we must rely on some personal interactions supported by CRM systems not to loose company knowledge.

'''''Sociality: communication'''''

* What: we are talking about the fact that a customer knows he will be recognized and helped
* How: on this topic we can think of formal communication systems like advertising but my opinion is that the best way is word-of-mouth and group diffusion
* Who: people involved are mainly sales executives and store managers
* Where: the sales place and the logical surroundings
* When: during the whole relation with the customer (pre, actual and after sale)
* How much: a possible indicator could be the number of contacts; both ways and any possible content
* Why: because it helps satisfying the customer.

The information object includes the content (“welcome”),  the form (direct or indirect message) and the destination (actual or prospect customers).

 

== Group processes ==

Customer group needs are those industry relates to. As far as data collection and analysis processes, we can refer to the first part of the book as we are talking about collecting and categorize common customer needs; retail is a different way of solving them.

'''Product – satisfaction.'''

* What: the topic is about product availability  in the whole time cycle including after sales. We should divide the process in purchasing, stocking, shelf availability and after sales. Problems concern offer analysis, purchasing operational, sales space limitation as we assume that bulk storage is not a retail problem; the whole system is the retail industrial chain.
* How: operations through subprocesses of purchasing, exhibition, sales and after sales service.
* Who: people involved includes merchandiser, buyers, sales executive and customer service.
* Where: any site of the company
* When: we can estimate a few months period
* How much: the whole process is so large that I think the only summary indicators we can use is the economical turnaround of the enterprise unit (shop etc.); subprocesses can be individually measured.
* Why: this is seen as the real nature of the retail structure, could not be the only one.

Customer satisfaction is “the process” of a retail system as it has to conjugate market availability and specific customer request. From an information point of view it asks for a huge amount of informations (see appendix B).

'''Product – communication'''

What: we are talking about the process which makes the customer understand that, in that place and at the right moment, he will find the answer to his product needs (group level). We thus deal with an information content.

How: we can use formal systems (commercials, press, window presentation) or informal (word-of-mouth) in large social contexts and personal systems (human relations) in limited environments.

Who: usually we cope with professionals in large scales and sales executive in small environment.

Where: Social contexts mean the whole society, up to world scale, and especially in aggregation area while small environment means essentially shops.

When: product satisfaction is not a one shot process, it needs to be created before and fed also after sale, this means that communication has to be time calibrated.

How much: without any communication product access is essentially stochastic so we can have  a first guess relating amount of communication to sales increase.

Why: because it might be that the customer doesn’t know that we can solve his need.

This whole topic should  be analyzed by itself.

'''Subjectivity  - satisfaction'''

* What: in this group we can identify a few topics. We can identify the role of the sales executive (technical expertise, personal attitude, follow up), customer-context relations (shop image, goods location and availability), customer-company relation (commercial, shop windows). They are all the result of how the company has imagined its relation with the customer.
* How: customer satisfaction can thus be a result of how we support
** Sale executive competence both on product and relation
** Context design and product merchandising
** Space positioning, visual merchandising and commercial.
* Who: persons involved include sales executive and sales structure managers to project the sale process
* Where: both in the shop and in the company studios
* When: a real sale experience does not last a moment, we must create a long lasting customer relation
* How much: I think one of the parameters we should consider is customer retention and find a way to measure it (e.g. fidelity cards)
* Why: we want to satisfy every aspect of our customers.

Informations related to this process are various and need a separate study.

'''Subjectivity – communication'''

What: this topic is about how we can communicate our ability in satisfying customer subjectivity

* How:
** sales executive: after the specific training, we must communicate our employees ability in a formal way to the market (group of customers)
** customer – context: after the design of a comfortable shop environment we must be very strict in assuring that the standard is kept
** customer-company: like before we must underline our ability in individual attention.
* Who:  people involved include sales executive and communicators.
* Where: we must act any place a prospect can be but especially near shops, as to use take advantage of existing structures.
* When: we are not talking of a specific product so there is no definite time zone, it is a continuous job with peaks when no specific product is to be advertised
* How much: I think we could use the number of visiting people in our shops as an indicator
* Why: to cover any aspect of subjectivity need.

The information request set is too large to be analyzed here, further studies are needed.

''' Sociality – satisfaction'''

This process is concerned with smaller groups of customers than those addressed by industry, retail is more “locally” concerned either from a geographical (customer in a certain area) or from a social (customer of a certain type) point of view.

* What: the aim is to create a sense of belonging so that the customer refers to the shop, also maybe not for purchasing
* How: the attachment may be induced either directly (direct marketing) or indirectly (social signs)
* Who: it is usually a PR person working on these topics
* Where: the place is related to the sale method (place or market type)
* When: the time base is fairly long as it implies personal involvement
* How much: a possible parameter to measure such a process could be the number of visit, whether for purchase or not, to the company locations
* Why: it is not so easy to create the “social” concept of the retailer, especially for multi-brand retailers who do not share a company support.

Let get into more details for this area. Our analysis could take into consideration:

Customer reasoning:

What qualifies myself from the context?

How much does belonging to that group cost ?   

Which are the group identities and testimonials?

How can I avoid being considered “standard” and yet belong to the group?

Retailer reasoning

How much does it cost to create the “group”?

How much does it cost to maintain the “group identity”?

How much do I get in terms of new customers or upsales form the “group”?

Generally which is the “group” trade off?

I think we can look at two possible ways of approaching the problem:

Internal: a “group” needs to have times and places it can exists (like happy hours in bars etc.) and archetypes it can recognize, testimonials defining the “group characters”

External: a “group” needs symbols like shopping bags or reserved events.

From an information point of view we can measure

Customer retention both in number and quantity

New customers entries

PR costs.

These data are very difficult to obtain as they are much perturbed by product data, at the moment I do not know of reliable analysis on this topic.

'''Sociality – communication'''

While industry communication is essentially based on product, retail communication underline the idea of service, of problem solving. This idea implies that it is more of an institutional then technical communication.

* What: I want to tell people that my “group” is a “happy community” and you can join it.
* How: the mean is related to the market I am heading, no general rule.
* Who: the person who acts is mainly a PR, the customer receives.
* Where: the main targets are customers and prospects so it has to be evaluated where to spend the money; internet is a world situation
* When: if you act just once it is dangerous: the customer asks himself why of these expenses; the “group” communication has be lasting in time as it connect people and it has to create trustworthiness
* How much: let us divide customers and prospects. Customer are to be steadily reminded, the parameter we could measure is customer retention. Prospects are to be invited, we could neasure new entries as a function of expenses.

The informations we need to control are various and often not explicit : imagine we talk of teen-agers buying clothes. Clothes are not just a way of dressing,  it is also a request for meeting similar. This means that a shop is a meeting point and it has to fulfill this need so that the teen-ager likes to stay in the shopping area. Places where you can only buy, in my opinion, have little chance against the web-offer, on the other hand satisfaction places are more expensive than normal shops.

From an information point of view the problem is thus to quantify the ratio between the capacity of satisfying customer social need and economical balance.

  

== Context processes ==

Context processes group all those operations which have no direct relation with the customer so these processes create no customer perceived value but are necessary for enterprise functioning.

A rough classification could divide them into “fiscal” processes (related to external existing rules and laws) and “organizational” (related to process “best practices” in the business area).

Context process are the one which are best known from an informational point of view as they derive either from formal rules (fiscal) or from repetitive experience (organizational); they are also the best information system supported processes. It is not the aim of this paper to describe more deeply this set of processes; I only would like to point out that, as they create no customer value, they must be considered a pure cost driver and the information system goal should be to satisfy the enterprise need reducing these costs. Typically this goal is achieved using methodologies as standard as possible introduced in the company via education and/or consultancy.

== Retail: the solution architecture ==

As we discussed in the industry part of this paper, in retail also we can create a schema for the set of processes related to the company information strategy. The matrix needs-functions is the retail phase space where each cell has its own cost and value; the complete figure is the company positioning strategy.

Some of these cells need to analyzed at a more specific level (e.g. group-product  satisfaction) ì; we should then sum the subprocesses cost to derive the total cell cost while the value is available only at an upper level.

We can think at the “true value” of the need as the product of the need importance multiplied by the channel expectation for the market we are operating, we find a result like the following table:

Based on this schema,  a retailer, as long has he decided which one is his operating channel, can find the relative value of customer need, his problem is now to decide “how much do I want to invest in satisfying this request”.

As we saw, each of these cell is made of many elementary processes with its own contribution to the final cost; this allows us to derive total cost as the sum of the whole solution.

The information technology goal is both to detail the information content and the analysis of a single subprocesses and to reduce the cost of each of the processes  itself using technology in the right way (where possible).

It is obvious that we start from processes which have the highest customer value so that they have  a quicker return.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Information systems in the consumer industry}}
The aim of this work is look for a schema in the structure of information  processing in a consumer industry. Personally I think we can recognize four types of consumer industry:

Physical goods with industrial origin (apparel, shoes, cars)

Physical goods for personal satisfaction (perfumes)

Services (non material goods) with industrial origin (security)

Services for personal satisfaction (films, bodycare).

Foe each type of industry organizational best practices, KPIs and data collection instruments have been defined but I believe that, up to now, information systems have developed only a local coverage related  to immediate needs or to the existence of a single cell information model. 

Looking at the whole information context it turns out that quite a few cell have information characteristics (timing, number of data, algorithms) that make a complete formal model unfeasible to exist. It turns out more useful to adopt a simplifying  approach and reengineer the process.

Sometimes the general approach is not possible also because it might happen that you are still defining the  elementary process. In particular there are many cells not covered by information models and instruments; most of these situation occurs from historical priorities or from lack of technical instruments.

In my opinion we could derive that

I think that, actually, the whole part related to customer subjectivity and sociality is left to the retailer experience and intuition. This attitude implies that satisfaction indexes are bound to be very inaccurate and inefficient. 

Obviously the relative weight of the various cells is related to the context we are working and, up to now, the “product” cells have been the most important.

In a globalized world were access to product will be eased by technical instruments, other factors will become more and more important so we shall get to analyze them.

We also need to stress that subjectivity and sociality assume a fairly different meaning in the internet world and this aspect is completely unknown at the moment.

Phase space for processes

As an example let us try to define the phase space cell for some general and industrial processes, not considering meaningless cell and taking into consideration the initial state of the processes.

'''Processes – customer group level''': here we can have more “general” (e.g. sale market analysis, purchasing) and more “specific”  topics (e.g. shop emotional paths definition); this might change the level of standardization we can find. Let us consider a fundamental retail need:

Customer group level: product-satisfaction.

In this part we consider the processes regarding availability of the product for the whole time period, including after sale. We can spot the following subprocesses:

* Market offer analysis
* Purchasing
* Stock management
* Sales area availability
* After sale behavior.

Assuming that request analysis (what does the customer group wants) has already been done, we want to use those informations.

'''Market offer analysis'''

In this process we match what the market offers with what our customers want. This process mainly takes place in two different ways:

Catalogue analysis

Physical analysis

''Catalogue analysis''

* What: we want to find, in the market we have access (first constraint), the product which best gets near to our objective in terms of
** Nature (clothing type and category)
** Technological properties (composition etc.)
** Aesthetical and fashion parameters
** Price range
** Supplier characteristics (reliability etc.)
* How: this process used to be, and partially still is, fulfilled via information channels like technical papers or physical agents
* When: the search is made essentially when a new collection is introduced so there is little time for changing and this creates markets rigidities
* Where: a multibrand retailer has limited possibilities to make real geographical analysis, we are talking of a fairly strict constraint on this point
* Who: the real actor is the buyer, in small entities this corresponds very often to the seller
* How much: with the actual information systems this process is fairly slow, we might think of using, as a measuring parameters, the number of suppliers taken into consideration
* Why: we want to increase the knowledge of the market offer

This is a process in which there are very large possibilities of increasing the information quality, maybe standardizing the offer methodology; the problem seems to be related to multibrand confusion.

Physical analysis

* What: in this process the retailer checks the correspondence  of initial informations and controls certain unavailable data (garment fit, fabric real color)
* How: the process takes place where the physical garment is available (fairs, show rooms)
* When: the time must be compatible with market requests
* Where: as said, in fairs, show rooms or agents information points
* Who: people involved includes buyers and offering companies
* How much: it could be interesting measuring the distance between the catalogue offering and the real offer; we should interview the customers
* Why: to reduce wasted times

The information system support for this process is, in my knowledge, near to zero. The goal could be a historical feedback system for operators.

''Purchasing''

This process begins after product choice and includes operations related to purchase order creation and control. It is a standard industrial process which we only quote quickly without even getting into details like quotation, offer and order confirmation. 

* What: it is the process of defining the characteristics of the supply in terms
** Physical: goods to be delivered, place and date of delivery, delivery context (packing, labeling etc.)
** Non physical: terms of payment, quality standard, information data.
* How: operational aspect of the purchase order (paper, electronic data interchange)
* When: purchase order can be made in various moments: fairs, later back home
* Where: as before it depends on customer/supplier organization
* Who: entities involved include customer, supplier and, sometimes, third parties like agents or credit companies
* How much: process dimension could not be related to the economical amount (think of small boutiques buying many codes and little quantities) but we could think in terms of SKUs
* Why: it is a steady state both from the physical and the information point of view.

From the information systems point of view, this is one of the best known process and there is plenty of knowledge on it.

''Stock management''

In this process, after we have chosen and ordered the garments, we are to keep track of the physical location.

* What: the process is about knowing where the goods are; they could be at the supplier, in transit, in the warehouse or in the sale area
* How: our system must help us in giving the situation both at the moment and in the next future (e.g. passage from transit to warehouse)
* When: the system must be available always and must give response on inventories at any time
* Where: the process must support people anywhere it is needed, both locally (shops, warehouses) and remote (company headquarter)
* Who: there are operational actors (shop executives, warehouse employee) and control people
* How much: it is obvious that precision is a must; sometime fiscal limits are law defined
* Why: sales points are part of a larger system designed for customer satisfaction.

We need an information system which gives you the situation in any part of the customer dedicated world (supplier, logistics, shops); at the moment we are not yet in this situation.

''Sales area availability''

This point is about the way goods are to be shown so that customer probabilities, to find what he is looking for, get higher.

* What: as we know what the inventory is, we need to balance space vs. goods and to define exposition priorities (paths and areas)
* How: the choices we make must match customer needs and quantities taking into consideration that we might have to cope with missing quantities to be filled in the future
* When: the matching process between goods and space is obviously related to goods availability (spaces are generally fixed on the short term) and to customer visit frequency. It is usually considered a two-three weeks period.
* Where: where the sale takes place
* Who: usually it a is a visual merchandiser job, in smaller sales entities it is a senior sale executive job
* How much: department stores have long studied this problem, it is not in the aim of this paper to get into it
* Why: no doubt a good explosion helps the customer in finding what he is looking for.

From an information point of view, data concern customer and product presence (actual and future), customer revisit attitude and product appeal on the local market.

''After sale behavior.''

To satisfy the customer we must also project to implement after sale behaviors. After sale has two main components: returns and follow-up.

Returns

* What: we are essentially dealing with garments with quality standards not as expected
* How: returns are mainly processed via a shop physical hand back and the substitution with another garment or a refund
* How much: timing is mainly law defined and it might last from a few days (unsatisfaction) to months (quality problems)
* Where: the return process usually happens where the sale process took place
* Who: acting people include the customer, the retailer and the garment company
* How much: it is easy to be measured and, obviously, should be as little as possible
* Why: because this process is somehow part of the sale process, it is a side effect

Follow up

* What: this process help us in defining our new sales standards, it should measure the difference between the relation perception at the sale moment and later in time
* How: we must identify customer correspondence between customer expectation and real result
* Where: we have to be able to re-reach our customers where they stay
* Who: this process is available only for trackable customers so we much try to increase this number
* How much: to be statistically significant
* Why: to drive future sales processes

As far as information system is concerned, returns is a typical summary process so it needs operational and control systems while follow-up is also an analytical process.

In this chapter you will learn what a camera is for and what you need to do with it.

==Why A Camera==
The camera is how you move your view in the game.  You will need it to run around with your character, do some nice cut-scenes and add overlay scenes.

'''BLENDER NOTE: For Everyone'''

What is parenting? It basically means that one object will follow another. You can do this by select the to objects you want to parent making sure that the child object (the one you want to follow the other around) is selected first. Then go to the '''Object''' menu at the bottom of the 3D view and go to '''Parent'''&gt;'''Set''' and select '''Object'''. Then confirm this move in the pop-up menu that comes up.}}

First add a camera. Next you can move it to a nice view of the character. Finally you can parent it to the character, making sure the character is the parent. That is one way.

That way will make the camera follow the character no matter what. It will remain firm and will look very un-smooth. You can add a slow parent and this is much preferred for it's ease and nice feel. But you can also use the Camera Actuator:

==Get That Camera Fixed==
Select your camera and add an '''Always''', an '''And''' and a '''Camera''' Actuator. Connect them all. Now fiddle with the settings for the '''Camera''' Actuator. Play the game (by pressing '''P''') and then correct the Camera Actuator until you find a nice setting that fits you. But for ease you can also just use this setting which, generally, works:

Got your camera? Excellent. Now let's add [[Beyond Blender Render/A Destination|A Destination]].

      <comment>/* Hydrophytes */  Aquatic plants transport oxygen; need plenty of light.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">This is about aquaculture plant and symbiotic organisms in hydroculture systems: the focus is horticultural. Aquaponic and aquascaping organisms are covered in this section.

==Hydrophytes==
[[w:Hydrophytes|Hydrophytes]] are aquatic plants. Aquatic plants can transport oxygen throughout its stem, unlike land plants. Hydrophytes need plenty of light, as in their natural environments.

===Semi-aquatic plants===
Semi-aquatic plants are adapted to live with its root system in both submerged and land based environments. Only during this time, when a plant's root system is submerged it is involved in hydroculture. (cranberry and watercress)

==Symbiotic animals==
Animals in aquaponics or aquaculture form a [[w:symbiotic|symbiotic]] relationship with plant-life. Aquatic animals need some light like in their natural environments.

===Freshwater===
[[w:Goldfish|Goldfish]], [[w:Loricariidae|Loricariidae catfish]], [[w:Freshwater mollusc|snails]] and [[w:Freshwater shrimp|shrimp]] eat algae.

===Plant-like animals===
[[w:Coral|Coral]] are a saltwater animal that require high maintenance. There are freshwater and saltwater [[w:sponge|sponge]].

==Aquaponics==

==Aquascaping==
Saltwater aquascaping is for aesthetic reasons.
Coral, sponges and saltwater plants may (possibly) form a symbiotic relationship.

(Aquarium keeping, fishkeeping, other symbiotic animals and aquascaping)

==Aquatic gardening==
garden ponds

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Background ==

Asthma is a chronic respiratory condition which causes a temporary narrowing and constricting of the airways. This airway inflammation is a result of mucus production, muscle tightening, and swollen bronchial membranes in the airways.&lt;ref name=&quot;nine&quot;&gt;Anderson, S.D. and Daviskas, E. (2000). ''The mechanism of exercise-induced asthma is..''. Department of Respiratory Medicine. 106(3). 453-459.&lt;/ref&gt; Factors which induce asthmatic symptoms in patients, called triggers, vary between individuals as does the severity of the condition. 

Exercise-induced asthma (EIA) occurs when asthma symptoms are stimulated by vigorous exercise.&lt;ref name=&quot;nine&quot;/&gt; Exercise itself does not cause asthma, however it is quite often a trigger, and affects about 90% of regular asthma sufferers.&lt;ref name=&quot;ten&quot;&gt;Afrasiabi, R. ''Exercise-Induced Asthma: Sports and Athletes''. Current Clinical Practice. 5. 237-249.&lt;/ref&gt; Most often this activity is aerobic in nature, with certain sports such as long distance running, cycling and cross-country skiing more likely to cause worsened symptoms than others.&lt;ref name=&quot;three&quot;&gt;Fitch, K.D. and Morton, A.R. (1971). ''Specificity of Exercise in Exercise-induced Asthma''. British Medical Journal. 4(5787). 577-581&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;four&quot;&gt;Schnall, R.P and Landua, L.I. (1980). ''Protective effects of repeated short sprints in exercise-induced asthma''. Thorax. 35. 828-832&lt;/ref&gt; 

Spirometry is used to diagnose exercise-induced asthma, and is present when there is a reduction in forced expiratory volume or peak expiratory flow following aerobic activity.&lt;ref name=&quot;olympic&quot;/&gt; As of 2011, approximately 1 in 10 (over 2 million total) Australians suffer from Asthma.&lt;ref name=&quot;five&quot;&gt;Australian Institute of Health and Welfare. (2011). ''Asthma''. Australia. Retrieved from http://www.aihw.gov.au/asthma/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effect on Exercise Participation ==

Whilst it is generally recommended that asthma sufferers avoid potential triggers, having exercise-induced asthma should not stop someone from enjoying the benefits of exercise, or from reaching their exercise goals.

===== Symptoms&lt;ref name=&quot;olympic&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;seven&quot;/&gt; =====
* Generally start 5-20 minutes after beginning exercise, and peak 5-10 minutes after stopping exercise
* Coughing and wheezing
* Excessive phlegm
* Chest pain
* Prolonged shortness of breath
* Elevated and irregular respiratory rate
* Extreme fatigue

===== How Aerobic Activity Induces Asthma Symptoms =====
When at rest, breathing through the nose serves to warm and humidify air before it travels through the airways to the lungs. 
The increased demand for oxygen when exercising results in a switch from breathing through the nose to the mouth. The air from this passageway is therefore a lot colder and drier because it has not been warmed and humidified in the nasal passage. This contrast in the air temperature can lead to asthmatic symptoms due to the increased risk and sensitivity of the bronchial smooth muscle lining the airways to inflammation and contraction.&lt;ref name=&quot;one&quot;&gt;Anderson, S.D. and Holzer, K. (2000). ''Exercise-induced asthma: Is it the right diagnosis in elite athletes?''. Department of Respiratory Medicine. 106(3). 419-428.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;six&quot;&gt;McFadden, E.R. (1987). ''Exercise-Induced Asthma: Assessment of Current Etiologic Concepts''. Asthma and Allergic Disease Center. 91(6). 151-157.&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Refractory Period =====
If symptoms of asthma or of an asthmatic attack occur as a result of exercise, it is often followed by a period of time where the lungs and airways are less likely to respond as strongly. This is referred to as the refractory period, and can last for anywhere up to two hours after the beginning of physical activity. Some exercise-induced asthma sufferers will know their condition well enough that they can use the refractory period as a loophole for participating in aerobic activity without symptoms.&lt;ref name=&quot;two&quot;&gt;Edmunds, A.T., Tooley, M. and Godfrey, S. (1978). ''The refractory period after exercise-induced asthma: its duration and relation to the severity of exercise''. The American Review of Respiratory Disease. 117(2). 247-254.&lt;/ref&gt;

== How to Control Exercise-Induced Asthma==

Treatment of exercise induced asthma with regards to aerobic training should aim to minimise the risk and prevalence of an asthma attack. Medication is often prescribed depending on the severity of the asthma. Bronchodilators used during or before exercise to assist in keeping the airways relaxed and open, or anti-inflammatory medication to reduce the sensitivity of the airways, are commonly used to prevent symptoms during aerobic training.&lt;ref name=&quot;olympic&quot;&gt;Fitch, K.D., Sue-Chu, M., Anderson, S.D., Boulet, L.P., Hancox, R.J., McKenzie, D.C., Backer, V., Rundell, K.W., Alonso, J.M., Kippelen, P., Cummiskey, J.M., Garnier, A. and Ljungqvist, A. (2008). ''Asthma and the elite athlete: Summary of the International Olympic Committee’s Consensus Conference''. Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology. 122(2). 254-260&lt;/ref&gt; Elite athletes need to ensure the legality of the medication they are taking within their National Federation Anti-Doping Agency, as a large portion of pharmaceutical prescriptions can be found on the banned substance list.&lt;ref name=&quot;olympic&quot;/&gt;

===== Management During Exercise =====

Suggested management techniques for participating aerobic activities:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Before Exercise !! During Exercise !! After Exercise
|-
| Avoid potential triggers. Eg. Dust, cold air, cigarette smoke || Have any prescribed medication on-hand and ready to administer if needed. || Light warm down and stretching.
|-
| Warm up appropriately to allow the body to adapt to changes. Greater than 10 minutes can take also take advantage of the refractory period || Cease exercise if symptoms persist. Do not resume exercise until these have subsided || Refer to doctor if any symptoms continue.
|-
| Preventative medication advised by a doctor is common 5-10 minutes before exercise. || Include rest periods throughout the exercise. || Get to know your asthma condition so you know yourself the best way to manage it.
|-
| Consider the training environment. || It is not encouraged to ‘run through’ an asthma attack. || 
|}

== Exercise Recommendations ==

As well as the obvious health benefits of regular aerobic exercise, physical activity is generally considered beneficial for those with asthma;&lt;ref name=&quot;seven&quot;&gt;Orenstein, D.M. (2002). ''Pulmonary problems and management concerns in youth sports''. Pediatric Clinic of North America. 49. 709-721.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Regular aerobic training increases muscular strength and cardiopulmonary endurance, therefore reducing the ventilation rate required for specific tasks. This reduces the strain on the cardiorespiratory system during exercise and decreases the risk of an asthma attack for low intensity exercise.
* Good cardiovascular fitness will allow exercise at a greater intensity before experiencing symptoms.
* Resistance training focusing on strengthening the muscles of the respiratory tract can also help when it comes to aerobic training.

The following is a summary of how asthma can respond to aerobic training with regards to the likelihood of provoking exercise induced asthma symptoms.&lt;ref name=&quot;three&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;four&quot;/&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Higher Risk !! Lower Risk
|-
| Continuous aerobic activity || Lower intensity activites interspersed with regular rest periods or breaks
|-
| Higher intensity endurance activity|| Exercising indoors or in warm environments
|-
| Exercising outdoors where the air is polluted or cold || For example; short distance running or short sprinting, walking, golf, gymnastics 
|-
| For example; long distance running, cycling, cross country skiing, cold-water swimming|| Swimming in heated pools is especially beneficial as the pool environment aids in the warming and humidifying of the air as you breath

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Roots of a hydroponically-grown plant.jpg|250px|right]]
Roots must breathe [[Hydroculture/Aeration|oxygen]]. There is a limit to the amount of dissolved gasses that can be contained in water. [[w:Aquatic plant|Aquatic plant]] roots do not need direct access to oxygen in the water or medium, because these plants are [[w:Aerenchyma|adapted to transport oxygen throughout its physiological system]].

[[File:Rhizosphere.svg|thumb|300px|An illustration of the rhizosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DOI|10.1007/3-540-26609-7_2}}&lt;/ref&gt; A=[[w:Amoeba|Amoeba]] consuming bacteria; BL=Energy limited [[w:bacteria|bacteria]]; BU=Non-energy limited bacteria; RC=Root derived carbon; SR=Sloughed root hair cells; F=Fungal [[w:hyphae|hyphae]]; N=[[w:Nematode|Nematode]] worm]]

==Rhizosphere==

The '''rhizosphere''' is the narrow region around the root that is directly influenced by [[w:root|root]] secretions and associated [[w:microorganism|microorganism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://uwstudentweb.uwyo.edu/T/Twhite/ | title = Microbial Health of the Rhizosphere | accessdate =5 May 2006}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rhizosphere contains many [[w:bacteria|bacteria]] that feed on sloughed-off plant cells, termed ''rhizodeposition'', and the proteins and sugars released by roots. [[w:Protozoa|Protozoa]] and [[w:nematode|nematode]]s that graze on bacteria are also more abundant in the rhizosphere. Thus, much of the nutrient cycling and disease suppression needed by plants occurs immediately adjacent to roots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://soils.usda.gov/sqi/concepts/soil_biology/soil_food_web.html | title = The Soil Food Web | publisher = [[w:United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]]-[[w:NRCS|NRCS]] | accessdate =3 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Secretions and endophytes==
{{see|w:endophyte}}
Plants secrete many compounds into the rhizosphere which serve different functions. [[w:Strigolactone|Strigolactone]], secreted and detected by [[w:mycorhiza|mycorhiza]]l fungi, stimulate the [[w:germination|germination]] of spores and initiate changes in the mycorhiza that allow it to colonize the root. Symbiotic [[w:Nitrogen fixation|Nitrogen-fixing]] bacteria, such as the ''[[w:Rhizobium|Rhizobium]]'' species, detect an unknown compound secreted by the roots of leguminous plants and then produce [[w:nod factor|nod factor]]s which signal to the plant that they are present and will lead to the formation of [[w:root nodule|root nodule]]s, in which the bacterium, sustained by nutrients from the plant, converts nitrogen gas to a form that can be used by the plant. Non-symbiotic (or &quot;free-living&quot;) nitrogen-fixing bacteria may reside in the rhizosphere just outside the roots of certain plants (including many grasses), and similarly &quot;fix&quot; nitrogen gas in the nutrient-rich plant rhizosphere.  Even though these organisms are thought to be only loosely associated with plants they inhabit, they may respond very strongly to the status of the plants. For example, nitrogen-fixing bacteria in the rhizosphere of the [[w:rice plant|rice plant]] exhibit [[w:Diurnality|diurnal]] cycles that mimic plant behavior, and tend to supply more fixed nitrogen during growth stages when the plant exhibits a high demand for nitrogen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Sims GK, Dunigan EP |year=1984 |title=Diurnal and seasonal variations in nitrogenase activity (C2H2 reduction) of rice roots |journal=Soil Biology and Biochemistry |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=15–18 |doi=10.1016/0038-0717(84)90118-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== '''Benefits of moderate aerobic exercise on Amyotrophic lateral Sclerosis''' ==

=== Background ===
Amyotrophic lateral Sclerosis (ALS) also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease is a degenerative disorder of specific nerve cells of the spinal cord, brain stem and the brain itself that affects the upper and lower parts of the body. Amyotrophic lateral Sclerosis is the most common disease in a group of diseases known as Motor Neuron Disease (MND). It is a neurological disease that selectively affects the nerves of the body which are specifically known as motor neurons. Motor neurons are cells that control voluntary muscle action and help us preform everyday actions such as walking, speaking, breathing, swallowing and general movement of the body. Being a neuron muscular disease, once Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis reaches the majority of neurons there is nothing exercise can do as the patient is completely bed ridden through partial or complete paralysation.&lt;ref&gt;Lui, A.J. and Byl, N.N. (2009) A systematic review of the effect of moderate intensity exercise on function and disease progression in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Journal of Neurological Physical Therapy 33, 68-87&lt;/ref&gt;


=== Risk and symptoms of Amyotrophic lateral Sclerosis ===
ALS generally strikes patients of middle age (25 to 55) and is more often found in men than women. In the initial stages of ALS symptoms can be so slight that they are often overlooked. The earliest symptoms are weakness and/or muscle atrophy.Yet this can often be disguised if a person does physical activity as they perceive it as just natural fatigue. Other initial symptoms include muscle fasciculation (twitching), cramping or muscle stiffness and slurred or nasal speech. These symptoms can come in any particular order and will depend on which motor neurons in the body are damaged first. &lt;ref&gt;Lopes de Almeida, J. P., Silvestre, R., Pinto A. C., and de Carvalho, M. (2012) Exercise and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.  Neurological Sciences 33, 9-15.&lt;/ref&gt; As symptoms progress each part of the body beginnings slowing down and eventually reaches a parasitic state. From this stage death is inevitable. In recent years more and more neurologists are stating that “Physical inactivity could expose people with ALS to even greater health risks, and exercise in moderation can bring the benefits of exercise while minimizing the risk of worsening their conditions”. When you look into it, there is no stone cold evidence that exercise can actually do damage to patients yet there is evidence for the benefits.


=== Aerobic exercise benefits for Amyotrophic lateral Sclerosis ===
Exercise is used to improve health, maintain fitness and is important as a means of physical rehabilitation. In relationship to Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, moderate aerobic exercise is vital in two important ways. The first way is for prolonging the symptoms from multiplying and the second is for the prevention of the disease all together. Between the years of 1992 and 2011 five major studies where done suggesting that Aerobic exercise played a major role in prolonging of ALS symptoms and the increased quality of life. These studies are as followed:

* '''1992:''' scientist discovered that short moderate aerobic exercise boosted the levels of neurotrophins in the brain. Neurotrophin are a substance of the brain that protects motor neurons and triggers growth of new motor neurons.
* '''1995:''' studys where done in which rats did moderate running exercise each day for one week. It was found that these rats had doubled levels of BDNF (brain derived neurotrophic factor)&lt;ref&gt; Itoh, H, Ohkuwa, T, Yamamoto, T, Sato, Y, Miyamura, M, and Naoi, M. (1998) Effects of endurance physical training on hydroxyl radical generation in rat tissues, Life Sciences 63, 1921-1929&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''2000:''' researchers found that increase levels of neurotrophin following moderate aerobic exercise actually helped protect the brain in rats from injury or neuron diseases. &lt;ref&gt; Itoh, H, Ohkuwa, T, Yamamoto, T, Sato, Y, Miyamura, M, and Naoi, M. (1998) Effects of endurance physical training on hydroxyl radical generation in rat tissues, Life Sciences 63, 1921-1929&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''2003-2005:''' two groups of rats with ALS were tested. The first group did moderate running exercise over the space of several weeks while the second group did moderate swimming over the same amount of time. Both sets of groups came back with positive results. In the first group it was reported that moderate running actually increased the lifespan of rats with ALS. While in the second group it was found that swimming significantly delayed clinical onset and dropped losses of motor neurons in the spinal cord by almost 50%. &lt;ref&gt;Kirkinezos, I.G, Hernandez, D., Bradley, W.G. and Moraes, C.T (2003) Regular exercise is beneficial to a mouse model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Annals of Neurology 53, 804-807&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''2011:''' researchers found that aerobic exercise not only increased neurotrophins but had the potential to keep the power on in the motor nerves by increasing the amount of oligodendrocytes in the brain and spinal cord. Oligodendrocytes are cells of the brain and spinal cord that supply critical energy to mitochondria keeping the energy flowing in distal axon and nerve terminals. They do this by making up the myelin sheath which extends and speeds up the functioning of the neurons.This meant that symptoms decreased and the quality of life increased. &lt;ref&gt; Nave, K.A. (2010) Myelination and the trophic support of long axons. Nature Reviews Neuroscience 11. 275-283 &lt;/ref&gt;

These tests showed that through moderate aerobic exercise both neurotrophins and Oligodendrocytes are increased or maintained allowing for a decrease in the rate of destruction of motor neurons. This meaning that the onset of the diseases was a lot less severe and allows patients to live longer and healthier lives. It is important to note that aerobic exercise does not reverse the disease but only delays the onset.

=== Moderate aerobic exercise activities suited for Amyotrophic lateral Sclerosis  === 
Moderate aerobic exercise activities are vital when attempting to prolong the onset of ALS, recommeded exercises are:   
* walking
* swimming 
* stationary cycling
It is important that these exercises are all done at 60 to 65% of a persons oxygen output, last no longer than 30 minutes and are partaken at least 3 times a week. This intensity allowed weakened muscles to preform exercise without overworking or damaging them and promotes the increase of protective substances in the brain and spinal cord. By doing this exersice it keeps fast twitch muscles active and oxidates them slowing down the process of atrophy. It also found that patients had significant signs of reduced functional decline and increased post rehabilitation survival. &lt;ref&gt;Neeper, S.A., Goauctemez-Pinilla, F., Choi, J. and cotman, C. (1995) Exercise and neurotrophins. Nature 373, 109&lt;/ref&gt;. While swimming significantly delayed clinical onset and dropped losses of motor neurons in the spinal cord by almost 50%.

=== Further reseach ===
Further research is being done to find out more about the effects of aerobic exercise in ALS patients. Testing still needs to be done on how different intensities may affect the disease and if resistance exercise can play a role. But what we are sure of is that any form of moderate aerobic exercise weather it is swimming, running or cycling can have a positive result rather than no exercise at all. It can increase the neurotrophins and oligodendrocytes in the brain and spinal cord allowing for a reduced functional decline and increased survival rate.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease that affects the central nervous system.&lt;ref name=&quot;Karpatkin&quot; &gt;&quot;Multiple Sclerosis and Exercise - a review of the evidence&quot; Author: H, Karpatkin. International Journal of MS care (2005)vol 7, 36-41&lt;/ref&gt; Recurring episodes of MS can cause scarring in the central nervous system as a result of the breakdown of myelin, the insulating material that covers the nerve fibres. This can result in impairment of motor, sensory and cognitive functions. 

The cause of MS is unknown and there is no known cure. The primary treatment for MS is pharmacological to help control exacerbation of the symptoms associated with the disease.

==Symptoms==
The symptoms of MS are associated with the scarring of the central nervous system. The physical symptoms of MS usually present as a combination of&lt;ref name=&quot;Karpatkin&quot; /&gt;:
:*Visual impairment
:*Loss of coordination and balance
:*Muscle spasms
:*Fatigue
:*Speech impediment

==Barriers to Exercise==
Despite health promoting benefits, many MS patients are often hesitant to participate in physical activity for fear of increasing symptoms or worsening the condition&lt;ref name=&quot;stroud et.al&quot; &gt;&quot;The perceived benefits and barriers to exercise participation in Persons with Multiple Sclerosis&quot; Author: N, Stroud et al. Disability and Rehabilitation Journal. (2009); vol 31(26), pg 2216–2222&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Becker et al&quot; &gt;&quot;What makes it so hard? Barriers to health promotion Experienced by people with Multiple sclerosis and polio&quot; Author: H, Becker et al. . Family and community health Journal. (2003); vol 27(1) pg 75–85&lt;/ref&gt;

MS patients report several reasons for avoiding physical activity including:
:*Fatigue accentuating symptoms following exercise
:*Perceived inability to exercise
:*Perceived lack of physical activity benefits
:*Increased scarring exacerbation

There are only a few symptoms which are shown to present a barrier to physical activity in MS patients, such as:
:*Loss of coordination and balance during exercise resulting in injury
:*Physical impairment

==Benefits of Exercise==
Physical activity has demonstrated many benefits to physical and mental health for sufferers of MS and shown that correct implementation of exercise programmes to be safe for MS patients.&lt;ref name=&quot;Karpatkin&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;petaja&quot; &gt;&quot;Recommendations for Physical Activity in Patients with Multiple sclerosis&quot; Author: J, Petaja. Sports Medicine Journal. (1999);  27(3)&lt;/ref&gt; Exercise has been shown to have physical health benefits such as:
:*Reduce MS symptoms severity and prevalence
:*Slow degeneration of MS
:*Improve muscular strength
:*Improve balance and coordination
:*Reduce feelings of fatigue
:*Reduce other disease morbidities

Exercise has also been shown to have benefits to the mental health of MS patients such as:
:*Improve wellbeing
:*Reduce depression
:*Improve self-esteem
:*Improve social interactions and support networks

===Recommendations &amp; Precautions===

Exercise is beneficial to assist in reduction of symptoms for MS sufferers. Some types of training for MS patients include:

      <text xml:space="preserve">== '''Exercise and the prevention of atherosclerosis''' ==

=== '''Background/ Explanation of the issue''' ===
[[Category:Exercise as it relates to Disease]]

Atherosclerosis is a disease characterised by hardening of the arteries in the body. This process often occurs as a result of ageing or lifestyle because over time the arteries become harder from the formation of plaques. &lt;ref name=&quot;A.D.A.M. Medical Encyclopedia&quot;&gt; A.D.A.M. Medical Encyclopedia. 2012. Hardening of the arteries [Online]. Available: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0001224/ [Accessed 22 October 2012].
&lt;/ref&gt;
Atherosclerosis is a condition that is associated with metabolic syndrome &lt;ref name=&quot;Vaidya&quot;&gt; VAIDYA, D., SZKLO, M., CUSHMAN, M., HOLVOET, P., POLAK, J., BAHRAMI, H., JENNY, N. S. &amp; OUYANG, P. 2011. Association of endothelial and oxidative stress with metabolic syndrome and subclinical atherosclerosis: multi-ethnic study of atherosclerosis. European Journal Of Clinical Nutrition, 65, 818-825.
&lt;/ref&gt; 
Atherosclerosis has an inflammatory effect and is also associated with thickening of the arterial wall surface due to plaque deposits &lt;ref name=&quot;Mottaghi&quot;&gt; MOTTAGHI, A., SALEHI, E., SEZAVAR, H., KESHAVARZ, S. A., ESHRAGHIAN, M. R., REZAEI, N., REJALI, L. &amp; SABOOR-YARAGHI, A.-A. 2012. The in vitro Effect of Oxidized LDL and PHA on Proliferation and Gene Expression of Regulatory T Cells in Patients with Atherosclerosis. Iranian Journal of Allergy, Asthma &amp; Immunology, 11, 217-223.
&lt;/ref&gt; 
Oxidative processes are important along with inflammation in the lead up to rupturing of plaque and thrombosis which can occur in this disease &lt;ref name=&quot;Cymbron&quot;&gt;.CYMBRON, T., RAPOSO, M., KAZACHKOVA, N., BETTENCOURT, C., SILVA, F., SANTOS, C., DAHMANI, Y., LOURENÇO, P., FERIN, R., PAVÃO, M. L. &amp; LIMA, M. 2011.  Cross-sectional study of risk factors for atherosclerosis in the Azorean population. Annals of Human Biology, 38, 354-359. &lt;/ref&gt; Oxidised low-density lipoprotein is involved in the initiation of plaque build up. Oxidised LDL assists T cells so they can adhere to vessel endothelium, in this way it contributes to development of atherosclerosis &lt;ref name=&quot;Mottaghi&quot; /&gt;
Platelets, leukocytes, endothelial cells, and the reactions between them are the characteristic elements of atherosclerosis &lt;ref name=&quot;Huang&quot;&gt;.HUANG, C.-C., LIU, K., POPE, R. M., DU, P., LIN, S., RAJAMANNAN, N. M., HUANG, Q.-Q., JAFARI, N., BURKE, G. L., POST, W., WATSON, K. E., JOHNSON, C., DAVIGLUS, M. L. &amp; LLOYD-JONES, D. M. 2011. Activated TLR signaling in atherosclerosis among women with lower Framingham risk score: the multi-ethnic study of atherosclerosis. PLoS ONE, 6, e21067-e21067.
&lt;/ref&gt;
T lymphocytes are the cells that have a major involvement in the development of atherosclerosis &lt;ref name=&quot;Mottaghi&quot; /&gt; .T regulatory cells have the ability to inhibit atherosclerosis by controlling production of T cells &lt;ref name=&quot;Mottaghi&quot; /&gt;. Cardiovascular disease frequently occurs as a result of atherosclerosis &lt;ref name=&quot;Cymbron&quot; /&gt;. It has been found that the risk of developing cardiovascular disease is lowered if the individual’s diet has a high fruit and vegetable content. However, vitamin supplements do not seem to have an effect in minimising cardiovascular disease &lt;ref name=&quot;Agarwal&quot;&gt;.AGARWAL, M., MEHTA, P. K., DWYER, J. H., DWYER, K. M., SHIRCORE, A. M., NORDSTROM, C. K., SUN, P., PAUL-LABRADOR, M., YANG, Y. &amp; MERZ, C. N. B. 2012. Differing Relations to Early Atherosclerosis between Vitamin C from Supplements vs. Food in the Los Angeles Atherosclerosis Study: A Prospective Cohort Study. The Open Cardiovascular Medicine Journal, 6, 113-121.  
&lt;/ref&gt; 
Risk of developing atherosclerosis is measured by carotid artery intimal medial thickness, and it’s progression can be linked with cardiovascular issues &lt;ref name=&quot;Agarwal&quot; /&gt;

=== '''Importance of Exercise''' ===

Studies have shown that physical activity can improve endothelial function when atherosclerosis is present. Exercise is also beneficial for individuals with risk factors for coronary artery disease &lt;ref name=&quot;Roitman&quot;&gt; ROITMAN, J. L. &amp; LAFONTAINE, T. 2006. Special populations. Exercise, atherosclerosis, and the endothelium: where the action is (part II). Strength &amp; Conditioning Journal (Allen Press), 28, 75-77.
&lt;/ref&gt;
Regular exercise has been found to be helpful in managing and preventing atherosclerosis and is a recommendation for individuals affected by coronary artery disease &lt;ref name=&quot;Reid&quot;&gt;. REID, R. D., TULLOCH, H., KOCOUREK, J., MORRIN, L. I., BEATON, L. J., PAPADAKIS, S., BLANCHARD, C. M., RILEY, D. L. &amp; PIPE, A. L. 2007. Who will be active? Predicting exercise stage transitions after hospitalization for coronary artery diseaseThis paper is one of a selection of papers published in this Special Issue, entitled Young Investigators' Forum. Canadian Journal of Physiology and Pharmacology, 85, 17-23. 
&lt;/ref&gt;
=== '''Benefits of resistance training on the prevention of atherosclerosis''' ===
Benefits of resistance training on the prevention of atherosclerosis:
Atherosclerosis is associated with an individual’s lifestyle and therefore this can be modified to help in the prevention of the disease. For example it has been linked with:
 
:*High serum total cholesterol and triglycerides levels &lt;ref name=&quot;Berenson&quot;&gt; BERENSON, G. S., SRINIVASAN, S. R., BAO, W., NEWMAN, W. P., TRACY, R. E. &amp; WATTIGNEY, W. A. 1998. Association between Multiple Cardiovascular Risk Factors and Atherosclerosis in Children and Young Adults. New England Journal of Medicine, 338, 1650-1656.  
&lt;/ref&gt;
:*Elevations in body-mass index (BMI) &lt;ref name=&quot;Berenson&quot; /&gt; 

:*Elevation in systolic blood pressure &lt;ref name=&quot;Berenson&quot; /&gt;

:*General physical inactivity &lt;ref name=&quot;Kadoglou&quot;&gt; KADOGLOU, N. P. E., ILIADIS, F. &amp; LIAPIS, C. D. 2008. Exercise and carotid atherosclerosis. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery, 35, 264-272.
&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several studies which have shown the benefit of resistance exercise on these factors. Progressive resistance training has been associated with decreases in:

:*Total cholesterol &lt;ref name=&quot;Kelley&quot;&gt; KELLEY, G. A. &amp; KELLEY, K. S. 2009. Impact of progressive resistance training on lipids and lipoproteins in adults: Another look at a meta-analysis using prediction intervals. Preventive Medicine, 49, 473-475.
&lt;/ref&gt;
:*non-high density lipoprotein cholesterol &lt;ref name=&quot;Kelley&quot; /&gt;

:*low density lipoprotein cholesterol &lt;ref name=&quot;Kelley&quot; /&gt;

:*triglycerides in adults &lt;ref name=&quot;Kelley&quot; /&gt;

:*both systolic and diastolic blood pressure  &lt;ref name=&quot;Fagard&quot;&gt; FAGARD, R. H. 2006. Exercise is good for your blood pressure: effects of endurance training and resistance training. Clinical &amp; Experimental Pharmacology &amp; Physiology, 33, 853-856.
&lt;/ref&gt;
==== '''Recommendations for resistance training''' ====
A doctor should be consulted before the onset of any vigorous exercise for individuals with any cardiovascular problems &lt;ref name=&quot;Thompson&quot;&gt;. THOMPSON, P. D., BUCHNER, D., PIÑA, I. L., BALADY, G. J., WILLIAMS, M. A., MARCUS, B. H., BERRA, K., BLAIR, S. N., COSTA, F., FRANKLIN, B., FLETCHER, G. F., GORDON, N. F., PATE, R. R., RODRIGUEZ, B. L., YANCEY, A. K. &amp; WENGER, N. K. 2003. Exercise and physical activity in the prevention and treatment of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Circulation, 107, 3109-3116.
&lt;/ref&gt;
Exercise should be stopped and medical advice immediately sought if the individual experiences, recurring chest pain, unusual shortness of breath, dizziness or heart rhythm abnormalities &lt;ref name=&quot;Franklin&quot;&gt; FRANKLIN, A. B., BALADY, J. G., BERRA, K., GORDON, F. N. &amp; POLLOCK, L. M. 2012. Exercise for persons with cardiovascular disease [Online]. Available: http://www.acsm.org/docs/current-comments/exercise-for-persons-with-cardiovascular-disease.pdf [Accessed 4 October 2012].     
&lt;/ref&gt;
The resistance training recommendations for individuals with cardiovascular disease include : 

:*Single set. &lt;ref name=&quot;Franklin&quot; /&gt; 
:*Performed a minimum 2-3 times a week. &lt;ref name=&quot;Franklin&quot; /&gt;
:*8-10 different exercises using the major muscle groups (shoulders, arms, chest, back, hips and legs). &lt;ref name=&quot;Franklin&quot; /&gt;
:*10-15 reps at a moderate level of fatigue. &lt;ref name=&quot;Franklin&quot; /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) is a form of anxiety disorder in which sufferers experience excessive and unnecessary anxiety and worry about regular occurrences in everyday life. In Australia, GAD affects approximately 3-6% of the population and is most common during mid-life. The onset of GAD can be genetic or caused by prolonged stress or a traumatic experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hunt|first=C|title=DSM-IV Generalized Anxiety Disorder in the Australian National Survey of Mental Health and Well-Being|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=109455|publisher=Psychological Medicine Journal|accessdate=Saturday 20 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Symptoms ==
Symptoms of anxiety can be classified as either mental (affecting the psyche) or somatic (affecting the body but excluding the psyche). Mental symptoms can be categorised as apprehension and vigilance, whilst somatic symptoms can be categorised as either motor-based or exaggerated physiological responses.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Background==
Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) is a form of diabetes mellitus that results from autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing beta cells of the pancreas. It is an inflammatory autoimmune disease of the pancreas, resulting in a lack of insulin&lt;ref name=&quot;Lernmark&quot; &gt; &quot;Lernmark, Å. (1999). Type 1 diabetes. Clinical chemistry, 45(8), 1331-1338 http://www.clinchem.org/content/45/8/1331.full &lt;/ref&gt;. 
Risk factors for developing Type 1 Diabetes &lt;ref name=&quot;Eisenbarth&quot; &gt; &quot;Eisenbarth, G. S. (1986). &quot;Type I Diabetes Mellitus.&quot; New England Journal of Medicine 314(21): 1360-1368 http://www.hindawi.com/journals/ari/2012/457546/ &lt;/ref&gt; include:
:*Genetics&lt;ref name=&quot;Eisenbarth&quot; &gt; &quot;Eisenbarth, G. S. (1986). &quot;Type I Diabetes Mellitus.&quot; New England Journal of Medicine 314(21): 1360-1368 &lt;/ref&gt;
:*Environmental&lt;ref name=&quot;Eisenbarth&quot; &gt; &quot;Eisenbarth, G. S. (1986). &quot;Type I Diabetes Mellitus.&quot; New England Journal of Medicine 314(21): 1360-1368 &lt;/ref&gt;

The rate of diabetes in Australia has shown a steady increase from 2.4% in 1995 to 3.8% in 2007–08&lt;ref name=&quot;National&quot; &gt; &quot;National Health Survey, 1995, 2001, 2004-05 and 2007-08 http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Lookup/4820.0.55.001main+features32007-08 &lt;/ref&gt;.
&lt;br/&gt;
In 2007-08, '''10%''' of the Australian population who suffered from diabetes (82,000 people) reported they had Type 1 diabetes, while '''2%''' of people with diabetes did not know which type of diabetes they had&lt;ref name=&quot;National&quot; /&gt;.

==Aerobic Exercise==
Type 1 diabetes mellitus sufferers often tend to avoid participating in aerobic exercise due to fear of enhancing more acute symptoms relating to the disease&lt;ref name= &quot;Zisser&quot; &gt; &quot;Zisser, H., Sueyoshi, M., Krigstein, K., Szigiato, A., &amp; Riddell, M. C. (2012). Advances in exercise, physical activity and diabetes mellitus. International Journal Of Clinical Practice (Supplement), 6662-71. doi:10.1111/j.1742-1241.2011.02856.x http://www.yorku.ca/mriddell/documents/Zisseretal2012.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= &quot;Cohen&quot; &gt; &quot;Cohen ST, Jacobson AM. Psychological benefits of exercise. In: Ruderman NB, Devlin JT, Schneider SH, Kriska A, editors. Handbook of exercise in diabetes. 2nd ed. Alexandria, VA: American Diabetes Association; 2002 http://www.australianprescriber.com/magazine/30/5/article/911.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;. Although this practice may reduce the immediate effects T1DM places on the body, it may increase the prevalence of other lifestyle complications including:
* '''Increased''' weight gain
* '''Decreased''' muscle mass
* '''Decreased''' bone density
* '''Decrease''' insulin sensitivity
* '''Decreased''' life expectancy
* '''Increased''' risk of lifestyle diseases
&lt;br/&gt;
These problems can affect common everyday tasks such as making it difficult to walk up a flight of stairs. They also dramatically affect the long term health of the patient.
&lt;br/ &gt;
&lt;br/ &gt;
===Benefits of Aerobic Exercise===
Recent research has shown sufficient evidence to indicate that aerobic exercise does not negatively affect Type I diabetes mellitus symptoms and is completely safe for patients suffering with well-controlled diabetes mellitus &lt;ref name=&quot;Pedersen&quot; &gt; &quot;Pedersen, O., H. Beck-Nielsen, et al. (1980). &quot;Increased Insulin Receptors after Exercise in Patients with Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus.&quot; New England Journal of Medicine 302(16): 886-892 http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM198004173021603&lt;/ref&gt;.  Aerobic exercise has been shown to:
* '''Improve''' glucose tolerance &lt;ref name= &quot;Pedersen&quot; /&gt;
* '''Reduce''' insulin requirements/increase insulin sensitivity &lt;ref name=&quot;Pedersen&quot; /&gt;
* Potentially '''lower''' glycosylated haemoglobin &lt;ref name= &quot;Komatsu&quot; &gt; &quot;KOMATSU, W. R., BARROS NETO, T. L., CHACRA, A. R., &amp; DIB, S. A. (2010). Aerobic Exercise Capacity and Pulmonary Function in Athletes With and Without Type 1 Diabetes. Diabetes Care, 33(12), 2555-2557. doi:10.2337/dc10-0769 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2992189/&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Reduced''' risk of CVD, hypertension, colon cancer, obesity and osteoporosis &lt;ref name= &quot;Komatsu&quot; /&gt;
* '''Increased''' overall life expectancy &lt;ref name= &quot;Komatsu&quot; /&gt;
* '''Increased''' CV endurance, muscle fitness and flexibility &lt;ref name= &quot;Komatsu&quot; /&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Aerobic exercise also contributes to psychological health benefits &lt;ref name= &quot;Komatsu&quot; /&gt; which may include:
* '''Improved''' self-esteem &lt;ref name= &quot;Komatsu&quot; /&gt;
* '''Enhanced''' sense of well-being &lt;ref name= &quot;Komatsu&quot; /&gt;
* '''Improved''' social interaction skills
&lt;br/&gt;

===Recommendations- Aerobic Exercise===
In order to gain the maximum benefits from aerobic exercise, the following recommendations should be followed:
* 5 sessions/week &lt;ref name= &quot;Cohen&quot; /&gt;
* 60-90% MHR &lt;ref name= &quot;Cohen&quot; /&gt; depending on individual
* 30-90 mins &lt;ref name= &quot;Cohen&quot; /&gt;
* Each training program may need to be personalised with GP recommendations and a pre-screening check
&lt;br/&gt;
This research may show that aerobic exercise, when taking correct responsibility for the varying insulin requirements, reduces the symptoms of T1DM. Even though this predominantly refers to med-high intensity over med-long duration, everyday occurrences will also have a positive effect on minimising symptoms of the disease. These may include:
* Walking to work
* Taking stairs rather than escalator/lift
* Taking dog for a run on a more common basis
&lt;br/&gt;

==Precautions==
Although research suggests that aerobic exercise is safe to participate in &lt;ref name= &quot;Zisser&quot; /&gt; some considerations must be taken:
* Discuss intended training plan with doctor prior to commencing.
* Frequently monitor blood-glucose levels during exercise.
* Cease exercise if any abnormal symptoms appear.

== Comorbidities ==
GAD has a high comorbidity rate as many symptoms of GAD overlap with those of other psychiatric illnesses, including depression, bipolar and other forms of anxiety (namely social phobia and panic disorder).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Simon|first=N.M|title=Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Psychiatric Comorbidities such as Depression, Bipolar Disorder, and Substance Abuse|journal=Journal of Clinical Psychiatry|year=2009|volume=70|pages=10–14|doi=10.4088/JCP.s.7002.02|accessdate=17/10/2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Dietary modifications (elimination of caffeine and alcohol) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hughes|first=R.N|title=Drugs Which Induce Anxiety: Caffeine|journal=New Zealand Journal of Psychology|year=1996|month=June|volume=25|issue=1|pages=36–42|accessdate=22/10/2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Exercise can be used in conjunction with these treatments to help minimise the symptoms of GAD.

== Barriers to Exercise or Physical Activity ==
There are several factors that dictate the likelihood of a GAD patient adhering to an exercise regime:
* Interest in the activity
* Perception of physical activity and exercise (i.e. incidental physical activity)
* Motivation
* Fatigue
* Low self-esteem
* Mind control

== Benefits of Exercise ==
* Endorphin release which masks pain, and produces feelings of euphoria and well-being &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harbor|first=VJ|title=Endorphins and Exercise|url=http://ukpmc.ac.uk/abstract/MED/6091217|publisher=Journal of Sports Medicine|accessdate=22/10/2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Stress relief and clearing and calming of the mind
* Lower resting heart rate - elevated heart rate is a symptom of GAD and exercise works to regulate this &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rodriguez|first=Diana|title=Anti-Anxiety Workout|url=http://www.everydayhealth.com/anxiety/anxiety-and-exercise.aspx|accessdate=22/10/2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Lowering airway resistance which improves the breathing difficulties experienced by GAD sufferers
* Aids in alleviating muscle tension associated with GAD
* Improves concentration

== Exercise Recommendations ==
Aerobic exercise is the recommended exercise modality, as it is more pleasurable and achievable for the patient, and therefore increases the likelihood of adherence. Brisk walking, jogging, cycling and swimming are best. Exercising in social situations (for example, social tennis or dancing) is beneficial in two ways; the body undergoes the physiological adaptations associated with exercise, whilst also relieving emotional tension and improving self-value. Constantly elevated heart rate is a complication associated with GAD, however aerobic exercise improves the efficiency of the heart, thus lowering resting heart rate and helping to alleviate this symptom. &lt;sup&gt; [9] &lt;/sub&gt; Yoga is recommended, and, whilst is it not seen as an aerobic exercise, it 
calms the body, regulates breathing, and alleviates stress, whilst also stretching the muscles and strengthening the body.

== Further Research, Reading and Support ==
It is well-documented that there is a positive link between exercise and its role in preventing or lessening the burden of mental illness, however the clinical recommendations for exercise prescription are very general and limited. Future studies into standardising an exercise regime for sufferers of mental illness would be extremely beneficial in both prevention and treatment.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is one of the leading causes of death in Australia, accounting for 34% of all deaths in 2007-08. The 2007-08 National Health Survey (NHS) reported Hypertension as the most common CVD, reported by 9% of the population. The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) reported CVD as the highest health expenditure of all disease groups, accounting for 11.3% of Australia’s total allocated health spending &lt;ref name=&quot;ABS&quot;&gt;Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2008. 2007-2008 National Health Survey&lt;/ref&gt;

Hypertension is a cardiovascular disorder characterised by a systolic blood pressure of at least 140 mmHg and/or a diastolic blood pressure of at least 90 mmHg. To avoid ‘white coat’ hypertension, it is commonly measured using 24 hour ambulatory methods. Gestational hypertension is the new-onset of hypertension, typically presenting 20 weeks after gestation, and involves little to no urine protein content. Some women progress from Gestational hypertension to Preeclampsia. Preeclampsia is defined as gestational hypertension, plus proteinuria (300&amp;nbsp;mg or more per 24-hourperiod).&lt;ref name=&quot;Sibai&quot;&gt;Sibai, B. M. &quot;Diagnosis and Management of Gestational Hypertension and Preeclampsia.&quot; American College of Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology. 2003. 102(1), 181-92&lt;/ref&gt; This complication occurs in roughly 2-8% of women but however is manageable upon early detection. A complication exists here because physical symptoms often present late or not at all.&lt;ref name=&quot;meher&quot;&gt;Meher S, Duley L. Exercise or other physical activity for preventing pre-eclampsia and its complications. Cochrane Database Syst Rev 2006;2&lt;/ref&gt; Literature has reported that insulin resistance in early stages of pregnancy may serve as predisposition marker for gestational hypertension.&lt;ref name=&quot;carpenter&quot;&gt;Carpenter, M. W. &quot;Gestational Diabetes, Pregnancy Hypertension, and Late Vascular Disease.&quot; Diabetes Care 30.Supplement_2. 2007. S246-250&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;seely&quot;&gt;Seely, E. W., and C. G. Solomon. &quot;Insulin Resistance and Its Potential Role in Pregnancy-Induced Hypertension.&quot; Journal of Clinical Endocrinology &amp; Metabolism. 2003.  88(6), 2393-398.&lt;/ref&gt;
== Pregnancy and Hypertension ==
Gestational hypertension is different to pre-existing Hypertension; however both carry risks for the mother and the baby. Hypertension in pregnancy can cause strokes, seizures, renal damage and cardiovascular disease.&lt;ref name=&quot;heart&quot;&gt;Heart foundation of Australia, 2012. Cardiovascular Conditions: High blood pressure. http://www.heartfoundation.org.au/your-heart/cardiovascular-conditions/Pages/blood-pressure.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; Different demographics will experience higher instance of hypertension during pregnancy. The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) found that in 2008, 14% of birth-mothers of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander high blood pressure during their pregnancy.&lt;ref name=&quot;ABS&quot;/&gt;
=== Foetal Risk ===
Due to the high pressure in the vascular network, capillary walls are damaged and blood flow is hampered. Neural tube defects and lack of blood flow can also cause maternal hyperthermia.&lt;ref name=&quot;wolfe&quot;&gt;Wolfe LA, Hall P, Webb KA, Goodman L, Monga M, McGrath MJ. Prescription of aerobic exercise during pregnancy. Sports Med 1989 Nov;8(5):273-301&lt;/ref&gt; Capillaries to the womb and placenta carrying blood and therefore oxygen and nutrients to the foetus are therefore not efficient. Sufficient blood flow is needed to ‘feed’ the growing foetus. Complications here can result in poor growth, pre-term birth or even loss of pregnancy.&lt;ref name=&quot;meher&quot;/&gt;
=== Treatment ===
Women diagnosed with Gestational Hypertension and/or Preeclampsia require close monitoring of both maternal and foetal conditions. 
Management of gestational hypertension includes&lt;ref name=&quot;carpenter&quot;/&gt;:
* Bed Rest
* Blood Pressure Medications (anti-hypertensive drugs)
* Foetal and Maternal Monitoring (daily blood pressure readings)
* Hospitalisation (severe)
Commonly the mother’s blood pressure will return to normal within the first week postpartum.&lt;ref name=&quot;ferrazani&quot;&gt;Ferrazani S, DeCarolis S, Pomini F, Testa AC, Mastromarino C, Caruso A. The duration of hypertension in the puerperium of preeclamptic women: Relationship with renal impairment and week of delivery. Am J Obstet Gynecol. 1994. 17:506–12.&lt;/ref&gt;  If blood pressure is still elevated, supplemented magnesium sulphate and antihypertensive drugs are given.&lt;ref name=&quot;seely&quot;/&gt; Daily blood pressure measurements are conducted, until there are no signs or symptoms of hypertension.

== Exercise Prescription for Gestational Hypertension ==
Current literature suggests that women with gestational hypertension need to limit physical activity.&lt;ref name=&quot;artal&quot;&gt;Artal, R., and M. O'Toole. &quot;Guidlines of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists for Exercise during Pregnancy and the Postpartum Period.&quot; Br J Sports Med. 2003. 37, 6-12&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (ACOG) listed pregnancy induced hypertension in a list for absolute contraindications to aerobic exercise during pregnancy.&lt;ref name=&quot;acog&quot;&gt;ACOG Committee. Opinion no. 267: exercise during pregnancy and the postpartum period. Obstet Gynecol 2002. 99,171–3.&lt;/ref&gt; Literature suggests that regular physical activity within the first 20 weeks of gestation may prevent or reduce the risk of developing Hypertension and related hypertensive disorders during the latter period of gestation.&lt;ref name=&quot;marcoux&quot;&gt;Marcoux S., Brisson J, Fabria J. The effect of leisure time physical activity on the risk of pre-eclampsia and gestational hypertension. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health. 1989. 43, 147-152.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;saftlas&quot;&gt;Saftlas, A. F., N. Logsden-Sackett, W. Wang, R. Woolson, and M. B. Bracken. &quot;Work, Leisure-Time Physical Activity, and Risk of Preeclampsia and Gestational Hypertension.&quot; American Journal of Epidemiology. 2004 160(8), 758-65.&lt;/ref&gt;
==== Hypertension and Exercise ====
Non aerobic-exercise such as yoga has been shown to decrease blood pressure in non-pregnant hypertensive patients.&lt;ref name=&quot;meher&quot;/&gt; It has been suggested this and other antenatal exercises could also reduce the risk of developing gestational hypertension along with aerobic exercise preconception.&lt;ref name=&quot;meher&quot;/&gt; Further research could be conducted into the effects of yoga and antenatal exercises on blood pressure in pregnant women to possibly predict the effects on pregnant hypertensive patients&lt;ref name=&quot;meher&quot;/&gt;
==== Pregnancy and Exercise ====
Exercise should not involve ballistic movements or too much thermal/environmental stress.&lt;ref name=&quot;larsson&quot;&gt;Larsson L, Lindqvist PG. Low‐impact exercise during pregnancy–a study of safety. Acta Obstet Gynecol Scand 2005; 84(1):34-38.&lt;/ref&gt; As the gestational period continues, exercise intensity can decrease as long as physical activity is maintained.&lt;ref name=&quot;wolfe&quot;/&gt; Too much exercise or high intensity exercise causes skeletal muscle and the foetus to compete for blood flow and is related to pre-term births.&lt;ref name=&quot;wolfe&quot;/&gt; Most studies predicted exercise intensity using % max heart rates varying depending on age and period of gestation.&lt;ref name=&quot;mottola&quot;&gt;Mottola MF, Davenport MH, Brun CR, Inglis SD, Charlesworth S, Sopper MM. VO2peak prediction and exercise prescription for pregnant women. Med Sci Sports Exerc 2006; 38(8):1389.&lt;/ref&gt; 
It is important to note that in healthy individuals, exercise during pregnancy is considered beneficial to both mother and foetus, and is encouraged.  The American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) recommend moderate intensity aerobic exercise for a minimum of 30 minutes per day.&lt;ref name=&quot;pate&quot;&gt;Pate RR, Pratt M, Blair SN, et al. A recommendation from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American College of Sports Medicine. AMA. 1995. 273, 402–7.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Exercise during pregnancy with non-hypertensive subjects not only reduces the risk of developing hypertension but has a number of other benefits including:
decreased adipose tissue accumulation associated with pregnancy due to increased sedentary activity,&lt;ref name=&quot;melzer&quot;&gt;Melzer K, Schutz Y, Boulvain M, Kayser B. Physical Activity and Pregnancy: Cardiovascular Adaptations, Recommendations and Pregnancy Outcomes. Sports Medicine 2010 06; 40(6):493-507.&lt;/ref&gt; decreased labour pain, decreased triglycerides and inflammatory cytokines, decreased insulin resistance, enhanced placental growth and vascularity, increase in plasma volume and cardiac output, reduction in emotional stress and anxiety &lt;ref name=&quot;meher&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;larsson&quot;/&gt;

== Recommendations ==
* Exercising with Gestational Hypertension is not encouraged as it only increases blood pressure and can causes damage to mother and foetus
* Monitoring of blood pressure, rest and anti-hypertensive drugs are the main therapy for Gestational Hypertension
* Best strategy is prevention through light aerobic exercise pre-conception and most importantly, during 1st half of pregnancy
* Possible room for research into other coping strategies (non-aerobic exercise)
*Contact your physician/obstetrician and seek medical evaluation and clearance before undertaking any exercise regime

      <text xml:space="preserve">Obesity is a severe excess of body mass relative to lean mass and is commonly determined by interpreting an individuals  body mass index (BMI) &lt;ref name=&quot;Gaines&quot; &gt;Gaines, R., et al. (2009) The”O” Fator: A Review of the Literature and Strategies to Reduce Childhood Obesity. VAHPERD, 9-12.&lt;/ref&gt;. It can be found by Dividing body weight in kilograms by height in meter’s squared. A BMI of equal or greater than 30 is considerd obese.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gaines&quot; &gt;Gaines, R., et al. (2009) The”O” Fator: A Review of the Literature and Strategies to Reduce Childhood Obesity. VAHPERD, 9-12.&lt;/ref&gt; It can be found by Dividing body weight in kilograms by height in meter’s squared. A BMI of equal or greater than 30 is considerd obese.

=====BACKGROUND=====
Childhood Obesity has reached epidemic proportion, with approximately 22 million children aged under 5 considred obese worldwide &lt;ref name=&quot;Watts&quot; &gt;Watts,K., Jones,T., Davis,E &amp; Green,D. (2005) Exercise Training in Obese Childeren and Adolescents. Sports Med, 35(5),375-392.&lt;/ref&gt;. Childhood obesity is considered  a major modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease and is strongly correlated with the development of comorbid conditions such as Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Insulin Resistance &lt;ref name=&quot;Ben-Sefer&quot; &gt;Ben-Sefer,E., Ben-Natan,M &amp; Ehrenfeld,M. (2009) Childhood ebesity: current literature, policy and implications for practise. International Nursing Review, 56, 166-173.&lt;/ref&gt;
The increase in fat mass in children has occurred concurrently with a decline in self-reported exercise time, with recent studies suggesting that obesity prevention should focus on increasing physical activity&lt;ref name=&quot;Watts&quot; &gt;Watts,K., Jones,T., Davis,E &amp; Green,D. (2005) Exercise Training in Obese Childeren and Adolescents. Sports Med, 35(5),375-392.&lt;/ref&gt; , to improve body composition and metabolic variables.

=====CAUSES OF CHILDHOOD OBESITY=====
Although a range physiological and psychological factors contribute to childhood obesity,
weight gain is primarily caused by an imbalance between energy intake (calories consumed ) and energy expenditure (calories expanded) where energy intake exceeds expenditure&lt;ref name=&quot;Ben-Sefer&quot; &gt;Ben-Sefer,E., Ben-Natan,M &amp; Ehrenfeld,M. (2009) Childhood ebesity: current literature, policy and implications for practise. International Nursing Review, 56, 166-173.&lt;/ref&gt;. In the present time children are spending more time participating in sedentary behaviour and consuming more energy dense processed food &lt;ref name=&quot;Gaines&quot; &gt;Gaines, R., et al. (2009) The”O” Fator: A Review of the Literature and Strategies to Reduce Childhood Obesity. VAHPERD, 9-12.&lt;/ref&gt; contributing to an  energy imbalance  swayed toward weight gain

=====ROLE OF EXERCISE IN REDUCING CHILDHOOD OBESITY=====
Exercise is a key component  in managing obesity. Physical activity increases energy expenditure improving energy balance towards weight loss. Exercise alone can also assist in the prevention of obesity related complications such as metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes &lt;ref name=&quot;Taplin&quot; &gt;Taplin,C.E &amp; Zeitler,P. (2009) Exercise for the treatment f childhood obesity- is it simply too much to ask? Foundation of Acta Paediatrica, 98, 214-216&lt;/ref&gt;.. Exercise increases self-confidence and self-esteem, the lack of which have been linked to obesity. 

=====EXERCISE RECOMMENDATIONS=====
The Australian Department of Health and Aging has developed Physical Activity recommendations for children and young people. These are that:
#Children and young people should participate in at least 60 minutes (and up to several hours) of moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity every day.
#Children and young people should not spend more than 2 hours a day using electronic media for entertainment (eg computer games, Internet, TV), particularly during daylight hours.
It is also recommended that Overweight and Obese childeren - begin slowly working up to 60 minutes per day of moderate to vigorous activity being sure to not over do it to cause injury, then increased to 60–90 minutes to avoid weight gain. &lt;ref name=&quot;Australian&quot;&gt;Australian Government Department of Health and Aging. (2007). Physical activity. Retrieved from http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/content/health-pubhlth-strateg-active-recommend.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Background==
Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD) is consistently feeling fearful and anxious at an unwarranted level. Although it is not known what is the direct cause it is associated with the amygdala and hippocampus of the brain, and elevated levels of norepinephrine, gamma-aminobutyric and serotonin in the brain, and trauma. If left untreated symptoms seem to become progressively worse.

'''Symptoms''' include difficulties with sleep, muscle tension, nausea, dizziness, excessive urination, restlessness, low concentration, sweating, and hot flushes&lt;ref name=&quot;Ordway&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BeyondBlue&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Barlow&quot;/&gt;

'''Risk factors''' include a family history of mental illness, stressful events or environments, long-term illness, and certain personality traits.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ordway&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BeyondBlue&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Barlow&quot;/&gt;

'''Prevalence''' - The 2007 mental health survey showed anxiety disorders effected 14% of the Australian population.&lt;ref name=&quot;DHA2&quot;&gt; (2007). Anxiety Disorders in Australia. The Mental Health of Australians - Australian Government - Department of Health and Aging. (5)23-28 Retrieved from http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/content/46AB7A3FEF9664E4CA2575D2000A6D09/$File/mha25.pdf(viewed 18/10/12)&lt;/ref&gt; Females consistently showed higher rates than males in all age groups, especially in teenage years.&lt;ref name=&quot;DHA2&quot;/&gt; GAD was responsible for 2.7%.&lt;ref name=&quot;DHA2&quot;/&gt; Sufferers experienced the highest perceived interference of life, and higher psychological distress than many other anxiety disorders.&lt;ref name=&quot;DHA2&quot;/&gt; 
In the UK 9% of the population had an anxiety disorder (less than Australia), while in the US 3.1% of the population had GAD (more than Australia).&lt;ref name=&quot;Ordway&quot;/&gt; &lt;ref name=&quot;Kessler&quot;&gt;Kessler, R.C., Wai, T.C., Demlar, O., Walter, E.E.

Retrieved from http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2847357/.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DHA2&quot;/&gt;

'''Treatment''' through counselling can include cognitive behavioural therapy, interpersonal therapy, family therapy, and psychodynamic therapy.
Medical treatment includes antidepressants and benzodiazepines.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ordway&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BeyondBlue&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Barlow&quot;/&gt;

==Generalised Anxiety Disorder and Exercise==
It has been shown that '''levels of anxiety''' in patients with GAD and other anxiety disorders '''decrease with physical activity'''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ordway&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Barlow&quot;/&gt;
This is thought to be due to the increased presence of excitatory hormones and bodily responses at the time of exercise and the decreased influence they have with continued exercise, which may be due to down-regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ordway&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Barlow&quot;/&gt;

===Type of Exercise===
It is currently thought that '''aerobic exercise''' is best for reducing anxiety.
This may be due to adherence, or from the ability to maintain the exercise for a longer duration.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ordway&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Barlow&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DHA&quot;&gt; (2010). Physical Activity Guidelines. Australian Government - Department of Health and Aging Retrieved from http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/content/health-pubhlth-strateg-phys-act-guidelines(viewed 18/10/12)&lt;/ref&gt; Best results are seen with walking, jogging, riding and swimming.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barlow&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DHA&quot;/&gt;

===Frequency===
It is recommended that the exercise is in sessions of '''20 minutes or longer'''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ordway&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Barlow&quot;/&gt; Australian government recommendations for physical activity for general health are '''30 minutes of moderate intensity exercise every day''' if possible, which is a sufficient amount to reduce anxiety.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ordway&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Barlow&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DHA&quot;/&gt; However, the recommendations also mention the possibility of breaking this time up in to '''10 or 15 minute sessions''', which '''may not be effective''' specifically for anxiety.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ordway&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Barlow&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DHA&quot;/&gt; As with many physical improvements, the reductions in anxiety take some time, with best results occurring after '''ten weeks''' or more.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barlow&quot;/&gt;

===Benefits===
The sufferers of GAD report having problems with many aspects of their lives, in particular their social life. Participation in group fitness may help make the participant feel involved.&lt;ref name=&quot;BeyondBlue&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Barlow&quot;/&gt; With GAD concentration is also a problem, with exercise work and school lives could be improved as concentrating becomes easier.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ordway&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BeyondBlue&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Barlow&quot;/&gt; Exercise may also increase the ease of sleeping.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ordway&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BeyondBlue&quot;/&gt; The weight gains associated with taking antidepressants, can be managed.&lt;ref name=&quot;BeyondBlue&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Barlow&quot;/&gt;

===Cautions===
Always make sure the participant is comfortable with the type of exercise, as you do not want to further anxieties.&lt;ref name=&quot;BeyondBlue&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Barlow&quot;/&gt; When taking antidepressants the side-effects of nausea, sweating, dizziness, and headaches may effect ability.&lt;ref name=&quot;BeyondBlue&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Barlow&quot;/&gt; With benzodiazepines, as well as the side-effects above they may have impaired motor coordination, blurry vision and tremors, which all mean greater precaution should be taken.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADF&quot;&gt; (2011). Benzodiazepines Druginfo - Australian Drug Foundation Retrieved from http://www.druginfo.adf.org.au/drug-facts/benzodiazepines(viewed 18/10/12)&lt;/ref&gt; The symptoms of GAD should always be taken into account when exercising.&lt;ref name=&quot;BeyondBlue&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ordway&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Barlow&quot;/&gt; Always consult a general practitioner if you are unsure of your ability.&lt;ref name=&quot;BeyondBlue&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ordway&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Barlow&quot;/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) is a form of anxiety disorder in which sufferers experience excessive and unnecessary anxiety and worry about regular occurrences in everyday life. In Australia, GAD affects approximately 3-6% of the population. GAD is most common during late teens to early twenties, and also in the elderly - as we have an ageing population, the number of people living with disorder may increase over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Generalised Anxiety Disorder|url=http://www.raminader.com/PDFs%20Uploaded/GAD%20-%20AnxietyBC%20-%20GAD.pdf|publisher=Anxiety BC|accessdate=23/10/2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; GAD is also more common in people of lower socio-economic status due to increased uncontrollable stressors. &lt;sub&gt; [1] &lt;/sub&gt;The onset of GAD can either be genetic, caused by prolonged stress, a traumatic experience or distorted beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clark|first=D.M|title=Anxiety Disorders: Why They Persist and How to Treat Them|journal=Journal of Behaviour Research and Therapy|year=1999|volume=37|pages=5–27| accessdate=22/10/2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Symptoms ==
Symptoms of anxiety can be classified as either mental (affecting the psyche) or somatic (affecting the body but excluding the psyche). Mental symptoms can be categorised as apprehension and vigilance, whilst somatic symptoms can be categorised as either motor-based or exaggerated physiological responses.

In order to meet diagnostic criteria for GAD, patients must suffer from persistent and uncontrollable apprehension, and the consequential somatic responses, for at least six months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kessler|first=R.C|title=Patterns and Correlates of Generalised Anxiety Disorder in Community Samples|url=http://psylux.psych.tu-dresden.de/i2/klinische/studium/literatur/587.pdf|accessdate=20/10/2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Comorbidities ==
GAD has a high comorbidity rate as many symptoms of GAD overlap with those of other psychiatric illnesses, including depression, bipolar and other forms of anxiety (namely social phobia and panic disorder).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Simon|first=N.M|title=Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Psychiatric Comorbidities such as Depression, Bipolar Disorder, and Substance Abuse|journal=Journal of Clinical Psychiatry|year=2009|volume=70|pages=10–14|doi=10.4088/JCP.s.7002.02|accessdate=17/10/2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, 75-90% of GAD sufferers will also be diagnosed with one of the aforementioned psychiatric illnesses. &lt;sub&gt; [1] &lt;/sub&gt;

== Common Treatments ==
Common treatments for GAD include:
* Pharmacotherapy
* Cognitive behaviour therapy
* Hypnotherapy &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sharma|first=Renu|title=Hypononsis: Psycho-philosophical Perspectives and Therapeutic Evidence|year=2011|publisher=Concept Publishing Company|location=New Dehli|isbn=13-978-81-8069-727-2|pages=207–211}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Dietary modifications (elimination of caffeine and alcohol) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hughes|first=R.N|title=Drugs Which Induce Anxiety: Caffeine|journal=New Zealand Journal of Psychology|year=1996|month=June|volume=25|issue=1|pages=36–42|accessdate=22/10/2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Exercise can be used in conjunction with these treatments to help minimise the symptoms of GAD.

== Barriers to Exercise or Physical Activity ==
There are several factors that dictate the likelihood of a GAD patient adhering to an exercise regime:
* Interest in the activity
* Perception of physical activity and exercise (i.e. incidental physical activity)
* Motivation
* Fatigue
* Self-esteem
* Mind control

== Benefits of Exercise in GAD Patients==
* Endorphin release which masks pain, and produces feelings of euphoria and well-being &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harbor|first=VJ|title=Endorphins and Exercise|url=http://ukpmc.ac.uk/abstract/MED/6091217|publisher=Journal of Sports Medicine|accessdate=16/10/2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Stress relief and clearing and calming of the mind
* Lowers resting heart rate - elevated heart rate is a symptom of GAD and exercise works to regulate this &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rodriguez|first=Diana|title=Anti-Anxiety Workout|url=http://www.everydayhealth.com/anxiety/anxiety-and-exercise.aspx|accessdate=22/10/2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Lowers airway resistance which improves the breathing difficulties experienced by GAD sufferers
* Aids in alleviating muscle tension associated with GAD
* Improves concentration
* Provides a sense of self-mastery and changes in self-concept &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Strohle|first=A|title=Physical Activity, Exercise, Depression and Anxiety Disorders|journal=Biological Psychiatry|year=2009|pages=777–784|doi=10.1007/s00702-008-0092-x|url=http://robertwhitaker.org/robertwhitaker.org/Solutions_files/Physical%20activity,%20exercise,%20depression%20and%20anxiety%20disordrs.pdf|accessdate=22/10/2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Exercise Recommendations ==
Moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, such as brisk walking, jogging, cycling or swimming, are recommended as they are more successful than vigorous intensity-based programs. &lt;sub&gt; [10] &lt;/sub&gt;Exercising in social situations (for example, social tennis or dancing) is beneficial in two ways; the body undergoes the physiological adaptations associated with exercise, whilst also relieving emotional tension and improving self-value. Constantly elevated heart rate is a complication associated with GAD, however aerobic exercise improves the efficiency of the heart, thus lowering resting heart rate and helping to alleviate this symptom. &lt;sup&gt; [9] &lt;/sub&gt; Yoga is recommended, and, whilst is it not seen as an aerobic exercise, it 
calms the body, regulates breathing, and alleviates stress, whilst also stretching the muscles and strengthening the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nefer|first=B|title=Exercises for General Anxiety Disorder|url=http://www.livestrong.com/article/129475-exercises-generalized-anxiety-disorder/|publisher=Live Strong|accessdate=23/10/2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

It is recommended that patients partake in aerobic exercise 3-4 times per week, with a duration of 20 – 30 minutes per bout. The exercise program should continue for 8 –14 weeks to see overall improvements in their condition, but should be maintained for life. As well as exercise, incidental physical activity should be encouraged (for example, cleaning the house or climbing stairs) &lt;sub&gt; [10] &lt;/sub&gt;

== Further Research, Reading and Support ==
It is well-documented that there is a positive link between exercise and its role in preventing or lessening the burden of mental illness, however the clinical recommendations for exercise prescription are very general and limited. Future studies into standardising an exercise regime for GAD sufferers would be extremely beneficial in both prevention and treatment. &lt;sub&gt; [10] &lt;/sub&gt;

[[File:Bézier 2 big.svg|200px|thumb|left|A smooth curve with control points P0, P1, and P2.]]
This tutorial discusses one way to render quadratic Bézier curves and splines in Unity. No shader programming is required since all the code is implemented in JavaScript.

There are many applications of smooth curves in computer graphics, in particular in animation and modeling. In a 3D game engine, one would usually use a tube-like mesh and deform it with vertex blending as discussed in {{Cg Programming Unity SectionRef|Nonlinear Deformations}} instead of rendering curves; however, rendering curved lines instead of deformed meshes can offer a substantial performance advantage.

[[File:Bézier 1 big.gif|200px|thumb|right|A linear Bézier curve from P0 to P1 is equivalent to linear interpolation.]]
=== Linear Bézier Curves ===
The simplest Bézier curve is a linear Bézier curve &lt;math&gt;B(t)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; from 0 to 1 between two points &lt;math&gt;P_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt;, which happens to be the same as linear interpolation between the two points:

&lt;math&gt;B(t) = (1-t) P_0 + t P_1&lt;/math&gt;

You might be fancy and call &lt;math&gt;1-t&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; the Bernstein basis polynomials of degree 1, but it really is just linear interpolation.

[[File:Bezier quadratic anim.gif|200px|thumb|right|Animation of a sampling point on a quadratic Bézier curve with control points P0, P1, and P2.]]
=== Quadratic Bézier Curves ===
A more interesting Bézier curve is a quadratic Bézier curve &lt;math&gt;B(t)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; from 0 to 1 between two points &lt;math&gt;P_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P_2&lt;/math&gt; but influenced by a third point &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; in the middle. The definition is:

&lt;math&gt;B(t) = (1-t)^2 P_0 + 2(1-t)t P_1 + t^2 P_2&lt;/math&gt;

This defines a smooth curve &lt;math&gt;B(t)&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;t \in [0,1]&lt;/math&gt; that starts (for &lt;math&gt;t=0&lt;/math&gt;) from position &lt;math&gt;P_0&lt;/math&gt; in the direction to &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; but then bends to &lt;math&gt;P_2&lt;/math&gt; (and reaches it for &lt;math&gt;t=1&lt;/math&gt;).

In practice, one usually samples the interval from 0 to 1 at sufficiently many points, e.g. &lt;math&gt;B(0), B(0.05), B(0.1), B(0.15), B(0.2), ..., B(1)&lt;/math&gt; and then renders straight lines between these sample points.

===Curve Script===
To implement such a curve in Unity, we can use the Unity component [http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/ScriptReference/LineRenderer.html &lt;code&gt;LineRenderer&lt;/code&gt;]. Apart from setting some parameters, one should set the number of sample points on the curve with the function &lt;code&gt;SetVertexCount&lt;/code&gt;. Then the sample points have to be computed and set with the function &lt;code&gt;SetPosition&lt;/code&gt;. This is can be implemented this way:

&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
   var t : float; 
   var position : Vector3;
   for(var i : int = 0; i &lt; numberOfPoints; i++) 
   {
      t = i / (numberOfPoints - 1.0);
      position = (1.0 - t) * (1.0 - t) * p0 
         + 2.0 * (1.0 - t) * t * p1
         + t * t * p2;
      lineRenderer.SetPosition(i, position);
   }
&lt;/source&gt;

Here we use an index &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; from 0 to &lt;code&gt;numberOfPoints-1&lt;/code&gt; to count the sample points. From this index &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; a parameter &lt;code&gt;t&lt;/code&gt; from 0 to 1 is computed. The next line computes &lt;math&gt;B(t)&lt;/math&gt;, which is then set with the function &lt;code&gt;SetPosition&lt;/code&gt;. 

The rest of the code just sets up the &lt;code&gt;LineRenderer&lt;/code&gt; component and defines public variables that can be used to define the control points and some rendering features of the curve.

&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
@script ExecuteInEditMode()
#pragma strict

public var start : GameObject;
public var middle : GameObject;
public var end : GameObject;

public var color : Color = Color.white;
public var width : float = 0.2;
public var numberOfPoints : int = 20;

function Start() 
{
   // initialize line renderer component
   var lineRenderer : LineRenderer = 
      GetComponent(LineRenderer);
   if (null == lineRenderer)
   {
      gameObject.AddComponent(LineRenderer);
   }
   lineRenderer = GetComponent(LineRenderer);
   lineRenderer.useWorldSpace = true;
   lineRenderer.material = new Material(
      Shader.Find(&quot;Particles/Additive&quot;));
}

function Update() 
{
   // check parameters and components
   var lineRenderer : LineRenderer = 
      GetComponent(LineRenderer);
   if (null == lineRenderer || null == start 
      || null == middle || null == end)
   {
      return; // no points specified
   } 
   
   // update line renderer
   lineRenderer.SetColors(color, color);
   lineRenderer.SetWidth(width, width);
   if (numberOfPoints &gt; 0)
   {
      lineRenderer.SetVertexCount(numberOfPoints);
   }

   // set points of quadratic Bezier curve
   var p0 : Vector3 = start.transform.position;
   var p1 : Vector3 = middle.transform.position;
   var p2 : Vector3 = end.transform.position;
   var t : float; 
   var position : Vector3;
   for(var i : int = 0; i &lt; numberOfPoints; i++) 
   {
      t = i / (numberOfPoints - 1.0);
      position = (1.0 - t) * (1.0 - t) * p0 
         + 2.0 * (1.0 - t) * t * p1
         + t * t * p2;
      lineRenderer.SetPosition(i, position);
   }
}
&lt;/source&gt;
To use this script '''create''' a '''Javascript''' in the '''Project''' view, double-click it, copy &amp; paste the code above, save it, create a new empty game object (in the main menu: '''GameObject &gt; Create Empty''') and attach the script (drag the script from the '''Project''' view over the empty game object in the '''Hierarchy''').

Then create three more empty game objects (or any other game objects) with different(!) positions that will serve as control points. Select the game object with the script and drag the other game objects into the slots '''Start''', '''Middle''', and '''End''' in the '''Inspector'''. This should render a curve from the game object specified as “Start” to the game object specified as “End” bending towards “Middle”.

[[File:Circle and quadratic bezier.svg|200px|thumb|right|A quadratic Bézier spline out of 8 quadratic Bézier curves.]]
=== Quadratic Bézier Splines ===
A quadratic Bézier Spline is just a continuous, smooth curve that consist of segments that are quadratic Bézier curves. If the control points of the curves were chosen arbitrarily, the spline would neither be continuous nor smooth; thus, the control points have to be chosen in particular ways.

One common way is to use a certain set of user-specified control points (green circles in the figure) as the &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; control points of the segments and to choose the center positions between two adjacent user-specified control points as the &lt;math&gt;P_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P_2&lt;/math&gt; control points (black rectangles in the figure). This actually guarantees that the spline is smooth (also in the mathematical sense that the tangent vector is continuous).

=== Spline Script ===
The following script implements this idea. For the j-th segment, it computes &lt;math&gt;P_0&lt;/math&gt; as the average of the j-th and (j+1)-th user-specified control points, &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; is set to the (j+1)-th user-specified control point, and &lt;math&gt;P_2&lt;/math&gt; is the average of the (j+1)-th and (j+2)-th user-specified control points:

&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
      p0 = 0.5 * (controlPoints[j].transform.position 
         + controlPoints[j + 1].transform.position);
      p1 = controlPoints[j + 1].transform.position;
      p2 = 0.5 * (controlPoints[j + 1].transform.position 
         + controlPoints[j + 2].transform.position);
&lt;/source&gt;

Each individual segment is then just computed as a quadratic Bézier curve. The only adjustment is that all but the last segment should not reach &lt;math&gt;P_2&lt;/math&gt;. If they did, the first sample position of the next segment would be at the same position which would be visible in the rendering. The complete script is:

&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
@script ExecuteInEditMode()
#pragma strict

public var controlPoints : GameObject[] = new GameObject[3];
public var color : Color = Color.white;
public var width : float = 0.2;
public var numberOfPoints : int = 20;

function Start() 
{
   // initialize line renderer component
   var lineRenderer : LineRenderer = 
      GetComponent(LineRenderer);
   if (null == lineRenderer)
   {
      gameObject.AddComponent(LineRenderer);
   }
   lineRenderer = GetComponent(LineRenderer);
   lineRenderer.useWorldSpace = true;
   lineRenderer.material = new Material(
      Shader.Find(&quot;Particles/Additive&quot;));
}

function Update() 
{
   // check parameters and components
   var lineRenderer : LineRenderer = 
      GetComponent(LineRenderer);
   if (null == lineRenderer || controlPoints == null 
      || controlPoints.length &lt; 3)
   {
      return; // not enough points specified
   } 
   
   // update line renderer
   lineRenderer.SetColors(color, color);
   lineRenderer.SetWidth(width, width);
   if (numberOfPoints &lt; 2)
   {
      numberOfPoints = 2;
   }
   lineRenderer.SetVertexCount(numberOfPoints * 
      (controlPoints.length - 2));

   // loop over segments of spline
   var p0 : Vector3;
   var p1 : Vector3;
   var p2 : Vector3;
   for (var j : int = 0; j &lt; controlPoints.length - 2; j++)
   {
      // check control points
      if (controlPoints[j] == null || 
         controlPoints[j + 1] == null ||
         controlPoints[j + 2] == null)
      {
         return;  
      }
      // determine control points of segment
      p0 = 0.5 * (controlPoints[j].transform.position 
         + controlPoints[j + 1].transform.position);
      p1 = controlPoints[j + 1].transform.position;
      p2 = 0.5 * (controlPoints[j + 1].transform.position 
         + controlPoints[j + 2].transform.position);
      
      // set points of quadratic Bezier curve
      var position : Vector3;
      var t : float; 
      var pointStep : float = 1.0 / numberOfPoints;
      if (j == controlPoints.length - 3)
      {
         pointStep = 1.0 / (numberOfPoints - 1.0);
         // last point of last segment should reach p2
      }  
      for(var i : int = 0; i &lt; numberOfPoints; i++) 
      {
         t = i * pointStep;
         position = (1.0 - t) * (1.0 - t) * p0 
            + 2.0 * (1.0 - t) * t * p1
            + t * t * p2;
         lineRenderer.SetPosition(i + j * numberOfPoints, 
            position);
      }
   }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

The script works in the same way as the script for Bézier curves except that the user can specify an arbitrary number of control points. For closed splines, the last two user-specified control points should be the same as the first two control points. For open splines that actually reach the end points, the first and last control point should be specified twice.

=== Summary ===
In this tutorial, we have looked at:
* the definition of linear and quadratic Bézier curves and quadratic Bézier splines
* implementations of quadratic Bézier curves and quadratic Bézier splines with Unity's LineRenderer component. 

===Further Reading===

If you want to know more 
* about Bézier curves (and Bézier splines), the Wikipedia article on [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zier_curve “Bézier curve”] provides a good starting point.
* about Unity's LineRenderer, you should read Unity's documentation of the class [http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/ScriptReference/LineRenderer.html LineRenderer].

* &lt;font size=3&gt;The first meter was installed in 1929. All stamps (except Type E2) are inscribed “CORREOS MEXICO” or “MEXICO CORREOS”.
* The stamps have a variety of numbers and prefixes: a meter number usually with “MAQ No” or “MAQ M” prefix, and a license or permit number, usually with “LIC No”, “PERM” or “PERM No” prefix. Often stamps show only one of these numbers rather than both a meter and a permit number.
* The stamps are grouped according to appearance and use:
:: A - Small upright rectangle with radiating lines at sides
:: B - Upright rectangle with internal frame lines but no ornaments
:: C - Open design with eagle between town mark and value box
:: D - Rectangle with single or double straight-line non-ornamental border
:: E - Open design without outer frame
:: F - Rectangle with elaborate ornamental border
:: G - Nearly square design with eagle and snake and cactus at right
:: H - Nearly square design with eagle man at right and cactus at left
:: I - Frank with simulated perforation border at top, bottom and left and with monument at right
:: J - Digital frank, unframed, with eagle head motif and 2D bar code
:: PO – Digital stamps generated by machines in Post Offices

* For specialized information about the meter stamps of Mexico, see ''Mexico Postage Meter Stamp Catalog'', by Douglas A. Kelsey, Mexico-Elmhurst Philatelic Society International, 1994.

== Can I actually use this content... ==

Hi,

I am brand new to wikibooks and was just wondering if I can actually use the content found here and in the books to build my website if I attribute it properly and license the site appropriately?  [[User:Yosef Karo|Yosef Karo]] ([[User talk:Yosef Karo|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Yosef Karo|contribs]]) 10:04, 30 September 2012 (UTC)
:Yes, you can &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 09:11, 1 October 2012 (UTC)
== NEW BOOK? ==

I was wondering if a new book should be created called &quot;BEYOND BLENDER RENDER: A GUIDE TO THE BLENDER GAME ENGINE&quot;. I know about &quot;NOOB TO PRO&quot; but that is for an earlier version of Blender (2.49 I believe). This would be for 2.63 (a). [[User:Downdate|Downdate]] ([[User talk:Downdate|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Downdate|contribs]]) 16:36, 8 October 2012 (UTC)

:Would this be taking the existing content of Noob to Pro and simply updating it?  If so, then it might be better to simply update Noob to Pro and note any discussions that require a particular version to make use of, with [[Template:B3D:N2P/ForVersion]].  If it'd be drastically different, there are already several [[Subject:Blender 3D|books on Blender 3D]], so I don't see why you couldn't begin another, should you have an inclination to see it through.  Please see [[Help:Contents]] for tips on getting started. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|discuss]]&lt;/small&gt; 04:32, 14 October 2012 (UTC)

== Fundraising localization: volunteers from outside the USA needed ==

''Please translate for your local community''

Hello All,

The Wikimedia Foundation's Fundraising team have begun our 'User Experience' project, with the goal of understanding the donation experience in different countries outside the USA and enhancing the localization of our donation pages. I am searching for volunteers to spend 30 minutes on a Skype chat with me, reviewing their own country's donation pages. It will be done on a 'usability' format (I will ask you to read the text and go through the donation flow) and will be asking your feedback in the meanwhile. 

The only pre-requisite is for the volunteer to actually live in the country and to have access to at least one donation method that we offer for that country (mainly credit/debit card, but also real-time banking like IDEAL, E-wallets, etc...) so we can do a live test and see if the donation goes through. ''All volunteers will be reimbursed of the donations that eventually succeed'' (and they will be low amounts, like 1-2 dollars)

By helping us you are actually helping thousands of people to support our mission of free knowledge across the world. Please sing up and help us with our 'User Experience' project! :)
If you are interested (or know of anyone who could be) please email ppena@wikimedia.org. All countries needed (excepting USA)!

Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;

== Open textbook hacking ==

A few groups are doing great work producing open texts.  Siyavula is building them from scratch, Saylor Foundation is doing both de novo and compilation work, combining anything freely readable online.  Boundless is doing compilation work, combining freely-licensed texts. 

[[Siyavula]] focuses on K-12 books for South Africa.  They are amazing, but not all here on Wikibooks yet! 

The [[Saylor Foundation]] is compiling college texts in a number of fields, matching the core courses needed, from existing materials that are free to use (online or in educational purposes).   Again, they're not all here yet; I'm not sure they are all cc-sa compatible.  See their  [http://www.saylor.org/otc/ Open Textbook Challenge].

[[Boundless]] is doing the same thing, as a for-profit that hopes to add extra services on top of OER texts in the future.  They are starting a series of book hackathons to pull together existing open materials into more coherent books (say, of Light &amp; Matter quality).  cf. boundless.com

Finally, [[Light and Matter]] is the best single-author set of OER texts ever written; thanks to [[user:Bcrowell|Ben Crowell]].  Who also wrote a lot of [[Modern Greek]] :)  We should talk more with him about how to better support and replicate that work.

=== Physics textbook hackathon ===
A physics textbook booksprint is taking place in Boston (and online) Nov 2-4, hosted by Boundless.  You can rsvp to attend in person [http://www.eventbrite.com/orderstart?ebtv=C on eventbrite].    I'll be there along with some of the boston-area wikipedians and text-hackers.  Perhaps we could organize online remote hacking here on wikibooks?  Let me know if this sounds interesting.  Or if you have subject areasd you'd like to see such a hackathon cover: the topic scope is yet to be decided.  Clearly we should expand and improve on what Light and Matter already offer [again, not all entirely replicated here on WB!] [[User:Sj|Sj]] ([[User talk:Sj|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Sj|contribs]]) 01:07, 19 October 2012 (UTC)

== Android ==

Hi folks. I've been contributing to the book [[Android]] for a while, adding a chapter on testing, but I'm wanting to edit some of the rest of it now, and  the user [[user:Fishpi]] who seems to have started the book doesn't have a user page... so has presumably vanished. Is it acceptable protocol for me to take the book over and expand the bits that aren't mine, like Wikipedia? I'd prefer to collude with Fishpi.

I'm also confused about who's reviewing the text and setting the quality 'minimal' - makes it sound like I'm not doing a very good job. :)

[[User:SleekWeasel|SleekWeasel]] ([[User talk:SleekWeasel|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SleekWeasel|contribs]]) 10:49, 22 October 2012 (UTC)

: Hi!

: Fishpi has been around moderately recently; see [[Special:Contributions/Fishpi]].

: To check for lurking past contributors to a book before &quot;adopting&quot; it for '''major''' changes, it's common to put an inquiry on the book's main talk page saying what you have in mind and asking for advice/help/etc.  In this case, that would be [[Talk:Android]].  Also, if there is a more-or-less-single author one can also inquire at their user talk page, in this case [[User talk:Fishpi]].  Depending on how extreme the change is going to be, one '''''might''''' wait as much as a week before proceeding, but it really does depend on the whole context of the situation, like how &quot;big&quot; the change you have in mind is.  It looks like there's a related chapter, [[Using Wikibooks/Contributing To An Existing Wikibook]], in the Featured Book [[Using Wikibooks]].

: Our textbooks are collaborative; so don't be shy about helping out with them, ''especially'' if what you have in mind really isn't destructive to the content or organization of what's already there.  You seem to be very respectful of past contribution to the book, so I suspect you'll be fine.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 13:00, 22 October 2012 (UTC)
== Improving communication between your wiki and &quot;tech people&quot; ==

Hi. I'm posting this as part of my job for the WMF, where I currently work on technical communications.

As you'll probably agree, communication between Wikipedia contributors and &quot;tech people&quot; (primarily MediaWiki developers, but also designers and other engineers) hasn't always been ideal. In recent years, Wikimedia employees have made efforts to become more transparent, for example by writing [[mw:Category:Wikimedia engineering reports|monthly activity reports]], by providing [[mw:Wikimedia Features engineering|hubs listing current activities]], and by maintaining &quot;[[mw:VisualEditor|activity pages]]&quot; for each significant activity. Furthermore, the [[mw:Wikimedia Engineering/2012-13 Goals|yearly engineering goals]] for the WMF were developed publicly, and the more granular [[:mw:Roadmap|Roadmap]] is updated weekly.

Now, that's all well and such, but what I'd rather like to discuss is how we can better engage in true collaboration and 2-way discussion, not just reports and announcements. It's easy to post a link to a new feature that's already been implemented, and tell users &quot;Please provide feedback!&quot;. It's much more difficult to truly collaborate every step of the way, from the early planning to deployment.

Some &quot;big&quot; tech projects sponsored by the WMF are lucky enough to have [[w:User:Okeyes (WMF)|Oliver Keyes]] who can spend a lot of time discussing with editors, basically incarnating this 2-way communication channel between users and engineering staff. But Oliver can only do so much: he has to focus on a handful of features, and primarily discusses with the English Wikipedia community. We want to be able to do this for dozens of engineering projects with hundreds of wikis, in many languages, and truly collaborate to build new features together. Hiring hundreds of Community Liaisons isn't really a viable option.

There are probably things in the way we do tech stuff (e.g. new software features and deployments) that drive you insane. You probably have lots of ideas about what the ideal situation should be, and how to get there: What can the developer community (staff and volunteers) do to get there? (in the short term, medium term, long term?) What can users do to get there?

I certainly don't claim to have all the answers, and I can't do a proper job to improve things without your help. So please help me help make your lives easier, and speak up.

This is intended to be a very open discussion. Unapologetic complaining is fine; suggestions are also welcome. Stock of ponies is limited. [[User:Guillom|guillom]] ([[User talk:Guillom|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Guillom|contribs]]) 14:40, 23 October 2012 (UTC)

:I would suggest having a central page that summarizes requests for the inclusion of extensions and the reasons for not including these extensions. And it would be good to have someone checking whether the reasons still apply on a periodic basis.

::That's a really nice idea, thanks for bringing this up. It's the first time I've heard this suggestion; I'll make a note of it.

== University professor concerned about the use of plagiarism detection tools ==

I am a professor at a university in Washington State.  My concern is how to detect plagiarism in university papers.  I have discovered a clever pattern my MBA students are using to avoid detection of their use of plagiarism (such as from Wikipedia). After cobbling together content (direct and indirect quotations) from various sources,  the students use a plagiarism detection tool to identify which parts of their paper need to be modified to avoid detection of lack of any attribution.  

I discovered that the student used without attribution a Log Normal Probability density function on http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-normal_distribution that has the caption:  &quot;Some log-normal density functions with identical location parameter μ but differing scale parameters.&quot;

I very much need your help in identifying the unattributed source for the following description (of the above log-normal distribution).

For example:  “Figure 6, presented below, illustrates several log-normal distribution shapes as an example of how distributions can vary widely depending on the nature of the process.  Looking at the highly skewed example, it is easy to see how an assumption of normality could greatly under-predict defect rates in the direction counter to the skew.”

:I'm not a lawyer...
:Using content for specific articles from Wikipedia is not a clear cut copyright infringement, since encyclopedic articles do not get copyright protection, only the aggregate work (collection). It still would constitute plagiarism (claiming other people work) in some of the more complex articles (some do go beyond being simple encyclopedic articles) but it would be disputable if they have any creative content, since the objective is to report facts.
:Note that images have their own copyright and some do require direct attribution. Tables and data collections do not have copyright protection unless they go beyond factual information and use creative content or reflect the result of some specific work (for example statistics and not absolutes, having a table without providing source information would serve no purpose).

:This is a very useful essay on Wikipedia - [[w:Wikipedia:Close_paraphrasing|Close Paraphrasing]]. It contains advice on how to detect plagiarism, even if the words have been changed. It isn't something that is easy to do though. However, for an expert in the field (which I presume you are) it should be relatively easy to list down the articles and sources a student is likely to have plagiarised and then use the structural tests. With a little practice you'll find before too long that you can spot a problem very quickly. Taken from that essay ([https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Close_paraphrasing&amp;oldid=513774396 attribution]:

* Look for disjointed and sudden changes in the tone, vocabulary, and style of content introduced by the same contributor. For example, &quot;The cat is a small predatory carnivorous species of crepuscular mammal. Housecats like to kill mice and bats.&quot;
* Look for redundant content; this may be a sign that two or more sources were closely paraphrased. For example, &quot;The cat is a small predatory carnivorous species of crepuscular mammal. Like many pets, domestic cats are carnivorous.&quot;
* Look for content that resembles content included in a quotation.
* Examine the talk pages of major contributors and other pages where they have written in their own words, and determine if their article contributions substantially differ in tone, structure, and vocabulary from these discussions.
* Take short phrases from the article and put them in a search engine. Take a look at the results and see if they closely resemble the article.

== Installing [[mw:Extension:SubpageSortkey|Extension:SubpageSortkey]] ==

Hi!

After the recent review of the [[mw:Extension:SubpageSortkey|Extension:SubpageSortkey]], it is finally ready to be deployed on Wikibooks project(s), to improve the categorization system as described on [[Wikibooks:Reading room/Archives/2010/June#DefaultSortkey for namespaces with subpages]].

Per [[bugzilla:22911#c30|Sumana's comment]] on our request, all we need is to confirm we still want that feature. From [[bugzilla:22911#c11|comment 11]], the configuration here on English Wikibooks would be:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;php&quot; enclose=&quot;pre&quot;&gt;
$wgSubpageSortkeyByNamespace[NS_MAIN] = '1..';
$wgSubpageSortkeyByNamespace[102] = '1..'; // Cookbook
$wgSubpageSortkeyByNamespace[110] = '1..'; // Wikijunior
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
Maybe also something else, since [[Template:BookCat]] has a #switch depending on namespace which seems to change the sortkey in other specific cases...

So, can it be installed with this configuration? If necessary, please take a look at the [[mw:Extension:SubpageSortkey#Usage|documentation]] to suggest an improved configuration. [[:pt:User:Helder.wiki|Helder]] 14:37, 25 July 2012 (UTC)

:The switch disables categorizing on discussion pages and files templates into a special category name and also files that special book-specific template category into the book's category.  The actual sort key value does not change unless you specify {{para|filing|deep}}.  The 1.. value seems to be quite fine to me, allowing the use of simple &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:Blah]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; code to reduce the barrier to entry for newcomers and even allow for a bit better performance on the wiki. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|discuss]]&lt;/small&gt; 11:10, 26 July 2012 (UTC)

[[File:Finite difference spline example.png|200px|thumb|left|A Hermite spline that interpolates smoothly between pairs of control points.]]
This tutorial discusses Hermite curves (more exactly: cubic Hermite curves) and Catmull-Rom splines in Unity. The latter are a special kind of cubic Hermite splines. No shader programming is required since all the code is implemented in JavaScript.

Some splines (for example the quadratic Bézier spline discussed in {{Cg Programming Unity SectionRef|Bézier Curves}}) don't go through all control points, i.e. they don't interpolate between them. Hermite splines, on the other hand, can be defined such that they go through all control points. This is a useful feature in many applications, e.g. in animation where it is often important to set specific values for particular key frames and let tools smoothly interpolate further values for inbetweens.

[[File:Hermite spline 2-segments.svg|200px|thumb|right|Two Hermite curves. The first curve goes from p0 to p1 with tangent m0 at p0 and tangent m1 at p1.]]
=== Hermite Curves ===
A single cubic Hermite curve &lt;math&gt;H(t)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; from 0 to 1 is defined by a start point &lt;math&gt;P_0&lt;/math&gt; with tangent &lt;math&gt;M_0&lt;/math&gt; and an end point &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; with tangent &lt;math&gt;M_1&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;H(t) = (2t^3-3t^2+1) P_0 + (t^3-2t^2+t) M_0 + (-2t^3+3t^2) P_1 +(t^3-t^2) M_1&lt;/math&gt;

The curve starts (for &lt;math&gt;t = 0&lt;/math&gt;) at &lt;math&gt;P_0&lt;/math&gt; in direction of &lt;math&gt;M_0&lt;/math&gt; and then changes course to direction &lt;math&gt;M_1&lt;/math&gt; and reaches &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;t = 1&lt;/math&gt;. As the figure illustrates, two Hermite curves can be smoothly attached to each other by choosing the same tangent vector for the corresponding end points. 

===Curve Script===
To implement such a curve in Unity, we can use the Unity component [http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/ScriptReference/LineRenderer.html &lt;code&gt;LineRenderer&lt;/code&gt;]. Apart from setting some parameters, one should set the number of sample points on the curve with the function &lt;code&gt;SetVertexCount&lt;/code&gt;. Then the sample points have to be computed and set with the function &lt;code&gt;SetPosition&lt;/code&gt;. This is can be implemented this way:

&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
   var t : float; 
   var position : Vector3;
   for(var i : int = 0; i &lt; numberOfPoints; i++) 
   {
      t = i / (numberOfPoints - 1.0);
      position = (2.0*t*t*t - 3.0*t*t + 1.0) * p0  
         + (t*t*t - 2.0*t*t + t) * m0
         + (-2.0*t*t*t + 3.0*t*t) * p1
         + (t*t*t - t*t) * m1;
      lineRenderer.SetPosition(i, position);
   }
&lt;/source&gt;

Here we use an index &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; from 0 to &lt;code&gt;numberOfPoints-1&lt;/code&gt; to count the sample points. From this index &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; a parameter &lt;code&gt;t&lt;/code&gt; from 0 to 1 is computed. The next line computes &lt;math&gt;H(t)&lt;/math&gt;, which is then set with the function &lt;code&gt;SetPosition&lt;/code&gt;. 

The rest of the code just sets up the &lt;code&gt;LineRenderer&lt;/code&gt; component and defines public variables that can be used to define the control points and some rendering features of the curve.

&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
@script ExecuteInEditMode()
#pragma strict

public var start : GameObject;
public var startTangentPoint : GameObject;
public var end : GameObject;
public var endTangentPoint : GameObject;

public var color : Color = Color.white;
public var width : float = 0.2;
public var numberOfPoints : int = 20;

function Start() 
{
   // initialize line renderer component
   var lineRenderer : LineRenderer = 
      GetComponent(LineRenderer);
   if (null == lineRenderer)
   {
      gameObject.AddComponent(LineRenderer);
   }
   lineRenderer = GetComponent(LineRenderer);
   lineRenderer.useWorldSpace = true;
   lineRenderer.material = new Material(
      Shader.Find(&quot;Particles/Additive&quot;));
}

function Update() 
{
   // check parameters and components
   var lineRenderer : LineRenderer = 
      GetComponent(LineRenderer);
   if (null == lineRenderer 
      || null == start || null == startTangentPoint
      || null == end || null == endTangentPoint)
   {
      return; // no points specified
   } 
   
   // update line renderer
   lineRenderer.SetColors(color, color);
   lineRenderer.SetWidth(width, width);
   if (numberOfPoints &gt; 0)
   {
      lineRenderer.SetVertexCount(numberOfPoints);
   }

   // set points of Hermite curve
   var p0 : Vector3 = start.transform.position;
   var p1 : Vector3 = end.transform.position;
   var m0 : Vector3 = startTangentPoint.transform.position 
      - start.transform.position;
   var m1 : Vector3 = endTangentPoint.transform.position
      - end.transform.position;
   var t : float; 
   var position : Vector3;
   for(var i : int = 0; i &lt; numberOfPoints; i++) 
   {
      t = i / (numberOfPoints - 1.0);
      position = (2.0*t*t*t - 3.0*t*t + 1.0) * p0  
         + (t*t*t - 2.0*t*t + t) * m0
         + (-2.0*t*t*t + 3.0*t*t) * p1
         + (t*t*t - t*t) * m1;
      lineRenderer.SetPosition(i, position);
   }
}
&lt;/source&gt;
To use this script '''create''' a '''Javascript''' in the '''Project''' view, double-click it, copy &amp; paste the code above, save it, create a new empty game object (in the main menu: '''GameObject &gt; Create Empty''') and attach the script (drag the script from the '''Project''' view over the empty game object in the '''Hierarchy''').

Then create four more empty game objects (or any other game objects) with different(!) positions that will serve as control points. Select the game object with the script and drag the other game objects into the slots '''Start''', '''StartTangentPoint''' (for the end point of a tangent starting in the start point), '''End''', and '''EndTangentPoint''' in the '''Inspector'''. This should render a Hermite curve from the game object specified as “Start” to the game object specified as “End”.

[[File:Catmull-rom-tangent.svg|200px|thumb|right|Computation of tangents in Catmull-Rom splines.]]
=== Catmull-Rom Splines ===
A cubic Hermite spline consists of a continuous, smooth sequence of cubic Hermite curves. In order to guarantee smoothness, the tangent at the end point of one Hermite curve is the same as the tangent of the start point of the next Hermite curve. In some cases, users provide these tangents (one for each control point), in other cases, however, appropriate tangents have to be computed. 

One specific way of computing a tangent vector &lt;math&gt;m_k&lt;/math&gt; for the k-th control point &lt;math&gt;p_k&lt;/math&gt; is this:

&lt;math&gt;m_k = \frac{p_{k+1} - p_{k-1}}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

and &lt;math&gt;m_k = p_{k+1} - p_{k}&lt;/math&gt; for the first point and &lt;math&gt;m_k = p_{k} - p_{k-1}&lt;/math&gt; for the last point. The resulting cubic Hermite spline is called Catmull-Rom spline.

=== Spline Script ===
The following script implements this idea. For the j-th segment, it computes &lt;math&gt;P_0&lt;/math&gt; as the j-th control point &lt;math&gt;p_j&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; is set to &lt;math&gt;p_{j+1}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;M_0&lt;/math&gt; is set to &lt;math&gt;(p_{j+1} - p_{j-1})/2&lt;/math&gt; (unless it is the tangent of the first control point, in which case it is set to &lt;math&gt;p_{j+1} - p_{j}&lt;/math&gt;) and &lt;math&gt;M_1&lt;/math&gt; is set to &lt;math&gt;(p_{j+2} - p_{j})/2&lt;/math&gt; (unless it is the tangent of the last control point, then it is set to &lt;math&gt;p_{j+1} - p_{j}&lt;/math&gt;).

&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
      p0 = controlPoints[j].transform.position;
      p1 = controlPoints[j + 1].transform.position;
      if (j &gt; 0) 
      {
         m0 = 0.5 * (controlPoints[j + 1].transform.position 
         - controlPoints[j - 1].transform.position);
      }
      else
      {
         m0 = controlPoints[j + 1].transform.position 
         - controlPoints[j].transform.position;
      }
      if (j &lt; controlPoints.length - 2)
      {
         m1 = 0.5 * (controlPoints[j + 2].transform.position 
         - controlPoints[j].transform.position);
      }
      else
      {
         m1 = controlPoints[j + 1].transform.position 
         - controlPoints[j].transform.position;
      }   &lt;/source&gt;

Each individual segment is then just computed as a cubic Hermite curve. The only adjustment is that all but the last segment should not reach &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt;. If they did, the first sample position of the next segment would be at the same position which would be visible in the rendering. The complete script is:

&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
@script ExecuteInEditMode()
#pragma strict

public var controlPoints : GameObject[] = new GameObject[3];
public var color : Color = Color.white;
public var width : float = 0.2;

{

      else
      {
         m1 = controlPoints[j + 1].transform.position 
         - controlPoints[j].transform.position;
      }   
      
      // set points of Hermite curve
      var position : Vector3;
      var t : float; 
      var pointStep : float = 1.0 / numberOfPoints;
      if (j == controlPoints.length - 2)
      {
         pointStep = 1.0 / (numberOfPoints - 1.0);
         // last point of last segment should reach p1
      }  
      for(var i : int = 0; i &lt; numberOfPoints; i++) 
      {
         t = i * pointStep;
         position = (2.0*t*t*t - 3.0*t*t + 1.0) * p0  
            + (t*t*t - 2.0*t*t + t) * m0
            + (-2.0*t*t*t + 3.0*t*t) * p1
            + (t*t*t - t*t) * m1;
         lineRenderer.SetPosition(i + j * numberOfPoints, 
            position);
      }
   }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

The script works in the same way as the script for Hermite curves except that the user can specify an arbitrary number of control points and doesn't have to specify tangent points. 

=== Summary ===
In this tutorial, we have looked at:
* the definition of cubic Hermite curves and Catmull-Rom splines
* implementations of cubic Hermite curves and Catmull-Rom splines with Unity's LineRenderer component. 

===Further Reading===

If you want to know more 
* about Hermite splines, the Wikipedia article on [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubic_Hermite_spline “cubic Hermite spline”] provides a good starting point.
* about Unity's LineRenderer, you should read Unity's documentation of the class [http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/ScriptReference/LineRenderer.html LineRenderer].

      <text xml:space="preserve">If you are having trouble make a connection between the WifiLapper app and Pitside over Wifi, here are a few tips.

== Check the Wifidots ==
First things first you'll need to make sure the phone is in range of the router. This can done by opening pitside and loading the Database corresponds to the sessions you were having issues in. In the example below you can see that both Wifi Dots channels logged something during a lap. This indicates that the phone was &quot;seeing&quot; the selected Wifi Network. As you can see, the connection was available for a while (about 15 seconds).

== Making Changes ==
Depending on the Android phone model, the Wifi connection interval can be set anywhere from 2 to 90 seconds from the factory. We can edit these parameters to speed up the connection time of WifiLapper to Pitside. The phone will need to be rooted to make this change. Beware that rooting your phone may void your Warranty or violate your wireless carrier contract. If you don't know how to root your phone, Google it. Be warned if something isn't done right during the rooting process, damage can be done to the phone. It's pretty hard to hurt Android phones, or &quot;brick it&quot; in hacking terms, but anything is possibly in experimental hacking. Users have reported getting it wrong 5 times on a phone while attempting to root it, but no physical harm was done to the device. As always, your mileage may vary. Consider this prior warning.

After the phone has been rooted, use [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rhmsoft.fm File Manager] to gain access to the &quot;build.prop&quot; file. Start by opening the File Manager app and open the setting menu, scroll to the bottom and enable Root Explorer and Mount System Folders.



Use the Up button to get to the root folder (usually 2 taps)



Find the &quot;system&quot; folder, click it



You should now see the build.prop file in the current folder



Tap and Hold on the file until the following menu comes up



Tap Permissions

Make a note of how the File Permissions are set before making any changes. You will want to set them back to this when we are finished editing.

Enable Read, Write and Execute permissions for all 3 groups to allow the file to be edited. They may not all have to be enabled but it always works this way



Close the menu and tap &quot;build.prop&quot;

Choose &quot;Open as Text&quot;



Be careful while in here, changes may break stuff** Now find the line that reads &quot;wifi.supplicant_scan_interval=&quot;.  This is how many seconds between attempts to connect to a known WiFi Network.  Some phones are set to 90 seconds. For typical lap times at most race tracks, that means the window of connection opportunity is very limited. The WifiLapper team recommends setting the wifi.supplicant_scan_interval to 2 seconds.

Make sure you Save the changes when you exit. It is also a good idea to return the &quot;build.prop&quot; file permissions to how they were originally found to prevent any accidental changes in the future.



Reboot the phone. The changes don't take effect until rebooted. Run some test laps at safe speeds around your neighborhood to verify WiFi connection to Pitside.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Flip Classrooms&lt;ref&gt;www.wilkes.edu&lt;/ref&gt;

Part I
Flip Classrooms
Trend hypothesis: 
 The trend of flipping classroom is when the teacher substitutes in-class instruction with at home video instruction and utilizes class time for homework assignments and other project based learning activities.  Several concepts support this style of teaching.  First space will be freed up during in-class time to allow for more just in time instruction and activities in smaller groups enabling the instructor to conduct inquiry-based learning.  Another concept of a flipped classroom is it integrates technology into learning and reinforces the classroom time to discussion and collaboration which reinforces the learning process. 
Description of Trend :
 Flipping a classroom is gaining a lot of momentum in teaching.  Professor Eric Mazur tested this style of instruction back in the 1990’s at Harvard.  Salmen Khan has generated over 2200 videos used for the purpose of educating.   He has created the Khan Academy which utilizes this trend.  The idea is that students learn the lesson at home through videos and other technologies.  In class instruction is spent doing homework assignments and inquiry based projects.  This type of teaching is a form of blended learning which incorporates technology with face to face learning.  
Khan Academy has revolutionized this type of teaching.  They have recently developed a software program which teaches math and are working on incorporating into other subject areas.  The initial learning of the lessons occurs at home through videos.  This gives students the opportunity to learn at their own pace.  If a student doesn’t understand a concept they are able to rewind the video and replay to review the concept and better understand.  For students that do not have computers alternative locations are available.  
Khan Academy provides teachers with a dashboard which enables teachers to monitor student progress.  Teachers can track individual student progress and progress as a whole class.  Teachers can monitor time spent on specific topics by individual students.   When teachers notice specific students are struggling with a topic or problem they are able to work one on one or in small groups to conduct a mini workshop.  While working with those struggling students the remainder of the class is able to continue to work on other activities or project based learning.  This type of teaching allows instructors to use their time more effectively with students.   This concept takes passivity out of the classroom and the teacher becomes more of a coach or a mentor as oppose to a lecturer.  
Flip Classroom is a constructivist approach to learning.
Constructivism is a theory of learning which allows a person to understand meaning through individual successions.  This trend of flipping the classroom incorporates this theory into practice.  Students learn through activities and project based learning after they have developed an understanding based on lessons they watched prior to class time.  Students learn assigned lessons prior to scheduled class time.  Students learn at their own pace through videos and/or other technological resources.  This type of learning provides the student with the opportunity to learn information at a pace that is conducive to their learning needs.   Students in a flip classroom are able to take what they have learned at home and apply it in a classroom setting through inquiry based projects and assignments. Teachers are able to provide just in time instruction based on student’s understanding, knowledge, and needs.  Students apply their understanding of the assigned lesson from the night before and demonstrate through projects and activities in class.  
This style of learning applies Lev Vygotsky zone of proximal development (ZPD).  ZPD is the range of tasks that are too difficult for a child to master alone but can be learned with guidance and assistance of adults or more skilled children. The lower limit of the ZPD is the level of skill reached by the child working independently, whereas the upper limit is the level of additional responsibility the child can accept with the assistance of the  instructor.  A student in a flip classroom applies this style of learning into his work by taking what he learns and demonstrates through a level of independence in the assignment.  If the student falls at the lower limit of the zone of proximal development the instructor is there to assist him.  Flip classrooms can be a great facilitator in developing student understanding and collaboration. 
Flip Classrooms and traditional instructional design models
Robert Gagne is a behaviorist who identified nine events of instruction.  His first event is to gain the attention of the learner.  In a flip classroom this can be accomplished through the teacher video.  As with any lesson it is important to “hook” the student’s interest so they will listen or watch what is being presented.  In a flip classroom there is more opportunity for teachers to be creative in grabbing a student’s interest.  The next event Gagne identifies is to inform the leaner of the objective.  This can successfully be accomplished in a flip classroom environment because teachers have the ability to incorporate in the video repetition as it relates to the objective.  By repeating what the students will be learning it provides reminders to what they are learning which in turn reinforces the goal(s) of the lesson, what they are expected to accomplish, and how they will be able to use the information.  Step three of Gagne’s events of instruction is to recall prior knowledge.  In a flip classroom environment the teacher will be able to incorporate recall of prior knowledge within the video the student will watch.  It can also be reinforced the day before as the assignment is being give.  In the lesson the teacher develops she will provide scaffolding techniques to stimulate this recollection.  In a flip classroom a teacher has the ability to be repetitive which further reinforces to this third event.  A teacher will also be able to provide additional detail, hints, information, concept, etc. to further stimulate the student’s memory.  Part of the at home assignment can include concept maps which will help learners to remember prior knowledge along with new knowledge being generated.  This will help the student “chunk” new information which is Gagne’s fourth event in his instructional model.  Events five through nine are reinforced during the in class activities and assignments.  Gagne’s nine steps can be modeled in a flip classroom because ultimately the goal in this style of learning is to provide more hands on time with the teacher directing the students.  This way of teaching helps students when they are incorporating new information and developing new ideas.  This way of teaching and thinking falls in line with Bloom’s Taxonomy creating, evaluating, and analyzing learning domains.
Shortcomings of traditional instructional software 
Aaron Sams (2011) in his article Setting the flip straight explains in a brief format the history of this concept.  There have been many versions of flip classrooms which have been around for several years.  For example, screencasting model or vodcasting.  It is important to remember that the Khan Academy, screencasting, or other models are not to be a substitute for an actual course.  These styles of learning do not replace the role of a live teacher. Many opponents to technology and blended learning believe that this style of educating is not a logical curriculum of study.  They believe it does not engage students at all the cerebral platforms in which a student needs in order to master subjects and successfully learn.  
Sams stated, “Khan Academy is great for learning about lots of different subjects. But it’s not really adequate for learning those subjects on a level that really makes a difference in the world” (Sams, 2011, retrieved from http://www.thedailyriff.com/articles/the-flipped-class-shedding-light-on-the-confusion-critique-and-hype-801.php).   He believes for knowledge to occur it takes more than “watching videos (or lectures) and doing exercises. It takes hard work (by both the learner and the instructor)” (Sams, 2011, retrieved fromhttp://www.thedailyriff.com/articles/the-flipped-class-shedding-light-on-the-confusion-critique-and-hype-801.php).
	In order for successful uses of technology in the classroom, as that required by flip classrooms it does require teachers to be prepared.  This requires professional development geared towards preparing teachers to use technology.  Harold Wenglinsky (1998) conducted a national study  of technology’s impact on mathematic achievement.  The findings showed when computers were used students in fourth and eighth grade achieved academic success in mathematics. 
Seymour Papert and Idit Harel (1991) have initiated the learning by design model to educational technology by having the student be the designer and creator of such software.  This places the student as the developer of programs for other students to learn.   Seymour Papert defines constructionism as &quot;Giving children good things to do so that they can learn by doing much better than they could before.&quot; (retrieved from http://www.papert.org/articles/const_inst/const_inst1.html)

The [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_food| local food] movement has mobilized many in support of its cause. Participants in this social movement are often called [http://locavores.com locavores], a term coined in 2005 for World Environment Day and named the Oxford American Dictionary word of the year in 2007.

This article seeks to examine the local food movement through social movement criteria developed by Eyerman and Jamison in 1991&lt;ref&gt;Eyerman, R., &amp; Jamison, A. (1991). Social Movements: A Cognitive Approach. Penn State Press.&lt;/ref&gt;. The four criterion are the creation of a mission, the use of technology, the dissemination of new technology, and the creation of new roles.

==Creation of a Mission==
This refers to the formation of common ground among the members of the movement. The mission becomes the overarching goal of the movement and acts as the foundation for the participants. 

===History===
Agriculture has always played a significant role in America’s economy. Initially, farms were family owned and produce was locally distributed. Western expansion and the implementation of railroad systems allowed the number of farms to triple from 1860 to 1905. With expansion and new technology came national distribution. Trucks and Trains now made it possible for people in Maine to eat peppers from Texas, people from Oregon to get cotton from Virginia, etc. This national trade allowed family farms to prosper. During the Great Depression, Roosevelt’s New Deal established many programs to help aid family farms and ensure continued prosperity. However, in the early 1970s, Earl Butz, Nixon’s secretary of agriculture, began to reengineer many programs established by the New Deal. He established new programs in hopes of driving down the cost of food, advertising slogans such as “get big or get out” and “from fencerow to fencerow”. Federal agriculture policy also shifted to include subsidies for commodity crops.&lt;ref&gt;Philpott, T. (2008, February 8). A reflection on the lasting legacy of 1970s USDA Secretary Earl Butz. Retrieved December 5, 2013, from Grist website: http://grist.org/article/the-butz-stops-here/ &lt;/ref&gt;   This lowered food prices and caused farmers to need increased yields to remain profitable. This led to deep depression in the farm belt followed by a brutal wave of consolidation. Large food manufacturers began to dominate the market, causing a greater separation between the public and their food.&lt;ref&gt;Pollan, M. (2010, June 10). The Food Movement, Rising. The New York Review of Books. www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2010/jun/10/food-movement-rising/&lt;/ref&gt; 

Initially, the majority of the public was unaware of the negative side effects of retrieving produce from distant, large food manufacturers. However, in the early 2000s, individuals began writing books and blogs about the difference between local and distant food. One book in particular, “Coming Home to Eat” by Gary Paul Nabham, inspired what many argue to be the beginning of the “Local Food Movement”.&lt;ref&gt;Trimarchi, M. (n.d.). What are locavores? Retrieved December 5, 2013, from TLC website:       http://recipes.howstuffworks.com/locavore1.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  

After reading Nabham’s book, four Californian women (Sage Van Wing, Jessica Prentice, Dede Sampson, and Lia McKinney) lead a challenge to eat from within a 100 mile radius for one month. Jessica Prentice created the name “locavore” to help their challenge gain awareness. She saw this word as a way to convey the concept of “eating not only from your place, but with a sense of place” .&lt;ref&gt;Ullmann, I. (2013, June 29). A local food revolution. Retrieved December 29, 2013, from Journal: A       Close Look at Sustainability website: http://journal.snodemo.com/showcase/2013/06/29/a-local-food-revolution/ &lt;/ref&gt; This word and movement began to gain popularity as it caused people to become more conscious of where their food what coming from and how it was produced. Soon several movements arose and united to form what is known today as the local food movement.

===Definition===
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_food &lt;u&gt;Local food&lt;/u&gt;] is produced in close proximity to consumers. &quot;Local&quot; can be based on a marketing relationship (i.e., that producers sell directly to consumers), or a geographical relationship. Although locavores initially popularized the &quot;100-mile Radius&quot;, the USDA acknowledges a 400 mile radius as a true boundary of what can be called geographical &quot;local&quot; food.&lt;ref&gt; Martinez, Steve et al. (2010) Consumer demand for food that is locally produced, marketed, and consumed is generating, Local Food Systems: Concepts, Impacts, and Issues. Economic Research Service Report Summary, U.S. Department of Agriculture&lt;/ref&gt;

A [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locavore &lt;u&gt;locavore&lt;/u&gt;] is a person who eats locally grown foods whenever possible. The term was created in 2001 as a way to convey the concept of “eating not only from your place, but with a sense of place”.&lt;ref&gt;Ullmann, I. (2013, June 29). A local food revolution. Retrieved December 29, 2013, from Journal: A Close Look at Sustainability website: http://journal.snodemo.com/showcase/2013/06/29/a-local-food-revolution/ &lt;/ref&gt;

===Consumer Motivations for Buying Local===

&lt;u&gt;Relationships:&lt;/u&gt; Local food establishes connections between consumers and producers that supermarkets are not able to provide. Organizations such as farmer’s markets and road-side stands allow the consumer to buy produce directly from the farmer. This enables the consumer to question production methods and promotes a personal relationship between farmer and consumer. On the other hand, supermarket food typically travels around 1,500 miles before reaching the consumer.&lt;ref&gt;Pirog, R., &amp; Benjamin, A. (2003). Checking the food odometer: Comparing food miles for local versus conventional produce sales to Iowa institutions. Leopold Center for Sustainable Agriculture, Ames, Iowa, 5.&lt;/ref&gt; This generally creates an impartial and impersonal experience for the consumer.

&lt;u&gt;Health and Taste:&lt;/u&gt; Supermarket food usually contains preservatives, while local food generally has no added chemicals, comes directly from the farmer, and often tastes fresher.&lt;ref&gt;Assessment, E. I. (2007). Analysis of Food Sustainability at the University of Kansas, Lawrence Campus. www.sustainability.ku.edu/Documents/Student_Projects/615/Food_Sustainability.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;u&gt;Environment:&lt;/u&gt; Local food addresses environmental concerns as a less energy-intensive alternative. Agricultural systems (processing, transportation, pre-washing, etc) consume about 1/5 of the total petroleum used in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Pollan, M. (2010, June 10). The Food Movement, Rising. The New York Review of Books. www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2010/jun/10/food-movement-rising/&lt;/ref&gt; Local food is generally not packaged, travels fewer food-miles, and doesn't require as much processing.

&lt;u&gt;Community:&lt;/u&gt; The average American farmer receives about $0.20 for each dollar they spend. Since 1979, the United States has lost around 300,000 farmers to debt. By buying directly from farmers, participants in the local food movement help farmers remain financially viable by retaining higher profits.&lt;ref&gt;Bird, G. W., &amp; Ikerd, J. (1993). Sustainable Agriculture: A Twenty-First-Century System. Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, 529, 92–102.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;u&gt;Animal Welfare:&lt;/u&gt; Large food manufacturers typically manipulate the quality of life of their animals to maximize their food-producing potential while local farmers use more human methods such as “free-range” and “grass-fed”.&lt;ref&gt;Food and Animal Welfare at Tufts. (n.d.). Retrieved December 5, 2013, from Feast website: http://www.tufts.edu/programs/feast/animalwelfare.htm &lt;/ref&gt;

===Availability===

Local food is rapidly becoming more accessible to consumers. In 2013, 8,144 farmers markets were listed in the U.S. (a 3.6% increase from 2012).&lt;ref&gt;Farmers Markets and Local Food Marketing. (2013, August 3). Retrieved December 5, 2013, from USDA       website: http://www.ams.usda.gov/AMSv1.0/ams.fetchTemplateData.do?template=TemplateS&amp;leftNav=WholesaleandFarmersMarkets&amp;page=WFMFarmersMarketGrowth&amp;description=Farmers%20Market%20Growth%5D &lt;/ref&gt;  [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community-supported_agriculture Community-supported agriculture], which involves purchasing “shares” of local farmer’s produce, is another way consumers are able to easily obtain local food. Local food can also be found through intermediaries such as restaurants, retail grocery stores and government institutions like hospitals and farm-to school programs. 

===Advocates and Opponents===
The local food movement can be framed by its advocates and opponents. 

Advocates of the local food movement range from individuals to large organizations. At the heart of the local food movement lies individual bloggers and writers who spread the importance of this movement. This has inspired many organizations to be created, ranging from small farmers markets to large groups such as [http://www.communityfoodadvocates.org/blog/ Community Food Advocates] and the [http://www.slowfoodusa.org/ Slow Food Movement]. Recently, select restaurants and grocery stores, such as Chipotle, Walmart, and Whole Foods, have become major advocates by selling almost exclusively local produce. The government has also recently become an advocate by establishing the “Farm-to-School” program. 

Major opponents of the local food movement include companies with financial stakes in the food production market. This can include large farms, and food conglomerates like [http://occupybigfood.wordpress.com/ Monsanto]. According to some analyses, transportation of local food is more inefficient; cross-specialization (i.e., large farms dedicated solely to one crop) would allow more food to be distributed to a growing population. &lt;ref&gt;Sexton, Steve. (2011). The Inefficiency of Local Food. www.freakonomics.com&lt;/ref&gt; Although local food proponents argue that producing food locally decreases transportation costs, a recent study found that 11% of energy costs are from transportation while 83% of the energy expended is from production, which can be less efficient at smaller family farms. &lt;ref&gt;Weber, CL &amp; Matthews, HS. Food-Miles and the Relative Climate Impacts of Food Choices in the United States. Environ. Sci. Technol. 2008, 42, 3508–3513&lt;/ref&gt; If food is being produced locally, it will reduce business from international producers, who may depend on exports for profit. &lt;ref&gt;MacGregor, J &amp; Vorley, B. (2006) &quot;Fair Miles? The concept of “food miles”  through a sustainable development lens.&quot; IIED.&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Locavores and Social Stigma===
Locavores are often portrayed as elitists. They are commonly viewed as a pretentious group that eats more expensive food because they can. However, a 6 state study found that when examining comparable items, farmers markets are less expensive than nearby supermarkets 74% of the time.

Locavores can be subdivided into four main categories: the environmentally concerned, the animal welfare activists, the health concerned, and the participants who prefer the freshness and taste of local foods. Participants feel that they can support the local food movement by 'voting with their food dollar' and buying local for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

The San Fransisco activists, who coined the term locavore, describe themselves as &quot;concerned culinary adventurers.&quot; They portray themselves as environmentalists, embracing the frontier of dietary practice and eschewing the normalcy of traditional consumption. They seek to appear both bold and exciting so that others will join their cause.

==Use of Technology==
This includes the creation of new technologies, both systematic and technical, for use within the movement.

===New Technologies===
Two technologies developed in response to the movement are [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polytunnel hoop houses] and vertical [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroponics hydroponics]. Hoop houses are highly customizable alternatives to greenhouses, allowing small farmers to economically and efficiently remain competitive. Vertical hydroponics allows for the high density vertical growth of fruits and vegetables.  Hydroponics is a system of nourishing plants without the use of traditional soil.  Naturally, plants receive nutrients through the breaking down of nutrients through the soil in which their roots are fixed in, but in a hydroponic system, those same plants are receiving their nutrients through artificially nourished water, eliminating the use of traditional soil fields and allowing farmers to maximize space in a green house or hoop house. Using this system, farmers can reap larger crop yields.&lt;ref&gt;http://greengrotech.com/news/&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Distribution Systems===
Local food producers have diversified their distribution systems. For example, [http://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/locally-grown Whole Foods] has shifted emphasis from organic to local foods. They spotlight local producers. Wal-Mart was the first supermarket to sell local food at its chains. Safeway, Kroger, and other supermarkets have followed suit. &lt;ref&gt;Clifford, Stephanie. (2010). Wal-Mart to Buy Local Produce. The New York Times. www.nytimes.com&lt;/ref&gt; The advent of these systems has not only raises awareness, but also increases the prevalence of organizations that serve as middlemen between small producers and large consumers.

====Food Cooperatives====

Another form of distribution system that has emerged from the local food movement is the popularization of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_cooperative food cooperatives].  These cooperatives serve as distribution centers for small local farmers who join together and practice [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_economics cooperative economics].  Each farmer contributes what he or she can to the reserves of food and is rewarded by gaining access to the entire source of food, while the surplus is then sold off to the public to cover cost associated with managing production and distribution.  This is a simple way for small farmers to support each other in their endeavor to provide locally grown organic food to their families and town.  Examples of food cooperatives that have grown psat their local roots are [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_O%27Lakes Land O'Lakes], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piggly_Wiggly_Alabama Piggly Wiggly], etc.  The importance of food cooperatives in sustaining local food markets can be seen globally by the United Nations declaration that 2012 was the &quot;International Year of Cooperatives &lt;ref&gt;http://social.un.org/coopsyear/&lt;/ref&gt;.  

Food cooperatives exist under the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rochdale_Principles Rochdale Principles], which state that they cannot exclude anyone from participating if he or she is able, and must cooperate with other cooperatives, among other principles.  Given this inclusion and open mindedness inherent to all food cooperatives, they have been able to thrive in even the most competitive local markets against large whole sale food providers.  In the Charlottesville area alone there are 4 separate entities that identify themselves as food cooperatives &lt;ref&gt;www.horseandbuggyproduce.com&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/firsthandfarmerscooperative&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;www.friendlycityfoodcoop.com&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;heartlandharvestfarm.com/buyingclubs.html&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Dissemination of Information==
A social movement needs to develop means of communication like the internet, advertisements, spoken word, pamphlets, etc.

===Communication within the Local Food Movement===
Farmers act as teachers, spreading information about unusual products, new recipes and interesting production processes. Chefs, like [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfgang_Puck Wolfgang Puck], can be advocates for local food by making their menu from marketplaces, and advertising on their websites.&lt;ref&gt;S. Inwood, J. Sharp, R. Moore, D. Stinner, Restaurants, chefs and local foods: insights drawn from application of a diffusion of innovation framework, Agriculture and Human Values. 26 (2009) 177–191.&lt;/ref&gt; Food magazines and newspapers often frame the movement in terms of child nutrition, food safety, and obesity, while individual blogs and articles focus also on the environmental benefits of eating locally through personal experiences and challenges. Ad hoc social institutions including farmers conventions, underground locavore restaurants, and local food councils also proliferate information within the movement.&lt;ref&gt; A. Starr, Local Food: A Social Movement?, Cultural Studies ↔ Critical Methodologies. 10 (2010) 479–490.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social and Popular Media===
According to a recent study published in the Journal of Extension, mass media tends to frame the local food movement positively, using emotionally-laden keywords like &quot;accessibility&quot;, &quot;variety&quot;, &quot;sustainable&quot;, &quot;safe&quot;, and &quot;cost-savings.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ruth-McSwain, A. Eating Green: Coverage of the Locavore Movement. Journal of Extension: October 2012 // Volume 50 // Number 5 // 5FEA7&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Occupy&quot;-esque movements and the Buy Fresh, Buy Local organization post propaganda through blogs, Twitter, and public events. Public figures like Michelle Obama also endorse the local food movement, garnering support from the general public. For example, the First Lady started an organic garden at the White House, and attends the White House Farmer's Market. The Food Network has also recently begun promoting local foods by including local ingredients in series like &quot;Chopped&quot; and &quot;Iron Chef&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Food Network. http://www.foodnetwork.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation of New Roles==
New roles can be formal or informal. They may include public officials, spokespersons, entrepreneurs, writers, activists, etc.

Roles created as a result of the local food movement include [http://www.charlottesville.org/index.aspx?page=757 farmers market managers], custom smaller slaughterhouses for small cattle operations, local food policy councils, farming restaurant owners and journalists reporting on local food, such as Food Inc or the book The Omnivores Dilemma.&lt;ref&gt;Starr, A. (2010). Local Food: A Social Movement? Cultural Studies ↔ Critical Methodologies, 10(6), 479–490.&lt;/ref&gt; Will Richey, owner of [http://revolutionarysoup.com/ Revolutionary Soup] in Charlottesville, is an example of a farming restaurant owner. His small farm in Esmont, Va supplies much of the dairy and poultry for his restaurant.

==Charlottesville: A Case Study==

===Origins to Today===
The local farming community has been a staple of central Virginia and Charlottesville since the area was first settled. A visit to [http://www.monticello.org/site/jefferson/attending-to-my-farm Monticello] will reveal how deeply rooted farming is in the history of Charlottesville. Thomas Jefferson’s gardens were used as both a means for sustenance as well as science. Jefferson experimented with over 70 different species from various geographic origins including beans brought back from Lewis and Clark’s expedition.&lt;ref&gt;Monticello. &quot;Attending to My Farm.&quot; http://www.monticello.org/site/jefferson/attending-to-my-farm&lt;/ref&gt; Jefferson’s unquenchable thirst for innovation is instilled in the culture of Charlottesville, which is apparent in the inventive techniques being used by local farmers for growing a diverse range of produce and distributors for reaching a broad range of local consumers. 

The city boasts [http://www.visitcharlottesville.org/visitors/things-to-do/orchards-and-farms/ scenic family-run farms], orchards, wineries, breweries, and restaurants as great attractions for visitors and residents alike. While tourism is a key revenue stream for some of the orchards and vineyards in Charlottesville, most farmers’ livelihoods rely on their produce and livestock. They can compete with corporate farms’ low costs better when [http://www.buylocalvirginia.org/index.cfm/1,3,0,0,html/Why-Buy-Local consumers place increased value] on freshness, local economic benefits, and knowledge of food history. 

The [http://www.charlottesvillecitymarket.com/ Charlottesville City Market], the largest outdoor market in Charlottesville, opened in 1973 and became a platform for local farmers and artisans to interact directly with the Charlottesville consumers. However, in 2009, the [http://localfoodhub.org/ Local Food Hub] began its mission to broaden consumer access to Charlottesville’s local food. 

Charlottesville farmers’ ability to produce a wide range of produce combined with the Local Food Hub’s model for local food distribution has led to great momentum in the Charlottesville local food movement. These two accomplishments were only possible because of Charlottesville consumers’ demand for local food.

===Diversity of Farmer Specialization===
Agriculture occupies 37% of the land in Virginia where there are over 47,000 individual farms making it the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia#Economy largest industry in Virginia].&lt;ref&gt;Wikipedia. &quot;Virginia Economy.&quot; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia#Economy&lt;/ref&gt; Though most of these farms have specialized in cash crops such as tomatoes, soy, hay, and tobacco, some farms in Charlottesville and other areas are attempting to cover a wider range of produce. In order for the local food movement to gain traction, the local farms need to produce a diverse range of produce in order to satisfy consumer choices.
 
Michael Clark, the owner and farmer of [http://www.planetearthdiversified.com/ Planet Earth Diversified] in Charlottesville, has used his technical proficiency to produce micro-greens for consumers with very particular tastes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.c-ville.com/beyond-organic-local-farmer-michael-clarks-produce-thrives-despite-growing-pains/&lt;/ref&gt; Clark came to the University of Virginia in 1975 to study electrical engineering. He ended up using his engineering expertise to open a small farm that uses [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroponics hydroponic] growing techniques and a self-built automated heating and cooling system. Clark has built relationships with local restaurateurs who have a high demand for his flavor loaded specialty produce, micro-greens. More than [http://localfoodhub.org/our-food/where-to-find-our-food/ 30 restaurants in Charlottesville] pride themselves on using local ingredients. They are only able to do this when local growers can supply them with the various ingredients that they need.

===Broadening Distribution Channels===
While Charlottesville restaurants and consumers have emphasized local food for many years, the [http://localfoodhub.org/ Local Food Hub], which opened in 2009, increased the Charlottesville farmer’s access to consumers immensely. This is the Local Food Hub’s [http://localfoodhub.org/about/mission/ mission]: “[We are] a nonprofit organization working to improve small farm viability and increase community access to local food.” Rather than limiting access to the Saturday [http://www.charlottesvillecitymarket.com/ City Market], restaurants, and specialty markets, the Local Food Hub has opened up Charlottesville farmers’ distribution channels to include schools, hospitals, nursing homes, and retailers. 

Distribution of perishable items, such as fresh produce and meats, requires large capital costs such as refrigerated warehouses and trucks. While these costs are too large for most local farmers, the Local Food Hub combines the distribution of [http://localfoodhub.org/about/mission/ over 70 local farms’] fresh food in order to provide a link to more than 150 locations. According to the [http://blogs.usda.gov/2010/12/15/local-food-hub-brings-it-all-together/ US Department of Agriculture], “It’s clear that Local Food Hub is doing more than just aggregation and distribution. In less than two years it’s emerged as a model for fostering long-term sustainable development and community engagement through agriculture.”&lt;ref&gt; US Department of Agriculture. http://blogs.usda.gov/2010/12/15/local-food-hub-brings-it-all-together/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consumer Support===
The success of Local Food Hub would not have been possible without the support of Charlottesville’s residents. When the non-profit first started in 2009, it needed to purchase refrigerated warehouse space and trucks. Turning to the residents of Charlottesville, Local Food Hub found its funding through donations.&lt;ref&gt;USDA. &quot;Local Food Hub Brings it all Together&quot; http://blogs.usda.gov/2010/12/15/local-food-hub-brings-it-all-together/&lt;/ref&gt; This was not only an important funding milestone for Local Food Hub, but also an indication that there was significant demand for increased access to local food from the residents of Charlottesville. Even the best-designed systems cannot gain social momentum unless there is community support. One way the Charlottesville local food advocates were able to gain community support was through access to information. Buy Fresh Buy Local is a non-profit that sends out semi-annual newsletters to 67,000 Charlottesville area residents promoting local food.&lt;ref&gt;Buy Fresh Buy Local http://www.buylocalvirginia.org/&lt;/ref&gt; The newsletters contain propaganda about the benefits of buying local, advertisements for different local farms, and information on where to buy different types of local food. These newsletters, festivals that promote local artisans and farmers, and the [http://www.charlottesvillecitymarket.com City Market] all helped the local food advocates gain community support.&lt;ref&gt;Charlottesville Festivals http://www.visitcharlottesville.org/visitors/calendar-of-events/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wrap Up===
Buy Fresh Buy Local was the first organized group to solely support the cause of buying local food in the Charlottesville area.&lt;ref&gt;Buy Fresh Buy Local. http://www.buylocalvirginia.org/&lt;/ref&gt; They garnered community support through information propagation in their semi-annual newsletters. This dissemination of information allowed for Local Food Hub to create a community supported distribution system with a mission to broaden consumer access to local food. They had to create a new role in which they combined the resources of over 70 farms in the Charlottesville area. Through this new role, Local Food Hub was able to shift the distribution power in favor of the local farms. This mission would not have been possible without innovative farmers’ abilities to use technology in ways that allow for a diverse range of produce that satisfy consumer taste.

==Conclusions==
Displeased with major changes in the food industry, small food movements combined to form the larger local food movement. Similar dissatisfactions have led to other social movements, such as the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupy_Wall_Street Occupy Wall Street] movement, the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_trade Fair-trade movement], and the emergence of [http://rabi.phys.virginia.edu/mySIS/CS2/index.php Lou's List] at the University of Virginia. Lou's list arose in 2006 as a result of dissatisfaction with ISIS, the old online information system at UVa. Because of frustrations with SIS (ISIS's replacement), students and professors found a new way to plan their schedules. Social causes arise as a result of common desires and dissatisfaction. They become movements when they create a mission, new technologies, new roles, and a means of propagating information.

In the case of 'information: 
* it is the transmission of a message from a sender to a receiver; the content of the message refers to &quot;objective&quot; facts and it codified independently from the human relationship between the informer and the informed..

In the case of communication:

* besides the message codified through a &quot;conventional&quot; language the communicating actors send also a series of message codified &quot;naturally&quot;  (e.g. body language) that clarify the relational content of the human relationship between the counterparts: viz. the tone of the voice, the rhythm of the sentence, the physical postures, etc. constitute clusters of information that acorganization the linguistic messages and propose an interpretation modality of the relationship. 
* not all messages are transmitted consciously (body may speak differently from what we expect); 
* the results of communication can be pre-planned by the actors before the communication is undertaken, because results depend on the other's choices; (e.g. the voice can reveal anxiety and may prompt unexpected results of hostility, etc.)

      <text xml:space="preserve">
Communication always involves at least two persons (or two groups of persons) who, while talking about &quot;something&quot; also define their relationship and the reciprocal expectations.
Usually when the communication &quot;fails&quot; it is not because of disagreement about &quot;what&quot; the two are talking about, but rather because they do not agree on the relationship model proposed by the counterpart.

! The relational content of communication
|-
| [[File:The relational content of communication.jpg]]
|-
|&lt;small&gt;Every communication has the purpose of establishing a relationship. Relationships are basically of three orders: the equal (between friends) and hierarchical relationship on both sides: adult-child and child-adult. There are also relationships, for instance, between man and woman thatmove through all three orders of relationships in different phases and different moments.   Human relationships are established if both accept the identification of the degree of relationship proposed by the other. In our case, for instance, I’m the father and you’re the child- I’m teaching and you’re learning. We accept this. The moment one of the students reacts and the teacher perceives that he is refused as a teacher, there is tension between the two until, for instance, the teacher realises that in that particular subject matter it is the student who knows more. So, I accept the other as the teacher (for instance, when you put doubts on the hardware list). The elasticity or the capacity of persons to accept changes in the levels of the relationship at different points is extremely important for the relationship.  Even if we consider language to be different from communication, we must always consider the hierarchical relationship as an essential purpose of the fact of communicating. We communicate in order to establish the level of the relationship and only after we’ve established it. This again is a problem of [[Development Cooperation Handbook/Cooperation and Communication/Punctualization|punctualization]].&lt;/small&gt;
|}

When we communicate we also tell to to the counterpart how we portray our relationship: as superior, inferior or as equal. And the other does the same. We feel comfortable  if the counterpart con organization our interpretation (he/she acts as inferior while we proposed us as superior, etc.); we feel uncomfortable if the counterpart refuses our interpretation and proposes one that we think it is unacceptable ( (e-g- both the counterparts wants to be considered as reciprocally superior).

Another factor of uneasiness can be the modality of interpreting and otherwise established hierarchy:  the hierarchical order is established as functional to the achievement of specific objectives or is it expression of a natural superiority/inferiority amongst the persons?

In any case the reciprocal definition of roles is never static: the constant redefinition or reiteration of the relationship represent the axis upon which interpersonal communication moves.  Along with the processes of communication therefore, are constantly redefined the spheres of competence, the sectors where one is superiors to the other are better defined, it is better understood how much there are common stakes and common interests and how much interests are diverging or become effective.
So we can say that communication is the process through which social ties are established   and that there is no community (or society) without group identity: this identity is formed when communication achieves its objective 

The objective of communication is achieved when a group of &quot;I&quot;s accept to identify themselves as a &quot;we&quot; (with a common purpose and common stakes). 

For most of the time the communication about the relationship is not explicit.  Most of the time in communication is spent referring to to the &quot;objective&quot; world (beyond their relationship). So  reciprocal interpersonal intentions are clarified implicitly, by the way people communicates and relates to each other.
Only rarely messages refers explicitly to the human relationship. In fact to communicate about &quot;things&quot; is easier then communicating about &quot;relationships&quot;. In order to be explicit about the relationship one need a higher level of intimacy.

Technically to communicate about the relationship is considered a way of &quot;communicating about communication&quot; :   that is why it is defined as &quot;[[Development Cooperation Handbook/Cooperation and Communication/Meta-communication|meta-communication]] &quot;.
It is important to realize that in each human relationship we can find elements of solidarity and elements of  competition.  

In fact each indivisual is at the same time in a communion of interests with the other in the organization of the economical and cultural structure of the social system where she lives and work; and in competition with the others in the effort of getting for herself as many good things produced by this system. Along this dynamics various smaller social units are generated, that are also at the same time in solidarity and in competition amongst themsellves, and produce various forms of unions and alliances. Along this dynamic of simultaneus solidarity¾competition are formed varius levels of social aggregation.   

Technically we call competition the [[Development Cooperation Handbook/Communication and Knowledge Management/The relational content of communication/the social games#the zero sum game|zero sum]] and solidarity the [[Development Cooperation Handbook/Communication and Knowledge Management/The relational content of communication/the social games#the positive sum game|positive sum]] in [[Development Cooperation Handbook/Communication and Knowledge Management/The relational content of communication/the social games|social gaming]].

Communication is what allows us to manage the reciprocal conflict of interests maintaining the bound of solidarity for the achievement of the shared objectives.

Communication is never an objective in itself, but it is always a means to produce an effect, that according to the three modalities of human relationship that we identified can be 

*increase the power of the protagonist by generating persuasion in the target audience; 
*allow the counterpart to make informed choices by providing knowledge of facts and intentions; 
*educate so that the counterpart can extend her/his horizon of possible choices.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The varieties of social games
In order to understand all the implications of the difference between didactical communication and advertisement we have to keep in mind the two levels upon which human beings interact. 
In each social game, there is some solidarity and some competition. A mixture of the two is required to keep any group socially alive. But the rules of competition are different from the rules of solidarity. In order to understand it, we need to look at the game theory and understand the difference between the zero-sum game and the positive-sum games.

== The zero sum game ==
For instance football. For every goal I score, I subtract one goal from the other team. If I make a 3-0 score, it’s equivalent to our team making 0 and the other –3. Every point that I make is a point taken from the others. So, the zero sum game implies that whatever I gain is taken from the other’s asset and vice versa.
Another example could be of the price of a house on sale. Let’s say that you are selling and I’m buying the house. Let’s assume that the original price of the house is $50,000. If I’m able to buy the house for $49,000, I gain $1000 and you lose $1000 and vice versa. Discussion about the price is a zero-sum game. A war between two countries too is a zero sum game. The more of your soldiers I kill, the more I gain and the more effective is my destruction. If the destruction made by both sides is equal, it’s a zero sum. If I have destroyed more than the other side, I gain and it is no longer a zero sum game. So long as I lose what you earn or vice versa, it’s a zero sum.
 

== The positive sum game ==
It implies that we both gain or we both lose. If two countries do project/programme purpose, there’s a possibility that both benefit out of it. Even in the example of the house, the discussion of the price is a zero sum game but both buying and selling is a positive sum game. Why? Because you are finally more interested in the money I’m giving than in the house you’re selling and I’m more interested in the purchase I’m making than in the money I’m giving. So both have profited and so in the overall, it’s a positive sum game. In a team, for instance, it’s a positive sum game because if we win, we all gain. If we work together in such a way as to win, we all benefit from it. Within the team, it’s a positive game. In many levels, both these games work simultaneously. Like in a husband- wife relationship. There are some situations in which it is a zero sum but on the overall it’s a positive sum game- either both lose or both win. So in each relationship, there’s solidarity as well as competition. This is also present in a producer- action sponsor/beneficiary relationship- the zero sum game being the money to be paid and the work to be got out of it and the positive sum game is in the fact that both want a good product that finally has a good follow-up. Since we have a common purpose, we will find the right price for producing the product. Another relationship is that of the owner with the managers, where, in a training initiative, the incompetent managers can be fired and so lose while owners gain. On the other hand, increase in the productivity of the organization would benefit everybody and this would be a positive sum game.

Development cooperation is done at its best when the partners have a common interest at stake, when they all are going to benefit from the development process and when they are together analyzing the problems, setting the objectives and are working together to  produce the expected changes. This requires a healthy [[Development Cooperation Handbook/Communication and Knowledge Management/The communication climate in Organizations and Teams|communication climate]] where  the interests of all partners are integrated so as to achieve a [[Development Cooperation Handbook/Communication and Knowledge Management/The relational content of communication/the social games#The positive sum game|positive-sum relation]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">Depending on which one of the  intended result of the intention of communicating we can distinguish three main modalities of communication pragmatics:
  
* '''Propaganda''': When we aim at convincing their counterpart in a modality that responds to our interests or convictions.
* '''Information''':  When we want to be as impersonal as possible, where what really matters is the &quot;objective&quot; content of the communication and the human relationship amongst the actors is not considered important (and not made explicit). 
* '''Education''': When the communication is a service given to the beneficiaries, with the objective of enlarging three horizon of possibilities and choices .
&lt;br /&gt;

In a gratifying human relationship the counterparts are able to shift roles and change the amongst these three fundamental modalities in order to better achieve their objective and reinforce their social identity.

However each one of these modality has  its own adequate methodology;  the approach that can be considered [[Development Cooperation Handbook/Cooperation and Communication/The efficacy of communication dependent upon only one of its mode|adequate]] in one modality may be counterproductive in the other modality.

Communication is never an objective in itself, but it is always a means to produce an effect, that according to the three modalities of human relationship that we identified can be:
* increase the power of  the protagonist by generating persuasion in the target audience; 
* allow the counterpart to make informed choices by providing knowledge of facts and intentions;
* educate so that the counterpart can extend her/his horizon of possible choices.

      <text xml:space="preserve">An important pre-requisite for an efficacious communication activity is to visualise properly which one of the three major varieties of communication represents our priority.
In fact the approach that can be considered adequate in one modality may be counterproductive in the other modality.
* Propaganda has to &quot;win over&quot; the resistance of the counterpart and therefore it requires &quot;arms&quot; and &quot;strategies&quot;. Victory is achieved when persuasion is achieved. The method of persuasion is the &quot;rhetoric&quot;: it is of two kinds: the friendly and the hostile.  Therefore success is based upon seduction and/or threats.
* Information has to be  &quot;objective&quot;, i.e. it has to furnish to the counterpart with adequate knowledge for aware choices.  The one who delivers the information should present herself as &quot;neutral&quot; with respect to the choices that the counterpart will do. 
* Education has to be &quot;maieutic&quot;,  i.e. has to help the counterpart to develop her personality according to what she values most. To educate is to help the person to develop her faculties and to express her individuality. In order to become education, communication primarily has to built a sense of respect and trust in the community that the learner considers as its own.
&lt;br /&gt;

The efficacy of communication dependent upon only one of its modalities: either seducing or objective, or self-revealing.

==Introduction==

This design study is part of the Human Expansion (HE) program conceptual design.  One of the HE program goals is to expand civilization into more difficult locations, while at the same time improving levels of technology and quality of life.  The goal in this study is to establish location parameter ranges for where people live now, and then from that derive what difficult and extreme ranges would be for future locations.  We set the middle 90% of where people live now as the existing range for each parameter, with 5% living at each extreme.  The middle 90% is described as '''Temperate''', and levels more than 10 and 20% beyond the Temperate range we call '''Difficult''' and '''Extreme''' respectively. 

The study will be performed in two parts.  The first part will make make initial estimates so that other parts of the HE program design can start to use the information.  The second part will survey where people live in more detail and generate improved values.  The HE program as a whole is using the start of 2013 as a baseline to reference against.  The '''[http://www.census.gov/population/popclockworld.html US Census Bureau]''' projects population at the start of 2013 to be 7,062 million, thus 5% is 353 million.  The more detailed population analysis will draw from world statistical data.

==Initial Estimates==

Seven environment parameters and four time and distance parameters were chosen in the HE Requirements Analysis to determine what makes a difficult or extreme location. In the list of the parameters that follows, we first define what the parameter is, then discuss how we make our estimate for the 90% Temperate Range.  We also discuss what the practical limits on Earth are for the Extreme ranges.  Once the practical limits on Earth are reached, or they exceed what is found in space, more difficult locations in space are used.

===Environment Temperature===

'''Definition''' - On Earth, this is the winter daily air temperature lows, and summer daily highs in Kelvin and (Celsius). For space locations this is the equilibrium temperature of a 50% gray body with one side facing the Sun and the opposite side facing away.

'''Estimate''' - On inspection of a world map, many more people live in far north locations than far south.  Northern Europe, Russia, parts of Tibet, Northern China, and Canada may supply 350 million cold climate residents.  Many people live in equatorial/hot climates, but the extremes are seen in dry climates where water vapor does not moderate daily temperature ranges. We make a rough estimate of 260 K (-13 C) as average January daily lows and 310 K (37 C) as average July daily highs as the limits of the Temperate range.

'''Limits''' - Ten percent, or 25-30K, beyond the temperate limits is a significant range for human climate, so Earth locations are likely to to have only one or two very cold and no hot difficult surface climates.  Deep underground might reach extreme hot levels in certain locations.

===Water Supply===

'''Definition''' - This is fresh water supply from rain and snow fall, flows from rivers and ice, and air moisture in meters depth/location area/year.  Since the density of fresh water is 1 ton/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, this is equivalent to tons/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.  Salt water does not count as fresh water supply, although evaporation does.  Underground aquifers that represents flows from rain or water transport count, but not amounts merely drawn from storage, since that is not sustainable.  Many people live near rivers, which supply high fresh water flows.  We count available river flow distributed over the local land area, so a high range location above that may be difficult to find.  Dry locations with low water flow are common.

'''Estimate''' - We use values of 0.25 and 2.5 meters on Earth as the Temperate range based on rainfall definitions of desert and wet climates.  This needs more support from climate data.

'''Limits''' -  On Earth, the lowest rainfall location, the Atacama Desert receives an average of 0.001 meters of rainfall/year.  We can get an upper estimate by assuming the Amazon River flow of 200,000 cubic meters/second is allocated to the nearest 10% of the drainage basin to the main river and tributaries.  Given a total area of 7 million km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, that gives a water supply of 9 meters per year.  The highest rainfall locations give about 11 meters/year.  So we will adopt 10 meters/year as the extreme upper value.  Space locations would range from essentially zero in the inner Solar System, to moderate when significant numbers of ice or hydrated bodies pass within reach, to very high for ice-covered satellites or bodies.

===Atmosphere Pressure===

'''Definition''' - The average location gas pressure in kPa.  

'''Estimate''' - On Earth nearly everyone lives in a fairly narrow range of pressures.  We will assume for now the nominal range is from 80 to 100 kPa (sea level to 2000 m altitude).  

'''Limits''' - On Earth the lowest surface pressure is presumed to be at the highest point, Mt. Everest, at +8,850 m elevation.  The highest pressure is presumed to be at the bottom of the LaRonde Gold mine in Quebec, which reaches 3 km below a surface elevation of 300 m, for a net height of -2,700 m.  The pressure range is thus from 31.5 to 138 kPa. To go beyond these limits would require artificial structures, or ambient pressure underwater locations.  In space, local pressure can range from complete vacuum to many times Earth values on Venus or the Gas Giants.

===Ground Pressure===

'''Definition''' - On bodies with gravity this is the foundation design load in MPa or exterior water or rock pressure for below surface locations. In both cases this amounts to a boundary pressure on location structures.  Low range would be surface water structures or swamps, and high range would be tall buildings or below surface locations.

'''Estimate''' - We make a rough estimate of the Temperate range by referring to allowable soil bearing pressures from soft clay up to hard bedrock.  Dropping extreme values, these give a range from to 0.25 to 2.0 MPa.

'''Limits''' - For low range limit, we can assume a shallow boat or raft foundation with a depth of 1 meter or less.  This gives a load of 0.01 MPa. For high range limits, assuming a floor + dead load of 1000 kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; per floor, a 100 story skyscraper might impose a bearing pressure of 1 MPa on the foundation base.  Practical limits on tall construction have more to do with economics than with structural materials, so taller buildings are possible.  

Since the depths of the ocean and deep underground can reach very extreme pressures and temperatures, we set a practical limit based on the energy to reach Earth orbit (31.3 MJ/kg) compared to the column of mass which must be displaced to access such deep locations. For a 1 kg volume of ocean, which has a mass of ~1 kg, displacing a column 800 m high requires raising 8000 kg x 400 m avg height x 9.8 m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 31.3 MJ.  For continental crust, which has a density of 2.7kg/liter, a 1 kg volume then is 7.2 x 7.2 cm.  Each meter of rock above this area then is then 13.925 kg.  A column 675 m deep then masses 9400 kg, and raising it an average of 337.5 m also yields 31.3 MJ/kg.  Therefore we will consider the practical limits to be ocean depths to 800 meters and continental depths to 675 m, after which we start including space locations. Other parameters may drive us to space before depth does.  The corresponding water and rock pressures are 8 and 18 MPa respectively. 

===Energy Supply=== 

'''Definition''' - Flux from natural sources in W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.  On Earth this will mostly be from solar and wind, with water flow and geothermal in some locations.

'''Estimate''' - On Earth, average solar flux ranges from 100 to 300 W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; after accounting for night, clouds, and sun angle.  Wind power in the US ranges from below 100 to over 1000 W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.  Hydroelectric, tidal and sea currents, and geothermal are localized, so we will ignore them for this first estimate.  Combining wind and solar we get a rough estimate of 150 to 900 W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; as the temperate range.  In space, solar flux is 1366 W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; at the Earth's distance, times the percentage time in sunlight.

'''Limits''' - Any significant water or ground depth will have near zero energy supply.  Peak Earth values might be at high altitudes where a combination of high winds and increased sunlight would supply high power levels.  In space, peak energy level will vary dramatically with distance from the Sun.

===Gravity Level===

'''Definition''' - Local gravity level in meters/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.  Space locations near large objects still has a gravity level, even though orbits may create free-fall conditions with low relative forces between system elements.  

'''Estimate''' - The Earth's surface, where almost everyone lives, is entirely within 10% of the 9.80665 m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; standard value.

'''Limits''' - Values more than 10% outside the Temperate range require extremely tall structures ( &gt; 320 km tall ), or orbital locations.  Thus this parameter is effectively fixed for Earth locations.  Solar system locations can range from zero to about 200 m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; very close to the Sun.

===Radiation Dose===

'''Definition''' - Human radiation exposure in an unprotected state from background radiation, in milliSievert/year.  It should be noted that in many locations humans cannot survive in an unprotected state, but for consistency the exposure level is measured that way.  In addition to background radiation, humans also get significant exposure from medical and other human-made sources, but that is not location-specific, so is not counted as part of this location parameter.  

'''Estimate''' - Most of the Earth's population lives in a relatively low radiation environment, but higher altitudes or high natural radioactivity areas exist.  Data derived from a UN report indicate the typical range is from 1-13 mSv/yr.

'''Limits''' - The city of Ramsar in northern Iran has background levels up to 135 mSv/yr due to underground concentrations of Uranium and mobile decay products.  Low Earth Orbit locations range from 80-160 mSv/yr, and locations above this can reach much higher levels from trapped particle belts and Solar particle events. 

===Ping Time===

'''Definition''' - Minimum round trip communication delay to next nearest 5% of human population, in seconds.  Depending on location, this may be by wired or wireless methods.  

'''Estimate''' - In theory all of the Earth is within 0.13 second ping time from any other point, but actual communications systems in place increase this value.  We assume at least voice/cellphone bandwidth for communications.  There are now more fixed and mobile telephone connections than there are people, so again, in theory, everyone has access to one.  From Slovakia, around 5% of the world population is within about 600 km.  Theoretical ping time is then 8 milliseconds (ms). The distance from Tahiti to major population centers is roughly 6600 km. Therefore best case ping time is 44 ms.  Given actual routing, and fiber-optic speeds, this is likely to be more like 100 ms.   

'''Limits''' - The worst case on Earth is no worse than locations like Tahiti, which require submarine cable, or satellite relay through the Iridium network.  Thus the limits for Earth are the same as for the Temperate range.  Space locations can range to 45,000 seconds from Earth to the Kuiper Belt.

===Travel Time===

'''Definition''' - Maximum one way normal travel time for humans, in hours or days, from the nearest 5% of human population.

'''Estimate''' -  In dense areas such as Europe the maximum direct distance to reach 5% of the world's population is about 600 km.  Allowing for actual highway routing and travel speed, we can estimate 8 hours to reach any point in that radius.  Ninety percent of the world's land area can be reached within 48 hours according to the '''[http://bioval.jrc.ec.europa.eu/products/gam/index.htm EU Joint Research Centre]''' map of accessibility.

'''Limits''' - The same accessibility map places parts of the Tibetan plateau at 20 days travel to a city of any size. '''[[w:Pole_of_inaccessibility|Point Nemo]]''', the farthest point in the world from land, is about 4000 km by sea from the nearest airports.  Therefore it is about 10 days travel by chartered ship.  Current travel time to space is measured in months to years, mostly because trips carrying humans are rare.  The actual transit time from the launch site is 2-3 days

===Stay Time===

'''Definition''' - Average per person stay time per location, in years.  People are assumed to stay in the same location if they live and sleep in the same place on a regular basis.  

'''Estimate''' - In the US, in 2010-2011, 3.9% of the population moved to a different county in one year.  We will take a county to represent a &quot;location&quot;.  Therefore the average stay time is 25 years.  We assume there are significant parts of the world where the average person does not move far from their place of birth, thus the average stay time in one location is their life expectancy of about 70 years.  

'''Limits''' - The fastest growing counties in the US in 2011 had a growth rate of 10%, and thus an average stay time of 7 years if both growth and normal mobility are counted. Stay times in space are currently much shorter than this because there are no permanent residents, and time is limited by zero gravity and radiation exposure.  We invert the time scale for space, and set a minimum stay time of 10% of Earth, or 0.7 years, as the initial range. At the other extreme, stay times are bounded by life expectancy, so are no higher than 70 years.

===Transport Energy===

'''Definition''' - Maximum total energy to reach a location from nearest 5% of population, by most efficient method, in MJ/kg.  Includes kinetic, potential, and friction energy cost.  

'''Estimate''' - For Earth, since most of the surface is near the same potential, this is mostly frictional losses for rail or ocean shipping.  Rail transport consumes 330 BTU/ton-mile, or 216 J/kg-km.  Assuming a total transport distance of 1000 km for dense areas, including partial road travel from nearest rail point, we get about 0.215 MJ/kg.  Ships consume 375 J/kg-km. Eastern Australia is about 6000 km by ship from the nearest 5% of the worlds population, giving 2.25 MJ/kg.

'''Limits''' - Assuming a mule pulling a cart equal to its body mass for 20 days to reach inaccessible areas in Tibet, we get 1.8 MJ/kg transport energy.  If we then add another 2000 km by rail to reach 5% of the world's population, this adds another 0.43 MJ/kg, for a total of 2.23 MJ/kg.  Assuming transport distance of 7000 km from population centers to Tahiti, this gives 2.6 MJ/kg, which is the higher value.  Low Earth orbit requires 31 MJ/kg, so there is a large step function from Earth to space locations.

==Detailed Estimates==

===Atmospheric Temperature===

We selected the seasonal daily highs and lows for this parameter as the &quot;normal extremes&quot; that people are adapted to, even though particular days can exceed this range.  We start from the hot and cold ends of where people live, and count until we reach 5% in each.    We count by countries when they are small and consist of one climate region, or by sections when they are large.  If the population is concentrated in one part, we use climate data for that area.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:ExpansionOfMacedon.jpg|thumb|Macedon during the Peloponnesian War, around 431 BC, and during the early Hellenistic period, around 336 BC, at the death of Phillip II of Macedon.]]

Macedonia or Macedon was an ancient Greek kingdom. The kingdom, centered in the northeastern part of the Greek peninsula, was bordered by Epirus to the west, Paeonia to the north, the region of Thrace to the east and Thessaly to the south. The rise of Macedon, from a small kingdom at the periphery of Classical Greek affairs, to one which came to dominate the entire Hellenic world, occurred under the reign of Philip II.

==History==

===Early history and legend===

The first Macedonian state emerged in the 8th or early 7th century BCE under the Argead Dynasty, who, according to legend, migrated to the region from the Greek city of Argos in Peloponnesus (thus the name Argead). The Macedonian tribe ruled by the Argeads, was itself called Argead (which translates as &quot;descended from Argos&quot;).

The kingdom was situated in the fertile alluvial plain, watered by the rivers Haliacmon and Axius, called Lower Macedonia, north of the mountain Olympus. Around the time of Alexander I of Macedon, the Argead Macedonians started to expand into Upper Macedonia, lands inhabited by independent Macedonian tribes like the Lyncestae and the Elmiotae and to the West, beyond Axius river, into Eordaia, Bottiaea, Mygdonia, and Almopia, regions settled by, among others, many Thracian tribes. To the north of Macedonia lay various non-Greek peoples such as the Paeonians due north, the Thracians to the northeast, and the Illyrians, with whom the Macedonians were frequently in conflict, to the northwest. To the south lay Thessaly, with whose inhabitants the Macedonians had much in common both culturally and politically, while to west lay Epirus, with whom the Macedonians had a peaceful relationship and in the 4th century BC formed an alliance against Illyrian raids.

Near the modern city of Veria, Perdiccas I (or, more likely, his son, Argaeus I) built his capital, Aigai (modern Vergina). After a brief period under Persian rule under Darius Hystaspes, the state regained its independence under King Alexander I (495–450 BCE). In the Peloponnesian War Macedon was a secondary power that alternated in support between Sparta and Athens

===Involvement in the Classical Greek world===

Prior to the 4th century BC, the kingdom covered a region approximately corresponding to the Western and Central parts of province of Macedonia in modern Greece. A unified Macedonian state was eventually established by King Amyntas III (c. 393–370 BCE), though it still retained strong contrasts between the cattle-rich coastal plain and the fierce isolated tribal hinterland, allied to the king by marriage ties. They controlled the passes through which barbarian invasions came from Illyria to the north and northwest. It became increasingly Atticised during this period, though prominent Athenians appear to have regarded the Macedonians as uncouth. Before the establishment of the League of Corinth (338/337 BCE), even though the Macedonians apparently spoke a dialect of the Greek language and claimed proudly that they were Greeks, they were not considered to fully share the classical Greek culture by many of the inhabitants of the southern city states, because they did not share the ''polis'' based style of government. Herodotus, one of the foremost biographers in antiquity who lived in Greece at the time when the Macedonian king Alexander I was in power, recorded in his ''Histories'', 5. 22:

:&lt;small&gt;&quot;And that these descendants of Perdiccas are Hellenes, as they themselves say, I happen to know myself, and not only so, but I will prove in the succeeding history that they are Hellenes. Moreover the Hellanodikai, who manage the games at Olympia, decided that they were so: for when Alexander wished to contend in the games and had descended for this purpose into the arena, the Hellenes who were to run against him tried to exclude him, saying that the contest was not for Barbarians to contend in but for Hellenes: since however Alexander proved that he was of Argos, he was judged to be a Hellene, and when he entered the contest of the foot-race his lot came out with that of the first.&quot;
:&lt;/small&gt;

Over the 4th century Macedon became more politically involved with the south-central city-states of Ancient Greece, but it also retained more archaic features like the palace-culture, first at Aegae (modern Vergina) then at Pella, resembling Mycenaean culture more than classic Hellenic city-states, and other archaic customs, like Philip's multiple wives in addition to his Epirote queen Olympias, mother of Alexander.

Another archaic remnant was the very persistence of a hereditary monarchy which wielded formidable – sometimes absolute – power, although this was at times checked by the landed aristocracy, and often disturbed by power struggles within the royal family itself. This contrasted sharply with the Greek cultures further south, where the ubiquitous city-states mostly possessed aristocratic or democratic institutions; the de facto monarchy of tyrants, in which heredity was usually more of an ambition rather than the accepted rule; and the limited, predominantly military and sacerdotal, power of the twin hereditary Spartan kings. The same might have held true of feudal institutions like serfdom, which may have persisted in Macedon well into historical times. Such institutions were abolished by city-states well before Macedon's rise (most notably by the Athenian legislator Solon's famous σεισάχθεια ''seisachtheia'' laws).

===Rise of Macedon===

King Amyntas, who had established a unified Macedonian state, had three sons; the first two, Alexander II and Perdiccas III reigned only briefly. Perdiccas III's infant heir was deposed by Amyntas' third son, Philip II of Macedon, who made himself king and ushered in a period of Macedonian dominance in Greece. Under Philip II, (359–336 BC), Macedon expanded into the territory of the Paeonians, Thracians, and Illyrians. Among other conquests, he annexed the regions of Pelagonia and Southern Paeonia.
[[File:Map Macedonia 336 BC-en.svg|left|thumb|Kingdom of Macedon after Philip's II death.]]

Philip redesigned the army of Macedon adding a number of variations to the traditional ''hoplite'' force to make it far more effective. He added the ''hetairoi'', a well armoured heavy cavalry, and more light infantry, both of which added greater flexibility and responsiveness to the force. He also lengthened the spear and shrank the shield of the main infantry force, increasing its offensive capabilities.
[[File:Philip II of Macedon CdM.jpg|thumb|''Niketerion'' (victory medallion) bearing the effigy of king Philip II of Macedon, 3rd century AD, probably minted during the reign of Roman Emperor Alexander Severus.]]

Philip began to rapidly expand the borders of his kingdom. He first campaigned in the north against non-Greek peoples such as the Illyrians, securing his northern border and gaining much prestige as a warrior. He next turned east, to the territory along the northern shore of the Aegean. The most important city in this area was Amphipolis, which controlled the way into Thrace and also was near valuable silver mines. This region had been part of the Athenian Empire, and Athens still considered it as in their sphere. The Athenians attempted to curb the growing power of Macedonia, but were limited by the outbreak of the Social War. They could also do little to halt Philip when he turned his armies south and took over most of Thessaly.

Control of Thessaly meant Philip was now closely involved in the politics of central Greece. 356 BCE saw the outbreak of the Third Sacred War that pitted Phocis against Thebes and its allies. Thebes recruited the Macedonians to join them and at the Battle of Crocus Field Phillip decisively defeated Phocis and its Athenian allies. As a result Macedonia became the leading state in the Amphictyonic League and Phillip became head of the Pythian Games, firmly putting the Macedonian leader at the centre of the Greek political world.

In the continuing conflict with Athens Philip marched east through Thrace in an attempt to capture Byzantium and the Bosphorus, thus cutting off the Black Sea grain supply that provided Athens with much of its food. The siege of Byzantium failed, but Athens realized the grave danger the rise of Macedon presented and under Demosthenes built a coalition of many of the major states to oppose the Macedonians. Most importantly Thebes, which had the strongest ground force of any of the city states, joined the effort. The allies met the Macedonians at the Battle of Chaeronea and were decisively defeated, leaving Philip and the Macedonians the unquestioned master of Greece.

      <text xml:space="preserve">We need to get google sparsehash first assuming you don't have  root priviligies and your name is USER we install in a local include directory

  wget http://google-sparsehash.googlecode.com/files/sparsehash-1.11.tar.gz
  tar xvzf sparsehash-1.11.tar.gz
  cd sparsehash-1.11
  ./configure -prefix=/home/USER
  make
  make install

  

Now get ABySS (assuming you have the BOOST libraries installed)

  wget http://www.bcgsc.ca/downloads/abyss/abyss-1.2.7.tar.gz
  tar xzvf abyss-1.2.7.tar.gz
  cd abyss-1.2.7
  ./configure CPPFLAGS=-I/home/USER/include
  make

For more details about the installation process see the {{:Next Generation Sequencing (NGS)/SeqWiki|ABySS}} entry or install the .deb if you have a debian compliant system.

We now run ABySS with a kmer size of 25 and require at least n=10 links to join contigs.

  cd bin
  ./abyss-pe k=25 n=10 in='SRR001665_1.fastq SRR001665_2.fastq' name=ecoli

      <text xml:space="preserve">We get some E coli data from SRR001665
you could type

  wget ftp://ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/SRR001/SRR001665/SRR001665_1.fastq.gz
  wget ftp://ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/SRR001/SRR001665/SRR001665_2.fastq.gz

unpack the two files

  gunzip SRR001665_1.fastq.gz
  gunzip SRR001665_2.fastq.gz

You will need to get SOAPdenovo and the data prepare module

  wget http://soap.genomics.org.cn/down/x86_64.linux/SOAPdenovo31mer.tgz
  tar xvzf SOAPdenovo31mer.tgz
  

Also we have to make a config file. We name this cont.config

  #maximal read length
  max_rd_len=36
  [LIB]
  #average insert size
  avg_ins=200
  #if sequence needs to be reversed 
  reverse_seq=0
  #use for contig building only
  asm_flags=1
  #in which order the reads are used while scaffolding
  rank=1
  #fastq files
  q1=./SRR001665_1.fastq
  q2=./SRR001665_2.fastq

  
And then we scaffold using a Kmer size of 31 (the read length is 36). We use the whole SOAP pipeline by specifying the &quot;all&quot; parameter
By setting asm_flags to 3 the same library would be used for scaffolding as well. In this case SOAP will terminate in the scaffolding step with a floating point exception as there is nothing to scaffold with. Contigs will be found nevertheless in EC.contigs.

  ./SOAPdenovo31mer all -K 31 -s cont.config -o EC

      <text xml:space="preserve">Climate is the atmosphere of a organization.  More specifically, climate is the atmosphere of supportiveness or defensiveness that people feel within an organization.  It is an integral part of organizational culture.  Do they feel safe? Protected? Appreciated? Are they confidant that their opinions count? Do they know that when they have something to say, they have a way to say it so that it will be heard, and that people will listen and take their ideas or comments seriously?  The overall organizational climate also includes the organization’s communication climate—how free people feel to communicate at work, especially about bad news or negative information.  When people feel they cannot communicate bad news for fear of reprisal, the organization loses valuable information about how it operates.&lt;br /&gt;

Information will flow much more freely in an organization where there is a positive communication climate, but may not flow at all, especially when it is most needed, if there is a negative communication climate.  A supportive communication climate allows for a better exchange of information and a more positive work environment.   An organization’s climate can be equated to the weather—it is the atmosphere that people feel within the organization itself.  It is an integral part of organizational culture.  More specifically, organizational climate is the atmosphere of supportiveness or defensiveness people feel within the organization and the feelings they have about sending and receiving messages.  &lt;br /&gt;
 
To build a supportive communication climate you need to send messages that acknowledge effort, creativity, and teamwork, engage people in the decision making process, establish trust, which is maintained through consistency, congruity, reliability, and integrity. It is not enough to be a nice manager and create a nice environment in which to communicate and work.  You must also communicate a sense of challenge to your employees by placing importance on high quality and establishing high performance goals.

Development cooperation is done at its best when the partners have a common interest at stake, when they all are going to benefit from the development process and when they are together analyzing the problems, setting the objectives and are working together to  produce the expected changes. This requires a healthy [[Development Cooperation Handbook/Communication and Knowledge Management/The communication climate in Organizations and Teams|communication climate]] where  the interests of all partners are integrated so as to achieve a [[Development Cooperation Handbook/Communication and Knowledge Management/The relational content of communication/the social games#The positive sum game|positive-sum relation]]. see more in ⇒ [[Development Cooperation Handbook/The participatory approach|The participatory approach]]

[[Development Cooperation Handbook/Cooperation and Communication/The communication climate in Organizations and Teams|Communication Climate]] is the atmosphere of a team or an organization.  More specifically, climate is the atmosphere of supportiveness or defensiveness that people feel within an organization.  
&lt;br /&gt;

According to communication scholar, W. Charles Redding the communication climate in any organization is composed of five components.  You can create a positive organizational and communication climate through:

* '''Supportiveness''': To build a supportive communication climate you need to send messages that acknowledge effort, creativity, and teamwork.  A supportive communication climate allows for a better exchange of information and a more positive work environment.   
* '''Participative Decision Making:''' To create a positive communication climate you need to engage people in the decision making process.  You can do this by having employees participate in identifying and solving problems that affect them and their working conditions.  Participative decision-making means that you assist your employees in setting standards and goals for the work they do. 
* '''Trust:''' Before there can be effective employee communication, there must be a climate of trust (the feeling that another’s motives are what he or she says they are).  An employee trusts in superiors when they have confidence in the superior’s intentions and motives, when the superior has proven to keep his or her word, when they are sincere not only in their dealings with themselves but with other people, and when the employees are not afraid that they will be met with retaliation for supplying negative information. . See Building a Climate of Trust ; Communicating Credibility; Behaviors that Endanger Trust; Factors that may block the flow of information 
* '''Openness:''' Openness refers to the candid disclosure of information, particularly negative information and the sharing of feelings and opinions regarding the organization and its activities. Open communication in terms of expressing your ideas and feelings through verbal channels in organizations has led to higher production and better performance within the organization. However, simply “showing” feelings and not discussing them openly, is viewed as dysfunctional and can be very counter productive.  See Encouraging Openness
* '''Emphasis on High Quality Goals:''' Placing importance on high quality and high performance goals has to do with the content of the communication that you have with your employees.  Such an emphasis is the most important focus of the content of your messages to your employees.  It is not enough to be a nice manager and create a nice environment in which to communicate and work.  You must also communicate a sense of challenge to your employees.

Another important elements of the communication climate are
* the organization leading ethics
* the approach towards employee empowerment, that is a necessary element of organizational learning and a prerequisite to an organization becoming a learning organization. learning organization&quot;

==Astronomy and Planetary Science==

'''[[w:Astronomy|Astronomy]]''' is the study of all objects and phenomena beyond the Earth's atmosphere, and '''[[w:Planetary_science|Planetary Science]]''' is specifically the study of condensed objects orbiting stars.  Since this is where space systems function, a basic understanding of these fields is highly relevant to working on such projects.  For more background than will fit in this book, see:

* Nick Strobel's '''[http://www.astronomynotes.com/index.html Astronomy Notes]'''
* The Wikibook '''[[General_Astronomy]]'''

One of the key ideas to emerge from these studies is the '''[[w:Uniformitarianism|Uniformity of the Universe]]'''.  As far as we can tell, the natural laws and processes that operate now have always operated in the past, are the same everywhere in the Universe, and we expect them to continue to be so in the future.  Having learned what these general principles are, we can then apply them to specific examples as needed.

===Origin and Evolution of the Universe===

The '''[[w:Universe|Universe]]''' is the totality of existence. The origin and history of the Universe as a whole is of great interest to many people for its own sake, but only selected features are relevant for space systems design.  This includes that '''[[w:Baryon|Baryonic]]''' matter (the ordinary kind of matter that we and the Earth are made of) started out as about 76% Hydrogen, 24% Helium, and almost nothing else.  Gravity caused the nearly uniform early Universe to develop denser regions with emptier regions in between.  The denser regions coalesced into many '''[[w:Galaxy|Galaxies]]''', of which the '''[[w:Milky_Way|Milky Way]]''' galaxy is the one which our Sun and planets are part of.

Galaxies in turn form denser condensations where nuclear reactions occur, which we call stars.  The reactions convert lighter elements into heavier ones, increasing the proportion by mass of Helium to about 27% and heavier elements to about 2%.  Stellar nuclear reactions release a great deal of energy, but this source is finite.  Thus the Sun and other stars will eventually run out of fuel, and the composition of the Universe will reach a stable condition.  Several lines of evidence indicate the current age of the Universe is about 13.6 billion years, and the era of stars would last about 100 trillion years.  If the expansion of the Universe continues to accelerate, then most of the Universe will be rendered undetectable long before all the nearby stars die out.  Regardless of the eventual destiny of the Universe, on human time scales it will last a long while relatively unchanged.   

===The Milky Way Galaxy===

The oldest stars in our home galaxy are about 13 billion years old, which indicates the galaxy started forming, at least to the point that stars condensed, shortly after the Universe as a whole formed.  The baryonic mass is embedded in a five times more massive amount of material which only reveals itself by its gravity.  Since this material does not form stars, it is dark, and thus called '''[[w:Dark_Matter|Dark Matter]]'''.  It is poorly understood at present, and our main concern for space projects is how it affects the motions of baryonic objects such as stars, planets, and molecular clouds.  Evidence from the composition and motions of parts of the Milky Way indicate it formed by infall of gas clouds and smaller galaxies, which continues to the present.  The shape seems to have evolved starting with the halo and central bulge, followed by growth of the disk shaped region.  The baryonic mass of our galaxy is estimated at 200-300 billion times the Sun's.

The Sun is in the disk region, about 27,000 light years from the center of the Milky Way, orbiting at about 220 km/s and thus taking about 225-250 million years to complete an orbit.  We do not know the exact shape of the Sun's orbit but it is suspected to be elliptical.  Random motions of nearby stars are on the order of 20-30 km/s. Over the age of the Sun these random motions amount to 450,000 light years, which is much more than the circumference of the Sun's orbit. This indicates the current nearby stars are not the ones the Sun was born near.  In fact, the current stars within 100 light years will be replaced by an entirely different set in 1 million years.

===Formation of the Sun===

We observe new stars forming in denser regions of our galaxy known as '''[[w:Molecular_cloud|Molecular clouds]]''', and we assume our Sun and the rest of the Solar System formed in such a cloud, which has since dispersed.  Based on radioactive dating we estimate our Solar System to be 4.6 billion years old, which is about 1/3 the estimated age of the Universe.  The presence of 1.5% heavier elements in the Sun confirms that it formed from recycled matter that had previously been enriched by older generation stars.  Loss of heat from radiation allowed gravity to collect part of the original molecular cloud into a distinct object called the '''Solar Nebula'''.  The core of the nebula continued to contract, and the increased pressure caused by self-gravity heated that core to create a '''Proto-Sun'''.  Once the core of the proto-Sun reached a temperature of 12 million kelvins, hydrogen fusion could begin, and the Sun proper was born.  This collapse until ignition took around 30 million years.

Nuclear reactions in the core of the Sun have converted Hydrogen to Helium, increasing the concentration there to about 60%.  Since Helium is heavier, the core has gotten denser and hotter, thus increasing the reaction rate of the remaining Hydrogen and the total energy output of the Sun by about 40%.  The current output is 3.846 x 10&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt; Watts.  This will continue to increase by about 1% per hundred million years.

===Solar System Evolution===

====Planetary Formation====

Whatever internal motions the Solar Nebula had, there was no way to dispose of angular momentum (net rotation).  Therefore a small part of the nebula remained orbiting the proto-Sun rather than falling in, and keeping most of the angular momentum.  This region is estimated to have been 50 AU in radius, and disk shaped as the net result of rotation.  The increasing temperature of the proto-Sun created a temperature gradient based on distance from the center.  The innermost part was too warm for icy material to remain solid, while the outer parts were cold enough for water, ammonia, and other ices.  No part was cold enough for Hydrogen and Helium to condense.  Particles condensed out of the nebula as the flat shape radiated heat to space and the optical thickness radially kept the outer parts from being heated by the Sun.  Small particles could grow first by sticking to each other, then later by gravitational attraction.  The mix of objects which formed this way are called '''Planetesimals'''.

Gravitational attraction is a runaway process.  As an object gets larger, it can attract objects from a larger distance, thus increasing its growth rate.  Larger objects also have a potential energy well, so approaching objects will accelerate to impact.  The impact energy eventually becomes large enough to melt the object.  In addition, there were more radioactive elements in the early Solar System than there are now, and decay of those elements contributed to the heating of the growing bodies.  The largest objects were able to affect the orbits of the smaller ones, causing them to either impact or get scattered away.  This tended to clear out a region around each large object.  The very largest objects had a sufficiently deep gravity well that they could collect gaseous Hydrogen and Helium, forming the gas giants. Some of the scattered objects, and planetesimals which formed at the outer edges of the nebula, have survived relatively unchanged beyond Neptune.  The material from the inner Solar System which could not condense there tended to be blown outwards, and the point where they could solidify is near Jupiter's orbit, which may account for the large mass of Jupiter and Saturn compared to the rest of the planets.  The entire accretion and clearing process took about 100 million years, with the final growth of the planets perhaps taking 10 million years.

====Planetary Evolution====

The bodies which were large enough to melt from impacts and radioactive heating had the denser compounds sink to the center. Iron and related metals are the heaviest common materials, so they ended up in the cores.  Going outwards, the layers include rocky minerals of different densities (a mantle and crust), then ices and an atmosphere if the body formed with these components.  This layered structure is what we find today in the planets and larger satellites, along with the composition change with distance from the Sun.  These trends are not strict rules because random collisions and gravitational scattering have changed the location and make up of the objects since they formed, and smaller bodies have lost original atmosphere and in some cases ices.  After the original formation era of about 100 million years, the larger planets continued to interact with each other chaotically until they settled into a relatively stable arrangement about 3.8 billion years ago.  The planetary shifts affected the smaller bodies, who continued to be scattered or impact.  The evidence of this is still visible in craters and the locations of scattered objects.  

Bodies in the Solar System continue to interact gravitationally, and impacts and scattering continue, but at a lower rate. Bodies like the Earth have active processes that tend to erase craters, while smaller ones lack an atmosphere or crustal motion, and preserve them through the life of the Solar System. The resulting current distribution of matter, and the very large energy output of the Sun, are the main resources to work with for space projects.

===The Earth-Moon System===

'''[[w:Earth_science|Earth Science]]''' is the study of the Earth and its component parts.  The study of the Earth predates detailed study of other planets because this is where humans started, and it continues to be the best studied planet.  In the context of modern astronomy and planetary science, the Earth is now studied as one planet among many.  In the context of human history it still has a special place because we evolved here, and until now, none of us has left the Earth-Moon system.  Nearly all of the design, materials, equipment, and operations of space projects to date has actually occurred on Earth.  This will continue to be true for at least the near future.  Therefore some understanding of the Earth is still needed to carry out space projects.  For an introduction to the field see:

* CK12 Foundation - '''[http://www.ck12.org/book/CK-12-Earth-Science-Concepts/ Earth Science Concepts]'''

The Earth formed in the same way as the rest of the large bodies in the Solar System, mostly by collisions.  Debris from a very large collision late in the process formed the Moon, explaining the difference in its composition relative to the Earth.  Impacts and radioactive decay released enough energy to melt the entire planet, and the high temperature likely led to loss of some of the more volatile ices and gases.  Continued radioactive decay, supplemented by other energy releases, has kept the Earth's interior hot. It has an inner metallic '''Ccore''' solidified by pressure, even though it is about the same temperature as the Sun's surface (6000 K).  Outside of this is a liquid metallic outer core, and then a rocky layer called the '''Mantle'''.  The deeper parts of this layer have temperatures of 2000K or more.  Although pressure keeps them solid at these high temperatures, the rock is able to flow slowly over time in a type of thermal circulation taking on the order of 100 million years.  The least dense and coolest rocks form a roughly 120 km thick solid layer called the '''Lithosphere''', which has a relatively high temperature gradient relative to the rest of the planet.  By composition the lower part of the Lithosphere is part of the Mantle, and the outer part is less dense rock called the '''Crust'''.

The internal motions of the Mantle and heat traveling outwards can cause local temperature to get higher than the melting point dictated by local pressure.  The molten rock is called '''Magma''', and its composition can vary because different minerals have different melting curves.  Movement of magma and bulk Mantle circulation drive about 20 pieces of the Crust, called '''Plates''' to slowly move and change shape.  These movements and '''Weathering''', the mechanical and chemical changes from the surface environment, explain the geography and geology we find today. These dynamic processes combine to erode most of the early Earth's history.  The current surface averages ten percent or less of the age of the planet as a whole.

'''The Moon''' 

The Moon formed by gravitational accretion of the debris from a major impact.  It formed much closer to the Earth than it is now, but tides act to slow the Earth's rotation and increase the Moon's orbit, a process that continues.  The Moon is smaller than the Earth, and so lost its internal heat faster, and is now mostly solid. It is too small to retain an atmosphere because of the low escape velocity.  Thus the Moon retains evidence of its early history in the form of large impact basins and craters of all sizes.  The larger basins filled with magma to create relatively flat and darker areas mistakenly named '''Mare''' (Latin for &quot;Sea&quot;), because they were thought to have water.  The greater tides from the time the Moon was closer to Earth slowed the Moon's rotation so the same side faces us, with a little wobble.  It also caused most of the Mare to form on the near side.

==Chemistry==

The science of '''[[General_Chemistry|Chemistry]]''' has historically been considered a separate subject from physics.  In a more general sense it can be considered a subset of low energy physics where arrangements of atoms via atomic bonding is important.  We humans happen to require living conditions where atomic bonding is important, so we give that energy regime more attention.  In reality, something like 99% of the matter in the Universe is in the plasma state, where electrons are no longer bound to atoms, and inter-atom bonding is rare.

The importance of chemical reactions to space projects until now was primarily in providing high temperature gases to propel rockets.  In future projects reactions in life support systems and extraction and preparation of materials in space will become much more important.  We will therefore summarize some key ideas here, and refer the reader to the following sources for more detail:

[[File:Schnorr von Carolsfeld Bibel in Bildern 1860 048.png|thumb|left|175px|Aaron Cast His Rod Before Pharaoh and It Became a Serpent (woodcut by Julius Schnorr von Carolsfeld from the 1860 ''Die Bibel in Bildern'')]]
God spoke to Moses, identified Himself as the God of the Patriarchs, and acknowledged hearing the moaning of the Israelites. God instructed Moses to tell the Israelites that God would free them, make them God’s people, and bring them to the Promised Land. But the Israelites would not listen because of their distress and hard labor. God told Moses to tell Pharaoh to let the Israelites go, but Moses complained that Pharaoh would not heed him, a man of impeded speech.

The text interjects a partial genealogy of Reuben, Simeon, and finally Levi, including Moses and his family.

[[File:Tissot Water Is Changed into Blood.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Water Is Changed into Blood (watercolor circa 1896–1902 by James Tissot)]]
God placed Aaron in the role of Moses’ prophet, to speak to Pharaoh. God intended to harden Pharaoh’s heart, so that God might show signs and marvels. God told how Aaron could cast down his rod and it would turn into a snake, and Aaron did so before Pharaoh. Pharaoh caused his magicians to do the same, but Aaron’s rod swallowed their rods. Pharaoh’s heart stiffened.

===The plagues of Egypt===
God began visiting ten plagues on Egypt.  God told Moses to go to Pharaoh at his morning bath, demand of him to let the Israelites go to worship in the wilderness, and have Aaron strike the Nile with his rod and turn it into blood. Moses and Aaron did so, and the fish died and the Nile stank. But when the Egyptian magicians did the same, Pharaoh’s heart stiffened.
Seven days later, God told Moses to have Aaron hold his arm with the rod over the river and bring up frogs, and they did so. The magicians did the same. Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron to plead with God to remove the frogs and said he's let the Israelites go; Moses did so, but Pharaoh became stubborn and did not let the Israelites leave.

[[File:Tissot The Plague of Flies.jpg|thumb|left|175px|The Plague of Flies (watercolor circa 1896–1902 by James Tissot)]]
God told Moses to have Aaron strike the dust with his rod, to turn it to lice throughout the land, and they did so. The magicians tried to do the same, but they could not. The magicians told Pharaoh, “This is the finger of God!”  But Pharaoh’s heart stiffened.

God loosed swarms of insects against the Egyptians, but not Goshen, where the Israelites dwelt. Pharaoh told Moses and Aaron to go sacrifice to God within Egypt, but Moses insisted on going three days into the wilderness. Pharaoh agreed, in exchange for Moses’ prayer to lift the plague. But when God removed the insects, Pharaoh became stubborn again.

God struck the Egyptian’s livestock with a pestilence, sparing the Israelites’ livestock. But Pharaoh remained stubborn.

God told Moses to take handfuls of soot from the kiln and throw it toward the sky, so that it would become a fine dust, causing boils on man and beast throughout Egypt, and he did so. But God stiffened Pharaoh’s heart.

God told Moses to threaten Pharaoh with hail. Those who feared God’s word brought their slaves and livestock indoors. God sent thunder and hail, which struck down all exposed in Egypt, but did not strike Goshen. Pharaoh confessed his wrong, agreed to let the Israelites go, and asked Moses and Aaron to pray to end the hail. Moses did so, but Pharaoh reverted to his guilty ways.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=License to Censor: THE USE OF MEDIA REGULATION TO RESTRICT PRESS FREEDOM=

Researched and written by Dr. Karin Deutsch Karlekar, Senior Researcher and Managing Editor of Freedom of
the Press, with the exception of the Lebanon and Ecuador chapters. The Lebanon chapter was
researched and written by Courtney C. Radsch, Senior Program Officer for the Global Freedom
of Expression Campaign and the Ecuador chapter by Javier Sierra, Projects Director of the
World Press Freedom Committee of Freedom House. Dr. Karin Deutsch Karlekar and Courtney
C. Radsch served as the report’s general editors.

==INTRODUCTION==

In some parts of the world, the threats to press freedom are explicit and often violent. Journalists
are murdered or imprisoned, states maintain strict media monopolies, and domestic audiences are
cut off from foreign news sources. Such unambiguously hostile conditions typically elicit strong
responses from international advocacy groups and democracies that are committed to defending
freedom of expression. However, in a much broader range of countries, governments are using
the more subtle tools of media regulation to restrict press freedom, maintaining a veneer of
legality and pluralism that is less likely to draw attention or criticism from abroad. Manipulation
of the regulatory framework allows leaders to either tolerate or rein in influential news outlets
depending on the political situation, and permits even democratically elected governments to
fortify themselves against future electoral competition.

This special report describes the primary types of media regulation that are used to
restrict press freedom, including:

 statutory controls on licensing and registration;

 the creation of nominally independent regulatory bodies with built-in avenues for
political influence;

 legal imposition of vague or burdensome content requirements

Official actions sometimes represent the normal application of highly restrictive laws,
while in other cases executive or judicial authorities act arbitrarily, outside the bounds of the law,
or in an overtly politicized manner. Government efforts to promote statutory regulation can be
particularly effective when self-regulatory mechanisms like media councils or ombudsmen are
nonexistent or perceived as weak or underutilized.

Through a detailed examination of such threats in eight different national media
environments—Ecuador, Georgia, Indonesia, Lebanon, Pakistan, South Africa, Uganda, and
Zimbabwe—this study assesses the growing danger they pose to media freedom worldwide and
provides recommendations on how to counter the negative trend.

==BACKGROUND==

Historically, some degree of regulation has been imposed on all types of media, but broadcast
media have usually been subject to a wider range of government controls, including more
stringent licensing rules, tighter restrictions on content, and limitations on private or foreign
ownership. This discrepancy can be attributed in part to the argument that while the number and
character of print outlets are limited only by demand and financing, broadcast media rely on the
airwaves, a finite public resource, meaning access must be parceled out and regulated by the
state.

One must distinguish between regulation that is minimal—for example, a pro forma
requirement to simply register a new outlet—and regulation that entails extensive, broadly
worded, or onerous licensing requirements, which can be enforced selectively as a method of
control. In freer countries, the predominantly private print media are generally unregulated or
self-regulated, and both private and public-service broadcast media have traditionally been
subject to limited state regulation. In less free media environments, print media outlets are often
subject to state-imposed statutory regulation, while the broadcast sector in many cases remains
mostly or entirely under state control.
In addition to the technical differences between print and broadcast media that have led to
greater regulation of the latter, many governments have regarded broadcast outlets as a greater
potential threat, largely because of their ability to overcome literacy barriers and reach larger
audiences. Broadcast media can also transmit live events, leaving little opportunity for the
authorities to censor information after the fact. Such concerns have led incoming or maturing
authoritarian regimes to make dominance of the national broadcast sector a high priority.
For example, after taking office as president of Russia in 2000, Vladimir Putin moved to
assert control over broadcast media through coerced buyouts, a campaign of intimidation against
billionaire businessmen with media assets, and concerted efforts to purge foreign-produced
content from many radio stations. More recently, the government of President Hugo Chávez in
Venezuela refused to renew the terrestrial broadcast license of the popular Radio Caracas
Television (RCTV), accusing the outlet of supporting a failed coup attempt and thus breaching
broadcast regulations. The closure of RCTV has been followed by the withdrawal of dozens of
private radio licenses. Similar approaches have prevailed in other parts of the former Soviet
Union and in the Middle East, with governments maintaining a firmer regulatory grip on
broadcasting than on print.

The increased manipulation of regulatory controls in recent years is in many ways a
response to a longer-term trend of diversification of broadcast media, which has been reflected in
successive editions of Freedom House’s annual Freedom of the Press report. In some cases, as
part of broader democratic openings or economic privatization programs over the last two
decades, governments have introduced new laws allowing the establishment of private outlets
where previously only state-run broadcasters were permitted. Other factors include the spread of
international or regional satellite broadcasters, as well as nationally focused satellite stations that
operate outside the target country’s borders. No longer inclined or able to engage in direct,
across-the-board censorship, the authorities in many countries have turned to more selective
controls, using licensing and regulatory frameworks in a politicized way to cripple only those
outlets that are seen as a threat to the government.

==METHODS OF CONTROL==

The use of regulatory mechanisms to restrict media freedom can take a number of forms. Official
control over the regulatory process can be built into the legal framework from the outset, through
either restrictive licensing laws or the processes for appointing the leadership of a regulatory
body. However, even in countries with a relatively well-constructed legal framework, the laws
can be selectively applied or misused to close critical outlets, and political leaders can exert
informal, extralegal influence over nominally
independent regulators.

===Licensing Rules===
----
Licensing is the primary method by which
the initial establishment of private media
outlets can be regulated. International bestpractice
standards call for minimal
notification or registration requirements,
which should not be used as a basis for
denying an outlet permission to function or
for governing content. Licensing of print
media is rare in more open environments,
while in more restrictive media environments
print media are subject to licensing
procedures that range from the simple, as in
Pakistan, to the extremely onerous, as in
Zimbabwe.
----
The most overt form of media restriction entails
outright state monopolies. While these still exist in
a number of highly repressive media environments,
the majority of countries now permit some form of
private ownership of broadcast media. In most
cases, private outlets exist alongside state-run
counterparts, although the private-public ratio
varies by country and region.1 It is important to
note that state ownership does not necessarily lead
to politicized control over content and the loss of
editorial independence. In practice, however, truly
independent public-service broadcasting has been
difficult to achieve except in democratic countries
with a long history of such institutions. In Eastern Europe and Southern Africa, for instance,
nominally independent public broadcasters that were formed in the 1990s following major
democratic openings remain subject to pressure from government officials and political parties.

A case in point is the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC), a state-owned entity that
is broadly perceived as presenting viewpoints that align with those of the ruling African National
Congress (ANC) party. In more restrictive media environments, state-run media dominate the
landscape and serve as mouthpieces for the government.

Licensing systems are also sometimes imposed on journalists themselves. Best practice
calls for open access to the profession, with no licensing process or other criteria—such as
membership in a particular professional body or educational credentials—for aspiring
journalists.2 Again, such requirements are less common in more open and democratic media
environments, but they exist to varying degrees in transitional or authoritarian media systems,
and in some cases they are used as an overt method of control over the media. A recent report for
the Center for International Media Assistance found that in over quarter of the more than 100
countries examined, the state plays some role in licensing journalists.3

By contrast, most countries, including democratic states, have traditionally featured
significant regulation of private broadcast outlets, typically including licensing and frequency
allocations by an official regulatory body. Ideally, an independent, nonpartisan entity adjudicates
requests for licenses and spectrum according to a clearly defined legal process, and in a
transparent and unbiased manner, so that media diversity is not compromised.4 Regulatory
bodies following this model are common in North America and Western Europe, as well as in a
number of other democratic settings. For example, in Mali, while the law requires broadcasters
to be licensed in order to receive a frequency and operate, the rules are straightforward,
bureaucratic procedures and financial hurdles are minimal, and the regulatory body in charge
functions independently.5

However, in less open systems, laws regulating broadcast licensing can provide ample
opportunities to restrict the dissemination of news and information. Exorbitant licensing fees can
bar new entrants to the market, perpetuating the dominance of state media. In Jordan, a new
licensing system that took effect in 2003 required high fees only for channels that intended to
broadcast political news; as a result, most new outlets air only music and other entertainment
programming.6

Licenses may also be denied to outlets with foreign ownership, and such rules are
sometimes enacted to target certain troublesome news sources. As part of a sweeping “media
industry development” decree issued in Fiji in June 2010, foreign ownership in any outlet—
whether print or broadcast—was capped at 10 percent, leading to the forced sale of the Fiji
Times, one of the country’s oldest independent newspapers and a strong voice for democratic
values.7

Geographical restrictions similarly serve to limit the reach and influence of private
outlets. A government may retain for itself the right to operate outlets with a national reach,
allowing smaller private outlets to operate only in certain geographic areas or with a limited
reach because of the equipment or technology available to them.

Additional burdensome measures could include requirements that force an outlet to
reregister every year, or to provide excessive personal information about the owners or staff
when applying for a license or registration.

Licensing restrictions that focus on content, as with the Jordanian system described above
or Lebanon’s restrictions on political news content, allow governments to foster a commercially
vibrant private media sector while curtailing critical news coverage. In the most extreme cases,
outlets might be legally required to submit planned programming for preapproval and possible
censorship by the state. In Syria, for instance, the Ministry of Information closely monitors
content to ensure adherence to government policies and directives.

In other settings, content restrictions may feature a prohibition on broadcasting news, or
conversely, a requirement to broadcast government-produced news material. In India, private FM
radio stations are not allowed to broadcast news content, while in neighboring Bangladesh,
private outlets are required to air selected government-produced news segments (in addition to
their own programming) as a condition of their operation. In Venezuela, all registered broadcast
outlets are required to carry the president’s speeches simultaneously and whenever they occur.
The cable arm of RCTV in Venezuela was suspended for more than a year and allowed back on
the air in early 2010 only after it agreed to this condition.8

Legal restrictions on broadcast content can also contain provisions that are overly vague,
giving the regulator wide discretion in its enforcement decisions. In recent years, a number of
countries—including India, Pakistan, and Turkey—have tried to regulate coverage of terrorism,
particularly material that could be seen as assisting or glorifying terrorist acts. However, industry
groups in the countries involved have raised concerns that broadly worded strictures could be
misapplied.

One such measure already in force is Venezuela’s 2004 Law for Social Responsibility in
Radio, Television, and Electronic Media, which prohibits broadcast stations from airing content
that could “promote, defend, or incite breaches of public order” or is “contrary to the security of
the nation.”9 A December 2010 amendment to the Organic Law of Telecommunications
extended the authority of the country’s National Telecommunications Commission (CONATEL)
to withdraw the license of any broadcaster that violated the law more than once, and shortened
license terms from 20 to 15 years; however, a controversial provision that would have required
owners of outlets to reregister with CONATEL in person was withdrawn from the final bill.

===Laws on Regulatory Bodies===

Legislation establishing an official regulatory body would ideally ensure its independence from
the political branches of government, political parties, and economic interests. This means
insulating the regulator from improper influence over its membership, appointments, financing,
and decision-making process.10 However, these laws can also be crafted in a way that both limits
the regulatory body’s autonomy from the outset and grants it such authority that the government
can use it to ensure official control over important parts of the media landscape.

A number of recent laws demonstrate
various governments’ intent to control the
broadcast sector, either directly or through an
obedient regulatory body. For example, the
Kenya Communications (Amendment) Act of
2009 gave the minister of information the
power to exercise editorial control over
broadcast content and to seize broadcast
stations and equipment. It also established a
communications commission appointed by the
minister, including four sitting government
officials, plus a chairman appointed by the
president. The commission would have the
power to issue broadcast licenses and impose
heavy fines and prison sentences for various
offenses.11 The law was heavily criticized, and
may be ameliorated by draft legislation
intended to bring existing statutes into
compliance with the new 2010 constitution by strengthening the independence of Kenya’s
regulatory bodies.12
----
Botswana’s December 2008 Media
Practitioners Act established a nominally
independent Media Council tasked with
upholding ethical standards and ensuring
media freedom. However, the legislation did
not contain supporting provisions to ensure
the council’s independence; in fact, it is
financially dependent on the government,
and its members are all appointed by the
minister of communication. This
compromised body was nevertheless granted
broad powers over the accreditation of
journalists and the supervision of media
conduct.
----

Such moves to ensure control over the regulator through legislation can occur even in a
relatively well-established democracy. In the second half of 2010, as part of a wide-ranging
package of changes to the media laws, Hungary enacted legislation that merged two existing
entities into a new National Media and Infocommunications Authority (NMHH). The prime
minister was granted the power to appoint the president of the NMHH for a nine-year term,
without limits on reappointment. The NMHH president also chairs a new, ostensibly autonomous
Media Council, whose four other members are appointed by the parliament; the ruling party
currently holds a two-thirds legislative majority. The Media Council has the authority to censure
and impose high fines on media outlets for broadly worded content violations, including failure
to provide “balanced coverage.”13 All types of media, including online outlets, will be required
to register with the NMHH. These changes were criticized by the opposition, press freedom
groups, and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). Some provisions
were softened by amendments passed in March 2011 after an outcry from the European Union,
but press freedom groups and the OSCE representative on media freedom continued to express
concerns that the laws had the potential to curb diverse and critical views.14

It is important to note that even when good laws have been passed, implementation may
lag severely, creating a vacuum of power and responsibilities. In Zambia, legislation to establish
an Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA) was passed in 2002, but the regulator has not yet
been set up, and the Ministry of Information has apparently taken an ad hoc approach to both
granting and threatening to suspend or withdraw broadcast licenses.15 In Georgia, gaps between
the law and practice have led to the regulatory body’s independence being compromised and it
becoming unduly subject to political influence. And in Indonesia, the government has reclaimed
powers granted by law to nominally independent regulatory bodies for both print and broadcast,
creating a situation where the government has de facto control over the regulatory process.
Arbitrary or Extralegal Regulation

While governments often restrict press freedom using regulatory and licensing procedures that
are clearly defined by law, they can also act on an arbitrary or extralegal basis. Common tactics
include bureaucratic obstruction, threatened or actual suspensions without a firm legal
justification, sudden bans on certain types of content, and circumvention of established
regulatory systems by other arms of the government.

Bureaucratic foot-dragging can be an effective method of state control over the media
space, and is often used to withhold licenses from private outlets. This tactic has been employed
against print outlets; the Daily News in Zimbabwe, which had been shut down in 2003, was
forced to wait until 2010 to reopen despite court rulings in its favor. But more examples can be
found in the broadcast sector. In Ethiopia, for instance, the 1999 Broadcasting Proclamation
provided for the licensing of private radio broadcasters, but the government did not open the
licensing authority until 2002, and it had only awarded licenses to two private FM stations by
2006.16 A third station licensed in 2009 limits its content to music and other entertainment,
avoiding any political topics, according to IREX’s 2009 Media Sustainability Index.

Similarly, in the decade prior to Tunisia’s recent revolution, the country’s National
Frequencies Agency licensed just one television station and three radio broadcasters, all of which
were owned by business interests close to the government, while repeatedly ignoring
applications from independent outlets.17 And in December 2010 in Armenia, the presidentially
appointed regulator denied a 13th consecutive license request from A1+, an independent
television station whose license was rescinded in 2002, despite a 2008 ruling in its favor by the
European Court of Human Rights.18 In these cases, as in a number of other countries, favoritism
was shown to progovernment applicants, while requests by independent outlets were rejected or
pointedly ignored.

The threat of license revocation or suspension is another tactic that has been used
frequently to harass critical media. An outlet may be threatened with the loss of its license if it is
deemed to have contravened vaguely written laws on content, or if it simply crosses the
government’s unofficial redlines on acceptable coverage. In some cases the reason for the
suspension or withdrawal of the license is never made clear. One recent example comes from
Ukraine, where in August 2010 two independent television companies had a number of their
licenses withdrawn due to alleged irregularities in their initial allocation. However, Valeriy
Khoroshkovsky, the owner of a rival media group and the head of the Ukrainian Security
Service, was accused by one of the stations of influencing the decision.19 License renewals have
also been denied for political reasons in Ecuador and Bangladesh. Even stations that are not
directly affected by such decisions may engage in self-censorship to avoid similar repercussions
for critical coverage, damaging the diversity and vibrancy of the media sector as a whole.

Actual shutdowns of media outlets are sometimes processed through legal channels but
more commonly occur as the result of an extralegal executive decision. While they are often
temporary, the closures occasionally become permanent. They are frequently imposed in periods
of political or social tension, such as during election campaigns, protest movements, or outbreaks
of ethnic or religious violence.

For example, in November and December 2010, regulators in Egypt shut down or
otherwise censored a number of television stations based on complaints filed by the minister of
information or alleged violations of election guidelines.20 Four satellite television stations were
also closed in October for breaches of unspecified license terms.21 The Rwandan government
employed similar tactics prior to elections held in August 2010. In late July, the regulator
published a list of several dozen print and broadcast outlets that would be “recognized” by the
government, rendering approximately 30 others illegal, including several leading print outlets.
The banned publications and stations were then ordered to reapply for licenses, and those that
attempted to continue operating were seized.22 Two leading newspapers had already been
suspended in April for a six-month period—an extralegal decision that also seemed aimed at
curtailing independent coverage of the August election.

With the dramatic increase in broadcast media diversity and the growth of private outlets
in recent years, there has been a particular focus on obstructing live television news coverage and
live radio and television call-in shows in which hosts, guest commentators, and ordinary citizens
are able to express their views freely. Bans on or interference with such programming occurred
amid political tension and rioting in Uganda in September 2009, and during ethnic violence in
Kyrgyzstan in June 2010.23 A radio station in Zambia, which had already been banned from
hosting live call-in programs since 2007, was threatened with revocation of its license in
November 2010 due to allegations that it intended to host an opposition leader and discuss a
controversial topic. In January 2011, the station was raided and closed down after airing an
advertisement for a meeting on the same topic.24 In the majority of such incidents, the authorities
cite technical “irregularities” or violations of license terms, but the true aim appears to be halting
criticism of the government or unflattering live news coverage.

Arbitrary directives on content have been also been employed by regulators in certain
situations. For example, in June 2010, the High Authority for Broadcasting and Communication
(HAAC) in Benin issued a blanket ban on all media coverage that could be described as
“premature” election campaigning until 15 days prior to the elections, which were not scheduled
to take place until 2011.25 The HAAC threatened to shut down or withdraw the license of any
outlet that violated this directive, despite protests from industry groups that the regulator was
overstepping its legal authority. A similar directive concerning coverage of campaigning
activities was announced by Côte d’Ivoire’s National Audiovisual Communication Council in
October 2010.

The state sometimes bypasses the legally mandated regulatory bodies entirely, with
executive or law enforcement agencies forcibly closing outlets on national security or some other
grounds. Authorities in Thailand used an emergency decree to shutter several dozen community
radio stations in July 2010, accusing presenters of fomenting political tension. The move
circumvented the National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission (NBTC), which
supervises broadcast outlets.26 However, NBTC officials were involved in a court-ordered raid
on 13 stations that was orchestrated by the Internal Security Operations Command in April 2011.
The raid, in which 12 stations were shut down and several media personnel were arrested, was
prompted by the airing of a speech by an opposition political leader that was considered to be
defamatory toward the king.27

Other such instances have occurred in countries including Uganda and Pakistan. In The
Gambia, a radio station that was arbitrarily closed in January 2011 was able to reopen in
February after being offered a “second chance” by the president, whose office noted in a letter to
the station that it should desist from citing opposition newspapers in its popular news review and
current affairs program, and should only review news from government-controlled outlets.28 A
local judge in Argentina ordered the closure of a radio station in Santa Fe Province in April in
what appeared to be a politicized decision stemming from the station’s criticism of the local
mayor; the ruling bypassed the federal regulator and an established process for making
complaints.29 Arbitrary decisions by a mayor were also apparently behind the shutdowns of a
television and a radio station in western Venezuela in May 2011.

===Self-Regulation===

Self-regulation, as an alternative to statutory regulation, is acknowledged as the best-practice
model and is already used in dozens of countries, particularly those with freer media
environments. In a self-regulatory system, the media industry essentially polices itself through
bodies such as a nongovernmental media council or an ombudsman, which monitor compliance
with agreed-upon codes of conduct. Most self-regulatory bodies apply to print media, but in
some countries there are separate entities for broadcast media. Councils that cover all forms of
media are less common, but given the growth of media houses that encompass print, broadcast,
and internet outlets, this all-media format may expand in the future.

Ideally, self-regulatory bodies should enjoy broad acceptance and participation by the
media sector, and their leaders should for the most part be members of the profession who were
elected by their peers, supplemented by members of the public, retired judges, or other
independent actors. The entity would be empowered to hear cases brought against media outlets
or journalists by members of the public or government figures, and to adjudicate and direct
remedial action, which frequently takes the form of a published retraction or correction.30
Examples of such bodies include the Peruvian Press Council and the Media Council of Tanzania.

In some cases, the state tries to co-opt an existing self-regulatory process. A subtle bill
proposed in Panama in early 2010, for instance, would establish a national agency to “oversee”
self-regulatory agreements by setting norms, a move that regional press freedom watchdogs
decried as a distortion of the idea of self-regulation.31 Alternatively, the state may claim that an
existing system is ineffective and try to replace or eclipse it with some form of statutory
regulation, as with a government-proposed media tribunal currently under consideration in South
Africa. Most commonly, the reason given for such a course of action is that the existing
mechanism does not have sufficient teeth (in terms of punishments for violators) or is unable to
police irresponsible media outlets effectively.

In a number of other countries, self-regulatory mechanisms are undeveloped or extremely
weak, and the state is able to use this as an excuse to continue or introduce statutory regulation.
In Zambia, for instance, the media have made attempts to develop a self-regulatory mechanism
that encompasses both the entire private sector and the state-run outlets, but the effort faces an
ongoing threat from the government, which has sought to impose statutory regulation.32 In 2010,
a consortium of industry groups agreed to establish a self-regulatory body, the Zambia Media
Council (ZAMEC), and drafted a code of ethics that the council would help enforce. However,
due to a lack of official support—which would limit the participation of state media—the
launching of ZAMEC was repeatedly postponed. In early 2011, ZAMEC announced further
measures to strengthen its enforcement mechanisms amid continuing discussions with the
government on whether the public media would be involved in the process.33

Threats to self-regulatory mechanisms appear to be on the rise, according to a recent
report by the Center for International Media Assistance; media in a number of countries,
particularly in Africa, are facing stronger attempts to impose state-controlled regulation.34
However, in some cases this has spurred private media to adopt preemptive measures. In
Pakistan, the government’s moves to impose additional regulatory controls have led to concerted
action by the media industry to develop its own codes of conduct, for example on the topic of
broadcast coverage of terrorist events or violence. Looming threats of state-led regulation also
prompted the establishment of independent media councils in Britain in 1991 and Ireland in
2007.35

===Regulation of Networked and Foreign Media===

As a result of the internationalization of the media space, national regulatory systems are
affecting not just domestic outlets, but also international and regional broadcasters. For example,
in the wake of the disputed 2010 presidential election in Côte d’Ivoire, the regulator—on orders
from the government, led then by President Laurent Gbagbo—suspended local transmission of
all international radio and television news services, citing the potential for unrest. France’s Radio
France Internationale was also shut down in the Democratic Republic of the Congo for more
than a year in 2009, after the government accused it of demoralizing the army. The pan-Arab
satellite television station Al-Jazeera has fallen afoul of a number of governments in the Middle
East and North Africa, which have on various occasions withdrawn licenses and accreditation
from its correspondents and bureaus.36

However, a more globalized and diverse media environment, in which cable and satellite
stations compete with terrestrial broadcasters, has also allowed national outlets to evade
restrictive regulations by, for example, establishing their headquarters and transmission facilities
outside the home country, as some Pakistani stations have done in Dubai.

The proliferation of networked media platforms like the internet and mobile telephones
presents an added challenge for regulators. In some countries, regulatory laws and bodies cover
the media as well as telecommunications, while in others there are separate regulatory
frameworks for each. Moreover, legislation on broadcasting in a number of countries,
particularly those that transitioned to more open democratic systems in the 1990s and enacted the
relevant laws more than a decade ago, seem increasingly inadequate to handle the phenomenon
of convergence, in which media content is disseminated across multiple delivery systems. Best
practice concerning internet regulation is still evolving, with many advocates arguing that online
outlets, like newspapers, should be largely free of state-imposed restrictions.

Nevertheless, some governments have responded by simply extending the rules for
broadcast media—which tend to be more restrictive than those for print and other media—to
cover the internet. A December 2010 amendment to Venezuela’s the 2004 Law for Social
Responsibility in Radio, Television, and Electronic Media extended its restrictions to online
outlets, banning messages that incite or promote hatred, foment citizens’ anxiety, or disrespect
authorities, among other loosely written provisions. The amendment also placed internet media
under the purview of CONATEL, the government regulator, which now has the power to block
online content and issue fines to media outlets or internet-service providers that violate the law.
In May 2010, Azerbaijani authorities also expressed their intent to extend licensing controls over
the internet, and particularly over internet-based television channels, although such controls have
yet to come into force.

==CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS==

The state-run national media monopolies that prevailed in many parts of the world during the
20th century have become increasingly rare, as democratization, privatization processes, and new
technologies multiply the conduits for news and information. However, governments have found
ways to adapt their legal and regulatory systems to the new environment, allowing them to
maintain a measure of control over the dissemination of news on sensitive topics.

In countries that have fallen under authoritarian rule, such as Venezuela or Zimbabwe,
legal restrictions are widespread, regulatory bodies are under government control, and private
outlets face the threat of closure for airing opposition views. In a range of partly free media
environments, authorities use regulation more selectively, punishing certain outlets or restricting
content during crucial periods. Often there is a gap between the laws on the books and their
application in practice. Unfortunately, even the governments in very open countries have
displayed an impulse to improperly control information through regulation. Hungary recently
enacted its most severe licensing and content controls since the end of communist rule, and in
South Africa, which has been held up as an example of best practice in terms of its legal
framework and self-regulatory system, a government-proposed media tribunal threatens to erode
the country’s hard-won press freedom.

In response, advocates need to maintain monitoring efforts, report violations of
international standards, and continue to push for both the reform of restrictive laws and full
adherence to well-crafted ones. Particular attention should be paid to the licensing regime and
the legal underpinnings of a given regulatory body, to ensure that the regulator has the capacity
to operate independently and make transparent decisions based on clearly defined and reasonable
criteria. Drastic steps such as the suspension of a license or the closure of an outlet should be
considered within this framework, and should not come as the result of arbitrary actions by
security forces or the executive branch.

Supporters of media freedom must also work to develop or strengthen truly independent
self-regulatory mechanisms that have the backing of both private and public outlets. These
systems should address concerns about ethical lapses and professional standards so as to prevent
the enactment of excessively harsh statutory regulation on the same grounds.

Finally, advocates should encourage a comprehensive approach to the changing and
converging media environment that nevertheless recognizes the necessity of applying different
levels of regulation to different types of media.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Pathogens in water supplies and disinfection methods for drinking water are following.

===Pathogens in Water Supplies===
* '''Bacteria''' - Bacteria are very common single-celled microorganisms that generally exist in colonies and almost always exist in water supplies.  In fact, in waste-water treatment, the presence of bacteria is essential to the breakdown of chemical contaminants.

* '''Viruses''' - A virus is a sub-microscopic (less than one micrometer in size) infectious agent that is unable to grow or reproduce outside a host cell. Each viral particle, or virion, consists DNA or RNA, within a protective protein coat called a capsid. The capsid shape varies from simple helical and icosahedral (polyhedral or near-spherical) forms, to more complex structures with tails or an envelope. Viruses infect all cellular life forms and are grouped into animal, plant and bacterial types, according to the type of host infected.

* '''Protozoa'''
** [[W:Giardia|Giardia]] - ''Giardia lamblia'' is a protozoan that is considered a dangerous acute contaminant that commonly exists in water supplies.  Within the environment, it is usually present in its dormant form as a [[W:cyst|cyst]], a thick-walled stage within which it can survive transport to a new host through water.
** [[W:Cryptosporidium|Cryptosporidium]] - ''Cryptosporidium parva'' is a protozoan that is considered a highly dangerous acute contaminant that occasionally enters water supplies.  Within the environment, it is usually present as an [[W:cyst|cyst]] or [[W:spore|spore]], a hardy stage which it uses to survive transport to a new host.

===Disinfection of Pathogens in Water===
* '''Physical''' - Boiling or freezing water causes changes in phase and density which disrupt the ability of a pathogen to exist within the medium.  Cellular [[w:cytoplasm|cytoplasm]] (cellular bodily fluid) is mostly water and reacts to physical changes of its medium (human bodily fluids or water supplies).  Boiling a fluid into a gas causes a pressure increase that explodes cell membranes.  Freezing a fluid completely causes thermal expansion of water (e.g. ice occupying more volume than the equivalent amount of water), which also creates a pressure that bursts cellular membranes.

* '''Irradiation by Electromagnetic Rays''' - [[W:Electromagnetic waves|Electromagnetic waves]] (light) of a frequency higher than low ultraviolet (i.e. UV, X and Gamma bands) are considered [[W:ionizing radiation|ionizing radiation]] and may break chemical bonds holding a pathogen together.  In the case of microbial DNA, the double helix may be broken, thus inactivating the virus.  In the case of any ionizing radiation, the water may be ionized thus creating oxidative conditions.

* '''Bactericidal metal Ions''' - Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and Hg&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; have been well known to be effective disinfectants for millenia.  

* '''pH Adjustment through Strong Acids and Bases'''

* '''Surfactants''' - Quarternary Ammonium Compounds

* '''Chemical Oxidants''' - Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ClO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, KMnO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and FeO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt; and halo-organic compunds.

'''Solar water disinfection''', also known as '''SODIS'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sodis.ch/index_EN |title=SODIS - Safe drinking water in 6 hours |publisher=sodis.ch |accessdate=30 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a method of [[w:disinfection|disinfecting]] water using only [[w:sunlight|sunlight]] and plastic [[w:polyethylene terephthalate|PET]] bottles. SODIS is a free and effective method for decentralized [[w:water treatment|water treatment]], usually applied at the household level and is recommended by the [[w:World Health Organization|World Health Organization]] as a viable method for household water treatment and safe storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/household_water/en/ |title=Household water treatment and safe storage |publisher=[[w:World Health Organization|World Health Organization]] |accessdate=30 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; SODIS is already applied in numerous [[w:developing countries|developing countries]].

==Principle==
Exposure to sunlight has been shown to deactivate [[w:diarrhea|diarrhea]]-causing organisms in polluted [[w:drinking water|drinking water]]. Three effects of [[w:solar radiation|solar radiation]] are believed to contribute to the inactivation of pathogenic organisms:

* UV-A interferes directly with the metabolism and destroys cell structures of bacteria.
* [[w:Ultraviolet|UV]]-A (wavelength 320-400&amp;nbsp;nm) reacts with oxygen dissolved in the water and produces highly reactive forms of oxygen (oxygen free radicals and [[w:hydrogen peroxide|hydrogen peroxides]]), that are believed to also damage pathogens.
* Cumulative solar energy (including the [[w:infrared radiation|infrared radiation]] component) heats the water. If the water temperatures rises above 50°C, the disinfection process is three times faster.

At a water temperature of about 30°C (86°F), a threshold solar radiation intensity of at least 500 W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (all spectral light) is required for about 5 hours for SODIS to be efficient. This dose contains energy of 555 Wh/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in the range of UV-A and violet light, 350&amp;nbsp;nm-450&amp;nbsp;nm, corresponding to about 6 hours of mid-latitude (European) midday summer sunshine.

At water temperatures higher than 45°C (113°F), synergistic effects of UV radiation and temperature further enhance the disinfection efficiency.

== Process for household application ==

[[Image:Pictograms SODIS.jpg|800px|]]
[[File:U+2673 DejaVu Sans.svg|thumb|right|PET recycling mark]]

* Colourless, transparent [[w:polyethylene terephthalate|PET]] water or pop bottles (2 litre or smaller size) with few surface scratches are chosen for use. The labels are removed and the bottles are washed before the first use.
* Water from contaminated sources are filled into the bottles. To improve oxygen saturation, bottles can be filled three quarters, shaken for 20 seconds (with the cap on), then filled completely and recapped. Very cloudy water with a turbidity higher than 30 [[w:Nephelometric Turbidity Unit|NTU]] must be filtered prior to exposure to the sunlight.
* Filled bottles are then exposed to the sun. Bottles will heat faster and to higher temperatures if they are placed on a sloped sun-facing corrugated metal roof as compared to thatched roofs.
* The treated water can be consumed directly from the bottle or poured into clean drinking cups. The risk of re-contamination is minimized if the water is stored in the bottles. Refilling and storage in other containers increases the risk of contamination.

==Applications==

SODIS is an effective method for treating water where fuel or cookers are unavailable or prohibitively expensive. Even where fuel is available, SODIS is a more economical and environmentally friendly option. The application of SODIS is limited if enough bottles are not available, or if the water is highly [[w:turbid|turbid]].In fact, if the water is highly turbid, SODIS can not be used alone, additional filtering is then necessary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cepis.org.pe/cursodesastres/diplomado/pdf/SODIS.pdf Limitations of SODIS]&lt;/ref&gt;

In theory, the method could be used in disaster relief or refugee camps. However, supplying bottles may be more difficult than providing equivalent disinfecting tablets containing chlorine, bromine, or iodine, or metal containers in which water can be boiled with fire.  Additionally, in some circumstances, it may be difficult to guarantee that the water will be left in the sun for the necessary time.

Other methods for household water treatment and safe storage exist, e.g. chlorination, different filtration procedures or flocculation/disinfection. The selection of the adequate method should be based on the criteria of effectiveness, the co-occurrence of other types of pollution (turbidity, chemical pollutants), treatment costs, labor input and convenience, and the user’s preference.

==Cautions==

If the water bottles are not left in the sun for the proper length of time, the water may not be safe to drink and could cause illness. If the sunlight is less strong, due to overcast weather or a less sunny climate, a longer exposure time in the sun is necessary. 

The following issues should also be considered:

* '''Bottle material:''' Some glass or PVC materials may prevent ultraviolet light from reaching the water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5hmK5deXc |title=SODIS Technical Note # 2 Materials: Plastic versus Glass Bottles |format=PDF |publisher=sodis.ch |date=20 October 1998 |accessdate=1 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commercially available bottles made of  [[w:Polyethylene terephthalate|PET]] are recommended. The handling is much more convenient in the case of PET bottles. [[w:Polycarbonate|Polycarbonate]] blocks all UVA and UVB rays, and therefore should not be used.

* '''Aging of plastic bottles:''' SODIS efficiency depends on the physical condition of the plastic bottles, with scratches and other signs of wear reducing the efficiency of SODIS. Heavily scratched or old, blind bottles should be replaced.
 
* '''Shape of containers:''' the intensity of the UV radiation decreases rapidly with increasing water depth. At a water depth of 10&amp;nbsp;cm (4&amp;nbsp;inches) and moderate turbidity of 26 NTU, UV-A radiation is reduced to 50%. PET soft drink bottles are often easily available and thus most practical for the SODIS application.

* '''Oxygen:''' Sunlight produces highly reactive forms of oxygen (oxygen free radicals and hydrogen peroxides) in the water. These reactive molecules contribute in the destruction process of the microorganisms. Under normal conditions (rivers, creeks, wells, ponds, tap) water contains sufficient oxygen (more than 3&amp;nbsp;mg Oxygen per litre) and does not have to be aerated before the application of SODIS.

* '''Leaching of bottle material:''' There has been some concern over the question whether plastic drinking containers can release chemicals or toxic components into water, a process possibly accelerated by heat. The Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Testing and Research have examined the diffusion of [[w:adipate|adipates]] and [[w:phthalates|phthalates]] (DEHA and [[w:DEHP|DEHP]]) from new and reused PET-bottles in the water during solar exposure. The levels of concentrations found in the water after a solar exposure of 17 hours in 60°C water were far below [[w:World Health Organization|WHO]] guidelines for drinking water and in the same magnitude as the concentrations of phthalate and adipate generally found in high quality tap water.&lt;br /&gt; Concerns about the general use of PET-bottles were also expressed after a report published by researchers from the University of Heidelberg on [[w:Polyethylene terephthalate#Antimony|antimony]] being released from PET-bottles for soft drinks and mineral water stored over several months in supermarkets. However, the antimony concentrations found in the bottles are orders of magnitude below WHO&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Guidelines for drinking-water quality |url=http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/dwq/chemicals/antimonysum.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=World Health Organization |pages=304–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and national guidelines for antimony concentrations in drinking water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070921045938/http://www.sodis.ch/files/Report_EMPA.pdf |format=PDF |archivedate=2007-09-21 |publisher=Swiss Federal Institute for Materials Testing and Research (EMPA) |author=Kohler M, Wolfensberger M|title=Migration of organic components from polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles to water}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=[[w:Journal of Environmental Monitoring|Journal of Environmental Monitoring]] |year=2006 |volume=8 |pages=288–292 |title=Contamination of Canadian and European bottled waters with antimony from PET containers |author=William Shotyk, Michael Krachler and Bin Chen |doi=10.1039/b517844b |laysummary=http://www.rsc.org/Publishing/ChemScience/Volume/2006/02/bottled_water.asp |pmid=16470261 |issue=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Bottled Waters Contaminated with Antimony from PET |date=26 January 2006 |url=http://www.uni-heidelberg.de/press/news/news06/2601antime.html |publisher=University of Heidelberg }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, SODIS water is not stored over such extended periods in the bottles.

* '''Regrowth of bacteria:''' Once removed from sunlight, remaining bacteria may again reproduce in the dark. A 2010 study showed that adding just 10 parts per million of hydrogen peroxide is effective in preventing the regrowth of wild [[w:Salmonella|Salmonella]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Chemosphere |date=2010-01-08 |format=Epub ahead of print |title=Dramatic enhancement of solar disinfection (SODIS) of wild Salmonella sp. in PET bottles by H(2)O(2) addition on natural water of Burkina Faso containing dissolved iron |author=Sciacca F, Rengifo-Herrera JA, Wéthé J, Pulgarin C |pmid=20060566 |volume=78 |issue=9 |pages=1186–91 |doi=10.1016/j.chemosphere.2009.12.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Toxic Chemicals:''' The method does not remove toxic chemicals which may be present in the water. (factory waste, ...).

==Health impact, diarrhea reduction==
[[Image:Mwamongu water source.jpg|right|thumb|Only forty-six percent of people in Africa have safe drinking water.]]
It has been shown that the SODIS method (and other methods of household water treatment) can very effectively remove pathogenic contamination from the water. However, infectious diseases are also transmitted through other pathways, i.e. due to a general lack of sanitation and hygiene. Studies on the reduction of diarrhea among SODIS users show reduction values of 30-80%.

==Research and development==

The effectiveness of the SODIS was first discovered by Professor Aftim Acra at the [[w:American University of Beirut|American University of Beirut]] in the early 1980s [3]. Substantial follow-up research was conducted by the research groups of [[w:Martin Wegelin|Martin Wegelin]] at the Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology (Eawag) and Dr [[w:Kevin McGuigan|Kevin McGuigan]] at the [[w:Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland|Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland]]. Clinical control trials were pioneered by Professor Ronan Conroy of the RCSI team in collaboration with [[w:Michael Elmore-Meegan|Michael Elmore-Meegan]].

Currently, a joint research project on SODIS is implemented by the following institutions:
* Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (RCSI), Ireland (coordination)
* University of Ulster (UU), United Kingdom
* CSIR Environmentek, South Africa, Eawag, Switzerland
* The Institute of Water and Sanitation Development (IWSD), Zimbabwe
* Plataforma Solar de Almería (CIEMAT-PSA), Spain
* University of Leicester (UL), United Kingdom
* The International Commission for the Relief of Suffering &amp; Starvation (ICROSS), Kenya
* University of Santiago de Compostela (USC), Spain
* Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology (Eawag), Switzerland

The project has embarked on a multi-country study including study areas in [[w:Zimbabwe|Zimbabwe]], [[w:South Africa|South Africa]] and [[w:Kenya|Kenya]].

Other developments include the development of a continuous flow disinfection unit&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid14766599&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Caslake LF, Connolly DJ, Menon V, Duncanson CM, Rojas R, Tavakoli J |title=Disinfection of contaminated water by using solar irradiation |journal=Appl.

== Issues to consider==
The following are some of the issues discussed in the literature:
* Local education in the use of SODIS is important to avoid confusion between PET and other bottle materials.&lt;ref name=&quot;TrainingEN&quot; /&gt;
* Applying SODIS without proper assessment (or with false assessment) of existing hygienic practices &amp; diarrhea incidence may not address other routes of infection. Community trainers need to themselves be trained first.&lt;ref name=&quot;TrainingEN&quot; /&gt;
* When the water is highly turbid, SODIS can not be used alone, additional filtering or flocculation is then necessary to clarify the water prior to SODIS treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/household_water/research/turbidity/en/ |title=Treating turbid water |publisher=[[w:World Health Organization|World Health Organization]] |year=2010 |accessdate=30 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Scaling&gt;{{cite book|url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/hq/2009/WHO_HSE_WSH_09.02_eng.pdf |title=Scaling Up Household Water Treatment Among Low-Income Populations |publisher=World Health Organization |author=Clasen T |year=2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Worldwide application==

The Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology (Eawag), through the Department of Water and Sanitation in Developing Countries (Sandec), coordinates SODIS promotion projects in 33 countries including Bhutan, Bolivia, Burkina Faso, Cambodia, Cameroon, DR Congo, Ecuador, El Salvador, Ethiopia, Ghana, Guatemala, Guinea, Honduras, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Laos, Malawi, Mozambique, Nepal, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Perú, Philippines, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Sri Lanka, Togo, Uganda, Uzbekistan, Vietnam, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. Contact addresses and case studies of the projects coordinated by the Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology (Eawag) are available at [http://www.sodis.ch/ sodis.ch].

SODIS projects are funded by, among others, the SOLAQUA Foundation (&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080504011759rn_1/www.wegelin.ch/who/solaqua.asp |archivedate=2008-05-04 |title=SOLAQUA |publisher=Wegelin &amp; Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt;), several [[w:Lions Clubs|Lions Clubs]], [[w:Rotary International|Rotary]] Clubs, [[w:Migros|Migros]], and the Michel Comte Water Foundation.

SODIS has also been applied in several communities in Brazil, one of them being Prainha do Canto Verde north of Fortaleza. There, the villagers have been purifying their water with the SODIS method. It is quite successful, especially since the temperature during the day can go beyond 40°C (100°F) and there is a limited amount of shade.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Following is about '''water security''' and '''water scarcity'''. Water security is the capacity of a population to ensure that they continue to have access to [[w:potable water|potable water]]. It is an increasing concern arising from [[w:population growth|population growth]], [[w:drought|drought]], [[w:climate change|climate change]], oscillation between [[w:El Niño|El Niño]] and [[w:La Niña|La Niña]] effects, [[w:urbanisation|urbanisation]], [[w:salinity|salinity]], upstream [[w:pollution|pollution]], over-allocation of [[w:water licences|water licences]] by government agencies and over-utilisation of [[w:groundwater|groundwater]] from [[w:artesian basin|artesian basin]]. Water security is rapidly declining in many parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119047944/abstract?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0 Retrieved 2009-01-19&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[w:Pacific Institute|Pacific Institute]] &quot;While regional impacts will vary, global climate change will potentially alter agricultural productivity, freshwater availability and quality, access to vital minerals, coastal and island flooding, and more. Among the consequences of these impacts will be challenges to political relationships, realignment of energy markets and regional economies, and threats to security&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pacinst.org/topics/global_change/climate_security/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Water security is sometimes sought by implementing [[w:water desalination|water desalination]], [[w:Pipeline transport|pipelines]] between sources and users, water licences with different security levels and [[w:war|war]].

== Causes of water stress ==
The concepts of water stress and water scarcity are relatively new. Fifty years ago, when there were fewer than half the current number of people on the planet, the common perception was that water was an infinite resource. People were not as wealthy then as they are today, consumed fewer calories and ate less meat, so less water was needed to produce their food. They required a third of the volume of water we presently take from rivers. Today, the competition for water resources is much more intense. This is because there are now nearly seven billion people on the planet, their consumption of water-thirsty meat and vegetables is rising, and there is increasing competition for water from industry, urbanisation and biofuel crops.

The total amount of available freshwater supply is also decreasing because of climate change, which has caused receding glaciers, reduced stream and river flow, and shrinking lakes. Many aquifers have been over-pumped and are not recharging quickly. Although the total fresh water supply is not used up, much has become polluted, salted, unsuitable or otherwise unavailable for drinking, industry and agriculture. To avoid a global water crisis, farmers will have to strive to increase productivity to meet growing demands for food, while industry and cities find ways to use water more efficiently.&lt;ref&gt;Chartres, C. and Varma, S. ''Out of water. From Abundance to Scarcity and How to Solve the World’s Water Problems'' FT Press (USA), 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economic==
[[w:Economic water scarcity|Economic water scarcity]], meanwhile, is caused by a lack of investment in water or insufficient human capacity to satisfy the demand for water. Symptoms of economic water scarcity include a lack of infrastructure, with people often having to fetch water from rivers for domestic and agricultural uses. Large parts of Africa suffer from economic water scarcity; developing water infrastructure there could therefore help to reduce poverty. Critical conditions often arise for economically poor and politically weak communities living in already dry environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some 2.8 billion people currently live in water-scarce areas, as defined by this method.
Water allocation between competing users is increasingly determined by application of market-based pricing for either water licenses or actual water.&lt;ref&gt;[[w:Patrick Webb]] and Maria Iskandarani, Water Insecurity and the Poor: Issues and Research Needs. http://www.zef.de/fileadmin/webfiles/downloads/zef_dp/zef_dp2-98.pdf, Center for Development Research, Discussion Papers on Development Policy No. 2, Bonn, October 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measurement==
A popular approach has been to rank countries according to the amount of annual water resources available per person. For example, according to the Falkenmark Water Stress Indicator&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  |url=http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg2/180.htm
  |title=Climate Change 2001: Working Group II: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability

  |author=Falkenmark and Lindh 1976, quoted in UNEP/WMO
  |date=
  |accessdate=2009-02-03
}}&lt;/ref&gt;, a country or region is said to experience &quot;water stress&quot; when annual water supplies drop below 1,700 cubic metres per person per year. At levels between 1,700 and 1,000 cubic metres per person per year, periodic or limited water shortages can be expected. When water supplies drop below 1,000 cubic metres per person per year, the country faces &quot;water scarcity&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Unitied Nations' [[w:FAO|FAO]] states that by 2025, 1.9 billion people will be living in countries or regions with absolute water scarcity, and two-thirds of the world population could be under stress conditions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/nr/water/issues/scarcity.html FAO Hot issues: Water scarcity]&lt;/ref&gt;
Water stress is considered &quot;set to become a permanent feature of British life&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;historyandpolicy&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyandpolicy.org/papers/policy-paper-75.html|title=Hosepipes, history and a sustainable future|last=Vanessa Taylor and Frank Trentmann|date=July 2008|work=History &amp; Policy|publisher=History &amp; Policy|language=[[w:English language|English]]|accessdate=9 December 2010|location=[[w:United Kingdom]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [http://water.worldbank.org/water/publications/water-and-climate-change-understanding-risks-and-making-climate-smart-investment-decisi  World Bank] adds that [[w:climate change|climate change]] could profoundly alter future patterns of both water availability and use,thereby increasing levels of water stress and insecurity, both at the global scale and in sectors that depend on water.&lt;ref&gt;The World Bank, 2009 {{cite web|url=http://water.worldbank.org/water/publications/water-and-climate-change-understanding-risks-and-making-climate-smart-investment-decisi |title=Water and Climate Change: Understanding the Risks and Making Climate-Smart Investment Decisions |pages=21–24 |accessdate=2011-24-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another measurement, calculated as part of a wider assessment of water management in 2007&lt;ref&gt;Molden, D. (Ed). ''Water for food, Water for life: A Comprehensive Assessment of Water Management in Agriculture.'' Earthscan/IWMI, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;, aimed to relate water availability to how the resource was actually used. It therefore divided water scarcity into ‘physical’ and ‘economic’. [[w:Physical water scarcity|Physical water scarcity]] is where there is not enough water to meet all demands, including that needed for ecosystems to function effectively. Arid regions frequently suffer from physical water scarcity. It also occurs where water seems abundant but where resources are over-committed, such as when there is over-development of hydraulic infrastructure for irrigation. Symptoms of physical water scarcity include environmental degradation and declining groundwater. 

==Water crises==
A '''water crisis''' is a situation where the available [[w:potable water|potable]], [[w:water pollution|unpolluted water]] within a region is less than that region's demand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peopleandplanet.net/doc.php%3Fid=671&amp;section=14.html Freshwater: lifeblood of the planet]{{dead link|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[w:United Nations|United Nations]] and other world organizations consider a variety of regions to have water crises such that it is a global concern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=17551&amp;Cr=&amp;Cr1 |title=United Nations statement on water crisis |publisher=Un.org |date=2006-02-20 |accessdate=2011-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrdc.org/international/summit/summit3.asp UN World Summit on Sustainable Development addresses the water crisis]{{dead link|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other organizations, such as the [[w:Food and Agriculture Organization|Food and Agriculture Organization]], argue that there is no water crises in such places, but that steps must still be taken to avoid one.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/english/newsroom/news/2003/15254-en.html &quot;No global water crisis - but may developing countries will face water scarcity&quot;], FAO.org 12 March 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manifestations===
There are several principal manifestations of the water crisis.
* Inadequate access to safe [[w:drinking water|drinking water]] for about 884 million people&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

* Inadequate access to water for sanitation and waste disposal for 2.5 billion people&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/media/media_44093.html |title=Updated Numbers: WHO-UNICEF JMP Report 2008 |publisher=Unicef.org |date= |accessdate=2011-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[w:Groundwater|Groundwater]] [[w:overdrafting|overdrafting]] (excessive use) leading to diminished [[w:agriculture|agricultural]] yields&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://academic.evergreen.edu/g/grossmaz/WORMKA/ |title=Water is Life - Groundwater drawdown |publisher=Academic.evergreen.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Overuse and [[w:pollution|pollution]] of water resources harming {{lw|biodiversity}}
* Regional conflicts over scarce water resources sometimes resulting in [[w:war|war]]fare

{{lw|Waterborne diseases}} and the absence of sanitary [[w:Domestic water system|domestic water]] are one of the leading causes of death worldwide. For children under age five, waterborne diseases are the leading cause of death. At any given time, half of the world's hospital beds are occupied by patients suffering from waterborne diseases.&lt;ref&gt;[[w:WaterPartners International]]: [http://water.org/WaterCrisis Learn about the Water Crisis]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[w:World Bank|World Bank]], 88 percent of all waterborne diseases are caused by unsafe drinking water, inadequate sanitation and poor hygiene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Water is the underlying tenuous balance of safe water supply, but controllable factors such as the management and distribution of the water supply itself contribute to further scarcity. 

A 2006 United Nations report focuses on issues of governance as the core of the water crisis, saying &quot;There is enough water for everyone&quot; and &quot;Water insufficiency is often due to mismanagement, corruption, lack of appropriate institutions, bureaucratic inertia and a shortage of investment in both human capacity and physical infrastructure&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0014/001444/144409E.pdf Water, a shared responsibility. The United Nations World Water Development Report 2], 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Official data also shows a clear correlation between access to safe water and GDP per capita.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been claimed, primarily by economists, that the water situation has occurred because of a lack of property rights, government regulations and subsidies in the water sector, causing prices to be too low and consumption too high.&lt;ref&gt;[[w:Fredrik Segerfeldt]] (2005), [http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=4462 &quot;Private Water Saves Lives&quot;], ''Financial Times'' 25 August&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Zetland, [http://aguanomics.com/2008/08/running-out-of-water.html &quot;Running Out of Water&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Zetland, [http://aguanomics.com/2008/07/water-crisis.html &quot;Water Crisis&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Vegetation and wildlife are fundamentally dependent upon adequate freshwater resources. [[w:Marsh|marshes]], [[w:bog|bogs]] and [[w:riparian zone|riparians]] are more obviously dependent upon sustainable water supply, but forests and other upland ecosystems are equally at risk of significant productivity changes as water availability is diminished. In the case of wetlands, considerable area has been simply taken from wildlife use to feed and house the expanding human population. But other areas have suffered reduced productivity from gradual diminishing of freshwater inflow, as upstream sources are diverted for human use. In seven states of the U.S. over 80 percent of all historic [[w:wetland|wetlands]] were filled by the 1980s, when Congress acted to create a “[[w:no net loss (wetlands)|no net loss]]” of wetlands.

In [[w:Europe|Europe]] extensive loss of wetlands has also occurred with resulting loss of biodiversity. For example many bogs in [[w:Scotland|Scotland]] have been developed or diminished through human population expansion. One example is the [[w:Portlethen Moss|Portlethen Moss]] in [[w:Aberdeenshire|Aberdeenshire]].

On [[w:Madagascar|Madagascar]]’s highland plateau, a massive transformation occurred that eliminated virtually all the heavily forested vegetation in the period 1970 to 2000. The [[w:slash and burn|slash and burn]] agriculture eliminated about ten percent of the total country’s native biomass and converted it to a barren wasteland. These effects were from [[w:overpopulation|overpopulation]] and the necessity to feed poor indigenous peoples, but the adverse effects included widespread gully erosion that in turn produced heavily silted rivers that “run red” decades after the [[w:deforestation|deforestation]]. This eliminated a large amount of usable fresh water and also destroyed much of the riverine ecosystems of several large west-flowing rivers. Several fish species have been driven to the edge of extinction and some, such as the disturbed Tokios [[w:coral reef|coral reef]] formations in the [[w:Indian Ocean|Indian Ocean]], are effectively lost.

In October 2008, Peter Brabeck-Letmathe, chairman and former chief executive of Nestlé, warned that the production of biofuels will further deplete the world's water supply.

===Overview of regions suffering crisis impacts===
[[File:AralShip.jpg|thumb|200px|Two abandoned ships in the former [[w:Aral Sea|Aral Sea]], near [[w:Aral Kazakhstan|Aral Kazakhstan]].]]
There are many other countries of the world that are severely impacted with regard to [[w:human|human]] [[w:health|health]] and inadequate drinking water. The following is a partial list of some of the countries with significant populations (numerical population of affected population listed) whose only consumption is of contaminated water:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unicef.org/specialsession/about/sgreport-pdf/03_SafeDrinkingWater_D7341Insert_English.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[w:California Department of Resources|California Department of Resources]], if more supplies aren’t found by 2020, the region will face a shortfall nearly as great as the amount consumed today. [[w:Los Angeles|Los Angeles]] is a coastal desert able to support at most 1 million people on its own water; the Los Angeles basin now is the core of a [[w:megacity|megacity]] that spans {{convert|220|mi|km|-1}} from [[w:Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]] to the [[w:Mexican border|Mexican border]]. The region’s population is expected to reach 41 million by 2020, up from 28 million in 2009. The population of California continues to grow by more than two million a year and is expected to reach 75 million in 2030, up from 49 million in 2009. But water shortage is likely to surface well before then.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fairus.org/site/PageServer?pagename=iic_immigrationissuecenters19af |title=U.S. Water Supply |publisher=Fairus.org |date= |accessdate=2011-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Water deficits, which are already spurring heavy grain imports in numerous smaller countries, may soon do the same in larger countries, such as [[w:Chinese water crisis|China]] and [[w:India|India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jul 21, 2006 |url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/South_Asia/HG21Df01.html |title=India grows a grain crisis |publisher=Atimes.com |date=2006-07-21 |accessdate=2011-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The water tables are falling in scores of countries (including Northern China, the US, and India) due to widespread overpumping using powerful diesel and electric pumps. Other countries affected include [[w:Pakistan|Pakistan]], [[w:Iran|Iran]], and [[w:Mexico|Mexico]]. This will eventually lead to water scarcity and cutbacks in grain harvest. Even with the overpumping of its [[w:aquifers|aquifers]], China is developing a grain deficit. When this happens, it will almost certainly drive grain prices upward. Most of the 3 billion people projected to be added worldwide by mid-century will be born in countries already experiencing water shortages. Unless population growth can be slowed quickly it is feared that there may not be a practical non-violent or humane solution to the emerging world water shortage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earth-policy.org/Books/Seg/PB2ch03_ss6.htm |title=Water Scarcity Crossing National Borders |publisher=Earth-policy.org |date=2006-09-27 |accessdate=2011-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greatlakesdirectory.org/zarticles/080902_water_shortages.htm Water Shortages May Cause Food Shortages]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://bbsnews.net/article.php/20070819122845423 Yemen's Capital Facing Water Shortage Due to Rapid Increase in Population]{{dead link|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four of these already import a large share of their grain.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The [[w:Sub-Saharan Africa|Subsaharan]] region of africa had the largest number of water-stressed countries of any other place on the globe. In Africa, the struggle for access to clean [[w:drinking water|drinking water]] is one of today's most obvious examples of how water scarcity leads to the stalling and reversal of human progress. While each individual living in the United States uses on average 100 to 175 gallons of water per day in the home, the average African family uses only 5 gallons of water per day.
&lt;ref name=&quot;bpn&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=The Facts About The Global Drinking Water Crisis|url=http://blueplanetnetwork.org/water/facts|year=2010|accessdate=18 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This vast disparity of clean water availability and consumption is reflected in a number of different developmental aspects. These consequences include the effects on health, opportunities for women, [[w:Education in Africa|children's education]], agricultural practices, regional conflict, and productivity and [[w:International development|development]].

== Impact on development ==
=== Health ===
The most immediately apparent impact of water scarcity in Africa is on the continent's health. Infants and children are especially susceptible to these diseases because of their inexperienced immune systems,&lt;ref name=&quot;WS&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Water Scarcity: The Importance of Water &amp; Access|url=http://thewaterproject.org/water_scarcity.asp|accessdate=18 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
which lends to elevated [[w:infant mortality|infant mortality]] rates in many regions of Africa.

When infected with these waterborne diseases, those living in African communities suffering from water scarcity cannot contribute to the community’s productivity and development because of a simple lack of strength. Additionally, economic resources are sapped by the cost of medicine to treat waterborne diseases, which takes away from resources that might have been used for food or school fees.&lt;ref name=WS/&gt;
This also takes a toll on the governmental funds. The [[w:Water Supply and Sanitation Collaborative Council|Water Supply and Sanitation Collaborative Council]] (WSSCC) estimates that in [[w:Sub-Saharan Africa|Sub-Saharan Africa]], treatment of diarrhea due to [[w:Water pollution|water contamination]] consumes 12 percent of the country’s health budget. With better water conditions, the burden on healthcare would be less substantial and a healthier workforce&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Rural Transformation in Tropical Africa|year=1988|publisher=Belhaven Press|location=Great Britain|author=Sandy Cairncross|editor=Douglas Rimmer|pages=49–54|chapter=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  would stimulate economic growth and pull many people out of poverty.

=== Women, children, and education ===
African women are disproportionally burdened by scarcity of clean drinking water. In most African societies, women are seen as the collectors, managers, and guardians of water, especially within the domestic sphere that includes household chores, cooking, washing, and child rearing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Impacts of Water Scarcity on Women's Life|url=http://www.worldpulse.com/node/20165|accessdate=1 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of these traditional [[w:Gender role|gender labor roles]], women are forced to spend around sixty percent of each day collecting water, which translates to approximately 200 million collective work hours by women globally per day.&lt;ref name=wac&gt;{{cite web|title=Women Affected by the Crisis|url=http://water.org/learn-about-the-water-crisis/women|accessdate=18 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; For African women, this often means carrying the typical [[w:jerrycan|jerrycan]] that can weigh over 40 pounds when full&lt;ref name=WS/&gt; for an average of six kilometers each day.&lt;ref name=bpn/&gt; As a result of this, many women are unable to hold professional employment.

Additionally, this prevents many young girls from attending school and receiving an education. They are expected to not only aid their mothers in water retrieval, but to also help with the demands of household chores that are made more time-intensive because of a lack of readily available water. Furthermore, a lack of clean water means the absence of sanitary facilities and latrines in schools, and so once puberty hits, this has the largest impact on female children. In terms of lost educational opportunity, if adequate investment were made in drinking water and sanitation, it is estimated that it would result in 272 million more school attendance days per year.&lt;ref name=wac /&gt; This lost number of potential school days and education results in the hindrance of the next generation’s African females from breaking out of the cycle of unequal opportunity for gainful employment. Because of this, available clean water for women and children translates to Africans with potential for education, prosperity, power, literacy, hygiene, security, and equality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Women for Water|url=http://womenforwater.com|accessdate=1 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Agriculture ===
The majority of Africa remains dependent on an agricultural lifestyle and so water scarcity translates to a loss of [[w:food security|food security]]. At this point, the majority of rural African communities are not tapping into their [[w:irrigation|irrigation]] potential, and according to the UN Economic Commission for Africa and New Partnership for Africa’s Development, &quot;irrigation is key to achieving increased agricultural production that is important for economic development and for attaining food security&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;uneca&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Management Options to Enhance Survival and Growth|url=http://www.uneca.org/awich/Water%20in%20Africa.pdf|accessdate=18 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; But for many regions, there is a lack of financial and human resources to support infrastructure and technology required for proper crop irrigation. Because of this, the impact of droughts, floods, and [[w:desertification|desertification]] is greater in terms of both African economic loss and human life loss due to crop failure and starvation. Additionally, lack of water causes many Africans to use wastewater for crop growth, then causing a large number of people to consume foods that can contain chemicals or disease-causing organisms transferred by the wastewater.&lt;ref name=&quot;WHO&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=10 Facts About Water Scarcity|url=http://www.who.int/features/factfiles/water/en/|accessdate=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, for the extremely high number of African areas suffering from water scarcity issues, investing in development means sustainably withdrawing from clean freshwater sources, ensuring food security by expanding irrigation areas, and effectively managing the effects of [[w:climate change|climate change]].&lt;ref name=uneca /&gt;

=== Conflict ===
The explosion of populations in developing nations within Africa combined with climate change is causing extreme strain within and between nations. In the past, countries have worked to resolve water tensions through negotiation, but there is predicted to be an escalation in [[w:Water conflict|aggression over water accessibility]]. Federal intelligence agencies have issued the joint judgment that in the next ten years, water issues are not likely to cause internal and external tensions to intensify to war, but after 2022 there is expected to be a change.&lt;ref name=usi&gt;{{cite web|title=US Intel: Water a Cause for War in Coming Decades|url=http://www.twincities.com/ci_20230354/us-intel-water-cause-war-coming-decades?IADID=Search-www.twincities.com-www.twincities.com|accessdate=23 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the classified [[w:National Intelligence Estimate|National Intelligence Estimate]] on water security, requested by Secretary of State [[w:Hillary Rodham Clinton|Hillary Rodham Clinton]] and completed in Fall 2011, after 2022 water will be more likely to be used as a weapon of war and potential tool for terrorism, especially in [[w:North Africa]].&lt;ref name=usi/&gt; On [[w:World Water Day|World Water Day]], the [[w:State Department|State Department]] stated that water stress, &quot;will likely increase the risk of instability and state failure, exacerbate regional tensions and distract countries from working with the United States on important policy objectives.&quot; Specifically referring to the [[w:Nile|Nile]] in Egypt, Sudan, and nations further south, the report predicts that upstream nations will limit access to water for political reasons, and that terrorists may target water related infrastructures, such as reservoirs and dams, more frequently.&lt;ref name=usi/&gt; Because of this, the [[w:World Economic Forum|World Economic Forum]]'s 2011 Global Risk Report has included water as one of the world’s top five risks for the first time.

=== Productivity and development ===
Poverty is directly related to the accessibility of clean drinking water- without it, the chances of breaking out of the [[w:poverty trap|poverty trap]] is extremely slim. The social and economic consequences of a lack of clean water penetrate into realms of education, opportunities for gainful employment, physical strength and health, agricultural and industrial development, and thus the overall [[w:Productivity|productive potential]] of a community, nation, and/or region. Because of this, the UN estimates that Sub-Saharan Africa alone loses 40 billion potential work hours per year collecting water.&lt;ref name=WS/&gt; Because of this, the [[w:United Nations Development Programme|United Nations Development Programme]] estimated that in Africa, every dollar spent on water and sanitation generates a nine-fold return in saved time, increased productivity and reduced health cost.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

==Reasons for scarcity==
===Climate change===
According to the Africa Partnership Forum, “Although Africa is the continent least responsible for [[climate change|climate change]], it is particularly vulnerable to the effects,” and the long-term impacts include, “changing rainfall patterns affecting agriculture and reducing food security; worsening water security; decreasing fish resources in large lakes due to rising temperature; shifting vector-borne diseases; rising sea level affecting low-lying costal areas with large populations; and rising water stress”.&lt;ref name=cca&gt;{{cite web|title=Climate Change and Africa|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/57/7/38897900.pdf|accessdate=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of Africa’s dependence on rain-fed agriculture, widespread poverty, and weak capacity, the water issues caused by climate change impact the continent much more violently compared to developed nations that have the resources and economic diversity to deal with such global changes. The [[w:Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] reports that climate change in Africa has manifested itself in more intense and longer droughts in the [[w:subtropics|subtropics]] and [[w:tropics|tropics]], while arid or semi-arid areas in northern, western, eastern, and parts of southern Africa are becoming drier and more susceptible to variability of precipitation and storms.&lt;ref name=cca/&gt; Overall this means that water stress caused by changing amounts of precipitation is particularly damaging to Africa and thus climate change is one of the major obstacles the continent must face when trying to secure reliable and clean sources of water.

=== Physical scarcity and economic scarcity ===
Water scarcity is both a natural and human-made phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Decade for Action: Water for Life 2005-2015|url=http://www.un.org/waterforlifedecade/scarcity.shtml|accessdate=18 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is thus essential to break it down into two general types: Economic scarcity and physical scarcity. Economic scarcity refers to the fact that finding a reliable source of safe water is time consuming and expensive. Alternatively, physical scarcity is when there simply is not enough water.&lt;ref name=WS/&gt;

The 2006 [[w:United Nations Economic Commission for Africa|United Nations Economic Commission for Africa]] estimates that 300 million out of the 800 million who live on the African continent live in a water-scarce environment.&lt;ref name=uneca /&gt; Specifically in the very north of Africa, as well the very south of Africa, the rising global temperatures accompanying climate change have intensified the [[w:hydrological cycle|hydrological cycle]] that leads to dryer dry seasons, thus increasing the risk of more extreme and frequent droughts. This significantly impacts the availability, quality and quantity of water due to reduced river flows and reservoir storage, lowering of water tables and drying up of aquifers in the northern and southern regions of Africa. 

The majority of Sub-Saharan Africa suffers from economic scarcity that exists because of population’s lack of the necessary monetary means to utilize adequate sources of water. Both political reasons and ethnic conflict have contributed to this unequal distribution of resources. Out of the two forms of water scarcity, economic scarcity can be addressed quickly and effectively with simple infrastructure to collect rainwater from roofs and dams, but this requires economic resources that many of these areas lack due to an absence of industrial development and widespread poverty.&lt;ref name=WS/&gt;

== Addressing the issue ==
===International efforts===
To adequately address the issue of water scarcity in Africa, the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa emphasizes the need to invest in the development of Africa’s potential water resources to reduce unnecessary suffering, ensure [[w:food security|food security]], and protect economic gains by effectively managing droughts, floods, and [[w:desertification|desertification]].&lt;ref name=uneca /&gt; Some suggested and on going efforts to achieve this include digging wells, rainwater harvesting, and building clean-water catchment and storage tanks. 

===Non-governmental organizations' efforts===
In addition to the role the United States, the United Nations, and international governmental aid are all playing in helping bring clean water to water stressed regions of Africa, a number of NGOs have formed water charities to work towards that same goal of providing clean water for the continent by 2015. These charities are based on individual and group donations, which are then invested in a variety of methods and technologies to bring clean water to regions in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Water Charities:A Comprehensive List|url=http://www.filtersfast.com/articles/Water-Charities-A-Comprehensive-List.php|accessdate=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some notable NGOs working towards this goal include, but are not limited to:

===Solutions and technologies===
The more basic solutions to help provide Africa with drinkable and usable water include well-digging, rain catchment systems, de-worming pills, and hand pumps, but high demand for clean water solutions has also prompted the development of some key creative solutions as well. 

Some non-profit organizations have focused on the aspect of drinking water contamination against [[w:sewage|sewage]] waste by installing cost-effective and relatively maintenance-free toilets, such as Drop In The Bucket’s “Eco-sanitation Flush Toilet” &lt;ref name=Drop/&gt; or [[w:Pump Aid|Pump Aid]]’s “Elephant Toilet”.&lt;ref name=PA/&gt; The Elephant Toilet uses community-sourced resources in construction to build a relatively simple waste disposal mechanism that separates solids from liquids to promote faster decomposition and lower the impact on ground water.&lt;ref name=PA/&gt; In comparison, the Eco-Sanitation Flush Toilet also uses no power of any kind, but actually treats sewage rather than just storing it so that the toilet’s output is only water.&lt;ref name=Drop/&gt; Both solutions are then simple for residents of African communities to maintain and have a notable impact on the cleanliness of local water sources.  

Overall, a wide range of cost-effective, manageable, and innovative solutions are available to help aid Africa in producing clean, disease-free water. Ultimately what it comes down to is using [[w:Appropriate Technology|technology appropriate]] for each individual community’s needs. For the technology to be effective, it must conform to environmental, ethical, cultural, social, and economic aspects of each Africa community.&lt;ref name=LI/&gt; If this can be done, with sufficient funding and aid to implement such technologies, it is feasible to eliminate clean water scarcity for the African continent by the [[w:Millennium Development Goals|Millennium Development Goal]] deadline of 2015.

=== Limitations ===
Africa is home to both the largest number of water-scarce countries out of any region, as well as home to the most difficult countries to reach in terms of water aid. The prevalence of rural villages traps many areas in what the [[w:United Nations Economic Commission for Africa|UN Economic Commission for Africa]] refers to as the &quot;Harvesting Stage&quot;,&lt;ref name=uneca /&gt; which makes water-scarce regions difficult to aid because of a lack of industrial technology to make solutions sustainable. In addition to the geographic and developmental limiting factors, a number of political, economic reasons also stand in the way of ensuring adequate aid for Africa. Politically, tensions between local governments versus foreign non-governmental organizations impact the ability to successfully bring in money and aid-workers. Economically, urban areas suffer from extreme [[w:Economic inequality|wealth gaps]] in which the overwhelming poor often pay four to ten times more for sanitary water than the elite, hindering the poor from gaining access to clean water technologies and efforts.&lt;ref name=uneca /&gt; As a result of all these factors, it is estimated that fifty percent of all water projects fail, less than five percent of projects are visited, and less than one percent have any long-term monitoring.&lt;ref name=wac /&gt;

'''[[w:Water security|Water security]] in Australia''' has become a major concern over the course of the late 20th and early 21st century as a result of [[w:population growth|population growth]], severe [[w:drought in Australia|drought]], fears of the [[w:effects of global warming on Australia|effects of global warming on Australia]], [[w:environmental degradation|environmental degradation]] from reduced [[w:environmental flows|environmental flows]], competition between competing interests such as [[w:grazing|grazing]], [[w:Irrigation in Australia|irrigation]] and urban [[w:water supply|water supplies]], and competition between upstream and downstream users.

Water reform was first placed on the national agenda at the 1994 [[w:Council of Australian Governments|Council of Australian Governments]] (COAG) meeting when a strategic framework was devised.
&lt;ref name=&quot;mwa&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Managing water for Australia:the social and institutional challenges |last1=Stoeckel |first1=Kate |last2=Abrahams |first2=Harry |editor1-first=Karen |editor1-last=Hussey |editor2-first=Stephen |editor2-last=Dovers |year=2007 |publisher=CSIRO Publishing |location=Collingwood, Victoria |isbn=978-0-643-09392-8 |pages=2—6 |chapter=Water Reform in Australia:the National Water Initiative and the role of the National Water Commission  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
As the knowledge of surface and groundwater systems grew and the awareness of the significance of sustainable water markets increased, further water reform was agreed to at the 2004 COAG meeting, under a national blueprint known as the National Water Initiative (NWI).

Australia can be divided into 12 major drainage divisions. For example, the Murray-Darling drainage division consists of the Murray River basin and the Darling River basin. Three of these drainage division account for 87% of the water that Australia consumes – the North East Coast division, the South East Coast division, and the Murray-Darling. This means that the supply of water within Australia is highly concentrated, and any defect to one of these major water divisions can cause major water security issues.

==Privatisation of water==
{{Main|w:Water privatisation}}

Since the turn of the 21st century, there have been attempts to establish a privatised water market in Australia, with the state of [[w:Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] acting as a model for other states. Many political parties, community groups, NGO's and other groups and people see the privatisation of water as a denial of basic human rights on behalf of State and Federal Governments {{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}. Water privatisation is a highly controversial topic and touches on the much broader arguments for and against the private control of formerly public services.

==Boundaries to water security==

A major boundary which affects effective water management is the highly variable precipitation levels of Australia – Australian rainfall is more variable than rainfall in rest of the world since it is driven by the [[w:Southern Oscillation|Southern Oscillation]] rather than by seasonal changes.
&lt;ref&gt;Diamond, Jared (2005). ''Collapse'', p. 384. Penguin Books, London. ISBN 0-670-03337-5&lt;/ref&gt;
The result is that for the same level of reliability of supply, dams in Australia need to be six times as large as those in Europe and twice as large as the world average to ensure water sources do not run dry during dry seasons{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}.

==Competition for water==
===Competition between states===
In Australia there is competition for the resources of the [[w:Darling River|Darling River]] system between [[w:Queensland|Queensland]], New South Wales and South Australia. Similarly there is competition for the resources of the [[w:Murray River|Murray River]] between NSW, Victoria and South Australia. The South Australian government established a new ministerial portfolio of Water Security as the water security issues facing South Australia and the Lower Lakes and [[w:Coorong|Coorong]] emerged.&lt;ref&gt;(February 2007).

Retrieved 20 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Competition between regions===
In [[w: Victoria, Australia| Victoria]] a pipeline from the [[w:Goulburn Valley|Goulburn Valley]] to [[w:Melbourne, Victoria|Melbourne]] has led to protests by farmers against the linkage of Victoria's water system to facilitate the privatisation of water in the region.&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Whinnett. (18 January 2008). [https://archive.is/20120903225709/www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,23069045-5010020,00.html Protest on water regarding pipeline]. The Herald and Weekly Times. Retrieved on 19 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Competition between uses===
In the [[w:Macquarie Marshes|Macquarie Marshes]] of NSW [[w:grazing|grazing]] and [[w:irrigation in Australia|irrigation]] interests compete for water flowing to the marshes which would otherwise support the environment. There have been a series of embankments built to channel water flowing towards the marshes to privately held commercial interests. Some of these works are thought to have been done illegally.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jennifermarohasy.com/blog/2007/07/stealing-water-from-the-macquarie-marshes-a-note-and-more-pictures-from-chris-hogendyk/ Stealing Water from the Macquarie Marshes: A Note and More Pictures from Chris Hogendyk].

Australian Broadcasting Corporation. Retrieved on 25 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Competition for environmental flows===
The [[w:Snowy Mountains Scheme|Snowy Mountains Scheme]] diverted water from the [[w:Snowy River|Snowy River]] to the [[w:Murray River|Murray River]] and the [[w:Murrumbidgee River|Murrumbidgee River]] for the benefit of irrigators and electricity generation through [[w:hydro-electric power|hydro-electric power]]. During recent years government has taken action to increase [[w:environmental flows|environmental flows]] to the Snowy in spite of severe drought in the [[w:Murray-Darling Basin|Murray-Darling Basin]]. The Australian Government has implemented buy-backs of water allocations, or properties with water allocations, to endeavour to increase environmental flows.

==Major capital works for increased major urban water security==
Several major capital works are currently under construction in an effort to privatise the nation's water. [[w:Water desalination|Water desalination]] has been introduced as a way of creating new water to increase the security of the supply of water, at huge financial costs, environmental losses and increased [[w:greenhouse gas emissions|greenhouse gas emissions]], while several pipelines are under construction in an effort to link regional systems to facilitate the trading of water.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;''D!ssent'', Article by Kenneth Davidson &quot;Water Lies&quot;, Issue 31 Summer 09/10&lt;/ref&gt; Price rises for consumers have been highest in Sydney where water deliveries are provided by Australia's largest utility, [[w:Sydney Water|Sydney Water]].&lt;ref name=&quot;wbodp&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/features/wet-blanket-over-desal-plants/story-e6frg6z6-1226039332011 |title=Wet blanket over desal plants |author=Lauren Wilson |accessdate=9 May 2011 |date=15 April 2011 |newspaper=The Australian |publisher=News Limited }}&lt;/ref&gt; The policies of several State Governments moves away from sustainable water management and divests themselves of their responsibilities to provide sustainable, just and affordable, potable water to their population.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

===Western Australia===
The WA government has built the [[w:Kwinana Desalination Plant|Kwinana Desalination Plant]] in an effort to privatise Western Australia's water system.

===New South Wales===
The [[w:Kurnell Desalination Plant|Kurnell Desalination Plant]]  constructed by the NSW Government at [[w:Kurnell|Kurnell]] near [[w:Botany Bay|Botany Bay]] has commenced operations. The power usage is to be offset by a new wind farm. Sydney also draws water from the [[w:Shoalhaven River|Shoalhaven River]] near [[w:Nowra|Nowra]].

[[w:Hunter Water Corporation|Hunter Water Corporation]] proposes a dam, [[w:Tillegra Dam|Tillegra Dam]], on the [[w:Williams River (New South Wales)|Williams River]] in [[w:Dungog Shire|Dungog Shire]] in the Upper [[w:Hunter Valley|Hunter Valley]]. When completed, the dam will hold 450 billion litres of water. The estimated cost of the dam is around $300&amp;nbsp;million ($477&amp;nbsp;Million as at April 2010). Included in the dam proposal is a hydro-power generation plant which will generate around 3,000 megawatt hours of energy each year. Hunter Water is also proposing to plant 1.5 million trees as carbon offsets. The need for this dam is strongly disputed and subject to review by the NSW Government Department of Planning. Hunter Water claims the dam is required to &quot;drought proof&quot; [[w:Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]] and the [[w:Central Coast, New South Wales|Central Coast]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tillegra Dam Proposal|url=http://www.hunterwater.com.au/files/Tillegra_Dam_Proposal_-_General_Information_Leaflet.pdf|publisher=Hunter Water Corporation|accessdate=3 October 2010|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090913150002/http://www.hunterwater.com.au/files/Tillegra_Dam_Proposal_-_General_Information_Leaflet.pdf|archivedate=13 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents say the dam is grossly excessive for this need, will drown valuable agricultural land and greater water efficiency, demand management and recycling would eliminate the need for the dam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=No Tillegra Dam|url=http://www.notillegradam.com/|publisher=No Tillegra Dam Group|accessdate=3 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Australia===
The South Australian government expects to have a desalination plant operating at [[w:Port Stanvac|Port Stanvac]] near [[w:Lonsdale, South Australia|South Australia]] by July 2011 with completion due in December 2012.&lt;ref name=&quot;sawb&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/added-cost-of-green-desal-hits-homes/story-e6frea6u-1226051749544 |title=SA Water bills to go up by $135 a year |author=Brad Crouch |accessdate=9 May 2011 |date=8 May 2011 |publisher=News Limited }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Victoria===
The Victorian state government plans several major construction projects to be completed as Private-Public Partnerships (PPPs), in an effort to link state water supplies. These projects are designed to establish a state-wide water market in preparation of the privatisation of Victoria's water.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;
The works include a $3.1&amp;nbsp;billion desalination plant to be built near [[w:Wonthaggi|Wonthaggi]] by the end of 2011,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.melbournewater.com.au/content/current_projects/water_supply/seawater_desalination_plant/seawater_desalination_plant.asp?bhjs=0 Desalination Plant : Projects]. Melbourne Water. Retrieved on 20 January 2009 &lt;/ref&gt; the North-South pipeline to connect water supplies from the [[w:Goulburn Valley|Goulburn Valley]] to Melbourne and [[w:Central Victoria|Central Victoria]], and an interconnector pipeline connecting the Geelong-Ballarat region.

Many argue that in privatising Victoria's water resources and creating a market to trade water between regions, the State Government is divesting itself from its core [[w:Water rights|human rights responsibilities]] to ensure [[w:potable water|potable water]] to the population it represents. &lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;
This would come at great environmental cost, increase energy usage, decrease efficiency, ignore sustainable water management options and increase end-user water costs, placing water privatisation as a high risk to water security in Victoria, despite its acceptance by the state government.

===Queensland===
The Queensland government has developed the [[w:SEQ Water Grid|SEQ Water Grid]], to enhance the state's water security with the [[w:Western Corridor Recycled Water Project|Western Corridor Recycled Water Project]] being a key part. The [[w:Gold Coast desalination project|Gold Coast desalination plant]] which has been built at [[w:Tugun|Tugun]] on the [[w:Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]], is another project that supplies water to markets in the [[w:South East Queensland|South East Queensland]] region. The Queensland government investigated the possibility of building a pipeline from the [[w:Northern Rivers|Northern Rivers]] of New South Wales to South East Queensland to facilitate water trade between these regions.

==Major initiatives for increased rural water security==
===Murray Darling Basin===
The [[w:Snowy Mountains Scheme|Snowy Mountains Scheme]] increased water security to properties near the [[w:Murray River|Murray River]] and [[w:Murrumbidgee River|Murrumbidgee River]] during the 1960s and 70s. Overallocation of water licences and prolonged severe drought affecting snowfalls have undermined that security in the early 21st century.
===Ord River Scheme===
The [[w:Ord River|Ord River]] Irrigation Scheme (ORIS)&lt;ref name=&quot;Ord&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anra.gov.au/topics/water/overview/wa/basin-ord-river.html|title=Water resources – Overview – Western Australia – Drainage Basin: Ord River|work=Australian Natural Resources Atlas|publisher=Australian Government|accessdate=4 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
in the [[w:Kimberley (Western Australia)|Kimberley]] region of Western Australia created [[w:Lake Argyle|Lake Argyle]], Australia's largest lake. ORIS provides water for irrigation to over 117&amp;nbsp;km² of farmland and there are plans to extend the scheme to allow irrigation of 440&amp;nbsp;km² in the future.

==Areas with critical water shortages==
===NSW===
====Lachlan River valley====
On 24 October 2009 the [[w:Sydney Morning Herald|Sydney Morning Herald]] reported that the [[w:Lachlan River|Lachlan River]] would stop flowing west of [[w:Condobolin, New South Wales|Condobolin]] within weeks as flows are slashed to keep only part of the river flowing, that the [[w:Wyangala Dam|Wyangala Dam]] could be empty by mid summer (15 January 2010) and that thousands of households will need to have water trucked to them. This situation follows 8 years of drought. Farmers in the area of the Lachlan Valley where the river will not flow are deeply concerned for the viability of their farms. More than 100,000 people live in the total Lachlan catchment. 14% of NSW agricultural production is generated in the region from a land area of approximately 10% of NSW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/environment/water-issues/water-crisis-in-west-as-lachlan-river-runs-dry-20091023-hdce.html|title=Water crisis in west as Lachlan River runs dry|last=Cubby|first=Ben|coauthors=Marian Wilkinson|date=24 Oct 2009|work=Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=29 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===South Australia===
====The Coorong====
The Coorong's future is in doubt because of low flows of water reaching the mouth of the Murray River.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/09/15/2686487.htm|title=Basin plan 'to determine' Coorong, lower lakes future|date=15 September 2009|publisher=ABC News Australia|accessdate=29 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Acid sulphate soils are being exposed as water levels drop in the Doorong and nearby lakes, adding to the problems in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independentweekly.com.au/news/local/news/general/sa-natural-icons-dying-from-thirst/780385.aspx|title=SA natural icons dying from thirst|last=Benger|first=Simon|date=30 May 2008|publisher=The Independent Weekly|accessdate=29 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Name of Plug-in:'''
IDT OligoAnalyzer Synbiota Plugin

'''Authors:'''
Fitzgerald Steele, Jr., Integrated DNA Technologies

'''What does the plugin do?'''

View oligo sequence Tm, Extinction Coefficient, Weight. Perform self-dimer analysis from Synbiota GENtle2. Of course, you can order the sequence from IDT.

Install it into GENTle2 like any other plugin (from the plugin menu). You can get it from the GitHub link:
https://github.com/fitzgeraldsteele/IDToligoanalyzer-synbiota-plugin

Highlight a sequence you want to anaylyze (up to 256 bases), then click Sequence &gt; IDT OligoAnalyzer. The plugin uses IDT's OligoAnalyzer web service to show you:

* Length
* Melting Temparature
* Extinction Coefficient
* GC% Content
* nmole/OD260
* ug/OD260
* Molecular Weight
* Self Dimer Analysis

We made some assumptions on the experimental conditions (0.25uM concentration, 50mM Na+ concentration, etc). Click the &quot;Open in OligoAnalyzer&quot; button to see even more detail, and customize the parameters to meet your experiment needs.

Of course, you can add it to your IDT shopping cart by clicking &quot;Order Oligos&quot;.

'''How does the plugin do it?'''

Makes use of the [http://www.idtdna.com/analyzer/Applications/OligoAnalyzer/ IDT OligoAnalyzer] web service

'''Current issues:'''
Seems like the highlight animation is being triggered multiple times at the end of the ajax call.

=== The operator equation ===

The continuous Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator can be calculated explicitly for certain domains, such as a half-space, a ball and a cylinder and a shell with uniform conductivity ''1''. For example, for a unit ball in ''N''-dimensions, writing the Laplace equation in spherical coordinates one gets:

: &lt;math&gt;\Delta f = r^{1-N}\frac{\partial}{\partial r}\left(r^{N-1}\frac{\partial f}{\partial r}\right) + r^{-2}\Delta_{S^{N-1}}f, &lt;/math&gt;
and, therefore, the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator satisfies the following equation:

: &lt;math&gt;\Lambda(\Lambda-(N-2)Id)+\Delta_{S^{N-1}} = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

In two-dimensions the equation takes a particularly simple form:
: &lt;math&gt;\Lambda^2=-\Delta_{S^{1}}.&lt;/math&gt;

The study of material of this chapter is largely motivated by the question of Professor of Mathematics at the University of Washington Gunther Uhlmann: &quot;Is there a discrete analog of the equation?&quot;
&lt;!--
:'''Exercise (**)''': Prove that for the unit ball the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator satisfies the quadratic equation above.

:'''Exercise (*)''': Prove that for the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator of a half-space of ''R''&lt;sup&gt;N&lt;/sup&gt; with uniform conductivity ''1'',
: &lt;math&gt;\Lambda^2 = -\Delta_{R^{N-1}}.&lt;/math&gt;
--&gt;
=== The network setting ===

To match the functional equation for the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator of the unit disc with conductivity ''1'', one needs to find a self-dual layered planar network with rotational symmetry. The Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator for such graph ''G'' is equal to:

: &lt;math&gt; \Lambda^2_G = L, &lt;/math&gt;
where ''-L'' is equal to the Laplacian on the circle:

: &lt;math&gt;
L =
\begin{pmatrix}
 2     &amp; -1 &amp; 0 &amp; \ldots &amp; -1 \\
 -1     &amp; 2 &amp; -1 &amp; \ldots &amp; 0 \\
 0     &amp; -1 &amp; \ddots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\
 \vdots    &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; 2 &amp; -1 \\
 -1     &amp; 0  &amp; \ldots &amp; -1 &amp; 2 \\
\end{pmatrix}
.
&lt;/math&gt;

:'''Exercise(*).''' Prove that the entries of the cofactor matrix of &lt;math&gt;\Lambda_G&lt;/math&gt; are ±1 w/the chessboard pattern. 

The problem of finding the graph ''G'' then reduces to finding a Stieltjes continued fraction that is equal to ''1'' at the non-zero eigenvalues of ''L''. For the ''(2n+1)''-case, where ''n'' is a natural number, the eigenvalues are ''0'' with the multiplicity ''1'' and
: &lt;math&gt; 2\sin(\frac{k\pi}{2n+1}), k = 1,2,\ldots n &lt;/math&gt;
with the multiplicity ''2''. The existence and uniqueness of such fraction with ''n'' levels follows from our results on layered networks, see [BIMS].

:'''Exercise (***).''' Prove that the continued fraction is given by the following formula:

: &lt;math&gt;\beta(z) = \cot(\frac{n\pi}{2n+1}) z + \cfrac{1}{\cot(\frac{(n-1)\pi}{2n+1})z + \cfrac{1}{ \ddots + \cfrac{1}{\cot(\frac{\pi}{2n+1}) z} }}.&lt;/math&gt;

:'''Exercise 2 (*).''' Use the previous exercise to prove the trigonometric formula:

: &lt;math&gt;
\tan(\frac{n\pi}{2n+1}) = 2\sum_k\sin(\frac{k\pi}{2n+1}).
&lt;/math&gt;

:'''Exercise 3(**).''' Find the right signs in the following trigonometric formula

: &lt;math&gt;
\tan(\frac{l\pi}{2n+1}) = 2\sum_k(\pm)\sin(\frac{k\pi}{2n+1}), l = 1,2,\ldots n.
&lt;/math&gt;

Example: the following picture provides the solution for ''n=8'' w/white and black squares representing ''1''s and ''-1''s.

:&lt;math&gt;\omega^N = 1, \omega \ne 1&lt;/math&gt;.
 
We consider the following '''Fourier transform''' given by the symmetric '''Vandermonde matrix''':

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F_N} =
\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}
\begin{bmatrix}
 1     &amp; 1     &amp; 1   &amp; \ldots &amp; 1 \\

 1 &amp; \omega^{(N-1) } &amp; \omega^{2(N-1)} &amp; \ldots &amp; \omega^{(N-1)^2} \\
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F_5} =
\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}
\begin{bmatrix}
 1     &amp; 1         &amp; 1        &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\

 1     &amp; \omega^2  &amp; \omega^4 &amp; \omega^6 &amp; \omega^8 \\
 1     &amp; \omega^3  &amp; \omega^6 &amp; \omega^9 &amp; \omega^{12} \\
 1     &amp; \omega^4  &amp; \omega^8 &amp; \omega^{12} &amp; \omega^{16} \\
\end{bmatrix}
 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}
\begin{bmatrix}
 1     &amp; 1         &amp; 1        &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\
 1     &amp; \omega    &amp; \omega^2 &amp; \omega^3 &amp; \omega^4 \\

 1     &amp; \omega^4  &amp; \omega^3 &amp; \omega^2 &amp; \omega \\
\end{bmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;

The square of the Fourier transform is the identity:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}_N^2 = \mathbf{I}.&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;!--
'''Exercise (**).''' Proof that if ''N'' is a prime number than for any ''0 &lt; k &lt; N''
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F(\omega^k)} = \mathbf{P}\mathbf{F(\omega)}\mathbf{P}^T&lt;/math&gt;,
where ''P'' is a cyclic permutation matrix.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The following rational approximation problem demonstrates how fast the considered discrete models converge to their continuous analogs. The problem of optimal rational approximation of the square root on an interval was solved by Russian mathematician Zolotarev with the closed form solutions in terms of '''[[Wikipedia:elliptic integral| elliptic integrals]]''', see [DIK] &amp; [PP].

The elliptic function 

: &lt;math&gt;
\xi = sn(u,k)
&lt;/math&gt;

can be defined by the following integral equation:

:&lt;math&gt;
u = \int^{\xi}_0\frac{dt}{\sqrt{(1-t^2)(1-\kappa^2t^2)}}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Let 

:&lt;math&gt;
0 &lt; \kappa &lt; 1 \mbox{ and } \kappa' = \sqrt{1-\kappa^2}
&lt;/math&gt;

The optimal rational approximation function of order ''(k-1,k)''.

: &lt;math&gt;
||1-\sqrt{\lambda}\tilde{r}(\lambda)||_{C[1,1/\kappa'^2]} = inf \{||1-\sqrt{\lambda}{r}(\lambda)||_{C[1,1/\kappa'^2]}, r \in R_{k-1,k}\}
&lt;/math&gt;

is given by

: &lt;math&gt;
\tilde{r}(\lambda) = c\frac{\prod_{l=1}^{k-1}(\lambda+c_{2l})}{\prod_{l=1}^{k}(\lambda+c_{2l-1})},
&lt;/math&gt;

where
:&lt;math&gt;
c_l = \frac{sn^2(lk/(2K),\kappa)}{1-sn^2(lk/(2K),\kappa)}, l = 1,2,\ldots,2k-1.
&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;
K = \int^{1}_0\frac{dt}{\sqrt{(1-t^2)(1-\kappa^2t^2)}}
&lt;/math&gt;

'''Exercise (**).''' Use the interlacing of zeros property to prove that the function
 
:&lt;math&gt;
s(\lambda) = \lambda\tilde{r}(\lambda^2)
&lt;/math&gt;

can be written as a Stieltjes continued fraction.

The optimal approximation converges exponentially fast with the degree of the rational function.

The effective conductivities b/w boundary nodes and the [[Dirichlet-to-Neumann]] operator of a network are invariant under the following '''star-mesh''' and '''[[Y-Δ transform]]''', illustrated by the following drawings from Wikipedia:

[[File:Star-mesh transform.svg|thumbnail| Star-mesh transform ]]

'''Exercise (**)'''. Let ''d'' be a diagonal entry of the [[Kirchhoff matrix]] ''K'' of a network ''G'', corresponding to an interior node. Use the [[Schur complement]] formula 

:&lt;math&gt;
\Lambda(G) = K/C = (K/d)/(C/d) 
&lt;/math&gt;

for the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator to prove the invariance.

The rules for replacing conductors in series or parallel connection by a single electrically equivalent conductor follow from the invariance property of the Y-Δ transform and can be viewed as its special cases, as also erasing an edge w/an end point of degree ''1'' and erasing an edge, which endpoints coincide. 

The ''Y-Δ'' transform is a special case of the star-mesh transform in which the center node has the degree ''3''.

The pulse is a precise instrument for transmitting signals about the organism of which it is a part. &lt;ref&gt;Leon Hammer, M.D. &quot;Chinese Pulse Diagnosis, A Contemporary Approach&quot;, Revised Edition, Page 33. EastLand Press, Seattle, 2005. ISBN: 0-939616-49-1 &lt;/ref&gt;

==The Pulse And Chinese Physiology==

===Paradox as a sign of illness===

===Positive and negative signs===
The pulse record can tell us our strengths. Intact proximal positions of the lower burner tell us that we are rooted and have ground to stand on. Intact middle positions of the middle burner tell us that we can restore and cleanse ourselves. Intact distal positions of the upper burner tell us that we can reach out to the world with awareness of our creative being, and to maintain mental and emotional stability.

An accurate pulse record is a precise and faithful catalog of a person's physiology and pathology at a given moment in life. It is the royal road to early diagnosis and prevention.

===Gender===
A very ''thin'' pulse in a man and a very ''wide'' pulse in a woman are inappropriate signs.
Men tend toward ''heat'' from excess and women tend toward ''blood deficiency''.

Disharmony will first occur in the most deficient organ. For example, anger is commonly associated with the Liver, but if a person's Lungs are weaker than the Liver, the Lungs will be affected by anger first, and disharmony will then be found in the Lungs.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Background ==

Lysergic acid diethylamide, commonly known as LSD, has been known to cause psychedelic hallucinations and visions. It has not been known to be addictive or cause brain damage. LSD has been typically used for recreation in order to enhance creativity and out of body experiences. Albert Hoffman, in 1938, discovered LSD when making different derivatives of diethylamide. It's hallucinogenic properties were accidentally discovered in 1943. In the 1950's LSD was brought to the medical community has a tool to create a temporary psychotic state and be used along side psychotherapeutic treatments. It was in the 1960's that the general public began using LSD for recreational use, and remains a major drug to this day. &lt;ref name=&quot;LSD&quot;&gt;Annelie Hintzen, et al. &quot;The Pharmacology Of Lysergic Acid Diethylamide: A Review.&quot; CNS Neuroscience &amp; Therapeutics 14.4 (2008): 295-314.&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Overview ==

LSD blocks serotonin from the brain.  Serotonin, a neurotransmitter, is in charge of regulating mood, muscle contraction, and other cognitive functions. The reason why LSD blocks serotonin is because of their structural similarity, LSD is mistake to be serotonin and is then sent to the synaptic cleft instead of serotonin. And like many other hallucinogenics, LSD has a substituted indole ring in its molecular structure, which contributes to its hallucinogenic effects. There are many perceptual changes altering the cognitive and visual sensory systems, as well as changed in the sense of time, body-image, and ego. Memory is also greatly effected. A typical &quot;trip&quot; can last anywhere between six and ten hours. The half-life in humans is approximately 175 minutes, though it is metabolized at different rates at different structures in the body. Not much clinical testing has been done since the 1970's, partly due to the fact that after the subjects have taken a dose of LSD they become &quot;too impaired to cooperate&quot;. &lt;ref name=&quot;LSD&quot; /&gt;

== Structure ==

The molecular configuration of crystal form LSD has been determined by using x-ray diffraction techniques. The configuration shows strain and steric hindrance. Serotonin and LSD are somewhat similar in structure as indicated by the indole ring present in both molecules. Therefore, the two molecules share similar chemical properties due to the similarity in structure. When comparing LSD and serotonin, the similarity between its electron densities of the highest occupied molecular orbital is observed.  The nitrogen atom possesses the electron density due to its free lone pair.
[[File:Serotonin-2D-skeletal.png|thumbnail]]serotonin 
[[File:LSD.png|thumbnail]] LSD
[[File:LSD isomers.png|thumbnail]]
LSD is prepared by reacting lysergic acid with diethylamide. LSD has the chemical composition C20H25N3O. It has four different isomers, however, only when it is R, and R, stereochemistry. Only one stereoisomer (the d-) is psychoactive. Therefore, a racemic mixture of LSD shows only  half the potency of the dextro form. 
The electron density is lowest in the areas around the indole ring in both molecules. The dipole moment of the two molecules are very close.  Serotonin is 2.98 D and LSD is 3.04 D; D is the SI unit measurement for electric dipole moment. The dipole moment is going towards the amine group in both molecules.  The virtually same dipole moments of both molecules is the key to the ability of LSD fitting into the same receptors as serotonin. 

== Storage ==
LSD is a somewhat stable organic molecule, like other  molecules with similar structures.The main factors to be concerned with are moisture due to chemical reactions in the presense of moisture, oxygen, light, and temperature.  Reaction rates typically depend  on temperature exponentially.  

== Synthesis ==

In its pure form, LSD is a white or clear, odorless, water-soluble crystal that can be crushed into a powder and dissolved. The most common form of LSD is known as blotter acid, sheets of paper that have are blotted with LSD.  Tablet known as microdot is also very common.  LSD is generally found as in its crystal form, dried on gelatin sheets or in capsule or liquid form.There a couple of different ways to make LSD. A common way is to start with lysergic acid. It will require morning glory seeds. Morning glory and the seeds contain  lysergic acid amide. It is considered a precursor to LSD. The amount of LSA in different seeds varies . As a result, the quality of the drug made from it would also vary.
Another synthetic route is to use ergot. Once the ergot is obtained, one must extract the ergot alkaloids which contain basic nitrogen atoms. A darkroom working environment is necessary because the ergot will decompose under bright lights. LSD itself can break down quickly when exposed to light.The solvents and reagents used in the synthesis are also harmful. The solvent anhydrous hydrazine can explode when heated. It is a carcinogen. Another chemical often used in for the synthesis is chloroform. It can cause cancer as well while causing internal damages to organs. The ergot alkaloid is synthesized into a compound called iso-lysergic acid hydrazide through the addition of reagents and heating. The iso-lysergic acid hydrazide is isomerized in order to make it active. Once cooled, the isomer is mixed with an acid and a base, and evaporated. The product obatined is iso-lysergic diethylamide, which is isomerized again to produce active LSD. The LSD is then purified and crystallized in order to obtain a higher concentrated form.

==Side Effects of LSD==
There have been no documented human deaths from an LSD overdose. It is physiologically well tolerated and there is no evidence for long-lasting physiological effects on the brain or other parts of the human organism.
LSD may temporarily impair the ability to make sensible judgments and understand common dangers, thus making the user more susceptible to accidents and personal injury. It may cause temporary confusion, difficulty with abstract thinking, or signs of impaired memory and attention span

      <text xml:space="preserve">Zur Klärung der Frage, was Dependency Injection (DI) soll zuerst beschrieben werden, welche Art von Abhängigkeit (Dependency) hiermit gemeint ist.

In DI steht das D für Abhängigkeiten zwischen Klassen bzw. genauer zwischen den korrespondierenden Objekten. 

Da in der Regel komplexere Objekte Funktionalitäten anderer Objekte benötigen, 
haben Sie diese Objekte in Membervariablen (Objektvariablen) gespeichert. 
z.B. (modifiziert aus M. Fowler: Inversion of Control Containers and the Dependency Injection pattern, 2004 http://martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html) :

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;java5&quot;&gt;..
public class MovieLister {
  ...
  private MovieFinder ;
  ....
  
  public Movie[] moviesDirectedBy(String directorName) {
        List&lt;Movie&gt; allMovies = finder.findAll();
        for (Movie movie : allMovies){
            if (!movie.getDirector().equals(directorName)) {
               it.remove();
            }
        }
        return allMovies.toArray();
    }
} 
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Die Methode &lt;code&gt;moviesDirectedBy&lt;/code&gt; verwendet hier ein Objekt von Typ &lt;code&gt;MovieFinder&lt;/code&gt;. Man sagt &lt;code&gt;MovieFinder&lt;/code&gt; ist '''abhängig''' von &lt;code&gt;MovieLister&lt;/code&gt;.

Der &lt;code&gt;MovieFinder&lt;/code&gt; ist ein Interface, für die es eine Vielzahl von Implementierungen (&lt;code&gt;DBMovieFinder, ColonDelimiterMovieFinder&lt;/code&gt;) geben könnte. 
 
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;java5&quot;&gt;
public interface MovieFinder {
  List&lt;Movie&gt; findAll();
}

&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;


Wenn nun aber direkt im Konstruktor des &lt;code&gt;MovieLister&lt;/code&gt; eine konkrete &lt;code&gt;MovieFinder&lt;/code&gt;-Instanz erzeugt, ist diese Wiederverwertbarkeit nicht gegeben, z.B durch:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;java5&quot;&gt;
class MovieLister
...
  private MovieFinder finder;
  public MovieLister() {
    finder = new ColonDelimitedMovieFinder(&quot;movies1.txt&quot;);
  }
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Der &lt;code&gt;MovieLister&lt;/code&gt; ist fest mit einer Implementierung des MovieFinder (&lt;code&gt;ColonDelimitedMovieFinder&lt;/code&gt;) verbunden. Dies führt zu einer starken Kopplung. Hierdurch ist aber die Methode &lt;code&gt;moviesDirectedBy&lt;/code&gt; bzw. der &lt;code&gt;MovieLister&lt;/code&gt; nicht mehr für alle möglichen Ausprägungen (Implementierungen) des &lt;code&gt;MovieFinder&lt;/code&gt; nutzbar.
Außerdem lässt sich die Methode &lt;code&gt;moviesDirectedBy&lt;/code&gt; nicht mehr testen, ohne gleichzeitig den &lt;code&gt;ColonDelimitedMovieFinder&lt;/code&gt; mit zu testen. 
Ein weiterer Nachteil ist das die Abhängigkeit vom &lt;code&gt;MovieLister&lt;/code&gt; zum &lt;code&gt;MovieFinder&lt;/code&gt; nicht in den Methoden-Signaturen (denke an Javadoc) erkennbar ist, sondern nur in der Implementierung.

Eine Lösung des Problems ist die Abhängigkeit z4 der 26n2reten 0*3e0ent5er4ng von außen hinein zugeben, z.B. über den Konstruktor (Constructor Injection). Nicht die die Klasse selbst kümmert sich um die Auflösung der konkret genutzten Implementierung des Interface. Sie wird von außen injiziert. Daher der Name &quot;Dependency (Abhängigkeit) Injection (Injizieren)&quot;.


&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;java5&quot;&gt;
  public MovieLister(MovieFinder finder) {
    this.finder = finder;
  }
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Hier wird aus der Konstruktor-Signatur die Abhängigkeit ersichtlich. 


Dies ist die Grundlage von Dependency Injection (DI). Dabei ergeben sich folgende Vorteile:
* Bessere Wiederverwertbarkeit
* Schwächen der Kopplung zwischen den Komponenten
* Isoliertes Testen (injizieren von Mock-Objekten) wird möglich
* Erkennen der Abhängigkeit in der Methoden-, bzw. Konstruktor-Signatur.

Object oriented programming? 
What does this mean?

Let's split this term in to:
* object-oriented
* programming

=== Programming ===

Programming is like cooking

=== What is an object? ===

{{TextBox|'''Summary:''' 

:When programming, we'll deal with ''''objects''''. 
:Objects can be very concrete, such as a book or a car, or be very abstract such as a color or number}}

When we programm in an object-oriented way, we deal with objects. What are &quot;objects&quot; exactly?

The definition of &quot;objects&quot; in the context of programming is much broader than in the &quot;real world&quot;.

In the real world you would have no problem to identify these as objects:

* a computer
* a car
* a book
* a guitar
* a banana

It is very easy for us to think about them as objects. You can see them, they have a position in space, you can use them.

What about living things? Are they objects also? For example:

* an elephant
* bacteria
* your parents
* a movie star
* yourself (?!)

Are these also objects? Yes, they are. Don't be confused and think that we are treating persons with disrespect by calling them &quot;objects&quot;. As you will see soon, it's pretty much the other way around: we will be treating objects like persons!

To this point you probably had little to no difficulty for recognizing these as ''real'' objects. However, in the object-oriented world there are many less-obvious cases. Things that you would conceptually recognize, but hardly smell, feel, touch or even see.

Pieces of information are also objects:

* today's temperature
* the current year
* the name of your first teacher
* the price of a cinema ticket
* your age

You might think it is strange to talk about these as &quot;objects&quot;. Well, it get's better than that.

In the object-oriented world we can deal with very abstract concepts and still call them &quot;objects&quot;.

Here are some examples to broaden your mind:

* the Internet
* a music concert
* the night
* the color red
* the number 3
* thruthness

At this point you might be confused. Don't worry, there is only one thing to remember. In the object-oriented world: '''everything is an object'''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In rhetoric, ethos is one of the three artistic proofs (pistis (πίστις)) or modes of persuasion (other principles being logos and pathos ) discussed by Aristotle in 'Rhetoric' as a component of argument. Speakers must establish ethos from the start. This can involve &quot;moral competence&quot; only; Aristotle however broadens the concept to include expertise and knowledge. Ethos is limited, in his view, by what the speaker says. Others however contend that a speaker's ethos extends to and is shaped by the overall moral character and history of the speaker—that is, what people think of his or her character before the speech is even begun (cf Isocrates).

According to Nedra Reynolds, Professor of Writing &amp; Rhetoric, &quot;ethos, like postmodern subjectivity, shifts and changes over time, across texts, and around competing spaces&quot;(Reynolds, 336). However, Reynolds additionally discusses how one might clarify the meaning of ethos within rhetoric as expressing inherently communal roots. This stands in direct opposition to what she describes as the claim &quot;that ethos can be faked or 'manipulated'&quot; because individuals would be formed by the values of their culture and not the other way around (Reynolds, 336). While its meaning and application within literature might differ over time, this classical interpretation persists.

There are three categories of ethos.
    
* phronesis - practical skills &amp; wisdom
    
* arete - virtue, goodness
    
* eunoia - goodwill towards the audience

In a sense, ethos does not belong to the speaker but to the audience. Thus, it is the audience that determines whether a speaker is a high- or a low-ethos speaker. Violations of ethos include:
    
* The speaker has a direct interest in the outcome of the debate (e.g. a person pleading innocence of a crime);
    
* The speaker has a vested interest or ulterior motive in the outcome of the debate;
    
* The speaker has no expertise (e.g. a lawyer giving a speech on space flight is less convincing than an astronaut giving the same speech).

Completely dismissing an argument based on any of the above violations of ethos is a formal fallacy, rendering the dismissal of the argument invalid.

The term &quot;source credibility&quot; has been used as the construct examined in the social sciences. Though recent work has found support for the existence of the three dimensions identified above, work from the 1950s through the 1980s consistently revealed two dimensions (competence and character) with other dimensions such as dynamism found only when broad approaches equating credibility with &quot;person perception&quot; were taken.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Since economic reforms that created a mostly free economy in 1991, India has grown rapidly. Over the last 10 years, real GDP growth has averaged 7.44% per year, compared to 2.56% per year in the United States &lt;ref&gt; Index Mundi [http://www.indexmundi.com/g/g.aspx?v=66&amp;c=us&amp;l=en]&lt;/ref&gt; This growth has been concentrated in urban centers, often completely passing over the rural poor. [[w:Ratan Tata|Ratan Tata]], former head of the [[w:Tata Group|Tata Group]], one of India's largest companies, had an idea that, if properly implemented, would help spread wealth to the rural poor: a cheap car that could be marketed to the lower class. Many poor Indian families use two-wheel motorbikes to travel, an unsafe practice which also limits the distance that can be traveled.
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt; &quot;I saw families riding around on scooters with kids standing up and the mother carrying a baby and decided to do something about it. It started as a quest: affordable transportation solution.&quot; -Ratan Tata &lt;ref&gt; Tata Motors Presentation [http://www.authorstream.com/Presentation/aSGuest37030-314986-tata-nano-future-2020-education-ppt-powerpoint/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
Mr. Tata's solution to this problem was the 1 lakh ($2250)  [[w:Tata Nano|Tata Nano]]. The Tata Nano has received high praise for it's implementation of frugal engineering and product innovation. It was predicted to expand India's car market by 65% and cause an overall dip in prices; however, after four years, it has failed to live up to its high expectations, in many cases because of Tata Motor's errors. &lt;ref&gt; The Indian Express [http://www.indianexpress.com/news/two-years-on-tata-nano-sales-yet-to-hit-top-gear/941736/2]&lt;/ref&gt; Hormazd Sorabjee, editor of Autocar India, says &quot;the Nano is a brilliant concept... but it is a monumental marketing blunder.&quot; Many rural Indians never heard about the car that was supposed to help transform their lives &lt;ref&gt;Stuck in low gear; Tata's Nano [http://www.economist.com/node/21526374]&lt;/ref&gt;, and it has not been as successful as anticipated. 

==Tata Nano Marketing Strategy==
The target population of the Tata Nano was low income rural families who relied heavily on motorcycles. However, the weak sales of the car show that Tata Motors' marketing campaign was mistargeted. In 2010, the then CEO of Tata Motors Carl-Peter Forster admitted that the company had to &quot;reinvent the Nano business model.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;The Little Car That Couldn't [http://www.economist.com/node/18285497]&lt;/ref&gt;. In 2010 &lt;ref&gt;The Little Car That Couldn't [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2096849-3,00.html]&lt;/ref&gt;,  cities with a population greater than 500,000 had 619 showrooms whereas towns with a population less than 500,000 had only six showrooms, which is why the rural population whose lives the Nano was intended to transform never even heard of the car. Tata Motors recognized this discrepancy and has made plans for 300 more distribution centers in rural areas. Furthermore, no financing scheme was provided at launch which deterred low income households from purchasing the car.

The sales of the Nano also suffered from negative publicity received due to reports of fires under the hood. When the car was first launched, the marketing campaign was subdued and media reports of the fires were more prominent. Monthly sales fell to 509 units during this period, far less than the target sales of 20,000 units per month &lt;ref&gt;The Little Car That Couldn't [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2096849-3,00.html]&lt;/ref&gt;.
[[File:altis_envy.gif|right|thumb|The average Indian household wants a car that's a status symbol, not a cheap car. ]]
[[File:Indian_middle_class.JPG|left|thumb|India's aspiring middle class is rising rapidly ]]


===Aspirations of the Indian middle class===
The Nano was marketed as a cheap car at launch. However, the average aspiring Indian middle class household considers a car as a status symbol. The Corolla advertisement on the right shows what a customer is looking for in a car. The Nano provides far better fuel economy than the next cheapest car, but consumerism trumps economic sense. After tax and basic add-ons, the Nano costs $3500, but many families chose to save a bit more and buy the next best car for $4500. Moreover, the middle class is rising rapidly in India. McKinsey's report on India's consumer goods market shows that 77% of Indian households are expected to have annual income ranging from 90,000-1,000,000 Indian rupees ($1650-$18,350) by 2025, up from 45% in 2005 &lt;ref&gt; The 'Bird of Gold': The Rise of India's Cosumer Market [http://www.mckinsey.com/locations/india/mckinseyonindia/pdf/India_Consumer_Market.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Focus on urban youth===

While the Nano was not popular with rural low income households, the few cars that did sell were popular among the urban youth. Tata Motors has responded to this unintended use of the Nano by targeting this demographic. The television and youtube commercials of the Nano show the changing focus of the customer base. During launch in 2009, the Nano was marketed as a family car ([http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WB87eo_obU video advertisement in 2009]), whereas the [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmSy69sUoQ 2012 video advertisement] appeals to the youth. Tata Motors has also started an aggressive marketing campaign to brand the car as a trendy, fun car through social networking and artistic collaborations. The Nano facebook page has two million fans and a merchandise store is available on eBay. Through the Nano Art in Motion campaign, artists paint the car in creative colorful themes.

==Tata Nano and the Lower Class==

The Tata Nano was designed to target those in India's lower class because many people in the lower class of India do not have transportation either due to a lack of supply or a high cost of access.  Lack of transportation inhibits the lower class from looking for work, transporting goods, and obtaining health care. &lt;ref&gt;The Next 4 Billion [http://pdf.wri.org/n4b_full_text_lowrez.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, the lower class is left to walking, bicycling, or driving animal-drawn carts.  Low class families also ride on motorcycles, as this is a cheap form of faster mobility.



The design of the Nano and its low cost was an effort to provide cheap alternative transportation for families unsafely crowded on two-wheel transportation. A portion of consumers saw the Tata Nano as a viable option.  For example, an Indian blogger claims that that Nano &quot;is good for people who ride bike.&quot; &lt;ref&gt; Tata Nano User Review [www.gaadi.com/review-Tata-Nano+-123]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unintended Use of the Tata Nano===
The Tata Nano was ultimately purchased by the middle class and aspiring urban youth due to unforeseen economic pressures. Vishnu Mathur, the Director-General of the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturing, claims that the &quot;[automobile] market continues to be tough due to...high interest rates and fuel prices.&quot; &lt;ref&gt; The Hindu [http://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/car-sales-dip-825-in-november/article4185400.ece] &lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, the characteristics of the Indian economy not only deterred many intended lower class consumers, but also attracted unintended users with more disposable income.  Low class consumers are still purchasing motorcycles because of their low cost and low gasoline consumption.

India is going through a period of rapid inflation implemented by the central bank.  A high borrowing rate has impacted the finances of the lower class, and they are resorting to motorbikes because &quot;especially for short distances, bikes make more sense.&quot; &lt;ref&gt; Topix.com [http://www.topix.com/forum/autos/tata-nano/T20J6IA6T816H44DE] &lt;/ref&gt;  The chief financial officer of the Indian-run Hero MotoCorp. Ltd. claims that &quot;the worst affected [by India's inflation] is the passenger-car market, where the dependence on loans...is high.&quot; While 30 percent of motorcycles are bought with a loan, approximately 80 percent of cars are bought with loans. &lt;ref&gt; Bloomberg News [http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-11-28/tata-nanos-aren-t-cheap-enough-as-india-chooses-motorbikes-cars.html] &lt;/ref&gt;  Bloomberg data shows that India has the third highest borrowing costs in Asia, with an increase in the repurchase rate by almost 4 percent since March of 2010. &lt;ref&gt;India Chooses Motorbikes Over Tata Nanos [http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-11-28/tata-nanos-aren-t-cheap-enough-as-india-chooses-motorbikes-cars.html] &lt;/ref&gt;  When loans have such a high interest rate, the demand of the Tata Nano went down with an associated increase in demand for cheaper alternatives, like motorcycles and other less-expensive transportation.  

Petrol prices are also rising, benefiting motorcycle manufacturers because people of India are traveling less and are thus using motorcycles which work well with short distances and require less gasoline per mile.  Gasoline costs in India are Rs. 68.64 per liter and prices are now 26 percent higher than a year ago. &lt;ref&gt;India Chooses Motorbikes Over Tata Nanos [http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-11-28/tata-nanos-aren-t-cheap-enough-as-india-chooses-motorbikes-cars.html] &lt;/ref&gt;  Passenger vehicle sales are lower than they have been for the last ten years, and &quot;two-wheeler deliveries rose 2 percent in October, extending consecutive monthly gains since January 2009.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Bloomberg [http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-11-28/tata-nanos-aren-t-cheap-enough-as-india-chooses-motorbikes-cars.html]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The increase in interest rates and gas prices has not only decreased Tata Nano consumption, but those who are purchasing the Tata Nano are those in the middle class and aspiring youth.  Lower class Indian citizens continue to purchase cheaper but unsafe motorcycles and bikes, leaving the purchasing of the Tata Nano to unintended consumers.

==Tata Nano and Conflict with the Government==
Tata misjudged the public perception of rural farmers whose land they were using for the Tata Nano factory.  In May 2006, Tata announced plans to build a factory in the town of [[w:Singur|Singur]], [[w:West Bengal|West Bengal]], approximately one hour outside of [[w:Kolkata|Kolkata]].&lt;ref&gt; Hindustan Times [http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/Kolkata/Court-verdict-on-Singur-mars-Didi-s-home-run/Article1-876893.aspx] &lt;/ref&gt; When economic regulations were relaxed in 1991, much of West Bengal was rapidly converted back to farmland by the Marxist government, with thousands of farmers receiving small parcels of land. By 2006, Chief Minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and Industry Minister Nirupam Sen (of the same Marxist Party) were intent on bringing India's rapid growth to West Bengal, and saw the Nano factory as an opportunity to do so. It was estimated that the Nano factory would bring thousands of jobs to the region, and the politicians felt pressured to make concessions to the Tatas in order to ensure economic growth.&lt;ref&gt; Telegraph India [http://www.telegraphindia.com/1061014/asp/bengal/story_6870254.asp] &lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;The Tata factory will certainly come up in Singur. We are trying our
best to provide land to those who want to set up factories.&quot;
-- Chief Minister Bhattarcharjee&lt;/blockquote&gt;



To provide land for the factory, Bhattarcharjee and Sen employed the arcane 1894 Land Acquisition Act, a version of eminent domain passed by the British during their rule to build public works, and bought 997 acres of farmland using state funds. The law's use of the phrase &quot;public purpose&quot; has been interpreted by the Kolkata High Court as a socio-economic decision best left to individual governments, meaning that Bhattacharjee and Sen were probably within their legal rights. However, roughly 2,250 of the over 13,000 farmers refused to sell their land. They felt their cropland was fertile enough to make a living, and that being bought out by the government was a violation of their rights. &lt;ref&gt; Telegraph India&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the urban poor from Kolkata and other larger cities joined the farmers in the fight, arguing that the peasants have emotional bond with the land, and money cannot compensate for this loss. &lt;ref&gt; Majumdar Dissertation [http://udini.proquest.com/view/peasants-against-the-nano-pqid:1936625261/] &lt;/ref&gt;

Their champion in this case became [[w:Mamata Banerjee|Mamata Banerjee]], the leader of the [[w:Trinamool Congress|Trinamool Congress]] opposition party. She rallied the coalition of farmers and urban poor to her cause, energizing them through a 25-day hunger strike in December 2006. Over the next year and a half, she stood behind rallies, human blockades, and massive strikes that eventually caused Tata to abandon the Singur site in October 2008, despite investing over Rs. 15 billion ($275M) in the project. Banerjee and her party received strong public support for their efforts, and won a large victory during May 2011 elections, unseating the Marxist party for the first time in 30 years.&lt;ref&gt; Telegraph India &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; The Economist [http://www.economist.com/node/12010079] &lt;/ref&gt; Tata instead built the factory in [[w:Gujarat|Gujarat]], India, sparking counter-protests in Singur from those who supported the factory because of its economic benefits, but the decision had been made. &lt;ref&gt; Majumdar Dissertation &lt;/ref&gt;

This debate over the constitutionality of the Land Acquisition Act and the power of the government to exercise eminent domain is still being fought in the courts. Mamata Banerjee continues to promise that all farmers will get their land back&lt;ref&gt;Hindustan Times 2[http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/WestBengal/Mamata-promises-Singur-land-back-to--unwilling-landlosers/Article1-966691.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt;, but the matter will be heard by the Indian Supreme Court during the next session. The Kolkata High Court declared the 1894 Act unconstitutional. If this decision is upheld, all land would immediately be returned to the farmers. If the decision is overturned, however, this will have far-reaching implications for how businesses approach capital investments in India.

==Tata Nano in the Future==
At the moment, the future of the Nano is very uncertain. It could still catch with the original intended market in India, and Tata Motors wants to sell it internationally as well. Within three years, US customers might be able to buy a slightly reconfigured Nano for under $10,000, although there are significant distribution obstacles to overcome. &lt;ref&gt; Autoblog.com [http://www.autoblog.com/2012/10/15/redesigned-tata-nano-to-arrive-in-u-s-wearing-price-tag-under/]&lt;/ref&gt; There are few predictions of what the future might hold for the Nano, but the fact remains that it is a brilliant engineering solution that, so far, has failed to appropriately manage the social interface of technology.

      <comment>Answer to the question</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi, the text after the first piece of code says: &quot;A check for self assignment is not strictly necessary but can give some performance improvements in (rarely occurring) self-assignment cases.&quot;

I don't understand why a check for self assignment is not necessary.
If we have a String s1, whose str pointer is pointing somewhere, and we write then:
s1 = s1;
This will:
1) create a temporary object, initialised with s1:
String temp (s1);

2) swap str pointers with the current object (s1):
temp.swap (s1); // so here, both temp and s1 point to the same char *.

3) return (*this)= s1:

4) delete temp, thus deleting s1.str.

So why's this acceptable?

I would have thought that one would need to write:
String &amp; operator = (String const &amp;s) {
      if (this != &amp;s) {
        String temp (s); // Copy-constructor -- RAII
        temp.swap (*this); // Non-throwing swap
      }
      return *this;
    }

Can someone please explain why this is not the case?

My answer (isn't there an answer function here?): 
s and temp are not the same pointer (if the Copy contstructor is using deep copy).</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Structural Biochemistry/ Secondary Bonds ==
Many of the properties of protein indicate that a variety of bonds other than the peptide exist in them. These secondary bonds hold the chain in its natural configuration.
Some of secondary bonds commonly found in proteins:
     '''1.Covalent Bond- Disulfide Bond (-S-S-)'''
Covalent bonds are strongest chemical bonds contributing to protein structure. Covalent bonds arise when two atoms share electrons. Covalent bond found between [[amino acid]] residues in protein and polypeptide in the disulfide bond of two [[cysteine]] residues to yield a mole of [[cystine]].
In general, reaction may be written as:
&lt;gallery&gt;
File:Disulfide-bond.png
&lt;/gallery&gt;
The disulfide bond is with typical bond strength of 50kcal/mole, about 2A&lt;sup&gt;o

*Oxytocin : a hormone stimulating the contraction of smooth muscles expecially during childbirth. Oxytoxin is a peptide of nine amino acid that contains a disulfide bond between two cysteine.
&lt;gallery&gt;
File:Oxytocin with labels.png
&lt;/gallery&gt;
 
Structure of Oxytocin 1

*Insulin: two peptide chains are linked together by 2 disulfide bonds, connecting the amino acid cysteine to cysteine.
     '''2.Hydrogen Bond:'''
In a hydrogen bond, a hydrogen atom is shared by two other atoms.When two atoms bearing partial negative charges share partially positively charged hydrogen, the atoms are engaged in a hydrogen bond.
Hydrogen bond is about 2.8A&lt;sup&gt;O&lt;/sup&gt; in length with typical length strong of 5-8 kcal/ mole and maxima when the bond is linear. Hydrogen bonds are stronger than van der Waals bonds but weaker than covalent bond.
     '''3. Nonpolar or Hydrophobic Bond'''
&lt;gallery&gt;
File:Water drop on a leaf.jpg
&lt;/gallery&gt;
Hydrophobic bonds are a major force driving proper protein folding. Many amino acids ( [[Alanine]],[[Valine]], [[Leucine]], [[Isoleucine]], [[Methionine]], [[Trytophan]], [[Phenylalanine]] and [[Tyrosine]]) have the side chains  are essentially hydrophobic. It means they have little attraction for water molecules in comparison to the strong hydrogen bonding between water molecules.
The hydrophobic also play important role in the formation of enzyme-substrate complexes and antibody-antigen interactions.
 
      '''4.Ionic ( Electrostatic Bond)'''
Ionic binds are formed as amino acids bearing opposite electrical charged in the hydrophobic core of proteins. These amino acid contribute negatively charged and positively changed side chains to the polypeptide backbone. In a long polypeptide chain containing a large number of charged side chains, there are many electrostatic interactions. Ionic bond, although weaker than the hydrogen bonds, but they can be important to protein structure because they are potent electrostatic attractions that can approach the strength of covalent bonds.
The force of such an electrostatic attraction is given by Coulomb's law:
                     F=q&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;q&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;D
which is q&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and q&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are the charged of the two groups, r is the distance between them, and D is the dielectric constant of the medium.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==What is Branding?==
A [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brand Brand] is some type of visual representation, whether through words, images, colors, or shapes, that is used to uniquely identify a company, product, or good.  Branding of products is not only a method by which to distinguish one product from another, but is a way to increase public awareness of that product.  Branding is especially important when discussing issues at the socio-technical interface; a brand is a powerful tool that can sway public perception of a technology.

==Hydraulic Fracturing vs. Fracking==
One of the biggest issues facing our society today is the development of alternative energy sources to decrease carbon emissions and potential climate change.  As oil and gas sources dwindle, people hope to find more &quot;unconventional&quot; sources to produce these fossil fuels&lt;ref name=&quot;Linley&quot;&gt;Linley, D. (2011, August). Fracking under pressure: The environmental and social impacts and risks of shale gas development. Sustainalytics.&lt;/ref&gt;.  One such unconventional source is shale gas, extracted via [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydraulic_fracturing hydraulic fracturing].  There are many [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_impact_of_hydraulic_fracturing_in_the_United_States environmental] and social impacts that incite debate over the technology.  Supporters of [http://i.imgur.com/NAF7B.jpg hydraulic fracturing] explain the process as one in which safe and controlled additives or fluids are sent into the shale layer of the earth's crust, pushing the natural gas up through the well, and into a facility or storage vessel above ground.  Opponents of [http://i.imgur.com/4iv1s.jpg fracking], on the other hand, focus on the use of potential hazardous chemicals leaking into ground water, as well as excessive water consumption leading to shortages.

==Social Perspectives==
Social groups and organizations participating in the debate of this technology draw on many of the same environmental impacts; however each spins them in a way to brand the technology as either a positive or negative process.  

===Support===
By far the largest and most vocal proponents of this technology are major American oil companies.  More modest proponents are environmental departments of states in which hydraulic fracturing is practiced.

=====Chevron's Approach=====
Chevron’s website currently runs an [http://www.chevron.com/next/producingnaturalgasprotectingwater/ article accompanied by a video] explaining the process of hydraulic fracturing.  At a glance, the video's first image appears to depict trees or other foliage.  The viewer later learns that the image is actually a hydraulic fracturing well.  This subtle imagery could indicate Chevron's attempt at branding hydraulic fracturing as a nature-friendly, well-controlled process.

The video features still shots of scientists discussing complex diagrams of natural gas reservoirs. These images of scientists are presented in such a way as to brand hydraulic fracturing as a technology that has been carefully researched by experts in the field.

Throughout the video there are panoramic scenes of pristine American landscapes, mountains and vast forests dotted with comparatively small natural gas production sites.  This imagery helps to emphasize that hydraulic fracturing is well-established and that Chevron is invested in ensuring environmental and water quality.  The imagery aids in Chevron's branding of the technology as natural and green.

=====The Language of Oil Companies=====
Like Chevron, many other oil companies participating in hydraulic fracturing publish articles or webpages to explain the technology.  A survey of these articles published by nine of the top U.S. oil producers found the following word usage &lt;ref&gt;Hess Corporation 2010 corporate sustainability report. (2011, June). Retrieved December 9, 2012, from http://www.hess.com/reports/sustainability/US/2010/default.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Natural gas. (2012).

&lt;/center&gt;

The word ''fracking'' is used infrequently due to the anti-fracking movement's success in branding the word as synonymous with evil corporate profiteering at the expense of the environment.  While ''natural gas'' and ''methane'' are both names for the product, the former sounds more environmentally friendly.  The word ''chemicals'' follows the same pattern, as it evokes negative feelings.  These word choices show how companies are attempting to assign a friendlier brand to the technology.

=====Ohio Department of Natural Resources=====
Another clear proponent of hydraulic fracturing is the Ohio Department of Natural Resources (ODNR).  The agency's webpage uses tactics similar to those of oil companies in its presentation of the technology.

ODNR's page on hydraulic fracturing is titled &quot;Shale Development&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Department of Natural Resources, Shale development. (Ohio). Retrieved December 9, 2012, from https://ohiodnr.com/tabid/23415/default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;.  Similar to several oil companies' pages, the ODNR never refers to the technology as ''fracking'', opting instead for a more positive-sounding brand name.  Beyond explicit re-branding of the technology, the ODNR assures readers that environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing are minimal.  For instance, the ODNR states that while water is a &quot;key ingredient&quot; in hydraulic fracturing, the technology poses no risk of drinking water shortages.  ODNR informs readers that water usage in a hydraulic fracturing well is comparable to that in more familiar water intensive practices, e.g. golf course maintenance&lt;ref&gt;Dept. of Natural Resources, Water (Flowback) From Hydraulic Fracturing. (Ohio ). Retrieved December 9, 2012, from https://ohiodnr.com/Portals/11/pdf/wastewater-fact-sheet.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;.

Unlike the oil companies, the ODNR does not stand to profit directly from hydraulic fracturing development.  The department's support of the technology is the result of its mission statement: &quot;To ensure a balance between wise use and protection of our natural resources for the benefit of all&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Dept. of Natural Resrouces, History and Purpose of the Department Of Natural Resources. (Ohio).  Retrieved December 9, 2012, from http://ohiodnr.com/tabid/10748/default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;.  The ODNR's subtle re-branding efforts represent its attempts to ease public concerns over a technology it has deemed to be safe, and therefore beneficial to the state of Ohio.

===Opposition===
====Social Organizations====
[[File:Stop Frack Attack.JPG|thumbprint|right|x200px]]
In 2011, the New York Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC), released its recommendations on fracking, &quot;allowing the practice in most areas of the state outside of the New York City and Syracuse watersheds&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;Food&quot;&gt;Food &amp; Water Watch. (2011, July 7). 49 groups call on Cuomo for statewide fracking ban [Press release].&lt;/ref&gt;.  This exclusion of the New York City watershed potentially communicates remaining uncertainty as to the safety of the technology.  A coalition of 49 national and state level social interest groups rose up and called for a state-wide ban on the process.  Of these groups included [http://democracyforamerica.com/ Democracy for America], [http://www.frackaction.com/ Frack Action], [http://www.foe.org/ Friends of the Earth], and the [http://chej.org/ Center for Health, Environment &amp; Justice].  The coalition also sent a petition to Governor Cuomo, signed by &quot;'nearly 20,000 New Yorkers...in the first 24 hours,'&quot; according to the Campaign Manager of [http://www.credoaction.com/ CREDO Action], another participating organization &lt;ref name=&quot;Food&quot;&gt;Food &amp; Water Watch. (2011, July 7). 49 groups call on Cuomo for statewide fracking ban [Press release].&lt;/ref&gt;.   

These organizations rely heavily on language, similar to the oil companies, but to promote fracking as a harmful and hazardous technology.  They each publish articles, press releases, and letters to politicians, emphasizing the dangerous impacts of fracking.  A survey of these publications by 6 social organizations found the following word usage&lt;ref&gt;Frack Action. (n.d.). What is fracking?

While their motive for choosing the words ''frack'' and ''chemicals'' is obvious, the higher frequency of describing the produced fuel as ''natural gas'' instead of ''methane'' is also deliberate.  Many of the organizations described the fuel as ''&quot;natural&quot; gas'', where the use of quotes directly implies their skepticism of how natural this fuel really is.

====Individuals====    
Aside from large organizations, individual citizens have also begun raising their voices in concern.  Maxime Daigle of New Brunswick, spent his career as an oil worker in Alberta, British Columbia and across the U.S.  In January 2012, he expressed his major concerns with the industry, having seen it from the inside: &quot;Some rig managers...make you contain contamination...But I've seen many times where you're told just to cover it with dirt, fresh dirt so nobody sees it&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Anonymous. (2012, January 26). Blow the whistle: ex-oil worker exposes the dangers of Hydro-Fracking. Westside Gazette.&lt;/ref&gt;.  Daigle effectively draws on his own first-hand experience to further perpetuate the negative branding of fracking.

In 2011, Frederick Mayer, a self described disabled veteran and resident of Candor, NY, made a [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEtgvwllNpg video] of himself lighting his kitchen sink water on fire.  He sent the video to [http://www.toxicstargeting.com/ Toxics Targeting], an environmental database service.  Mayer lived near the Marcellus Shale Formation, a large natural gas deposit, and claimed the drilling is what led to a natural gas leak in his drinking water.  He shared how he reported the problem to the DEC, yet no one came to inspect his water or fix the gas leak&lt;ref&gt;Toxics Targeting. (n.d.). Ignitable drinking water in Candor, NY, above Marcellus Shale [Video file]. Retrieved from http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEtgvwllNpg&lt;/ref&gt;.  Frederick Mayer not only added to the negative branding of fracking and its potential environmental impacts, but also highlighted the fact that even environmental groups are not doing as much as they should to help.  Describing himself as a disabled veteran, while having nothing to do with the issue, Mayer also associates fracking with harming vulnerable groups.

==A Political Case Study==
For decades, many federal policy breaks have been granted to oil and gas companies in response to “industrial, legislative and lobbying pressures&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hoggan, J., DeMelle, B., Gelbspan, R., &amp; Littlemore, R. (n.d.). Gas politics are polluted [Blog post]. Retrieved from DeSmogBlog website: http://www.desmogblog.com/fracking-the-future/politics.html#footnote-22309-22 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Colborn, T., Kwiatkowski, C., Schultz, K., &amp; Bachran, M. (2011). Natural gas operations from a public health perspective. International Journal of Human and Ecological Risk Assessment.  &lt;/ref&gt;.  The [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_Policy_Act_of_2005 Energy Policy Act of 2005] included a controversial amendment that exempted hydraulic fracturing from part of the [http://water.epa.gov/lawsregs/rulesregs/sdwa/index.cfm Safe Drinking Water Act] (SDWA). The 2005 Act “inserted new language to exempt ‘the underground injection of fluids or propping agents (other than diesel fuels) pursuant to hydraulic fracturing operations related to oil, gas, or geothermal production activities'”&lt;ref&gt;United States Environmental Protection Agency. (n.d.) Regulation of hydraulic fracturing under the safe drinking water act. Retrieved from http://water.epa.gov/type/groundwater/uic/class2/hydraulicfracturing/wells_hydroreg.cfm &lt;/ref&gt;.  This amendment became known as the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halliburton Halliburton] Loophole, named after one of the largest oil producers in the world.

While the Halliburton Loophole relieves the Federal Government of regulating hydraulic fracturing, states are still free to impose regulations as they see fit.  In June, 2011 the Ohio State Senate passed Senate Bill 315 granting the ODNR authority to regulate state-wide hydraulic fracturing&lt;ref&gt;Department of Natural Resources, Senate Bill 315 - Improving regulatory framework, S. 2012 (Ohio 2012). Retrieved from https://www.dnr.state.oh.us/tabid/23947/Default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;.  ODNR Director James Zehringer championed the Bill saying, “If Ohioans lose confidence in our ability to protect public health and safety, this potential boom will fizzle”&lt;ref&gt;Hearings on 315 before the House Public Utilities Commitee, 2012 Gen. Assem. (Ohio 2012) (testimony of James Zehringer).&lt;/ref&gt;.  While both ODNR and large oil companies are strong supporters of hydraulic fracturing, Zehringer recognizes that without social support, the technology cannot be successful.  He skillfully brands the ODNR as an organization that is concerned with citizen well-being in an attempt to increase acceptance of the technology, particularly by the opposition.

== Conclusions ==
One of the most important factors in determining public acceptance of a technology is the way in which relevant social groups develop a brand through use of language and imagery.  Participants in debates will try to brand the technology in a way that suits their opinions and needs.  Opponents have branded the word ''fracking'' and played off of its negative sound to brand the technology as a whole.  Supporters have tried to invoke the use of other words and imagery to brand the technology in a more positive light.  Supporters are not trying to rebrand the term ''fracking'', but instead to associate it with different language.  Once a brand has been established, rebranding societal perception of a technology is very difficult.

==Opportunities for Further Study==
Future teams may be interested in augmenting this chapter by further investigating political outcomes of this technology.  Court cases and legislation, such as the 1997 case of LEAF vs. EPA or the defeat of the 2009 NAT GAS Senate bill, may prove to be areas of great interest within the socio-technical interface of hydraulic fracturing.  It may also be of interest to research the effect of language on the success of legislation.  Additionally, future teams may look into other terms used to describe this technology.

*As of 2006, one third of all nations suffered from clean water scarcity,
&lt;ref name=&quot;uneca&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Management Options to Enhance Survival and Growth|url=http://www.uneca.org/awich/Water%20in%20Africa.pdf|accessdate=18 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Water scarcity''' or [[Physical water scarcity|lack of safe drinking water]] is one of the world's leading problems affecting more than 1.1 billion people globally, meaning that one in every six people lacks access to safe [[drinking water]].
&lt;ref name=&quot;bpn&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=The Facts About The Global Drinking Water Crisis|url=http://blueplanetnetwork.org/water/facts|year=2010|accessdate=18 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation]] set up by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) and [[UNICEF|United Nations Children’s Fund]] (UNICEF) defines safe drinking water as &quot;water with microbial, chemical and physical characteristics that meets WHO guidelines or national standards on drinking water quality.&quot;

* With a complete lack of water, humans can on average only live up to 3 to 5 days.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Water Page|url=http://www.thewaterpage.com/live-without-water.htm|accessdate=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This often forces those living in water deprived regions to turn to unsafe water resources, which then contributes to the spread of [[waterborne diseases]] including [[malaria]], [[typhoid fever]], [[cholera]], [[dysentery]] and [[diarrhea]], and can lead to diseases such as [[trachoma]], plague, and [[typhus]].
&lt;ref name=WHO&gt;{{cite web|title=10 Facts About Water Scarcity|url=http://www.who.int/features/factfiles/water/en/|accessdate=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Additionally, water scarcity causes many people to store water in their households, which increases the risk of household water contamination and incidents of malaria and dengue fever spread by mosquitos.&lt;ref name=WHO/&gt;
These waterborne diseases are not usually found in developed countries because of sophisticated [[water treatment]] systems that filter and chlorinate water, but natural, untreated water sources often contain tiny disease-carrying worms and bacteria.
&lt;ref name=WS&gt;{{cite web|title=Water Scarcity: The Importance of Water &amp; Access|url=http://thewaterproject.org/water_scarcity.asp|accessdate=18 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although many of these waterborne sicknesses are treatable and preventable, they are nonetheless one of the leading causes of disease and death in the world. Globally, 2.2 million people die each year from diarrhea-related disease, and at any given time fifty percent of all hospital beds in the world are occupied by patients suffering from water-related diseases.&lt;ref name=bpn /&gt; 

* Efforts made by the United Nations with the [[Millennium Development Goals]] have targeted water scarcity globally. The compiled list includes eight international development goals, seven of which are directly impacted by water scarcity. Access to water affects poverty, food scarcity, educational attainment, social and economic capital of women, livelihood security, disease, and human and environmental health.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Decade for Action Water for Life 2005-2015: Water Scarcity|url=http://www.un.org/waterforlifedecade/scarcity.shtml|accessdate=1 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Because addressing the issue of water is so integral to reaching the MDGs, one of the sub-goals includes halving the proportion of the globe’s population without sustainable access to safe drinking water by 2015. In March 2012, the UN announced that this goal has been met almost four years in advance, suggesting that global efforts to reduce water scarcity are on a successful trend.
&lt;ref name=remarks&gt;{{cite web|title=Remarks in Honor of World Water Day|url=http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2012/03/186640.htm|accessdate=1 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* As one of the five permanent members of the [[United Nations Security Council]], the United States plays an integral role in promoting solutions to aid with clean water scarcity. One of many efforts include [[w:USAID|USAID’s]] [[WASH]]- the WASH for Life partnership with the Gates Foundation- that works to promote water, sanitation, and hygiene. With this, the U.S. &quot;will identify, test, and scale up evidence-based approaches for delivering these services to people in some of the poorest regions&quot;. &lt;ref name=remarks/&gt;
Additionally, in March 2012, Hillary Clinton announced the U.S. Water Partnership, which will bring together people from the private sector, the philanthropic community, non-governmental organizations, academics, experts, and the government in an attempt to look for system-wide solutions. &lt;ref name=remarks/&gt;
The technologies and ability to tackle the issue of water scarcity and cleanliness are present, but it is highly a matter of accessibility. Thus, the partnership will aim at making these solutions available and obtainable at a local level.

===Can be useful for '''Drinking water/''' new page===

* Moving beyond sanitary waste disposal and pumps, clean water technology can now be found in the form of drinking straw filtration. Used as solution by Water Is Life, the straw is small, portable, and each $10. &lt;ref name=WIL/&gt;
The filtration device is designed to eliminate waterborne diseases, and as a result provide safe drinking water for one person for one year. &lt;ref name=WIL/&gt;

* Other solutions to clean water scarcity issues have focused on innovative pump systems, including hand-pumps, Water for People’s “[[w:Roundabout PlayPump|Play Pumps]]”,&lt;ref name=WFP/&gt; and Pump Aid’s “Elephant Pumps”. &lt;ref name=PA/&gt;
All three designs are built to aid communities in drawing clean water from wells. The hand pump is the most basic and simple to repair, with replacement parts easily found. &lt;ref name=LWI/&gt;
Using a more creative approach, Play Pumps combine child’s play with clean water extraction through the use of playground equipment, called a roundabout. The idea behind this is as children play on the roundabout, water will simultaneously be pumped from a reservoir tank to either toilets, hand-washing stations, or for drinking water. &lt;ref name=PA/&gt;
Alternatively, Elephant Pumps are just extremely simple hand water pumps. After a well is prepared, a rope-pump mechanism is installed that is easy to maintain, uses locally sourced parts, and can be up and running in the time span of about a week. &lt;ref name=PA/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Web authoring software ==

Website creation has changed from simply writing some Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) code and loading to the World Wide Web. HTML is what the first website developers had to use and, while it worked, by itself it is cumbersome and tedious. It still serves a major role in web site design and is the main markup language for displaying web pages and other information that can be displayed in a web browser. However, the growing demand for complicated and complex websites has grown to help foster the creation of Web Authoring Software.  Website creation now encompasses a range of skills including graphic design, web design, programming, system integration, audio editing and video editing.
Larger commercial web sites use Content Management Systems (CMS) such as Drupal&lt;ref&gt;
Drupal http://drupal.org/home
&lt;/ref&gt;
and Joomla&lt;ref&gt;
Joomla http://joomla.co.uk/
&lt;/ref&gt;
(open source), Adobes’ Dreamweaver (commercial software) and WordPress&lt;ref&gt;
WordPress http://wordpress.org/
&lt;/ref&gt;
(also open source).
These Web authoring software programs encompass a variety of programming tools and languages including PHP, Ruby on Rails and JavaScript, and WYSIWYG HTML editors to provide custom features quickly to a website under construction.
Web authoring software is software used by web designers and developers to create applications and websites across multiple platforms including tablets and browsers. A primary purpose of using Web authoring software is to utilize web standards based framework for websites that flow easily across multiple screens. Web authoring software automates and organizes many of the tasks and steps needed to put together a well thought out website. Web site prototypes are created using artwork, video, audio, and text, using accepted standards for web page creation.

A key feature of Web authoring software is the ability to layout semantic web design using CSS inspectors and tools.
A CSS page layout uses the Cascading Style Sheets format, rather than traditional HTML tables or frames, to organize the content on a web page. The basic building block of the CSS layout is the &quot;div tag&quot;—an HTML tag that in most cases acts as a container for text, images, and other page elements. When you create a CSS layout, you place div tags on the page, add content to them, and position them in various places. Unlike table cells, which are restricted to existing somewhere within the rows and columns of a table, div tags can appear anywhere on a web page. Website developers position div tags by specifying floats, paddings, and margins, the preferred methods by today’s web standards. 

Commercial Web authoring software (for instance Dreamweaver CS6)&lt;ref&gt;
Dreamweaver http://helpx.adobe.com/dreamweaver.html
&lt;/ref&gt;
eliminates having to make CSS layouts from scratch.
This may be very desirable because unaided CSS layout can be very time-consuming and be difficult because there are so many ways to do it.
Simple two-column CSS layout may be accomplished by setting floats, margins, paddings, and other CSS properties in a nearly infinite number of combinations.
CSS layouts made from scratch will not display properly in some browsers{{fact}}. Dreamweaver allows the building of pages with CSS layouts by providing 16 pre-designed layouts that work across different browsers.

Unmerged history to [[Drinking water/Scarcity/Australia]] so far. Its better to rewrite, based on references used, . Merging will take a lot of mess over to the subarticle, unless the exact contributors to this text can be history merged.
* In [[Australia]] there is competition for the resources of the Darling River system between [[Queensland]], [[New South Wales]] and [[South Australia]]. In the [[Macquarie Marshes]] of NSW [[grazing]] and [[irrigation]] interests compete for water flowing to the marshes. The [[Snowy Mountains Scheme]] diverted water from the [[Snowy River]] to the [[Murray River]] and the [[Murrumbidgee River]] for the benefit of irrigators and [[electricity]] generation through [[hydro-electric power]]. During recent years government has taken action to increase [[environmental flows]] to the Snowy in spite of severe drought in the [[Murray Darling Basin]]. The Australian Government has implemented buy-backs of water allocations, or properties with water allocations, to endeavour to increase environmental flows.

* In [[Victoria, Australia]] a proposed pipeline from the [[Goulburn Valley]] to [[Melbourne, Victoria|Melbourne]] has led to protests by farmers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,23069045-5010020,00.html Retrieved 2009-01-19&lt;/ref&gt;

* By far the largest part of [[Australia]] is [[Deserts of Australia|desert]] or semi-arid lands commonly known as the [[outback]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">This helps with the understanding of hydroculture related plant propagation.

==Stem cutting==
Cut a green branch off of the desired plant above a node with a sterile cutting utensil. On the cut branch, trim off one or both sides, up to the length of next node. There should be one or two strips of bark running the length from below the bottom most node to the bottom of the cutting. Wet and dip this in rooting hormone if desired. Place the cutting into the aggregate. The more leaf area the cutting has, the more chances that the plant dries out, as a green stem is all that is necessary. Proper drainage is required: a substrate that has a higher water to air ratio attracts an-aerobic conditions and mold.

There are ways of improving the growth of stem cutting propagations. Intensifying light allows cuttings to root and sprout faster, apart from the concern that this could cause the propagation material distress.&lt;ref name=&quot;light cutting&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/research/2012/120123LopezBedding.html | title=Study shines light on ways to cut costs for greenhouse growers | publisher=Purdue University | work=Lopez and Currey | date=January 23, 2012 | accessdate=July 31, 2012 | author=Wallheimer, Brian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Azalea cuttings can be mildly heated in water to disinfect it from the fungus pathogen Rhizoctonia, and this could potentially be used for other plants.&lt;ref name=&quot;water treatment&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://phys.org/news180889087.html#nRlv | title=Hot Water Treatment Eliminates Rhizoctonia from Azalea Cuttings | publisher=Physorg | work=USDA Agricultural Research Service | date=December 24, 2009 | accessdate=July 31, 2012 | author=Yao, Stephanie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Seeds, bulbs and tubers==
Large seeds, bulbs and tubers (potatoes, avocado seeds) proved to be hardier than smaller propagation material. Propagation material is very delicate to minute water qualities. These minute water qualities are trivial to aquatic animal health. Ideally, keep the fish and other aquatic animals stress-free.

Some seeds need to have their coating removed, because it is susceptible to rot. Removing the seed coat, on certain species, also allows for quicker propagation.

==Grafting==
{{see|w:Grafting}}
[[w:Grafting|Grafting]] is not specific to hydroculture, but it may be used. A reason may be, to grow different varieties of a species of the same genus on one plant.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Beginnings==

The Earth was formed about 4.5 billion years ago as theorized by the Big Bang. Life did not arise on the primordial earth due to reducing conditions and super-hot climates. After billions of years; however, signs of molecules began to arise. It was not until 3.9 billion years ago did these molecules begin to form into protobionts. The early reducing atmosphere and conditions on earth also promoted organic synthesis. Energy was everywhere on earth due to climate, lightning, ultra-violet rays and volcanoes. The Oparin-Haldane hypothesis was proposed to explain earth's early conditions and help shed light on how the first molecules were formed. Other theories have hypothesized that the Earth could have been bombarded by asteriods that contained both D and L amino acids, but as billions of years passed the L-isomer amino acid predominated and is in all organisms today.

Evidence of Life's History: By studying fossils and through relative dating and absolute dating, geologists were able to establish a geologic record of the Earth’s history. Fossils are the remains of ancient life or activity. Types of fossils include imprint fossils, trace fossils, petrification, and amber. Relative dating provides a geologic time scale. The principle of superposition states that in sedimentary rocks, the highest stratum is the youngest and vice versa. Absolute dating is a technique that use radioactive isotopes and half life of elements to determine the actual ages of strata in geological column.     

The current geologic record divides Earth’s history into three eons: the Archaean, Proterozoic, and Phanerozoic eons. The Archaean and Proterozoic eons lasted approximately 4 billion years together leaving the Phanerozoic eon to encompass the most recent 500 million years of Earth’s history [2]. 

The Phanerozoic eon represents most of the time for the existence of animals on Earth. This eon is split into three eras on the geologic record: the Paleozoic, Mesozoic, and Cenozoic eras.

==Early Earth - Precambrian Era (4.5 Billion Years ago - 545 Million Years Ago)==

Conditions on the earth before the Cambrian explosion and prior to the three domains of life we know today were very extreme and harsh. However, protobionts (organic molecules that formed abiotically) began to form through time and were theorized to be the first molecules, and the precursor to the prokaryotic cells. After a few billion years prokaryotic cells formed and along with these prokaryotes, cyanobacteria began to grow and photosynthesize, thus releasing oxygen into the atmosphere and changing the oxygen level of the earth. Prior to this earth had little to no oxygen. With newly diversified cells, bacteria began to conjugate. Conjugation of bacteria over time therefore led to single celled eukaryotes, the protist. As protist began to replicate and grow, multicellular eukaryotes began to arise and led to multicellular organisms. These conditions over time paved way for the massive Cambrian explosion where diversity of life on a massive scale took place.

Precambrium - Archean: 3.5 bya (billions years ago) - oldest fossils (of bacteria) found. There were only prokaryotes for the first 1.5 billions years of life. Fossil of cyanobacteria were found, they were oxygenic and could carry out photosynthesis. 2.7 bya - atmosphere accumulated Oxygen and iron precipitated out of the oceans. &lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Reece. &quot;Biology- 8th Ed..&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Precambrium - Proterozoic: 1.9 bya - oldest Eukaryotes found. 1.2bya - multicellular eukaryotes -alga- found. 700mya, there were diverse algae and soft-bodied animals. 650mya - there was a massive glacier (snowball earth) cooling of earth. 540mya - Cambrian explosion - diverse animals and algae come about. &lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Reece. &quot;Biology- 8th Ed..&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Oxygen Revolution==

During Earth’s history, there were many key events that resulted in major evolutions. One such event was the “oxygen revolution”. Most of the oxygen gas in the atmosphere was of a biological origin, particularly from the water-splitting step of photosynthesis in ancient cyanobacteria. The oxygen gas was first dissolved by the surrounding water. The oxygen gas then started to react with dissolved iron once the concentration of oxygen was high enough. This reaction produced iron oxide which precipitated to form sediments. As the oxygen gas concentration kept rising, the seas and lakes soon became saturated with oxygen gas and the oxygen started to “gas out” of the water and into the atmosphere [2]. The amount of atmospheric oxygen gas was increasing at a gradual rate between 2.3 and 2.7 billion years ago; however, the rate of oxygen gas being added to the atmosphere spiked up rapidly causing an increase of 1% to 10% of its present level [2]. This is known as the “oxygen revolution” and it had a huge impact of the life inhabiting Earth at the time. Many prokaryotic groups became extinct due to oxygen being toxic to these groups by attacking chemical bonds, inhibiting enzymes, and damaging the cells. The species that survived did so by inhabiting an anaerobic environment. Diverse adaptations also resulted from this revolution, one of which was cellular respiration. The oxygen revolution also brought about the first eukaryotes. The origin of the eukaryotes can be further explained by the endosymbiont theory.

==Paleozic Era (545 Million Years Ago - 251 Million Years Ago)==

The Paleozice Era is marked by the cambrian explosion in which organismic diversification exploded, forming different life forms on earth. Due to lack of a fossil record prior to the Paleozic era, little can be said about when the cambrian explosion actually occured but new novelty structures such as jaws,appendages, bones, and other features on today's organisms began to form. There were also marine diversification. The first vertebrates appeared 525 mya. THere were invasion of land by many. The first land plants and fungi formed 460mya. THe first land animal Arthropods appeared. Following this, the first insects was found 396mya. Furthermore, the first land vertebrate (amphibians) appeared 360mya. The appearance of amniotes (terresterial animal) in the late Paleozoic. &lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Reece. &quot;Biology- 8th Ed..&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Also during this time the earth due to continental drift began to move together and form a supercontinent, pangea. There were a reduction of shallow coastal habitats and along came cold harsh interior climates. However, the Paleozoic Era ended with a mass extinction termed the Permian Crisis. During the Permian Period about 251 million years ago, 96% of species went extinct. This occurred because massive volcanic eruptions released SO2 and CO2, causing global warming feedback. This massive release of methane by the underwater volcanoes led to a change in ocean circulation and an anoxic ocean, or an ocean depleted of oxygen. &lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Reece. &quot;Biology- 8th Ed..&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mesozoic Era (251 - 65 Million Years ago)==

The Mesozoic era, also known as the age of the dinosaurs shows more growth and diversification in organisms. Gymnosperms appeared in the early Mesozoic. During the mid-mesozoic, dinosaurs were introduced. The late Jurassic introduced birds. Origin of mammals are from early Mesozoic. 127 mya angiosperms (flowering plants) appeared. Also during this time the earth due to continental drift Pangea began to break. The end of the Mesozoic era is also marked with another mass extinction (especially of dinosaurs),the Cretaceous Crisis, theorized to have been caused by a gigantic asteroid, hitting the area of Yucatan. Layers of iridium are found around this area, thus proving that there could have been a catastrophic asteroid hitting this area affecting the plants and organisms that lived around that area during that time. The global effects included (1) crustal material ejected into stratosphere, (2) widespread fires nearer to impact, (3) reduced photosynthesis for several years, and (4) reduced global temperatures.

==Cenozoic Era(65 Million Years Ago - Present)==

The Cenozoic also known as the age of mammals began after the extinction of all the dinosaurs (except birds). The first grass appeared 40mya. At the beginning of Pleistocene, 2mya, there were glaciations. Human evolution occured during this time. Homo-sapiens as we know today began to populate the earth 100,000 years ago. There are many misconceptions: our ancestors are not chimps, not half-stooped cave dwellers, and are not contemporaries of dinosaurs.

^-^-^-To use HELP, supply a word or value as its
^-^-^-argument:
^-^-^-
^-^-^-^-help insert
^-^-^-^-help system
^-^-^-^-help system/script

^-^-^-To view all words that match a pattern use a
^-^-^-string or partial word:

^-^-^-^-help &quot;path&quot;
^-^-^-^-help to-

^-^-^-To see words with values of a specific datatype:

^-^-^-^-help native!
^-^-^-^-help datatype!

^-^-^-Word completion:

^-^-^-^-The command line can perform word
^-^-^-^-completion. Type a few chars and press TAB
^-^-^-^-to complete the word. If nothing happens,
^-^-^-^-there may be more than one word that
^-^-^-^-matches. Press TAB again to see choices.

^-^-^-^-Local filenames can also be completed.
^-^-^-^-Begin the filename with a %.

      <comment>/* Sea water still */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Water may be boiled away, then condensed to form pure water as [[w:distillation|distillation]]. The water must be condensed high from the water source. This may be useful for desalinating water. Volatile substances in the water may evaporate along with this water. The builder and user are responsible for further research and for safety.

==Glass bottle==
A glass bottle may be heated where it is curved outward, ''only'' if water is inside of it. Water's boiling point is 100°C, so the water temperature cannot get higher than this (unless it is [[w:superheated|superheated]] by reheating vapor with a secondary heat source). This takes heat away from the glass bottle, provided the heated air is allowed to escape around, not getting trapped in an air pocket outside of the bottle. If done properly, the glass bottle is prevented from overheating, which would break the glass. Once the water is boiled away, there will be nothing to keep the container just above 100°C, and the glass will break, creating a hazard. Safety is important to not get scalds, cause a fire or break glass. Then [[Drinking water/Distillation#vapor collection|collect water vapor]].

==Cooking container==
(stainless steel container; aluminum material is unfavorable)

==Solar distillation==
Solar distillation or [[w:Solar humidification|solar humidification-dehumidification method (HDH)]] is, as its name implies, useful for distilling water. A [[w:solar still|solar still]] and [[w:Multiple-effect humidification|multiple effect humidifcation]] are two methods of solar distillation.
[[File:Evapo still.svg|150px|right]]

===Solar still===
A '''solar still''' is a simple way of [[w:distillation|distilling]] water, using the heat of the sun to drive evaporation from humid soil, and ambient air to cool a condenser film. Two basic types of solar stills are box and pit stills. In a solar still, impure water is contained outside the collector, where it is evaporated by sunlight shining through clear plastic. The pure [[w:water vapour|water vapour]] condenses on the cool inside plastic surface and drips down from the weighted low point, where it is collected and removed. The box type is more sophisticated. The basic principles of solar water distillation are simple yet effective, as distillation replicates the way nature makes rain. The sun's energy heats water to the point of evaporation. As the water evaporates, water vapor rises, condensing on the glass surface for collection. This process removes impurities such as salts and heavy metals as well as eliminates microbiological organisms. The end result is water cleaner than the purest rainwater.

Solar stills are used in cases where rain, piped, or well water is impractical, such as in remote homes or during power outages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Anjaneyulu|first=L.|coauthors=Kumar, E. Arun; Sankannavar, Ravi; Rao, K. Kesava|title=Defluoridation of Drinking Water and Rainwater Harvesting Using a Solar Still|journal=Industrial &amp; Engineering Chemistry Research|date=13 June 2012|volume=51|issue=23|pages=8040–8048|doi=10.1021/ie201692q|url=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ie201692q}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[w:Florida|Florida]] and other [[w:hurricane|hurricane]] target areas that frequently lose power for a few days, solar distillation can provide an alternate source of clean water.

Solar stills are occasionally used on a longer term basis in [[w:developing world|developing world]] settings. However, depending on environmental conditions, they usually produce a relatively small amount of water, and even less where the source is saline or [[w:brakish|brackish]]. If the source is inadequate, a compromise method is to mix the distilled water with the brackish or saline water purified with other methods - this gives a more adequate quantity and re-introduces the other source contaminants, while still lowering the salinity, and improving the taste.
The [[w:Water Pyramid|Water Pyramid]] is a larger version, which uses an inflatable dome as the condensing surface and can be used in tropical, rural areas.

Knowing how to put together a solar still can prove to be a useful [[w:Survival skills|survival skill]] and could provide an important means of obtaining potable water in the event of a wilderness emergency.  Nevertheless, under typical conditions makeshift solar stills rarely produce enough water for long-term survival, and the sweat expended in building one can easily exceed its daily output.  Solar stills can extract water from moisture in the ground but to increase the amount of moisture available to a solar still, water (fresh or [[w:saline water|saline]]) can be added inside or along the edges of the still.  Where no water sources are readily available, shredded vegetation, wet soil/sand, urine or covered faeces, can be used inside the pit.  If only the natural soil moisture is used, the pit must eventually be moved as the productivity drops.  To prevent losing moisture by taking apart the still to retrieve collected water a length of plastic tubing can be used to sip water as it accumulates.

====Sea water still====
In 1952 the US military developed a portable solar still for pilots stranded on the ocean which comprised a large inflatable 24 inch plastic ball which floated on the ocean with a tube coming out the side. A separate plastic bag hangs from attachment points on the outer bag. Seawater is poured into the inner bag from an opening in the ball's neck.  Fresh water is taken out by the pilot using the side tube which leads to bottom of the large inflatable ball.  It was stated in magazine articles that on a good day 2.5 quarts of fresh water could be produced.  On an overcast day, 1.5 quarts was produced.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=8dwDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA113&amp;dq=1954+Popular+Mechanics+January&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=lYK0T7T1Es2dgQe5iMgH&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAjgy#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true &quot;Sea Water Still.&quot;] ''Popular Mechanics'', February 1952, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar sea water stills are included in some [[w:liferaft|liferaft]] [[w:survival kit|survival kits]], though manual [[w:reverse osmosis|reverse osmosis]] desalinators have mostly replaced them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=a0f2e9cd317c57ab0333b5da36c95319&amp;tab=core&amp;_cview=0 |title=Manual Reverse Osmosis Desalinator - NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD SOLE SOURCE, USAF |first= |last=|work=fbo.gov |year=2012 [last update] |accessdate=July 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multiple-effect humidification===
'''Multiple-effect humidification''' (MEH) uses multiple [[w:evaporation|evaporation]]-[[w:condensation|condensation]] cycles at separate [[w:temperature|temperature]] levels to minimize the total energy consumption of solar humidification processes. &lt;ref name=&quot;MEH&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://mediatum2.ub.tum.de/node?id=601861 | title=Multiple Effect Humidification Dehumidification at ambient pressure: Optimisation and applications | publisher=Technical University of Munich | date=2002 | accessdate=June 6, 2008 | author=Müller-Holst, Hendrik}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vapor collection==
The water vapor should be collected safely, and be mindful of volatile substances. Alcohol and certain volatile substances have a lower boiling point than water, so be careful that nothing poisonous also condenses into the end water supply.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Challenges and Opportunities in Using the Internet to Realize Democracy in Egypt=

by Nahed Amin Azab

Management Information Systems, Department of Management, The American University in Cairo, Egypt

Volume 2012 (2012), Article ID 547105, Journal of North African Research in Business, 10 pages, DOI: 10.5171/2012.547105

==Abstract==

There is a widespread belief that the Internet provides real opportunities for democratization and political transformation, especially in authoritarian regimes characterized by a strong restriction on freedom of speech and expression and inability of civic engagement and participation. Such role has been clearly witnessed with the rise of the Arab spring in general, and in Egypt in particular. During the 18 days of the Egyptian revolution starting on 25 January 2011, and afterwards, the Internet proved to be an important tool in mobilizing people, coordinating between protestors and documenting and publishing facts that occurred on the ground during the revolution. However, such optimistic view cannot be supported unconditionally due to several reasons related to the uniqueness of each country. This paper therefore attempts to critically examine the potential of the Internet on the political transformation in Egypt taking into consideration a full context covering economical, political, technological and social dimensions. Studying these various aspects would highlight the challenges and opportunities that affect the Internet in changing the political situation during the transitional period the country is going through.

==Introduction==
 
There is growing evidence that the Internet has an influence on identity development and on civic communication and participation (Wyn et al., 2005; Metcalf, 2008). Beside easy access to the news, the Internet allows people to read others’ reviews and to send feedback comments on the news they read. Citizens’ participation was more encouraged due to the emergence of ‘Web 2.0’ technologies, such as blogs, podcasts and social networking websites, which blurred the boundaries between publisher and reader. Any user has the chance to be a message receiver or sender during any given communication cycle (Williams, 1998, Boczkowski, 2004). By enabling individuals to create and publish content, such technologies promote collaboration, ownership, empowerment (Boulos and Wheelert 2007; Christensen et al., 2002; Crespo 2007) and the ability to express opinions and be heard. Boulos and Wheelert (2007) and Lefebvre (2007) argue that this in turn could result in increasing flexibility and democracy.
 

Seeking to reach democracy, the youth who initiated the Arab spring, especially in Tunisia, Egypt and Yemen, have relied on the Internet in disseminating news and philosophies of their revolutions, and in mobilizing people in their countries. Such initiatives were recognized and appreciated worldwide as some of revolutions’ leaders were nominated for peace prizes, such as Nobel from Switzerland, Sakharov by the European parliament and Anna Politkovskaya from Russia. The role played by the Internet in the Egyptian revolution triggers the need to question whether it would contribute negatively or positively in reaching democracy during and after this transitional period.
 
This paper starts by reviewing the literature discussing the relation between the Internet and democracy. Next, the paper presents different means to use the Internet in politics, and examines the applicability of these means in Egypt and their potential in assisting the country in its path towards democracy at a crucial phase during which the first democratically elected parliament has just held its opening session on the 23rd of January, only 2 days before the passing of the first year of the Egyptian revolution. 
 
==The Internet and Democracy ==

There is a growing controversy related to the ability of the Internet in assisting developing countries in fostering democracy. Some researchers see that the Internet can contribute to a great extent into such direction. For example, Milner (2006) argues that Internet capabilities (easy, broad, cheap access and sharing of information) allow for building and mobilizing opposition groups, which impose threat on autocratic regimes. Being aware of that strong effect of the Internet, such regimes do not encourage Internet adoption compared to democratic ones (Norris, 2001). 
 
Furthermore, the Internet has the potential to realize the concept of the “public sphere” as defined by Jürgen Habermas (1974): a place where communities could jointly form public opinions in an environment removed from the government or economy. On the other side, Downey and Fenton (2003) quote the expression “bad civil society” from Chambers and Kopstein (2001) described as being capable of creating a counter public sphere that could alter democratic public dialogue. Lunat (2008) notes that the Internet leads in several cases in developing countries to promoting violence due to the ‘fragile structure’ of public spheres in these communities. In fact, several reasons affect negatively the Internet potential in promoting democracy in developing countries: (i) limited Internet accessibility by many sectors in the society (Khiabany, 2009) and its availability to extremists (Dean (2003); (ii) absence of well established and sustainable online political entities (Lunat, 2008); (iii) being an additional media type, the Internet is usually in line with the existing political status enabling traditional authorities to increase their political power (Papacharissi, 2002); (iv) tracking and censorship by existing (and most probably autocratic) regimes (Albirini, 2008). As such, Albirini (2008) criticizes the optimistic view that assumes that the Internet can modify the dictatorial structure of developing countries describing this as an ‘illusion’.
 
==Internet Political Channels==

Several World Wide Web applications encouraged citizens to engage into politics, especially online newspapers, social network sites (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, MySpace, LinkedIn, etc.) and blogs. The Internet made a remarkable shift in the newspaper industry since the creation of the first non-print in 1995. The evolution of online papers on the web has provided a window for the emergence of new content-creation regimes, and allowed the examination of broader patterns in the construction of information on the Internet, multimedia developments being an example (Boczkowski, 2004; Molina, 1997). Starting from 1995, the Web proved to be the “electronic publishing environment of choice” for publishing newspapers (Garrison, 1997; Martin and Hansen, 1998; Molina, 1997). More than 175 US dailies were published on the Web by the end of 1995, growing to over 750 three years later (Newspaper Association of America, 1998; Editor and Publisher, 1996). In a survey of US online newspapers, Peng et al. (1999) conclude that the top three reasons for publishing on the Web versus other options are (1) availability of a large number of readers worldwide (57%), (2) ease of publishing  (27%), and (3) superior graphical presentation (15%). 
 
Most newspapers and news portals currently provide links to several social networks as an extended channel to foster more participation among their readers. Since the Howard Dean campaign on Facebook in 2004, the Internet was recognized as a powerful tool in gauging the interest and opinion of the public in the political process, as well as communicating efficiently with supporters (Westling, 2007). The most widely used social networking site is Facebook, which covers an increasing and broader number of networks (academic institutions, cities, organizations, clubs, etc.) of different geographic and ideological aspects, reaching more than 500 million members in 2010 (Facebook Press Room, October 2010).
 
Facebook provides political actors with an efficient and inexpensive tool to disseminate their messages to a wide audience, to mobilize and organize thousands of supporters and to measure public opinion. One of the main causes of the success of Barack Obama’s presidential campaign in 2008 was the resourceful and creative use of Facebook by his then-campaign-manager David Plouffe, pulling out young, disenfranchised voters to the polls. Even before Barack Obama announced his candidacy for president, the Facebook group “Barack Obama for President in 2008” had accumulated over 50,000 members. Another group, “Barack Obama (One Million Strong for Barack)” gathered 200,000 members in less than three weeks (Goldfarb, 2007), reaching 325,000 by April 2007. Obama also had strong presence on other social websites including MySpace, Twitter, MyBatanga, MiGente and AsianAve. Obama’s opponent John McCain did not give similar focus to social networks and had fewer than 200,000 supporters on Facebook (Terhune, 2008). The increasing role of Facebook in presidential campaigns can clearly be seen by noting that Howard Dean ended up with over 190,000 members in his Meetup.com group at the end of his 2004 presidential primary campaign (Trippi, 2004), versus more than 3 million supporters for Obama (DWSMG, 2008).
 
In addition to online newspapers and social network websites, political blogs are seen as an increasingly powerful form of journalism on the Internet (Farrell and Drezner, 2008), expanding media freedom (Coleman, 2005) and shaping democracy outside the mass media and conventional party politics (Gillmor, 2003). They should be seen as democratic listening posts, enabling us to pick up signals of subjective expression. Blogs were recognized in 1997 with the launching of Scripting News, a website developed by Dave Winer (Schiano et al., 2004) (dubbed the “Father of Blogging”) (BBC News, 2007), recording his views on different topics, and the longest-running blog on the Internet in 2003 (Gillmor, 2003). Blogs are gaining a growing popularity among Internet users, particularly political ones, which receive thousands of hits daily (Schiano et al., 2004). Starting with the 2004 US Presidential campaign, blogs were clearly perceived by candidates, political parties and mainstream media as a powerful tool to monitor, publish, discuss, host breaking news and even create self-owned blogs (Adamic, 2005; Bahnisch, 2006; Bichard, 2006; Carlson, 2007; Kerbel and Bloom, 2005; Stromer-Galley &amp; Baker, 2006; Trammell, 2006; Baumer, 2010). There are several reasons that drive Internet users to create blogs: responding to readers’ requests, updating others about their lives and activities, thinking by writing, looking for others’ feedback, conveying opinions and convincing others, or merely reducing tension (Nardi et al., 2004). One of the main advantages of blogs lies in their asymmetric and “non-intrusive” nature, unlike emails or instant messages. This reduces the temper and intensity of interaction (Clark and Brennan, 1991). Feedback can be through blogs, other media, or face-to-face communication, all after some time has elapsed, which allows for deeper and less emotional interaction. Furthermore, people read blogs because they find up-to-date, genuine and sincere opinions compatible with their views (Johnson et al., 2007), independency and freedom in expressing beliefs, (Bruns, 2006; Lasica, 2002) as compared to the controlled and balanced nature, which characterizes media corporations (Metzger et al., 2003). Furthermore, politically interested Internet users see that blogs are more credible than other online sources (Johnson et al., 2007). 
 
==Internet and Politics in Egypt==

Even though the Internet started in Egypt in 1993, interest in using the Internet in politics has become clearly apparent since 2008, when a Facebook page was created by the group &quot;6th of April Youth&quot;, to call for a labor strike against price hikes (Azab, 2012). Despite limited use of the Internet by political candidates to express their views and to interact with voters, a number of users head towards the Internet for other reasons: seeking political facts, commenting on political news and events, attempting to bring about partial change (Awad, 2010), gathering political views through polls and surveys and supervising the regime through publishing and disseminating corruptions and violations of human rights. 
 
Top Egyptian newspapers (e.g., AlAhram, AlMasryAlyoum, AlShorouk, AlDostor, etc.) have created not only e-newspapers publishing the same content as their corresponding traditional ones, but also their Internet portals to provide continuous updated content around the clock. Social networks, especially Facebook and Twitter, are used extensively in politics in Egypt. One of the most influential Facebook pages is “We are All Khaled Said”, which was created before the revolution on 6 June 2010. At that date, Khaled Said, a 28 year-old young man from Alexandria was found dead, with a common belief that he was tortured to death by two policemen (Abdellah and Blair, 2010). The page was created bearing his name, and attracted 4000 members to join in the first hour (ElShorouk Newspaper, 11 June 2010), with an increase of 1000 members each hour (Adel, 2010a). Several activists uploaded videos of the incident’s witnesses stating evidences contradictory to those expressed by the Ministry of Interior (ElShorouk Newspaper, 15 June 2010). As a result, the Attorney General was compelled to order the extraction of Said’s body and assign a committee to conduct a re-autopsy in order to explain the cause of death and injuries on the body (AbouElMaaref, 2010; Fouad et al., 2010). A remarkable online presence on social networks was also attributed to Dr. Mohamed ElBaradei, who was a prospect candidate “posing the most serious challenge” for the presidential position in Egypt in 2010 (BBC News, 2010; Broad, 2010). ElBaradei raised hope to the youth posing a possibility to commit political change through using Twitter and Facebook as channels for communications with citizens. “We are All Khaled Said”, &quot;6th of April Youth&quot; and “Mohamed ElBaradei” Facebook pages played an important role in initiating the Egyptian revolution (Ghuitas, 2011). As for blogs, many of them were recognized in expressing views opposed to existing regimes before and after the revolution (e.g., Wael Abbas, Mohamed Abdel Fattah, Michael Nabil, and Alaa Abdel Fattah). Some political blogs not only express ideas, but also include videos and photos to support them.
 
Realizing the increasing interest and position of the Internet in politics before and during the revolution, the current regime that started ruling in 11 February just after the 18-days revolution, is using Facebook to convey messages and interact with the Egyptian society and to obtain its feedback through reviews and polls.
 
==Discussion and Conclusion==

The previous section shows that the Internet different channels are used extensively in politics in Egypt. However, they are still insufficiently exploited in presidential campaigns. This could be due to the fact that the view is not clear, which made ElBaradei, who was a prospect candidate for presidential elections, decide to step down few months after freezing his campaign. Now that it has been formally announced that applications for presidential candidacy will start in March 2012, and that the elections is expected to take place before June 2012, the use of the Internet in the first democratic presidential elections ever in Egypt will be followed very closely and analyzed in depth.
 
It appears that the Internet was and is still playing an important role in influencing Egyptians from a political perspective, and that it can be used as a tool for promoting civic engagement. Internet users rely on the Internet in accessing political news and analysis, expressing opinions and monitoring the regime through publishing multimedia content. Smith and Rainie (2008) classify Internet’s behavior in politics into 3 main activities: accessing news, communicating with others and being interested in campaign information and active in disseminating it. As such, Egyptians use the Internet in performing the first 2 activities. 

One cannot deny the effect of the Internet on the happening of the Egyptian revolution. Even its censorship by the State Security Investigations (SSI) created an opportunity for youth groups to pass wrong messages about their intentions and meetings. Calls for demonstrations (started 18 months before the revolution) were transferred from the ‘virtual to the tangible world’, which were mostly efficient by social movements having a broad well-established existence (e.g., 6 April Movement that has a strong online presence as well as physical presence in 24 of the 29 Egyptian governorates) (Ezbawy, 2012; Earl and Kimport 2008; Al-Sayyid 2011). Even during the 5 days of the Internet cutoff performed by the authorities from 28 January to 1 February 2011, young Egyptians living outside Egypt created a Facebook group reporting events worldwide (Ezbawy, 2012).
 
Egyptians had high expectations that the Internet will bring about a major change towards democracy (clearly perceived by the increasing number of Internet and social network users, and by the results of several studies indicating increasing interest in politics among Internet users after the revolution). Unfortunately however, one year after the revolution, the Internet’s role is still falling behind expectations. Certainly, the Internet assisted the nation with the first steps into democracy through realizing a number of benefits on the ground, but was unable to build a critical mass capable of reaching the main objectives of the revolution and enabling activists to lead the political scene. Such fact was obvious in the first ‘democratic parliament elections’ that started in November 2011; relying mainly on the Internet in elections’ campaigns from different youth fragmented entities was not successful in influencing the mass. They still miss different dimensions of political aspects in Egypt, ‘in particular in the light of a very different configuration of political powers’ under-estimating other powerful means to disseminate ideas and pass agendas, such as mosques (Tadros, 2012). Consequently, Islamist groups represent 75% of the elected members in the new Parliament, a far higher percentage than their contribution to the Internet-based politics. The political situation currently in Egypt can be described as a ‘shallow’ form of democracy reflecting mostly a propagandistic approach. There is still a long way to formulate a true democratic framework enabling people to commit change formally (Shoukry, 2012). 
 
Shortcomings in the political status are due to several reasons in-line with the literature concerning the relation between the Internet and democracy in developing countries. First, Internet users constitute 25% of the population by educated groups since Egypt suffers from a high illiteracy rate. In addition, the Internet is providing a space for extremist groups and for electronic committees belonging to the authorities that are conveying messages against protesters and democratic movements. Second, as stated earlier, youth coalitions using the Internet are not yet combined into robust bodies. The third reason is attributed to the ruling regime following the same philosophy of the ousted one, is using the Internet as an additional channel to promote its ideas, and dissuade Internet content that does not. Thus, authorities are widely believed to be still imposing censorship on the Internet and are targeting Internet activists and jailing them, as was the case before the revolution. Lastly, youth activists are continuously dragged into various fights aiming to alter them from realizing the revolution objectives from the ruling regime and from political forces that ‘claim ownership of the revolution’ (Tadros, 2012), shifting their focus from constructing the required critical mass.
 
Nevertheless, the outlook is optimistic due to the high growth rate of Internet users and to the high percentage of youth in the Egyptian population; the best candidate to make change happen.  Moreover, traditional media such as TV and newspapers are increasingly relying on online user generated content in seeking political news and facts, which widens Internet exposure covering even non-Internet users.  In addition, since young political activists using the Internet do not yet possess a thorough knowledge in mobilization and building strong campaigns, they are definitely learning while practicing, and will gradually craft effective and creative new tactics. As Shoukry (2012) comments on the small percentage of youth activists who won in the first Egyptian parliamentary elections after the revolution: such results are based on the past, but the future will probably witness the foundation of new realities.

The Internet is definitely a potential mean for identity construction, which in turn mobilizes Civil Society leading to socio-political change (Habermas, 1996). Hence, Civil Society is presented with an unprecedented opportunity to formulate the Internet in developing countries while Internet diffusion is continuously on the rise (Petrazzini and Kibati (1999). It is thus recommended for youth coalitions to minimize the gap between the Internet and the ground through a continuous scanning and recognition of public opinion leading to dynamic reshaping of unified online and offline strategies. Online information sharing and communication are not sufficient to realize political reform and to bring democratic changes in developing countries. The Internet should be considered  a tool to support the creation of a physical environment for such transformation (Albirini, 2008). Thus, youth coalitions should reconsider using the Internet in collaborating with similar interest groups to form robust political entities.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==The ''polis'' or city-state==

''Polis'' (plural ''poleis''), literally means &quot;city&quot; in Greek; but the word &quot;city&quot; also included the terms state, citizenship and body of citizens. In fact, the Greek term which specifically meant &quot;city&quot; as a conglomerate of urban buildings and spaces was ''ásty''. In modern historiography, ''polis'' is normally used to indicate the ancient Greek city-states, like Classical Athens and its contemporaries, so ''polis'' is often translated as &quot;city-state.&quot; 

The term city-state which originated in English (alongside the German ''Stadtstaat'') does not fully translate the Greek term. The ''poleis'' were not like other primordial ancient city-states like Tyre or Sidon, which were ruled by a king or a small oligarchy, but rather a political entity ruled by its body of citizens. The traditional view of archaeologists that the appearance of urbanization at excavation sites could be read as a sufficient index for the development of a ''polis'' was criticised by François Polignac in 1984 and has not been taken for granted in recent decades. In fact, the term ''polis''  changed with the development of the governance center in the city to indicate state (which included its surrounding villages), and finally with the emergence of a citizenship notion between the land owners it came to describe the entire body of citizens.

==Archaic and classical ''polis''==

Basic and indicating elements of the archaic and classical ''polis'' were:
[[File:Acropolis091.jpg|thumb|Acropolis of Athens, a noted ''polis'' of classical Greece.]]

* Self-governance, autonomy and independence (city-state)
* Agora: the social hub and financial marketplace, on and around a centrally located large open space
* Acropolis: the citadel, inside which a temple had replaced the erstwhile Mycenaean ''anáktoron'' (palace) or ''mégaron'' (hall).
* Greek urban planning and architecture, public, religious, and private (see Hippodamian plan)
* Temples, altars and sacred precincts: one or more are dedicated to the poliouchos, the patron deity of the city; each polis kept its own particular festivals and customs (Political religion, as opposed to the individualized religion of the later antiquity). Priests and priestesses, although often drawn from certain families by tradition, did not form a separate collegiality or class: they were ordinary citizens who, on certain occasions, were called to perform certain functions.
* Gymnasia: a training facility for competitors in public games. It was also a place for socializing and engaging in intellectual pursuits.
* Theatres
* Walls: used for protection from invaders
* Coins: minted by the city, and bearing its symbols
* Colonies being founded by the oikistes of the metropolis
* Political life: it revolved around the sovereign Ekklesia (the assembly of all adult male citizens for deliberation and voting), the standing boule and other civic or judicial councils, the archons and other officials or magistrates elected either by vote or by lot, clubs, etc., and sometimes punctuated by stasis (civil strife between parties, factions or socioeconomic classes, e.g. aristocrats, oligarchs, democrats, tyrants, the wealthy, the poor, large or small landowners, etc.).There were practising the direct democracy.
* Publication of state functions: laws, decrees and major fiscal accounts were published, and criminal and civil trials were also held in public
* Synoecism, conurbation: Absorption of nearby villages and countryside, and the incorporation of their tribes into the substructure of the polis. Many of a polis' citizens would have lived in the suburbs or countryside. The Greeks did not regard the polis as a territorial grouping so much as a religious and political association: while the polis would control territory and colonies beyond the city itself, the polis would not simply consist of a geographical area. Most cities were composed of several tribes or phylai, which were in turn composed of phratries (common-ancestry lineages), and finally génea (extended families)
* Social classes and citizenship: Dwellers in the polis were generally divided into four types of inhabitants, with status typically determined by birth:
:
:* Citizens with full legal and political rights, i.e. adult free men born legitimately of citizen parents. They had the right to vote, be elected into office, bear arms, and the obligation to serve when at war.
:* Citizens without formal political rights, but full legal rights: the citizens' female relatives and underage children, whose political rights and interests were represented, and property held in trust, by their adult male relatives.
:* Citizens of other poleis who chose to reside elsewhere (the metics, μέτοικοι, métoikoi, literally &quot;transdwellers&quot;): though free-born and possessing full rights in their place of origin, had full legal rights but no political rights in their place of residence. Metics could not vote, could not be elected to office, could not bear arms and could not serve in war. They otherwise had full personal and property rights, albeit subject to taxation.
:* Slaves: chattel in full possession of their owner, and with no privileges other what their owner would grant (or revoke) at will.

==Hellenistic ''polis''==
[[File:Antikes Alexandria Karte.JPG|thumb|Ancient Alexandria, a ''polis'' of Hellenistic Egypt.]]

During the Hellenistic period, which marks the decline of the classical ''polis'', the following cities remained independent: Sparta until 195 BC after the War against Nabis. Achaean League is the last example of original Greek city-state federations (dissolved after the Battle of Corinth (146 BCE)) . The Cretan city-states continue to be independent (except Itanus and Arsinoe, which lay under Ptolemaic influence) until the conquest of Crete in 69 BCE by Rome. The cities of Magna Graecia, with the notable examples of Syracuse and Tarentum, were conquered by Rome in late 3rd century BC. There are also some cities with recurring independence like Samos, Priene, Miletus and Athens. A remarkable example of a city-state which flourished during this era is Rhodes through its merchant navy, until 43 BCE and the Roman conquest.

The Hellenistic colonies and cities of the era, retain some basic characteristics of a ''polis'', except: the status of independence (city-state) and the political life. There is a self-governance (like the new Macedonian title ''politarch'') but under a ruler and king. The political life of the classical era is now transformed to an individualized religious and philosophical view of life. The demographic decline forced the cities to abolish the status of metic and bestow citizenship; In 228 BCE Miletus enfranchised over 1000 Cretans. (Milet, I, 3, 33-8.) Dyme sold its citizenship for one talent, payable in two installments. The foreign residents in a city are now called ''paroikoi''. In an age, when most of the establishments in Asia are kingdoms, an interesting example of a Hellenistic cities federation is the Chrysaorian League in Caria.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Hemocyanin2.jpg|thumb|3D structure of hemocyanin.]]

'''Hemocyanin''' is a protein found in mollusks that carries oxygen in much the same way as [[Structural Biochemistry/Hemoglobin|hemoglobin]] carries oxygen in human blood.  Similarly to hemoglobin, a central metal atom binds oxygen differentially, however in hemocyanin, this central metal atom is copper.  When the copper is oxidized from its Cu(I) form to its Cu(II) the protein changes color from clear to blue, which is the source of the blue tinge of mollusk hemolymph.  The origin of the word hemolymph (from Latin for heme- blood and cyanin- blue) alludes to this blue tinge. In hemolymph, hemocyanin is present as an extracellular protein that aggregates into large complexes held together by calcium or magnesium ions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chem.utoronto.ca/coursenotes/GTM/JM/HCstart.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  The number of monomers and the size of these aggregates can differ between mollusk and arthropod species, but all forms contain the central copper atoms.

== Structure ==
[[Image:PDB 1oxy EBI.jpg|thumb|Arthropod hemocyanin, displaying both [[Structural_Biochemistry/Proteins/Structures#Beta_Pleated_Sheet|B- sheets]] and [[Structural_Biochemistry/Proteins/Structures#Alpha_Helix|a- helices]].]]

The structure and function of the hemocyanin molecule revolves around the two copper atoms embedded at its core.  Each copper atom is complexed by three histidine residues that form the distorted pyramidal geometry of each atom.  This and the space between the copper atoms facilitates the bonding of the two copper atoms to each dioxygen molecule.  In close proximity to the histidine residues are two phenylalanine residues that form a hydrophobic core that protects the active site.  Once oxygen is bonded, a geometrical change occurs from trigonal pyramidal to a distorted tetrahedral and it is this change in bonding geometry that explains the change in color that occurs with oxydation of the central copper atoms.  Although in both arthropod and mollusk hemocyanin, the binding mechanism and active site are nearly identical, there are various differences in the structure and assembly of subunits.

In arthropods, hemocyanin is made up of monomers of approximately 75 kDa which make up hexamers that aggregate into multiple hexamer groups.  Each monomer may take one of several forms, all of which occur in a specific location in the molecule.  Arthropod hemocyanin has three regions, the second of which housing the copper atoms and residing within a 4 a- helical set.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jbc.org/content/276/19/15563.full&lt;/ref&gt;

Mollusks, however have much larger polymeric subunits on the order of 350-450 kDa.  Additionally, the aggregates of subunits are often much larger; for example, cephalopod hemocyanin consists of 5-10 cylindrical aggregates and in other gastropods there can be as many as 160 oxygen accepting units.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jbc.org/content/276/19/15563.full&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite the differences in quaternary structure between mollusk hemocyanin proteins, the tertiary structure of each subunit is very similar.

== Evolution ==

Hemocyanin and other proteins that facilitate oxygen transport and aerobic respiration have their evolutionary roots in some of the earliest life forms.  Since the atmosphere was mostly anaerobic, oxygen was probably poisonous to many early anaerobic organisms.  In an effort to eliminate poisonous oxygen byproducts, early oxidative proteins were evolved that utilized iron or copper to carry out oxidative processes.  Over time, the concentrations of oxygen in the atmosphere increased and oxidative proteins began to be used in aerobic systems.  Additionally, as body size began to increase (around 700-800 MYA), diffusion would not supply enough oxygen to the entire organism, and iron and copper based molecules began to be diversified.  The similarities between hemocyanin structures in mollusks and arthropods suggest a divergence in hemocyanin structure before 750 MYA.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jbc.org/content/276/19/15563.full&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:StockholmCordonMap.png|thumb|Stockholm Tax Cordon Map]]
In 2006, a tax cordon around much of the City of Stockholm was implemented.  Congestion had been a problem in the city for some time, and for years traffic flow into the downtown area had not increased.

To mitigate this congestion, a tax was charged on most types of vehicles crossing the cordon at a relatively low rate.  Prior to implementation, the tax was of much political debate.  People outside the cordon largely opposed the tax.  Once people inside the tax cordon were involved, the results changed as they showed large support for the tax.

Those who live within the tax cordon tended to cross the cordon less often than those who commuted daily from suburbs or other areas to the city for work.  Those people also would experience lower demand for their local roads and this is a possible reason for their support of the tax.

=Road pricing=

Road pricing is a generic term which refers to a charge for using a road. Such a policy involves imposition of a fee for operating a motor vehicle on a roadway facility in order to generate revenue, manage traffic demand, or reduce environmental impacts associated with traffic congestion.&lt;ref name=&quot;R1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;R2&quot; /&gt;

Three types of road pricing based on the purpose are recognized. In '''congestion or value pricing''' the main goal is managing demand to reduce congestion and/or retain targeted travel speed.&lt;ref name=&quot;R3&quot; /&gt; Congestion pricing works by shifting some less critical rush-hour highway travels to other transportation modes or to off-peak periods.&lt;ref name=&quot;R4&quot; /&gt; The main purpose in '''tolling''' is to generate revenue to cover the costs of infrastructures construction and/or operations. '''Environmental pricing''' aims to reduce environmental impacts of traffic (i.e. emission).&lt;ref name=&quot;R3&quot; /&gt;

Road pricing is also categorized using the scale of its application &lt;ref name=&quot;R3&quot; /&gt;:
*'''Facility-based Pricing:''' when charges are imposed over specific roadway facilities (e.g. bridges and tunnels) or dedicated lanes on these facilities (e.g. HOT lanes).
*'''Zone-based (area or cordon) pricing:''' when there are charges to drive within (area) or into (cordon) a congested urban area (as in London, Stockholm and Singapore).
*'''Distance-based charges:''' when per-mile charges are levied on vehicles on roads within a specified region or country (as in the Czech Republic and Germany).

In all cases charging rates may vary by time of day (versus flat tolls), traffic volumes and vehicle types.&lt;ref name=&quot;R3&quot; /&gt; Fix charges are basically used in cases with revenue generation purpose while variable tolls are more appropriate for traffic demand management strategies.&lt;ref name=&quot;R4&quot; /&gt;

==Congestion Pricing Technology==
Today, tolls are collected at highway speeds by using electronic toll-collection technology. Vehicles are equipped with electronic devices called transponders or &quot;tags&quot;, which are read by overhead antennas or gantries.&lt;ref name=&quot;R4&quot; /&gt; This system which is called Dedicated Short-Range Communication (DSRC) is implemented in Singapore, Germany and Czech Republic.&lt;ref name=&quot;R3&quot; /&gt; Simple types of tags or In-vehicle Units (IU) are affordable for less than $10.&lt;ref name=&quot;R4&quot; /&gt;

Global positioning systems (GPS) are used to calculate mileage traveled by trucks in Germany on the autobahns.&lt;ref name=&quot;R3&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;R4&quot; /&gt; A Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) is also needed for data transmission in this method of tolls collection.&lt;ref name=&quot;R3&quot; /&gt; The costs of such systems are currently high as much as $500 per vehicle in Germany. Some additional services such as in-vehicle navigation and commercial fleet management are also provided to make these high costs justifiable.&lt;ref name=&quot;R4&quot; /&gt; 

Cameras are an essential complement to both DSRC and GPS systems to capture an evidence of the identity of vehicles that do not have a working tag or GPS unit. So, this component is known as an enforcement tool.&lt;ref name=&quot;R4&quot; /&gt; More sophisticated cameras which are able to recognize the plate number of cars can be used independently (without having DSRC) for collecting tolls. This technology known as Automated Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) is currently used in London and Stockholm congestion pricing. Users have a specified time to pay the charge; otherwise they will be fined by an incremental penalty scheme.&lt;ref name=&quot;R3&quot; /&gt;

=Referendum=
[[Image:Stockholm congestion tax referendum map.svg|thumb|200px|Map showing the results of the referendum in each [[Municipalities of Sweden|municipality]].
{{legend|#00FF00|'Yes'-majority.}}
{{legend|#FF0000|'No'-majority.}}
{{legend|#C0C0C0|No referendum held.}}]]
A referendum was held on September 17, 2006 on whether to permanently implement the congestion tax. Although the reigning government stated that only the results from Stockholm Municipality would be considered, surrounding municipalities held their own referendums.  The opposition parties stated they would consider these results if they won power. They proceeded to win the election, but announced in October 2006 that they would implement the congestion tax permanently.&lt;ref name=&quot;wiki&quot; /&gt;

=Collection of the Tax=
[[File:Betalstation 2010.jpg|thumb|Tax Collection Point]]
The tax is imposed only between the hours of 6:30 AM and 6:30 PM Monday thru Friday.  The charge could be anywhere from 10 kronor to 20 kronor for each crossing of the tax cordon, and a vehicle can accrue a maximum of 60 kronor in charges per day.&lt;ref name=&quot;R7&quot; /&gt;

The tax is not imposed on public holidays or during the month of July, and obviously not on weekends.  There are also many vehicles that are exempt from the tax, such as emergency vehicles or public busses.  Other types of vehicles used to be exempt, such as alternative-fuel vehicles.  Research indicates this had caused a much higher percentage of alternative-fuel vehicles to cross the cordon than regular vehicles.&lt;ref name=&quot;R8&quot; /&gt;  In fact, about 28 percent of all tax cordon crossing's are exempt.&lt;ref name=&quot;R6&quot; /&gt;

These decisions come as the result of a seven-month study period, in which the tax was an experiment.&lt;ref name=&quot;R7&quot; /&gt;  Today, the tax is a permanent installation.  In the table below, the charge by time of day is shown (for days in which the tax is levied).

==Exemptions==
The following classes of vehicles are automatically exempt from congestion tax:&lt;ref name=&quot;R5&quot; /&gt;
*Emergency vehicles
*Public buses with a total weight more than 14 tons
*Taxis. This exemption is no longer valid &lt;ref name=&quot;R3&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;R6&quot; /&gt;
*Diplomatic registered vehicles
*Motorcycles
*Foreign-registered vehicles
*Military vehicles
*Certain alternative-fuel vehicles (Green cars). This exemption is no longer valid.
*Vehicles with handicap plates.
*Residents of the Island of Lidingö, who can access the rest of Sweden only through the CBD, have 30 minutes to exit the area; otherwise the charges are applied.

28 percent of all passages across the congestion tax cordon are made by exempted. The proportion of passages made by Green cars has increased from 3 percent in the trial to 13 percent in 2008. It turned out that alternative fuel vehicles make on average 70 percent more journeys over the congestion tax cordon than the average for taxable vehicles. In addition, the increasing number of alternative fuel vehicles is probably another reason for the increase in trafﬁc across the congestion tax cordon in 2008 compared to the trial in 2006. For these reasons the exemption for alternative fuel vehicles ceased in July 2012 [6]. Note that reducing congestion is the primary policy goal while reducing emissions is the secondary purpose.

=Effects of Congestion Tax=
==Traffic==
During the 6 month congestion tax trial period, Stockholm saw a 22% decrease in the number of vehicle crossings into the city center.&lt;ref name= &quot;R6&quot;/&gt;  After the trial period, crossings rose significantly, but never reached original levels.  This remaining decline could have been due to road construction on two major brides.&lt;ref name= &quot;R7&quot;/&gt;  Another possible factor being commuter habit.  Travelers became accustomed to their new mode of commuting from the trial period.  

Comparing 2008 levels (a year after permanent implementation) to 2005, reveals an 18% reduction in cordon vehicle crossings.  Data from late 2007 and early 2009 reveal a similar trend.  The greater vehicle crossing reduction during the trial 2006 has several possible explanations.  Unusually large snowfall may have dissuaded commuters from driving.  Travelers may have also required time to adapt to the system originally, contributing to the large decline in traffic.&lt;ref name= &quot;R6&quot;/&gt;

[[File:TrafficVolumes.png|thumb|Traffic Volume Comparison]]

The decline in car journeys across the cordon in 2008 compared to 2005 amounted to 96,000 per taxable day.&lt;ref name= &quot;R6&quot;/&gt;  Nearly half of these trips were work or school trips, with the remaining consisting mostly of discretionary travel.  Almost all work and school trips mode shifted to transit.  Discretionary trips on the other hand were primarily moved out of the peak period, eliminated altogether or avoided crossing the cordon.  No significant increase in car-pooling or telecommuting was seen.&lt;ref name= &quot;R7&quot;/&gt;
 
Traffic levels within the inner city saw a smaller decrease than cordon crossings.&lt;ref name= &quot;R7&quot;/&gt;  Drivers are charged only for crossing the cordon, but travel within the inner city is not charged a tax.  With an overall reduction in congestion levels, this likely led to some convergence.  Drivers within the inner city took advantage of the additional capacity created by the congestion tax.

Orbital roads in 2008 saw a 5-10% increase in traffic compared to 2005.  This increase is partly caused by an overall rise in traffic, but also caused by commuters avoiding cordon crossings.&lt;ref name= &quot;R6&quot;/&gt;

==Public Transit==
Transit ridership numbers in 2008 show 80,000 more journeys across the cordon per taxable day than in 2005.  This represents a 7% increase in transit ridership.  Roughly half of this increase can be attributed to population growth.&lt;ref name= &quot;R6&quot;/&gt;  Additional factors, such as changes in gas prices, business-cycle effects and expanded transit ridership, also contributed to the increase.&lt;ref name= &quot;R7&quot;/&gt;  Nevertheless, a clear car to transit mode shift can be observed for work and school commuters.  At least a third of the increased ridership is likely due to implementation of the congestion tax.&lt;ref name= &quot;R7&quot;/&gt;

==Travel Times==
[[File:Traveltimes.png|thumb|Travel Time Comarison]]

Travel time measurements were primarily done by a camera system.&lt;ref name= &quot;R6&quot;/&gt;  An overall reduction in travel times on various road types is seen during the trial period.  This is not surprising given the lower car volumes.

==Environment==
Measurements to quantify environmental changes inside the cordon were conducted.  The Stockholm Traffic Administration estimated that a 10-14% decrease in CO2 emissions from vehicles occurred during the congestion tax trial period.  Since permanent implementation, estimates show a 4% further reduction.&lt;ref name= &quot;R6&quot;/&gt;  The decrease in CO2 emissions is largely due to the increase in alternative vehicles.  Some of it can be credited to decreased traffic volumes.  However, some of the reduction in car emissions is offset by the increased bus service.  The congestion tax is likely the greatest driving factor behind the rapid increase in alternative vehicle use.  Alternative vehicles are allowed to pass the cordon free of charge.  Although, the 9% increase in alternative vehicle use cannot be solely attributed to the congestion tax.&lt;ref name= &quot;R6&quot;/&gt;  An increase in ownership would have likely occurred regardless of the tax exemption.

==Economy==
There is no significant evidence of economic consequences to Stockholm businesses resulting from the congestion tax.  Observed changes are within normal price variations.  The rest of Stockholm county was used as a control in comparing economic changes within the city.  Researchers suggest the lack of impact on retail is due to the limited effect the congestion tax has on disposable income, estimated around 0.1%.&lt;ref name= &quot;R7&quot;/&gt;  However, if this is the case, one would expect drivers to be inelastic in their behavior.  Another explanation is that many discretionary trips were moved to off peak hours and not completely eliminated.

=The Tax Debate=

Prior to implementation in 2007, there was a trial period (January–July 2006) and a referendum in September 2006 to decide on implementation. 
Those who pay the cordon tax the most frequently are on average of higher income and have greater car ownership.&lt;ref name=&quot;R6&quot; /&gt;  Many of these tax payers live in areas surrounding the inner city where household incomes are higher.

==Supporters of the Tax==
*'''Residents of the City of Stockholm'''
Residents living within the tax cordon voted in favor of the referendum.  Those same residents were in even greater support of the tax in 2007 than before the tax was implemented.&lt;ref name=&quot;R6&quot; /&gt;
*'''Owners of Exempted Vehicles'''
&quot;Exempted vehicles&quot; cross the cordon an average of 12 times per two week period, compared to seven times for a taxable vehicle.  This was a statistically significant increase.&lt;ref name=&quot;R6&quot; /&gt;
*'''Public Transportation Companies'''
Public transportation use increased across the tax cordon by 6%.&lt;ref name=&quot;R7&quot; /&gt; However a quarter of that increase was due to increased employment, population, and fuel prices according to the study.&lt;ref name=&quot;R7&quot; /&gt;  Nevertheless, this is still a 4.5% increase in public transportation use that could be the result of the cordon tax.
Six of seven bus routes crossing the tax cordon have experienced decreased bus journey routes, even despite the increase in ridership.&lt;ref name=&quot;R7&quot; /&gt;
*'''Taxpayers of Stockholm'''
While the benefit to the taxpayers can be of much debate, the net social benefit was calculated to be about 650 mSEK/year (about 100 mUSD/year) according to a study published in Transportation Research Part A.&lt;ref name=&quot;R7&quot; /&gt;

==Those Indifferent to the Tax==
*'''Business Owners within the cordon'''
According to a report, business has had consistent turnover from before and after the tax implementation, and with respect to the rest of Stockholm county.&lt;ref name=&quot;R6&quot; /&gt;  In fact, retail and wholesale sectors exhibited increased turnover within the tax cordon.&lt;ref name=&quot;R6&quot; /&gt;

==Opponents of the Tax==
It is worth nothing that the number of opponents to the tax has drastically decreased since implementation (and even more so since the beginning of the trial period.&lt;ref name=&quot;fhwa&quot; /&gt;  There were only a few episodes of violence or protesting on the first few days of the trial period.  Ever since, there has been no opposition beyond opinions expressed in public polling.&lt;ref name=&quot;newspaper&quot; /&gt;

Irony exists in the fact that the political party that supported and initiated the project (the tax cordon) was voted out of power at the same time as public polling began to approve of the congestion charging scheme.&lt;ref name=&quot;fhwa&quot; /&gt;

==Revenue Allocation==
According to a report, the revenues are reinvested in improvements to the road network in the Stockholm region.  This had not been the plan during the trial period, as at that point it had been stated that the revenues would go entirely to improving public transport in Stockholm.&lt;ref name=&quot;stockholm&quot; /&gt;

The tax was implemented as a state tax, because in Sweden a municipality cannot collect taxes from the inhabitants of another municipality.  Because inhabitants would come from other locations and be taxed in the City of Stockholm, the tax could only be levied on Stockholmers, or be implemented as a state tax.  But with the tax classified as a state tax, the redistribution of those revenues is complicated.  Due to changing political parties as well as other factors, the revenues have not always found their way back to Stockholm.&lt;ref name=&quot;stockholm&quot; /&gt;

=Other Congestion Taxes =

Two other successful congestion pricing projects are those implemented in London and Singapore. There are some similarities and differences between them which are useful to be pointed out.
 
Managing congestion is the primary purpose in all three cities while transit promotion and emission reduction are secondary.&lt;ref name=&quot;R3&quot; /&gt;

Stockholm operates a cordon pricing while Singapore uses cordon as well as facility-based pricing and London uses area pricing. Exactly for this reason, London had to procure too many cameras in comparison with Stockholm. London conducts 348 sites along the cordon and within the area plus some patrols roving the zone capturing live videos of the license plates of all vehicles whereas Stockholm controls only 18 gantries. The charges vary by time of day in Stockholm and Singapore While there is a flat rate of £8 per day in London. In Singapore fees even varies by vehicle type.&lt;ref name=&quot;R3&quot; /&gt;
 
Stockholm and London apply ANPR technology to control the zone and collect the tolls. Singapore uses the DSRC and transponders to do this but at the same time ANPR system is used as enforcement tool. So Singapore has required more infrastructures and naturally more capital and also operating costs. Stockholm applied the DSRC and transponder system too during the trial period. But then, officials decided that the ANPR system performed sufficiently that the transponder-based option is not necessary. So it was eliminated in the permanent program to reduce overall system operating costs. Stockholm and London has defined some exemption rules based on their own policies and/or characteristics. Unlike in Stockholm and London, no vehicles are exempt from the charge in Singapore, except emergency and military vehicles because of the tough geographical conditions.&lt;ref name=&quot;R3&quot; /&gt;
 
Net revenues generated in Stockholm were allocated to transit and new roads in and around the city. In London 82 percent of it was used for bus improvement, 9 percent for roads and bridges, and the remaining 9 percent for other transport improvements within greater London. In Singapore, though, a portion of net revenues returned to vehicle owners through periodic rebates on vehicle taxes and the rest were invested in transit and highway systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;R3&quot; /&gt; This refunding gave rise to a valuable public acceptance for the pricing program.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Lecture 20 - Weber on Legal-Rational Authority [November 10, 2009]=

by Iván Szelényi

==Overview==

The purest form—the ideal type—of Weber's legal-rational type of authority is bureaucracy. Legal-rational authority indicates that authority is invested in a set of rules and rule-bound institutions and that the creating and changing the rules are outside of the control of those who administer them; it does not mean, however, that the authority is democratic. Monarchs and even authoritarian leaders who recognize a set of laws external to their powers govern using legal-rational authority. The characteristics of bureaucracy include a fixed salary, posts based on technical skill rather than personal connections, a well-defined hierarchy, and continuous rules which bind the behavior of administrators and citizens or clients alike.

==Chapter 1. Introduction to Weber's Theory on Legal Rational Authority==

Professor Iván Szelényi: Good morning. Now today's topic is Weber's theory of legal-rational authority and his theory of bureaucracy. This is one of those questions—those topics—Weber is probably the best known for. It's also a rather complicated issue. When we are saying legal-rational authority, we briefly refer to the rule of law, and we tend to associate in our mind the rule of law with liberal market economies and the liberal democracies. Well Weber has a very complex argument about this.

Indeed, legal-rational authority is the kind of system of authority which is predictable, because there is an observable law, everybody is subordinated to, which, in fact, has the most—the clearest elective affinity with a market economy. Nevertheless, as we will see, he will argue that—which is very counterintuitive—that the purest type of legal-rational authority is bureaucracy; and this is usually what we don't have in our mind when we are thinking about a market economy, that it is bureaucratic. So we have to deal with Weber's interesting claim that the purest type of legal-rational authority, which goes together with a market capitalist economy, is actually bureaucracy.

It's also interesting that Weber does not make an assumption that bureaucracy, legal-rational authority, or capitalism necessarily goes together with democracy. How democracy fits into the picture is rather problematic for him. Of course, we have to appreciate that in Weber's--when Weber was writing about these issues, somewhere between 1914 and 1920, I mean, virtually none of the countries in the world were liberal democracies or universal suffrage. The political systems of the world changed so much in the last hundred years. But he problematizes this relationship; and it's actually quite useful.

So this is the guideline for today's lecture. Again I start with the definition of the ideal type, the purest type of legal-rational authority, and then I try to dig into this unusual but very influential Weberian argument—that bureaucracy, in fact, is the purest type of legal-rational authority. And then I will look at various kinds of limitations of the exercise of bureaucratic authority. One is collegiality. The other is functional division of labor—right?--the separation of various branches of government, which is a limitation on bureaucracy, and representation, democracy, is a limitation on government. So you can see that he sees a tension—right?--between democracy, bureaucracy, legal-rational authority and capitalism. They do not go as easily together as usually we Americans tend to think about this. And then a couple of ideas about his view about democracies.

==Chapter 2. Pure Type of Legal Rational Authority==

Okay, so let me start with what is the pure type of legal-rational authority. And there are really two issues we have to very briefly talk about. There are different ways how laws and norms can be established. We're already beginning to feel our way into the problem whether the rule of law and democracy are identical, or, you know, it can be democratic, or does not have to be that democratic. And then the question is who obeys what and whom, under legal authority?

So and a bit about legal-rational authority. So the argument is—right?--that there are various ways how laws or norms can be established. And well he said, legal authority rests on the acceptance of the following ideas. Right? Well, the norms, he said, can be established by agreement—that's what we usually think when we think about rule of law—or by imposition; it can be imposed on people. Right? And it can happen on the ground of expediency. It can happen because these are the most useful laws and therefore we either agree that this is what we want to obey, or there is an authority which they impose on us. Or it can be based on value rationality. It may not be that expedient, may be not necessarily immediately useful, but on the basis of shared values, or the values of those who impose those laws—and we tend to believe it—we will—this is the way how it will be established.

And then, of course, the legal system has to be somewhat consistent—this is important for the predictability of the system—and has to be intentionally established. Right? This is not coming from accident, but intentionally established. But the major point what I wanted to make—right?--that legal-rational authority, in Weber's view, can be actually an authoritarian system. Let's say Chile under Pinochet, the later times, after he established—consolidated his power; earlier on it was a tyrannical rule. But later on, Pinochet established a legal-rational order, though it was not democratic at all. Right? It was operating with a legal system which was imposed on people. And in history we have a number of instances when we can say, &quot;This is country is a country of law and order. We know what the laws are; we actually think the laws are not unreasonable. But it was imposed by some power upon us.&quot;

Now the next question is who obeys whom? And well I don't want to dwell on this so long. This is quite clear. You already are familiar with this. What is important—right?--the person who is in authority, who issues orders, is himself subject to an impersonal order. So we are all subject to the same order. This is the essence of legal-rational authority, at least in the ideal type. Right? We know the exceptions to this. We know that Berlusconi, for instance, in Italy, though Italy is really a legal-rational authority, for a long time managed—right?--to pass a legislation which enabled him to escape prosecution; though he's probably involved in a number of criminal activities, but somehow he managed to escape criminal prosecution. But that's the exception. The rule is—right?--that even the person who is highest in charge is subject to the same authority and has to obey the law. And this is again very obvious; we already covered this, the opposite, the mirror image of it. Right? The members of the society of obedience, to the superior, not as an individual, but to an impersonal order, to the law as such. That should be quite obvious.

Now so what are the major characteristics of a system which is based on legal-rational order? There is a continuous rule-bound conduct. It's again, I think, does not call for too much clarification. It is continuously the same rules. The rules change slowly and with a great deal of difficulties, as we can see how Congress is struggling to pass a law about health care reform. It takes months or years before an important new piece of legislation gets into place. And usually new pieces of legislations, in legal-rational authority, are grandfathered. Right? If you pass a new law, you change the rules of the game, you usually grandfather them; those who entered the game before the new law are still under the rule of the old law. We do that at the universities all the time. Right? If, for instance, the degree requirements do change in a university, almost always these degree requirements are—this new legislation is grandfathered. You know the terminology. Right? It will not apply to people who are already in the program. It will only apply to people who are entering the program. Or one way of grandfathering it, that we give people a choice. You know? If you want to operate under the new rule, you can opt for the new rule; or if you want to stay under the old rule, you can stay under old rule. Only for those are the new rules binding who are entering the system now. So that's very important—right?--that it is continuous and rule-bound.

And he also said in legal-rational authority there must be a very clear separation of spheres of competence. Right? Who is competent to carry out what? And then you can always figure out how you navigate in a legal-rational order. You will be told, &quot;Well, this is not my table, you go somewhere else.&quot; So you go and you ask something from the director of undergraduate studies, and the director of undergraduate studies might say, &quot;Go and see the dean of your residential college&quot;—right?--&quot;because that is the sphere of competence of the residential college.&quot; That's the way how legal-rational order is supposed to operate. And the same, occasionally the dean of college will say, &quot;Well, you have to see your sociology professor, or your economics professor.&quot; Right? You want to get transfer credit, for instance, for a summer course, and then the dean of college well said, &quot;It is the department&quot;—be it political science or economics or anthropology--&quot;they will be able to tell whether this can be accepted as an economics course at Yale.&quot; Right?

And this also implies that there is always a hierarchy and a right to appeal. This is—again, you are very familiar with it. You know exactly if you get a grade from your discussion section leader, you can appeal to the professor to say, &quot;Well, I don't think it's a fair enough grade. I deserve a better grade. My section leader made an error.&quot; And if you are unhappy with the response of the professor, you go to the chair of the department and appeal to the chair. There is a whole hierarchy of appeal—right?--where you can try to correct what you think is not right. So I think it's extremely important that you know exactly what is the chain of appeal and how far you can go up.

Usually there is also some specialized training which is expected for people to occupy certain positions. So well discussion section leaders will always be at least graduate students; usually, well, people can teach their own course once they were passed—they are Ph.D. students but all what they have is a dissertation to finish, or they must have their Ph.D. Right? So there is a specialized training necessary to perform certain functions, as such. And that's an interesting and very complex idea—right?--that the staff has to be separated from the ownership of means of production and administration. This is even more important for Weber's argument. Being separated—it's not that easy to penetrate what he exactly wants to say with this. What does it mean that you do not own the means of administration? It basically means that the source of rules and laws are outside of the administrator as such. If you want to have any change in the rules, there must be some procedure which is beyond the person who is administering that rules, how the rules can be changed. Right? This in order—you have to prevent unpredictability in the system. And that's why rules change all the time. But the fundamental principle is that these rules should not be allowed to be changed by the person who administers—right?--those rules.

So just to give a very trivial example, once you got your syllabus and the course requirement and what kind of assignments you have to deliver during the course in order to get credit in this course, then well working out these rules, a professor plays a role. But we have to get approved by the Courses and Curriculum Committee, and then in a way we are bound by those rules. So on the way I could not announce you today, &quot;Well I changed my mind and there will be an unseen final examination where you will have to get a final examination--right?--and you will not know what questions I will ask, and I can ask any question for the whole course.&quot; Right? If I would change—right?--these rules right now, you would have, I'm sure, appeal against me, against my decision. Right? I'm bound by rules. So that means that I don't own the means of administration. Right? I am administering—right?--what is in the syllabus. Well there is a little leeway. Right? Occasionally I can give you an extension, for instance, if you come to me. Therefore it's--there is a little flexibility in the system. But fundamentally the course should be taught as it is in the syllabus, and the requirements should be like it is in the syllabus. That's what it means—right?--that you do not own—right?--the means of administration, unlike in traditional authority where a feudal lord does have—does own, appropriated, some means of administration from the monarch. And a British or a French high aristocracy could make rules; not implement the rules, but could make rules as well.

The unique feature of modern legal-rational authority is that this becomes an impersonal process, which is not done—there is a separation between those who implement the rules, and there is a separate procedure—right?--how the rules are being established. Is that reasonably clear, what ownership of means of administration means? As I pointed out, it's a very Weberian idea. Right? For Marx—right?--the whole issue is the ownership of means of production. For Weber this is everything about the administrations—the means of administration.

==Chapter 3. The Bureaucracy==

Okay, now we come to this very interesting Weberian theory of the bureaucracy: very interesting, very controversial, in many ways very counterintuitive. You may say it is false. Well we will see. That is a nice topic for discussion sections. And this is what I will go through—a number of issues. What is a bureaucracy? Weber makes this quite incredible claim, what first you will completely reject, that the most efficient organization is the bureaucracy. Right? That's exactly the opposite what you think. When something is very inefficient, then you say, &quot;Well this is so bureaucratic.&quot; Right? Weber nevertheless claims that the most efficient organization is bureaucracy.

Then the question is how is bureaucracy related to capitalism and socialism? Is really capitalism a bureaucratic organization? What is the relationship between capitalist market economy and bureaucracy? What are the consequences of bureaucracy? And also then some contradiction of bureaucratization.

Now let's just quickly rush through what are the characteristics of a bureaucracy. Well, he said, &quot;the purest type of legal authority&quot;—this is, as I said, counterintuitive--&quot;is that one which employs a bureaucratic administrative staff.&quot; And well what are the characteristics of this staff in order to qualify to bureaucracy? Well they have to be personally free. So it cannot be clients—right?--of a mentor. Right? They are legally free individuals. That makes it so different—right?--from a traditional organization. That's why a family is not a bureaucratic organization, because you are not there by choice. Right? And then a bureaucracy is organized into a hierarchy of offices—this is something which basically we already covered—and the offices are filled by a free contract, and in this contract what your qualification is, that's what we call—right?--meritocracy. People do have a certain degree, and that degree qualifies them to be incumbents of a certain office.

And they receive a fixed salary. It's not quite a bureaucratic organization if you are working for a commission. Right? You are really in a bureaucratic organization when you sign a contract and you know exactly what your fringe benefits will be and what your annual salary will be. Typically the office is the sole occupation of the incumbents, and it constitutes a career. This is also very important; again, very different from a traditional organization where people could actually be incumbents of a number of positions and could draw, in fact, even incomes from a number of positions. In a pure bureaucratic organization, you really can have only a single occupation. If, for instance, somebody is appointed with tenure to Yale, and is coming from another institution, he'll have to resign from his or her tenure at the other institution. If you are employed by Yale, you can be only a Yale employee; you cannot hold multiple jobs at the same time.

And it constitutes a career. The career means there is a ladder. You have some sense how you will progress in this bureaucratic hierarchy. Again, universities are classical bureaucracies—that you enter as an assistant professor; then you are, seven to nine years, depending on the institution, without tenure; then you are being promoted to tenure; then you expect at one point of time to become a full professor; blah-blah-blah. Right? This is what it meant, it is a career. And in many bureaucratic organizations, even in the business world—right?--you have a sense how you progress. In a law firm—right?--if you enter a law firm—right?--you have a pretty clear idea; it's actually very similar to the universities. Usually for seven years you are working for the law firm, and that's when you can become—right?--a partner in the law firm. Right? So you have a sense how your career will unfold. Well this is something we already kind of covered—right?--that you are separated from the means of administration, because you are subjected to discipline and control.

Now comes the very controversial idea, and that we have to talk about it. Weber's claim, which is very much against commonsense, that the purely bureaucratic type of administration is capable of attaining the highest degree of efficiency. Well let me, on the other hand, from this citation, underline an important point here. And this is—of course Weber was talking about a very specific type of organization, bureaucracies, which were, relatively speaking, historically quite efficient—right?--the Prussian type of bureaucracy. But here he emphasizes—and these are two very important words--&quot;from the technical point of view.&quot; Right? The bureaucracy, from the technical point of view, is the most efficient organization. It does not necessarily mean that it does achieve the highest welfare for people who are seeking to navigate in a bureaucratic organization. But technically speaking, it is the most efficient. Why? Because it has a very high degree of predictability. I mean, this predictability might suggest that it will take you a long time to get through of that bloody red tape—right?--what the bureaucracy imposes on you. But you know exactly the red tape, and you know, if you are stuck, how to try to appeal and to get the process moving. And therefore the crucial issue he said, why the bureaucracy is so efficient, because it is technically competent and it is predictable. And this is what makes it actually so—to fit so well with a market.

Well he said, &quot;And what else?&quot; If it is not bureaucracy, how can you otherwise organize an organization? If it is not done bureaucratically, then it is dilettantism. Right? And you may want to think about this. Now here comes the question about how does bureaucracy and capitalism fits into? And now he makes a very intriguing, very provocative claim. I think it is very deep, and deserves your attention. He said, &quot;The primary source of superiority in a bureaucratic administration lies in technical knowledge.&quot; Right? Bureaucracy is domination through knowledge. Well, a very provocative, very important claim. Right? Bureaucracy is—right?--the par excellence meritocratic organization—right?--where people who are issuing command are issuing command with the assumptions that they are the most competent people to carry this out. Well whether this is the case or not—you remember, Weber is always operating with ideal types, or pure types. The concrete cases may be different from it.

You may have people who are not competent to exercise the authority, what they do exercise. But I think it is important that you have the ideal type, because then you can be upset, and you say, &quot;These bloody bastards.&quot; Right? &quot;It is incompetent; cannot do the job.&quot; And then you can appeal and to say, &quot;Why don't you remove this person, because this person does not know what his or her job is?&quot; And actually such appeal very often is consequential. People occasionally are removed their position if their incompetence is being demonstrated. Well this is very difficult to do at a university, because universities, we have this system of tenure. You know? After you've suffered for seven years as an assistant professor, you are promoted to tenure, and then it is very difficult to get you out of the job. But even at the university this is possible. If you find out that I'm completely incompetent—right?--you document that I am incompetent—right?--that I am just misinterpreting all the authors you had here. And then you can appeal—right?--to the university, and you can say that I really should be removed; my tenure should be invoked. And if I'm found to be incompetent, I will lose my job; but the only way to do it, is through my incompetence. But actually universities very rarely do it, because it's a very painful exercise. But because they are bureaucracies there is—right?--the rule that it can happen, and it should happen in these cases.

And then he said, &quot;Well from this point of view, it really does not matter whether an economy is organized as a capitalistic economy, based on private ownership, or whether it is organized as a socialist economy, based on public ownership.&quot; Right? And, in fact, now he goes even further; and it's very interesting what he's got to say here. He's writing somewhere in 1919, 1920. The Soviet Union already exists, Soviet Russia already exists. There is already a society which calls itself socialist, which eliminated private ownership. And he said, &quot;Well socialism would require a still higher degree of formal bureaucratization than capitalism.&quot; That's a very interesting idea. Though until now he suggested—right?--that the bureaucratic organization fits the best with free market economy, now he said actually socialism will be even more bureaucratic.

And then I think what comes very—it's a very intriguing idea, and he said, &quot;But the big problem with socialism is that there will be a big conflict here between the formal rationality and substantive rationality, what the bureaucracy carries out.&quot; And you know by now—right?--or you have at least a hunch what he's getting at between formal and substantive rationality. Right? Formal rationality is that you are simply implementing the rules of the game. Substantive rationality is you are actually concerned with the welfare, the substantive goals of the action. And he said, &quot;Well, if you have a publicly owned economy, centrally planned economy, then the central planners make substantive decisions about the economy.&quot; They decide, for instance, where government or taxpayer money should go to—which branches of the economy should be investment going to. Right? In a capitalist economy, governments typically cannot do that. Right? They set the rules of the game. Well the best—they manage interest rates and they may be able to manage the currency exchange rate, but they cannot allocate resources across the economy. Of if they do, then people will say, &quot;We are on the road to socialism.&quot; Right? To the extent substantive rationality is involved.

But he said, &quot;Well if it is socialism, there will be this big tension.&quot; Right? You cannot be at the same time formally rational and substantively rational. You either consider the content of your decisions, or you are concerned simply with the procedures of the decision. If you are concerned with the procedure, that is formal rationality. If you are concerned with the content, that is substantive rationality.

Let me just give you one example about the legal system. Indeed, in Communist societies—and probably to some extent even China today, much less so than it was let's say thirty of forty years ago—well when justice is being served by the court, the court is not blind to who the people who are being accused of committing some crime is. The communist legal system called itself a class law; that, in fact, the purpose of the legal system is not to be blind—right?--who committed the crime. The purpose of the legal system is—that was the kind of legitimacy claim under Communism—to defend the interests of the working class. Right? And therefore that was specifically a legal system based on substantive rationality. Right?

Well capitalist legal systems tend to be procedurally—right?--rationalistic, formally rationalistic. In principle it doesn't matter who the person is when you are serving justice. This is again the ideal. Right? In concrete cases actually judges might consider some substantive characteristics of the person who is on trial, not simply to implement the law. May consider as mitigating circumstances—right?--for instance, when they are passing the law. And, of course, there are other reasons how actually substantive considerations enter the game. You know? If you are white and rich, you can hire a better defense lawyer and your chances to get off the hook within the same rules are better. So substantive considerations enter the thing. But that's the exception; that's not supposed to happen. We are angry when this happens. Right? We want to have a faceless legal system. Right? Justice is blind. Right? This blindness of justice means—right?--this is simply procedurally just—right?--and not substantively so. Right? This is why justice is shown with blind eyes.

Now what are the consequences of bureaucratization? Here are some of them. He said there is a tendency of leveling of interest; since everybody is in principle equal before the law and therefore interest will be leveled. You are not supposed to take into account people's position in it. Well there is a tendency—meritocratic tendency—that people higher up will have higher levels of training, or more training, as such. And—this is again justice is blind—what is important is that the essence of a bureaucracy has to be a formalistic impersonality: sine ira et studio, without hatred and passion. Right? This is why occasionally you are kind of upset when you are confronted with the bureaucracy. You have a special problem—you know?--and then the bureaucracy tends to be insensitive to your special problem—right?--when it is a real bureaucracy. Right? You can say, &quot;I just had a fight with my partner and this is why I cannot take the test.&quot; Well, sine ira et studio. I mean, in a real bureaucratic, discussion leader or professor will say, &quot;Too bad. This is your personal business. The test is right now.&quot; Right? &quot;You take it or leave it.&quot; Well, I mean, we are usually not that stupid bureaucrats. But that's the spirit of bureaucracy. Right? Without hatred and passion; that also means that you are not motivated by personal feelings. You don't differentiate this is a person I like and then I give preferences; or dislike, and therefore give a worse grade.

All right, there are a number of contradictions of bureaucracy. It is very formalistic. And he said there is also another interesting tendency. Though it is formalistic and it's supposed to go simply by the rules, occasionally, not only under socialism, in all systems the bureaucracy tends to have some sensitivity to substantive rationality, to the welfare of the people who are under the bureaucracy. And then it can be turned into a clientalistic system; the bureaucracy can have these tendencies. And think about welfare bureaucracies—right?--which do have a great deal of clientalistic tendencies built into them.

==Chapter 4. Limitations of Bureaucratic Authority==

Well, and there are these various limitations of bureaucratic authority. One is collegiality, division of powers, and representation. Well I don't want to dwell too long on the notion of collegiality. Collegiality, he says, really grows out of what we knew as professional groups or professional organizations. There are different ways how collegiality can operate. One way—that means that you are interacting with other people in the same organization, on the basis of collegiality. You can get a good sense of this collegiality; for instance, it's very important in the medical profession. If you go to a doctor for a second opinion, this doctor is really not supposed to say that his or her colleague, the other doctor, really screwed it and he gave you the wrong diagnosis or the wrong therapy. Right? Collegiality means that you stick together—right?--that the profession sticks together. There is a very strong sense of collegiality among lawyers, or at least supposed to be. The ethic of the legal profession is very much collegiality.

And it is also incidentally in the universities. I mean, faculty is not supposed to badmouth each other. Right? They certainly, towards students, they have to show that they have a collegial relationship with each other. Mutual respect binds them together. Occasionally there is what he calls veto collegiality; the collegiality does give veto right to certain people to run this organization. A single person can veto a decision, as such. Again, very typical in universities when it comes, for instance, to a decision whether somebody will be granted a permanent position in a university; so-called tenure, there is actually—the president of the university usually has a veto right and can veto. No matter that all bodies approved that, the president usually has a veto right—can veto that decision. It uses it very rarely, but occasionally it does use its veto right. So even in a collegially organized bureaucracy, there is these individual veto rights; otherwise, collegiality usually operates through the different committees and advisory boards. I mean, collegiality usually is emerging in a situation where you have a common trade or a common profession. That's when a group is being organized as a collegial bureaucracy, as such. And many of you will end up in professions in which you will have such a collegial environment, as such. Okay.

The other issue is—which is also a limitation of the functioning of the bureaucracy—right?--collegiality meant—right?--that though the bureaucracy is supposed to be blind to individual differences, it's not always, because we have loyalties towards each other, based on our profession. Lawyers are loyal to lawyers, and doctors are loyal to fellow doctors, and professors have a degree of loyalty.

Now the other one is division of powers. Well this division of powers, what Locke and Montesquieu and Rousseau were talking about, well it's a functional system—he cites Montesquieu about the separation of power—and that creates some degree of unpredictability in the system; but necessary, but creates some degree of unpredictability. Nevertheless, this is the way how to prevent tyranny. So therefore it is good for the economy; by what he means for the market economy.

And then comes the question of representations, and different forms of representations. Well there are—again, representations can be democratic, but is not necessarily all that bloody democratic. In fact, there is a possibility of representation when the representation is happening through some hereditary means. Traditional authority; people who were born in certain positions, like Montesquieu himself, was supposed to represent certain interests, which is beyond the personal interests of the person—right?; was supposed to represent the interests of the whole estate, what it was standing for. Well it's also—in modern times we do have a representation where representations can be selected by rotation or lot—in Ancient Greece this happened—and there can be a limited mandate; they are not representing necessarily the interest of the constituency and they can be recalled. This was typical of Communist bureaucracies. Or there can be what he calls free representation—it's what we would associate to democracy—where the representative is elected, rather than selected or appointed.

But it is also not bound by instructions; is only obliged to express his own conviction. So this is what we have seen in the Congress happening. Right? That Democrats voted with Republicans, because those Democrats argued, &quot;I'm not under party discipline.&quot; Right? &quot;I am acting out of my conscience.&quot;

Well a couple of ideas about free representation, and how it goes with a capitalist economy. Well what is crucial—right?--and Weber keeps coming back and back to this—what is vital for a capitalist economy is to be calculability and reliability. And well in early stages, in fact, there was property qualification, who could actually vote, and that was implemented in order to make the system more predictable for the propertied classes. There was a great deal of concern by the bourgeoisie to give universal suffrage, because they felt then this will be unpredictable, who will win the elections.

In fact, very often, these were monarchs and absolutist monarchs, who were pushing for extension—right?--of suffrage, because they wanted to use this against the propertied bourgeoisie. That's again something very counterintuitive, but I think historically a very accurate understanding. Right? So one has to be very careful what exactly the relationship with a capitalist economic order and democracy is. Well so Weber's fundamental argument is what many people who do the history of the democratic movement will agree; others will disagree with him. Again, a good subject for discussion. Parliamentary free representation was the product between struggles; actually struggles between monarchs and the bourgeoisie. Well I think I'll just leave this here. I probably gave us enough food for the discussion. Thank you.

      <comment>/* Different Hydrophobicity Scales */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Hydrophobicity scales''' is a system used by biochemists who study amino acids to relatively define the hydrophobicity of amino acid residues. A hydrophobicity scale is typically within a negative to positive range. Values that are in the negative range are defined as not very hydrophobic, whereas the values in the positive range are defined as somewhat hydrophobic. Hydrophobicity scales also offer great insight as to the thermodynamics of the interactions that take place between lipids and proteins inside the cell membrane. 
[[File:Liquid water hydrogen bond.png|thumb|right|Hydrogen bonding between water molecules.]]

== Hydrophobicity ==
Hydrophobicity, also known as the hydrophobic effect, is the tendency and readiness of non-polar molecules, such as lipids, to associate themselves together in an aqueous solution while simultaneously excluding water molecules. The hydrophobic effect is created when lipids and other non-polar molecules disrupt the hydrogen bonding network of water and forces it reform itself around the non-polar molecule. The resulting effect is water forming a cage around that particular hydrophobic molecule. The hydrophobic effect plays a crucial role in the regulation of protein folding, as well as formation of lipid bilayers and the insertion of membrane proteins into non-polar lipid environment. 

== Different Hydrophobicity Scales ==
There are many different types of hydrophobicity scale. Below are five different ways to access the hydrophobicity level of a single amino acid residue or a single amino acid mutation of a polypeptide, as discussed by MacCallum in his hydrophobicity scales article.  In the Radzicka–Wolfenden experiment, the sidechain of the amino acid arginine is placed into water and cyclohexane solvent. The concentration of the amino acid in each layer is used to calculate the free energy. The problem with this hydrophobicity scale is that cyclohexane, being more nonpolar, does not accurately represent the lipid bilayer of the cell membrane. The MacCallum et al.’s evaluation of the hydrophobicity scale is very similar to that of Radzicka’s. The only difference is that instead of using cyclohexane, MacCallum uses DOPC, which is a more accurate representation of the actual lipid bilayer. The problem is the same in that there is no backbone in this model. A “water defect” is seen because as some of the amino acids pass through the bilayer, its charges attracts and pulls the water with it. Wimley–White uses 1-octanol with water droplets and a pentapeptide Ace-WLxLL instead. They replace a single amino acid each time. This is a more realistic representation of the cell membrane because it takes into consideration the effects of the polypeptide backbone. They also measure the proportion of pentapeptide in each solvent. Moon–Fleming uses the protein OmpLA, which can be in an unfolded state in water or in a folded state when inserted inside the membrance.The equilibrium is shifted by mutating ompLA. Measurement is taken from using fluorescent spectrometry. Hessa et al. uses the protein leader peptidase. They attach an H-segment,a 19-residue-long chain, and 2 glycosylation sites on the H-segment to the leader peptidase. By assaying the glycosylation sites, they can predict if the H-segment have been inserted inside the membrane or not. These five experiments all measured the free energy transfers as the amino acid passes through the membrane. These hydrophobicity scales correlated very well with each other when normalized. Note: It should be kept in mind that these experiments do not fully represent the hydrophobicity inside the biological systems  because they do not take into consideration the membrane proteins that are already presented inside the cell membrane, which could have interact with our amino acid.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacCallum&quot;&gt;MacCallum, J.L. and Tieleman, D.P.

== Importance of the Hydrophobicity Scale ==
Even though 20-30% of all proteins are membrane proteins, less than 1% of all structures known in the Protein Data Bank are membrane proteins. Knowing the hydrophobicity scale allows for prediction of the transmembrane protein sequence, as well as allows for a better understanding of the water-protein-lipid interactions.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacCallum&quot; /&gt;

== Protein-lipid interactions ==
The thermodynamic and microscopic details for lipid-protein interactions are very important in a number of vital biological factors. 

One of such biological factor involves KvAP, which is the first crystal structure of a voltage-gated potassium channel. The structure of KvAP has led to numerous discussions in the biochemistry community about the interactions that take place between arginines, an amino acid, and lipids. This is due to the gating mechanism that the structure suggests in which positively charged arginines were exposed to the interior of the hydrophobic lipid bilayer of the cell membrane. 

Another key biological factor in protein-lipid interactions is the action of anti-microbial peptides and cell-penetrating peptides. This is because anti-microbial peptides have specific amino acid sequences that are enriched in cationic and aromatic residues, whereas cell-penetrating peptides are rich in cationic residues.

The last major development is the successful crystallization and determination of the structure of the Sec-translocon system, which has the fundamental task of inserting membrane proteins into the membrane as soon as they are done synthesizing by the ribosome. The complexity of the Sec translocon system has raised questions about the thermodynamics of membrane insertion.

== Protein membrane structure ==
The membrane bilayer is a highly heterogeneous layer with large gradients in density and polarity on a nanometer length scale. The membrane lipid bilayer can be divided into four major regions. The hydrophobicity decreases and the hydrophilicity increases moving along each region. In the first region, which is the center of the bilayer, is very hydrophobic and is significantly disordered with properties similar to decane. In the second region, the lipid tails are more ordered and have a higher density, with features that are very similar to a polymer. In the third region, there is a diverse mixture of functional groups, most of the head group density, as well as water. In the fourth and last region, it is very hydrophilic because it is defined as mostly water that is perturbed by the lipid layer. This layer can be very deep, depending on the cellular conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Engleman, D.M. ''et al.'' (1986) Identifying nonpolar transbilayer helices in amino acid sequences of membrane proteins. ''Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem.'' 15, 321-353&lt;/ref&gt;

== Comparison of Hydrophobicity Scales ==
Different hydrophobicity scales have been developed in the biochemistry community to study the lipid-protein interactions that take place at the membrane protein. Each hydrophobicity scale has been developed independently of one another using different techniques to study these lipid-protein interactions.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacCallum&quot; /&gt;

=== Radzicka-Wolfenden small molecule partitioning scale ===
One of the earliest hydrophobicity scales was developed by Radzicka and Wolfenden to study the folding of globular proteins. This scale was based on the partitioning of small molecule analogs of amino acid sidechains between a polar layer (water), and a lipophilic layer (cyclohexane). This particular scale is relevant for membrane partitioning due to the fact that the center of the membrane has physiochemical properties similar to those of bulk hydrocarbon.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfenden, R. (2007) Experimental measures of amino acid hydrophobicity and the topology of transmembrane and globular proteins. ''J. Gen. Physiolo.'' 129, 357-362&lt;/ref&gt;

Sidechain analogs of amino acids were added to a biphasic system of water and cyclohexane. After the system reached equilibration, the concentrations of both water and cyclohexane were both measured. This ratio in the concentrations of water and cyclohexane are directly proportional to the free energy of transfer.

Although the Radzicka-Wolfenden hydrophobicity scale is simple, this scale does not accurately reflect real cellular conditions because lipid bilayers do not resemble isotropic solvents and sidechains by themselves ignore important aspects of protein structure.&lt;ref&gt;Radzicka, A. and Wolfenden, R. (1988) Comparing the polarities of the amino-acids - side-chain distribution coefficients between the vapor-phase, cyclohexane, 1-octanol, and neutral aqueous-solution. ''Biochem''. 27, 1664-1670&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Visual of Radzika's Hydrophobicity Scale.png|thumb|center|upright=2.0|alt=]]

=== MacCallum et al. molecular dynamics potential of mean force scale ===

MacCallum et al.'s molecular dynnamics potential of mean force scale focuses on molecular dynamics simulations in order to calculate the distribution of the Radzicka-Wolfenden sidechain analogs (as described above). Instead of using cyclohexane as the lipophilic layer, a more realistic bilayer called 1,2-dioleoylsn-glycero-3-phosphocholine bilayer (DOPC) was utilized instead. Because these are computer simulations, the local environment is able to be known in the molecular level. 

One of the most important things about this particular model is the formation of water defects in the bilayer, which are local deformations in the membrane which allow for water to penetrate into the bilayer core and keep polar and charged groups hydrated in the partitioning of polar and charged molecules into the lipid bilayer membrane.&lt;ref&gt;MacCallum, J.L. ''et al.'' (2008) Distribution of amino acids ina lipid bilayer from computer simulations. ''Biophys. J.'' 94, 3393-3404&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Visual of MacCullum's Scale.png|thumb|center|upright=2.0|alt=]]

=== Wimley-White pentapeptide-based hydrophobicity scales ===
Wimley and White developed a peptide-based system to derive a thermodynamic scale between amino acid side-chain residues and lipids. &lt;ref&gt;Wimley, W.C. and White, S.H. (1996) Experimentally determined hydrophobicity scale for proteins at membrane interfaces ''Nat. Struct. Biol.'' 3. 842-848&lt;/ref&gt;. The pentapeptide which Wimley and White used was Ace-WLxLL, where x can be any of the 20 naturally occurring amino acids. Water was used as the polar layer and 1-octanol was used as the lipophilic layer, and the partitioning between the two layers was measured. The partitioning between water and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) was also measured via equilibrium dialysis and reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).

One of the caveats of this particular scale is that its focus is explicitly interfacial instead of the bilayer core like the other scales. In order to achieve a better understanding of this scale, one will need to dwelve into the microscopic level. However, compared to the other small molecule scales, this scale is more realistic but emphasizes on the interactions of amino acid side-chain residues with either the water-lipid interface or a heterogeneous octanol environment with a hydrophobic environment for neutral amino acids like lycine and a more hydrophilic environment for charged amino acids like arginine. &lt;ref&gt;Franks, N.P. ''et al.'' (1993) Molecular oganization of liquid n-octanol: An X-ray diffraction analysis. ''J. Pharm. Sci.'' 82, 466-470.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wimley, W.C. ''et al.'' (1996) Solvation energies of amino acid side chains and backbone in a family of host-guest pentapeptides. ''Biochem.'' 35, 5109-5124&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Visual of Wimley's Hydrophobicity Scale.png|thumb|center|upright=2.0|alt=]]

=== Moon-Fleming OmpLA folding/refolding scale ===
Moon and Fleming developed a hydrophobicity scale that is based on the reversible ''in vitro'' equilibrium between the water soluble unfolded state and membrane-inserted folded state of outer membrane phospholipase A (OmpLA) &lt;ref&gt;Moon, C.P. and Fleming, K.G. (2011) Side chain hydrophobicity scale derived from transmembrane protein folding into lipid bilayers. ''Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.'' 108, 10174-10177&lt;/ref&gt;. By making mutations in OmpLA, equilibrium between the folded, membrane-inserted state and the unfolded state in solution can be shifted and subsequently measured by fluorescent spectroscopy. 
[[File:PDB_1fw2_EBI.jpg|thumb|right|The three-dimensional structure the outer membrane phospholipase A (OmpLA).]]

This experiment compares a well-defined folded membrane state with an unfolded state in solution and measures the thermodynamic equilibrium between the two. One of the complications is that the bilayer used, 1,2-dilauroyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DLPC), is relatively thin and unstable.


[[File:Visual of Moon's Hydrophobicity Scale.png|thumb|center|upright=2.0|alt=]]

=== Hessa et al. Sec translocon hydrophobicity scale ===
Hessa et al. developed a hydrophobicity scale using a previously developed membrane protein insertion assay using the small membrane protein leader peptidase. They engineered two glycosylation sites and a 19 amino acids long residue, also known as the H segment, which can be inserted into the membrane as a transmembrane helix depending on its hydrophobicity. By assaying the two glycosylation sites, the insertion state of the H segment can be determined &lt;ref&gt;Hessa, T. ''et al.'' (2005) Recognition of transmembrane helices by the endoplasmic reticulum translocon. ''Nature'' 433, 377-381&lt;/ref&gt;. An apparent equilibrium between the inserted and non-inserted state of H segments can be achieved by modulating the sequence. 

The insertion of the H segment involves the Sec translocon, which is a cellular machinery that either inserts of secretes a given H segment into the membrane as it gets synthesized by the ribosome. Hessa et al. used this to develop a transmembrane prediction method that relies on a linear combination of single residue results to predict whether or not a helix of an amino acid residue will get inserted into the cellular membrane &lt;ref&gt;Hessa, T. ''et al.'' (2007) Molecular code for transmembrane-helix recognition by the Sec61 translocon. ''Nature'' 450, 1026-1030&lt;/ref&gt;.

Another useful application for this method with the Sec translocon is to test whether a particular sequence from a voltage-gated potassium channel would insert into the membrane, despite having multiple arginine and other polar residues &lt;ref&gt;Hessa, T. ''et al.'' (2005) Membrane insertion of a potassium-channel voltage sensor. ''Science'' 307, 1427&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Similarities between the hydrophobicity scales ===
Despite having used different environments and methods to test for hydrophobicity, each of the five aforementioned derived hydrophobicity scales all exhibit a well-defined correlation with one another &lt;ref name=&quot;MacCallum&quot; /&gt;. For instance, the Radzicka-Wolfenden and MacCallum scales correlate very well with each other and yield almost identical absolute free energy differences. The Wimley-White scale measures the interactions in the heterogeneous environment of water and 1-octanol, whereas the Moon-Fleming and Hessa ''et al.'' scales measure properties that are directly related to membrane protein insertion and stability. 

The absolute magnitudes of the Wimley-Hessa-Moon scales and the MacCallum-Radzicka scales differ by a significant amount. Despite this fact, all five of these scales all point to the same result &lt;ref&gt;Gumbart, J. ''et al.'' (2011) Free-energy cost for translocon-assisted insertion of membrane proteins. ''Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.'' 108, 3596-3601&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Discrepancies===
Although the experiments that have been conducted have had similar results in an attempt to mach the reaction of lipids and their membrane proteins, the experiments were overall very simple and not necessarily replicators of a true physiological setting, and therefore do not give much insight to true physiological cellular membranes. The experiments are simply correlated and not necessarily exact, for biological membranes contain a diverse mixture of lipids as opposed to the single component bilayers used. Membrane proteins play up to a 25% role in cellular membranes and these are not included within the experiments. Additionally, charged or polar molecules typically distort the lipid-water interface. Moreover, the scales used in the above experiments have only considered single amino acid residues, while in a true biological setting, multiple amino acid residues are present. The free energy calculations (the free energy being the amount of energy measured from the transfer of each amino acid between a polar, water environment and a lipid bi-layer environment) used to determine the scales in each of the experiments were also very different and this is why a scale factor was used to compare the experiments. Overall, true biological systems have very different settings involved, which have yet to be matched more closely to true settings. Despite the discrepancies within the research of hydrophobicity scales, there are many profound reasons to continue investigating this rather complex and relatively unknown topic, as discussed below.

===Implications===
Researching hydrophobicity and establishing a scale is rather important in creating the ability to discuss the implications of the different scales, as well as in finding a single scale to utilize. The scales help to predicting membrane protein-lipid interactions as well as membrane protein structure, of which little is known. Because many drugs interact strictly with membrane proteins, understanding protein-lipid interactions through measuring hydrophobicity could give great insight to how to cure or treat illnesses through new methods that are not yet known and could be more effective. This would be most applicable in mechanisms of antimicrobial and cell penetrating peptides. Also, hydrophobicity reveals side chain-lipid interactions.

==Introduction==


The heat stress response (HSR) in plants involves a complex network of different pathways which occurs in different cellular compartments. Scientists have been trying to figure out which is the main thermosensor that initiate the transcription of heat stress response gene in response to the heat stress.Up till now, scientists predicted that there are at least four major thermosensors in plants that activate a similar set of HSR gene which helps improving thermotolerance in plants, include a plasma membrane channel, an unfolded protein sensor in endoplasmatic recticulum, an unfolded protein sensor in cytosol, and a histone sensor in the nucleus. &lt;ref name=&quot;Finka&quot;&gt;Finka, A., Goloubinoff, P. and Mittler, R.. “How Do Plants Feel the Heat?” ''Trends in Biochemical Sciences''. March 2011: 118-125.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the relationship between these four thermosensors remains unknown.

==The Significances of Heat Stress in Plants==

1. Heat plays tremendous roles, especially those of adverse, in plant development, growth, reproduction and fertilization. Plant tissues involved in reproduction are especially vulnerable to the exposure of heat.

2. Plants are sessile organisms that cannot escape heat. Their metabolism is unique as they adapt their metabolism to counterbalance this disadvantage.

3. Cells and organelles in plants are designed in a way to combat and prevent damages caused by heat. 

4. Studies for heat stress in plants help agriculture. Necessary measures for heat damage may be prepared from these studies. Under heat stress, programmed cell death can be activated in plants and this can lead to the shredding of leaves, flowers not blooming, little to no production of fruits, or simply the death of plants. In addition, the reproductive tissues in plants are especially sensitive to heat. A difference of a few degrees in temperature can lead to no crops for the season. This can have an enormous and negative impact on the economy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Finka&quot; /&gt; It is estimated that the 1980 and 1988 US heat waves resulted in overall damages of approximately 55 and 71 billion dollars&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Genetic engineering for modern agriculture: challenges and perspectives&quot; by R. Mittler, E. Blumwald&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Effects of Heat Stress in Plants==

Heat stress has certain effects on different components in plant cells such as the stability of membranes, proteins, RNA and skeleton structure in cells.It also can change the way chemical reactions are carried out such as enzymatic reactions in the metabolic system. Due to the changes in these components, metabolic process of plant cells becomes imbalance. The disrupted state of metabolites can result in unwanted by-products such as reactive oxygen species (ROS).&lt;ref name=&quot;Finka&quot; /&gt;

In response to the changes of surrounding temperature, plants re-program their transcriptome, protome, metabolome and lipidome. This action  basically induces changes in the composition of certain transcripts, metabolites and lipids which help the plants reset a new  metabolic balance so that the cells can survive and function as normal even at high temperature.&lt;ref name=&quot;Finka&quot; /&gt; Moreover, when the temperature comes back to normal, plant cells can reverse the reprogram process and get back to the original metabolic balance that fit in with the current temperature. In addition, plants can also program cell death in response to the heat stress such as resulting in leaves shedding.

==Types of Heat Response in Plants==

Several heat treatments have been applied on plants to study the heat response in plants. There are three major set of heat treatments as mentioned in the article &quot;How do plants feel the heat&quot; by Ron Mittler* : no priming, stepwise priming, and gradual priming.&lt;ref name=&quot;Finka&quot; /&gt;

In the &quot;no priming&quot; treatment, the plants are introduced to a series of severe heat stress. For example, a plant that normally grows at  21&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C is placed in an environment at 42-45&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C for 0.5 to 1 hour. Plant survival is then measured 5-7 days after the treatment to determine the effect of heat stress.&lt;ref name=&quot;Finka&quot; /&gt; Due to this series of severe heat applied, the plant dies very quickly (exponential decay). The plants ability to survive after such treatment is referred to as basal thermotolerance, the ability of plants to sense and adapt to extreme heat without any priming. 

&quot;Stepwise priming&quot; subjects the plants to an environment of moderate heat stress. This is set up by first letting the plants grow at 21&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;C, and then subjecting them to a temperature of 36-38&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;C for a short period time of 1.5 hours.  They are then recovered to the normal temperature of 21&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;C for 2 hours after to which they are subjected to a severe temperature of 45&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;C. Their survivability under such condition (after priming) is known as acquired thermotolerance. 

&quot;Gradual priming&quot; is the process which the temperature was increased gradually and steadily until it reaches the temperature equal to extreme heat of 45&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;C. This is supposed to imitate the conditions that is seen in nature. Plants under these conditions also exhibit acquired thermotolorence. For Arabidopsis thaliana, gradual priming increase the survival rate by more than 10%. It is preferred over both no priming heat stress and stepwise priming temperature changes. &lt;ref name=&quot;Larkindale&quot; /&gt; 

The last type of heat treatment is &quot;warming&quot;, which is not considered as one of the heat stress treatments. During warming treatment, plants are originally at a temperature lower than standard growing temperature of 12&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;C, instead of 21&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;C. They are then exposed to a temperature that is slightly higher than their ordinary growth temperature so instead of subjecting them to 21&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;C, they are grown at 27&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;C. This slight increase in temperature change from the norm is, however, not considered heat stress since plants actually do not express HSR markers under warming. In general, warming allows longer term adaptation and reprogramming of the development, which includes early flowering or shedding leaves. 

The important message to take home from this experimental setup is that different heating treatments elicit different transcriptome responses. This suggests that there may be separate heat sensors and signaling pathways activating specific responses to rise in temperature.

==Sensing heat in plants==
When an ''A. thaliana'' experiences an increase in external temperature, its large surface-to-volume ratio makes sure that almost all macromolecules such as protein complexes, membranes and nucleic acid polymers in the plant cells to acknowledge the heat immediately. As it is true for every matter in the universe, the macromolecules' kinetic energy is raised by the introduction of heat into the system. This, consequently, results in reversible physical changes of the macromolecules. There are certain macromolecules that not only just &quot;perceive&quot; heat but also differentially trigger a unique signaling path that can specifically upregulate hundreds of HSR genes&lt;ref&gt;&quot;How do plants feel the heat?&quot; by Ron Mittler, Andrija Finka, Pierre Goloubinoff&lt;/ref&gt; 

There are 2 basic routes plants use to mediate heat stress
1. Direct effect in a specific sensor: The specific macromolecule that behaves as a sensor molecule could be directly affected by heat. It is observed when temperature-induced changes in its quaternary and tertiary structures occur. 
2. Indirect effect in a specific sensor: In this route, the specific macromolecule sensor is indirectly influenced by heat due to the effects of heat on other components of the cell. For example, temperature-induced changes in membrane fluidity could affect a membrane protein which is embedded in. It is indirect because the membrane protein is actually affected by heat but is only subject to change when the fluidity of plasma membrane varies.

==Heat sensing at Plasma Membrane==

The fluidity of the plasma membrane can increase when there is an increase in temperature. Scientists have found out that the increased fluidity of the plasma membrane will activate calcium channels, which will lead to an influx of Calcium ions into the cell. This is the primary heat sensing event in the moss ''Physcomitrella patens''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Finka&quot; /&gt; This is the mechanism of detecting heat. However, the actual heat stress sensor in plants cells in still unknown. The ''A. thaliana''genome encodes over 40 calcium channels and many of them are known to be located in the plasma membrane. These presences of calcium channels strongly suggest that calcium ions are the ones, which are responsible for sensing heat.

Beside activating the Calcium channels, membrane fluidity change might also trigger lipid signaling due to the change of temperature.

''How does a heat stress-induced inward calcium flux can control regulate multiple signaling pathways in plants?''

In ''A. thaliana'', the following 4 pathways are known to happen: [[File:Ch4 kinases.jpg|thumbnail|Mechanism of protein kinases]]

1. The calmodulin AtCaM3 signals heat stress and it itself is involved in the activation of different transcription factors such as WRKY39&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Functional characterization of Arabidopsis thaliana WRKY39 in heat stress&quot; from Mol. Cell, 29 (2010), pp 475-483) by S. Li&lt;/ref&gt; and HSFs &lt;ref&gt;&quot;The role of class A1 heat shock factors (HSFA1s) in response to heat and other stress in Arabidpsis&quot; from Plant Cell Envirnment, 34 (2011), pp738-751 by H.C. Liu&lt;/ref&gt;

2. Chain reactions may be triggered by heat signaling. It is known that an inward flux of calcium activates unique calcium-dependent protein kinases or the ROS-producing enzyme NADPH oxidase. A protein kinases is a kinase enzyme that modifies other proteins by chemically adding phosphate groups to them. 

3. AtCaM3 activated calcium/calmodulin-binding protein kinase. This protein kinase phosphorylates HSFA1a.

4. An HSP90/FKBP-dependent kinanse can also mediate HSF phosphorylation causued from calcium binding to calmodulin &lt;ref&gt;&quot;Arabidopsis ROF1(FKBP62) modulates thermotolerance by interacting with HSP90.1 and affecting the accumulation of HsfA2-regulated sHSPs&quot; from Plant Journal 59 (2009), pp 387-399 by D. Meiri, A Breiman&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lipid Signaling== 

On top of ion channel activation in the plasma membrane, membrane fluidity changes caused by increase heat can also trigger lipid signaling. During heat stress, phospholipase D (PLD) and phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase (PIPK) are activated. Lipid signaling molecules such as phosphatidic acid, D-myo-inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3), and phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PIP2) start to accumulate from heat stress and tigger the calcium channels open, resulting in calcium influx. On a side note, it should be noted that a reduction in phospholipase C9 activity is correlated with lower concentration of IP3, sHSP downregulation, and lower thermotolerance. 

The mechanistic relationship between lipid signaling response to heat stress and plasma membrane channels (whether it is direct or indirect) is still unclear. The chronological order of events in heat stress sensing and signaling response also remains as a question to be answered. It is likely that the signaling pathways function downstream to what's responsible for sensing heat stress in plasma membrane. 

==Change in Histone occupancy==

Histones are proteins that help package DNA. As seen in wild-type plants, the increase in temperature causes a significant decrease in concentration of certain histones such as H2A.Z which contains the nucleosomes that might trigger the changes in transcriptome so that HSR genes are initiated. Scientists also found that the decrease in H2A.Z histone concentration might also cause the change in the expression of a specific transcription factor or other regulatory proteins which can initiate the response of transcriptome. After screening for mutants impaired in heat sensing, it was discovered that the ARP6 gene is possibly responsible for mediation of responses to temperature changes. ARP6 codes for a SWR1 subunit that is required in order for H2A.Z to be inserted into nucleosomes, instead of H2A. It was shown that warming in wild-type plants result in significant decrease in H2A.Z occupancy in nucleosomes where the transcription for warming-induced genes starts. Since less histones are in the way, this allows for more transcriptions of these warming-induced genes. Less H2A.Z occupancy in certain HSP promoters can also affect transcription factor and other regulatory proteins' expression and DNA binding ability, ultimately inducing transcriptome response. It is, however, unsure whether the occupancy of the histones is the cause for heat sensing related to acquired thermotolerance. &lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt;.

==Unfolded Protein Response==

Heat stress may activate the unfolded protein response (UPR) in both ER and Cytosol which can initiate heat stress response(HSR). The UPR is the weakening of protein stability. In the ER pathway, unfolded proteins can enter the nuclei and therefore affect the transcription of certain genes. This will lead to an accumulation of ER chaperone transcripts which will alter the metabolism of the cell in order to adapt to the heat.&lt;ref name=&quot;Finka&quot; /&gt; Beside heat stress, UPR can also be activated by specific chemicals that cause UPR or changes in certain abiotic aspects.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moreno&quot;&gt; Moreno, A.A. and Orellana A. (2011) The Physiological role of the unfolded protein response in plants. ''Biol. Res''. 44, 75-80.&lt;/ref&gt; Because few unfolded proteins and HSR chaperones are likely to exist under mild heat conditions, the UPR is considered to be not as sensitive as the PM heat response.&lt;ref name=&quot;Finka&quot; /&gt;



==ROS Signaling==

Different metabolic pathways are likely to depend on enzymes with different responsiveness to unnecessary heat. From this reason. it has been proposed that heat stress might uncouple some metabolic pathways and cause the accumulation of unwanted by-products. An example of such by-product is reactive oxygen species (ROS). Studies have shown that the accumulation of ROS is mostly likely due to the change in fluidity of the plasma membrane.&lt;ref name=&quot;Königshofer&quot;&gt; Königshofer, H. ''et al''. (2008) Early events in signaling high-temperature stress in tobacco BY2 Cells involve alterations in membrane fluidity and enhanced hydrogen peroxide production. ''Plant Cell Environ.'' 31, 1771-1780.&lt;/ref&gt; This event is most likely a positive feedback loop since the accumulation of ROS will also open up more calcium channels in the plasma membrane and therefore lead to more calcium influx into the cell.&lt;ref name=&quot;Finka&quot; /&gt; Therefore, it seems that the plasma membrane heat sensing is highly interlinked with ROS signaling. A large accumulation of ROS may lead to program cell death.&lt;ref name=&quot;Finka&quot; /&gt;

==Conclusion==

Although scientists have proposed possible ways in which plants can sense heat, there is still much we don’t understand about the specific mechanisms and the order of events. How the signals from the speciated sensors integrate with each other within the network of signal transduction is also still of an important question that is yet to be answered. There could be additional pathways not yet discovered but crucial to heat stress response.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
Mismatch Repair in mammals is an important mechanism in the overall processes of DNA repair. Mismatch Repair (MMR) works by removing incorrect base pair match-ups in double-stranded DNA and replacing it with the correct base pair. However, MMR has other known functions, including mutagenesis in different ''in vivo'' conditions.

==Canonical MMR Mechanism==
Errors in DNA replication pose many problems to both the integrity of the DNA and to the individual. MMR is one way that these errors are fixed, as it is known that deficiency in MMR causes cancerous tumors in animal models. 

The basic MMR system relies on the proteins, MutSα, MutLα, EXO1, RFC, PCNA, RPA, polymerase-δ, and DNA ligase I. There are three basic steps of MMR known as licensing, degradation, and resynthesis. 

===Licensing===
In licensing, MutSα binds to the mismatch error in the DNA strand, which causes a change in the conformation of MutSα into a sliding clamp. This change is dependent upon an exchange of ADP for ATP. MutLα is recruited to forma  ternary complex with MutSα, which then diffuses along the DNA strand until it reaches PCNA.

PCNA, or proliferating cell nuclear antigen, is a protein that can undergo a conformational change to become a ring around DNA. To attach to the DNA, it relies on the function of RFC, or replication factor C. This protein uses ATP hydrolysis to attach the PCNA to the DNA. This attachment is only efficient when there is a &quot;nick&quot; in the DNA, or an apyrimidinic (AP) site. The PCNA can then attach to the 3' end of the nick. While RFC can add PCNA without a nick in the DNA, this is down with extremely low efficiency. 

Once it reaches PCNA, the cryptic endonuclease of MutLα is activated and causes additional nicks that are on both sides of the mismatch error on the same strand. This is only necessary for PCNA binding on the 3' side of the mismatch. Nicks are only made on the same strand as the mismatch because PCNA is not symmetric and has distinct sides to it. As such, MutLα can only interact with PCNA on a specific face and the complex will have a certain orientation, which remains constant even when sliding across the DNA. MutLα has endonuclease activity on one of its heterodimer subunit, PMS2, and this will only nick the same strand as the PCNA binding.

The reason that nicks are made close by to the mismatch (which is essential for DNA repair) is because the complex making the nicks, MutSα/MutLα, has the highest number around the mismatch site, correlating with greater PCNA collision frequency. This is especially important in replication, where the PCNA molecules adhere to the DNA for an extended period of time even after replication. Due to RFC, they are loaded at the 3' terminus of an Okazaki fragment of the leading strand. They adhere with a certain orientation, which allows MutSα/MutLα to cleave the nascent DNA strand, even though the gap around the Okazaki fragment has long been linked. As such, the MMR system has the correct directionality due to this nick generation.

[[File:DNA Repair.jpg|thumb|DNA Repair by DNA ligase I]]

===Degradation===

In degradation, EXO1 is loaded at the nicks created by the PCNA-activated MutSα/MutLα complex. This creates a large gap that starts the nick and ends around 150 bases afteer the mismatch. This gap is single-stranded and on the same side as the mismatch. EXO1 is an exonuclease that can only cut in a 5' to 3' direction. 

===Resynthesis===

Resynthesis involves PCNA, polymerase-δ, and DNA ligase I in order to replace the removed bases and, overall, fix the mismatch error.

===EXO1 Independent Mechanism===
Although not proven in humans, EXO1 deficient mice showed less mutations than MSH2 and MLH1 deficient mice, indicating a mismatch repair mechanism that does not require EXO1. Indeed, a 5' nick MMR mechanism could occur without EXO1 through use of polymerase-δ and MutSα, RPA, RFC, and PCNA. When there is a 5' nick from the mismatch error, polymerase-δ can catalyze strand displacement, whereby FEN1 can catalyze the removal of the strand containing the mismatch. DNA ligase I would then seal the nick formed.

==Insertion/Deletion Loops and Trinucleotide Repeats==

Insertion/Deletion loops (IDLs) and trinucleotide repeats (TNRs) interact largely with MMR in both error-preventing and error-propagating ways.

===Origin of IDLs===

IDLs arise due to the activity of polymerase on TNRs. Trinucleotide repeats are large number of repeats of a single tripley of nucleotides. Such repeats have been implicated in diseases such as Fragile X. When polymerase reads these repeats, it slows down. However, helicase does not slow down, and due to being relatively faster, there becomes long strands of single stranded DNA. As such, these strands can bunch up and form an IDL. This would cause polymerase to create shorter than usual DNA strands.

===The Error-Preventing Role of MMR===

When things such as this happen, MMR can work to fix it. If the loops is less than two to three extrahelical nucleotides long, the canonical MMR can fix it. However, if the loop is longer, there is a MutSβ-mediated way for loops to be fixed. However, this happens by some other MMR mechanism, for in the regular process, PCNA would not be able to diffuse past the large loop. Thus, there must be some non EXO1-mediated MMR.

===The Error-Propagating Role of MMR===

In certain cases, MMR may be &quot;hijacked&quot; to cause TNR expansion. In the event that there is a cruciform loop structure, where there are loops in both strands in the same relative position, a cleavage by PCNA attached by RFC onto one of the loops activating MutSβ and MutLα endonucleolytic activity may cause one of the loops to collapse. When polymerase replaces the missing nucleotides, there will be an extension of the trinucleotide repeat. A larger number of repeats has been linked to more severe disease in diseases that are caused by TNRs, and so this is an important field of study.

==Antibody Variation and Class-Switching==

Antibody variation, although due to a variety of reasons, is largely dependent on the role of MMR. After VDJ recombination, a process involving recombination of the variable, diversity, and join regions of the immunoglobulin genes, a variety of IgM antibodies can be made. However, there are further mechnanisms for antibody variability.

===The role of MMR in Somatic Hypermutation===

Somatic hypermutation (SHM) is a process whereby many mutations arise in the variable region of the antibody. It works through activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) where C nucleotides are converted to U. This occurs during transcription, because AID works best on single-stranded DNA. When this occurs, there is a mismatch error on the resultant DNA. As such, uracil DNA-glycosylase works to do base-excision repair (BER) and remove the incorrect U nucleotide. However, once this happens there is an apyrimidinic site (AP) remaining. This site can be the target of EXO1 in order for MMR to occur.

In this case, EXO1 cleavage may cause a large swath of DNA to be excised. When polymerase goes to fix it, AP sites and remaining uracil nucleotides may cause incorrect mutations at the sites where AID acts. This would result in changes in the variable site of the antibody and ultimately, different antigen recognition.

===The role of MMR in Class-Switch Recombination===

MMR can also cause the type of antibody to change, such as from IgG to IgM while recognizing the same type of antigen. When there are two AP sites and EXO1 causes the excision of a section of DNA to the other gap, class-switch recombination (CSR) can occur due to a double-strand break.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The following interactions; ion-ion, ion-dipole, dipole-dipole, dispersion, and Van Der Waals with respect to the strength of the interaction vary in terms of strength levels.  The strength of the interaction rests largely on the distance on which they can act on each other.  

==Ion-Ion Interactions==

Coulomb’s law delivers that the electric force acting on a point charge q1 as a result of the presence of a second point charge q2. 
The potential energy, U(r), is given by the equation:
U(r)= (q1q2)/(4*π*E0)*(1/r).  In which potential energy arises from the forces between species.
Where q1 and q2 are the two charges, separated by a distance “r” in the vacuum.  E0 is the permittivity of a vacuum and 1/(4*π*E0) represents Coulombs’ constant. This equation is characteristic of the relationship between two charges.  The ion-ion interactions act over a large distance. Or it can be said that the two charges interact with each other via U~1/r.

==Dipole-Dipole==
For dipole-dipole interactions assume two polar molecules A and B having permanent dipole moments L1 and L2.   The force one molecule exerting on another will depend on L1 and L2, the distance r, and the relative orientation.  The dipole moments of two molecules tend to align with the positive end of one dipole near the negative end of the other, so that the forces of attraction between them are maximized.   The potential energy of the interaction can be simplified to 
U= -2L1L2/ (4*π* E0*r^3) for a horizontal orientation and U= -2L1L2/ (4*π* E0*r^3) for a vertical orientation.  The negative sign indicates that the interaction is attractive. 
For dipole-dipole interactions the two dipoles interact with each other via U~1/r^3.

==Ion-Dipole==

For ion-dipole interactions the interaction between an ion and polar molecule is given by: U=-(qL)/( 4*π* E0*r^2)  where q=ion charge and L again represents the dipole. 
Note: The equation is valid when the ion and dipole lie along the same axis.  
For ion-dipole interactions the cation and negatively charged end of the dipole interact with each other via U~1/r^2.

==Ion-Induced Dipole==

For ion-induced dipoles the interaction is dependent on the orientation of the dipole and for dipole-induced-dipole interactions is dependent on the polarizability of the molecule in which the dipole is induced.   Ion-induced dipoles interact with each other via U~1/r^2 and dipole-induced-dipole interactions interact with each other via U~1/r^5. 

==Dispersion &amp; Van Der Waals Interactions==
Dispersion interactions otherwise known as London interactions interact with each other via U~1/r^6.   Van der Waals Repulsion repels at an even shorter distance and is based upon the Pauli exclusion principle.  One can calculate the interaction utilizing quantum mechanics.  These interactions are dependent on the inverse of the 12th power of the distance, U~1/r^12. 
John Edward Lennard accounted for the repulsive and attraction interactions in nonionic systems: U=-A/r^6+B/r^12 where A and B are constants for two interacting molecules which gives the general form of the equation: 
U=4*E*[(H/r)^12-(H/r)^6]  for a given pair of molecules where E is the depth of the potential  well and H is the separation at which U=0.   Therefore Van Der Waals interactions are dependent upon U~1/r^12. 

The ranking of the above interactions in descending order are as follows:  
Ion-ion, ion-dipole, ion-induced dipole, dipole-induced-dipole, dispersion forces, and Van Der Waals interactions. 

Again, the strength of the interaction rests largely on the distance on which they can act on each other.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''p53''' is one of the most extensively studied [[Structural Biochemistry/Tumor suppressor genes|tumor suppressors]] in multicellular organisms. It was discovered in 1979 and over 60,000 papers have been published about it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Viadiu&quot;&gt;Viadiu, Hector. &quot;Gene Recognition by the P53 Protein Family.&quot; CHEM 114A Lecture. University of California, San Diego, La Jolla. 14 Nov. 2012. Lecture.&lt;/ref&gt; It is nicknamed &quot;Guardian of the Genome&quot; and in 1993 it was named the &quot;Molecule of the Year&quot; by ''Science'' Magazine.&lt;ref name=&quot;Viadiu&quot;/&gt; It is also known as “protein 53” or “tumor protein 53” and is part of the small p53 family which also includes [[Structural Biochemistry/P63|p63]] and [[Structural Biochemistry/p73|p73]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Bissol&quot;&gt;Andrea Bisso1, Licio Collavin1, and Giannino Del &quot;p73 as a Pharmaceutical Target for Cancer Therapy&quot; Laboratorio Nazionale CIB, Area Science Park, Padriciano 99, 34149 Trieste, Italy. 2Dipartimento di Scienze della Vita, Universitàdi Trieste, Via L. Giorgieri 1, 34100, Trieste, Italy/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;. This tumor suppressor is regulated by a gene called “TP53 gene”. p53 works by sensing oncogenic cytotoxic and genotoxic stress signals and responds by signaling for cell-cycle arrest as well as apoptosis in order to prevent the cells from further growing. Several experiments have shown that loss of p53, due to inactivation, rearrangement or some other change that causes the protein to lose it's function, promotes the growth and survival of cancer. &lt;ref name=&quot;Levine&quot;&gt;Levine, Arnold J., and Moshe Oren. &quot;The First 30 Years of P53: Growing Ever More Complex.&quot; Nature Reviews Cancer 9.10 (2009): 749-58. Print. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2771725/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;. It is estimated that 50% of the people who have cancer have a mutation in the p53 protein &lt;ref name=&quot;Viadiu&quot;/&gt;

[[File:p53.png|thumb|Cartoon representation of a complex between DNA and the protein p53 (described in Cho et al. Science 265 pp. 346, 1994 [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=8023157])]]

The tumor suppressor p53 in humans is a polypeptide of 393 amino acids that take up five domains. p53 is active as a tetramer that has four identical chains of 393 residues. The N-terminal region consists of disordered transcription domains and a proline rich region. At the C terminus, p53 contains the regulatory domain of unfolded basic amino acids that binds DNA nonspecifically as a transcription factor. &lt;ref name=&quot;Joerger&quot;&gt;Joerger AC, Fersht AR. The tumor suppressor p53: From structures to drug discovery. Cold Spring Harb Perspect Biol. 2010;2:a000919.&lt;/ref&gt;
The protein is normally found in the cytoplasm of the cell. If the cell is properly functioning and the p53 protein is not needed, then it is degraded by the MDM2 protein.&lt;ref name =&quot;Viadiu&quot;/&gt; If the cell is stressed or there is something wrong, then p53 is passed to the nucleus where is dimerizes and eventually tetramerizes to act as a transcription factor.&lt;ref name =&quot;Viadiu&quot;/&gt;. 

==Structure==
p53 is a tumor protein that codes for a protein which regulates the cell cycle. There are three domains in the p53 protein that are responsible for directly DNA repair or cell death.&lt;ref name =&quot;Viadiu&quot;/&gt; The three domains are responsible for binding to DNA, recruiting proteins (other transcription factors) to the DNA, and the third domain is a regulatory domain in the C-terminus that regulates the binding of p53 to DNA. &lt;ref name =&quot;Viadiu&quot;/&gt; The wide-type p53 is a libile protein that is comprised of folded and unstructured regions which function in a synergistic manner.&lt;ref name =&quot;Viadiu&quot;/&gt; 
===N Terminus p53===
The N terminus of p53 has unfolded regions, but has secondary residual structures that contain hydrophobic resides. The acidic TAD, the main body, which has 2 ill-defined subdomains (TAD1 &amp; TAD2), has binding sites for multiple interactions with proteins that deal with transcription machinery and transcriptionary coactivators. Thanks to the intrinsic disorder of TAD it can facilitate the binding of diverse proteins with high specificity. The n terminus of p53 deals with post translation modification where multiple phosphorylation of serine and threonine residues, by several protein kinases, happen which shift the affinity for different proteins that compete to bind with p53. The proline rich region that is in the n terminus links the TAD to the DNA binding domain of the humans. The PXXP motifs, which are in p53 help modify and mediate the protein to protein interactions. &lt;ref name=&quot;Joerger&quot; /&gt;

===DNA-Binding Domain===
The DNA binding site for p53 is 20 nucleotides long. As the protein is a tetramer, this means that each dimer binds to 10-basepair sequences that have the general pattern Pu Pu Pu C A/T A/T G Py Py Py from the 5' to 3'direction.&lt;ref name =&quot;Viadiu&quot;/&gt; Thanks to the crystal and solution structure of p53C, the structures have been found in which there are complexes within the p53C that bound to domains of signaling protein. This consists of immunoglobulin beta sandwich that is able to provide a scaffold for DNA-binding surfaces. There is a loopsheet helix motif which dock to the DNA major grooves including loop L1, and beta strands of S2 &amp; S2'. Although these loops are large, they are stabilized by a zinc ion. If this zinc is lost, there will a be a decrease in the thermodynamic stability and a increase in the aggregation tendencies. &lt;ref name=&quot;Joerger&quot; /&gt;

===C Terminus===
The C terminus consists of regions in the protein that help tetramerization. With the help of 3 residues, it forms the central hydrophobic core of the dimer. Formation of stable dimers are through high protein concentrations in the solution. Some extreme C terminus may be intrinsically disordered through local disorders to order transitions from binding to nonspecific DNA or proteins. Some motifs from residues may affect the confirmation. The C terminus is required for efficient binding and transactivation of target genes in large molecules of DNA. &lt;ref name=&quot;Joerger&quot; /&gt;

'''Mechanism'''
p53 plays an important role in cell cycle control and apoptosis. The defective p53 could also allow abnormal cells to proliferate, which then results in cancer. When the DNA is damaged, it will trigger the increase of p53 proteins, which have three major functions. They are DNA repair, growth arrest, and apoptosis (cell death). The cellular concentration of p53 must be tightly regulated. However, the high level of p53 may accelerlate the aging process by excessive apoptosis. 

'''Role of p53 in Disease'''
The tumore supression is reduced when the p53 is reduced. p53 also damaged in cells by mutagens (viruses, chemicals, or rediation). Also, p53 itself can inhibit normal p53 (Blagosklonny, 2002).

==p53 Target Gene Recognition==
p53 regulates the gene transcription binding to double-stranded DNA sequences of its choices. In other words, the p53 protein acts as a transcription factor. Each half-site that the p53 can be described as an inverted pentameric quarter site. The human genome is found to have a high probability binding loci that contains half sites without insertion. Within p53C domains, there are 4 spots that bind to response elements which increase upon binding to full length proteins. The teramers also demonstrate different areas of binding which is formed through a symmetrical dimer. The interface is stabilized within the loops that bind by hydrophobic and water mediated polar contacts. Weak protein-protein interactions are observed within the dimers that can reflect to the response elements within the different spacers. The key residues in the DNA interface make direct contact with DNA half sites inside the DNA minor groove. When making contact, it makes salt bridges that help bind. Although the specific contacts with DNA is important, the residue in the DNA domain are disordered sometimes. &lt;ref name=&quot;Joerger&quot; /&gt;

==p53 Cancer &amp; Mutations==
Although the p53 may help in repressing tumor, some mutations of the TP53 gene is found in some human cancers. These cancers may have over 17,000 cases of somatic p53 missense mutations. Some causes may be the common ancestor found between the p53 genes. There are different mutant classes amongst the mutants. Contact mutations remove DNA-contact residues, while structural mutations affect residues that are essential in the big picture of the DNA binding surface. The equilibrium unfolding and denaturation allow response elements to find even more mutant classes. B sandwich mutations are found in 1/3 of cancer cases in which the B sandwich cannot collapse with the surrounding structure. The mutation destabilizes the protein losing the hydrophobic interactions. &lt;ref name=&quot;Joerger&quot; /&gt;
Most of the mutations in p53 are missense mutations that affect the DNA binding domain region of the protein. When this happens, the molecule is not longer able to bind to DNA which results in a loss of function.&lt;ref name =&quot;Irwin&quot;&gt; Irwin, Meredith S. &quot;Family Fued in Chemosensitivity.&quot; Cell Cycle 3.3 (2004): 319-23. PubMed.gov. Web. 14 Nov. 2012. &lt;http://www.landesbioscience.com/journals/cc/irwinCC3-3.pdf&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; In other cases it has been found that the molecule still tetramerizes and is still capable of binding to DNA, but it no longer can function as a transcription factor. &lt;ref name =&quot;Viadiu&quot;/&gt; 

In the case of mutations that result in the protein losing its ability to bind to DNA, there is a subgroup of mutations that actually result in a &quot;gain of function&quot; and p53 now has an oncogenic role&lt;ref name =&quot;Irwin&quot;/&gt;. It this case, it is believed that p53 binds to the DNA binding domain of p73, thus inactivating p73 by preventing it from binding to its targets. As a result, this inhibits that pathways p73 is responsible for, transactivation and apoptosis, thus further promoting cancer&lt;ref name =&quot;Irwin&quot;/&gt; This inactivation of p73 by an alread inactive p53 further results in a decreased response to chemotherapy&lt;ref name =&quot;Irwin&quot;/&gt;.
P53 inhibits tumor formation through the use of Cell Cycle Arrest, Apoptosis and Senecence. This gene has the ability to induce cell apoptosis as part of its role as a tumor suppressor. P53 becomes activated by damage in the cell and is suppressed by MDM2 and when P53 becomes too activated to be suppressed it is possible for it to activate the apoptosis pathway in the cell, among other pathways. Some of the proteins that activate p53 are the MAPK proteins, ATR, TP53RK, and p14ARF. The acetylation sites on p53 play a key role in controlling the specific p53 activation sites and if both are mutated the mutation causes the loss of ability for p53 to induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.

==Regulation of p53==
MDM-2 (murine double minute 2) is the negative regulator of p53 and acts by binding to the first 42 N-terminal residues that contain a transactivation domain.&lt;ref name=&quot;Belyi&quot;&gt;Belyi, Vladimir A., Prashanth Ak, Haijian Wang, Wenwei Hu, Anna Puzio-Kuter, and Arnold J. Levine. &quot;The Originals and Evolution of the P53 Family of Genes.&quot; Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Biology, n.d. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; When MDM-2 binds to p53, is causes a α-helix conformation to form which is successful in blocking the transcription and ubiquitinating lysine resides in the C-terminal domain region. When stress signals or abnormal cell division is sensed, the ARF gene is transcribed and its purpose is to bind to MDM-2 and inhibit its activity and allowing p53 levels to rise.&lt;ref name=&quot;Belyi&quot;/&gt; 
==3D Structure==
Determining the 3D structure of p53 has been very difficult due to the very complicated folding, especially in the C- and N- termini. The best way to study the three dimensional structure of this interesting protein is to look at the structure of each of its domains separately. The domains structure that have been solved so far are the tetramerization domain; DNA binding domain in complex with DNA, a complex with a transactivation domain; and some parts of the regulatory domain in complex with proteins.&lt;ref name=&quot;Joerger&quot;/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
Warfarin is an oral anticoagulant to prevent new blood clots from forming. Blood clot is the aggregation of platelets in the blood vessels and the formation of fibrin network which traps the additional blood cells which can cause heart attack, stroke or other medical problems. &lt;ref&gt;[1]&lt;/ref&gt;

Warfarin also is used to treat venous thrombosis (which is the swelling and blood clot in a vein). It is used to prevent pulmonary embolism (blood clot in the lung). Warfarin also can be called anticoagulants (&quot;blood thinners&quot;).

==Coagulation==
Blood coagulation is the process of formation of blood clots. It involves a series, known as the “coagulation cascade.” Each step of the cascade involves a protease, a zymogen, a non-enzymatic protein cofactor, platelets surface, and calcium ions.  In each step, zymogen is converted to an active protease by cleavage of one or more peptide bonds in the zymogen. Thrombin is the last in a series of coagulation enzymes that are activated by proteolysis of zymogen. Thrombin then converts the soluble fibrinogen into insoluble fibrin, which eventually forms a fibrin meshwork and the ultimate blood clot.&lt;ref&gt;[2]&lt;/ref&gt;


==Who needs Warfarin?==
Patients with prosthetic heart valves, irregular heartbeat, thrombosis, and embolism are prescribed warfarin. 

==Overview==
The chemical name of Warfarin is 4-hydroxy-3-(3-oxo-1-phenylbutyl)-2H-chromen-2-one, and the chemical formula is C19H16O4. 

==How it works==
Warfarin is used to decrease the ability of clotting of blood. It works by inhibiting vitamin-K-dependent coagulation factors. It inhibits the production of clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X. These factors require carboxylation of glutamic acid residues to bind phospholipids to the factors, which is a vitamin-K-related process.
After vitamin K is converted to vitamin K epoxide in the liver by oxidation, vitamin K epoxide is then reduced to vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKOR) by an enzyme. This reduced epoxide is necessary for the production of coagulation factors. Therefore, warfarin plays a role in prohibiting the actions of VKOR in the liver, so available amount of vitamin-K that can be used for oxidation and the production of coagulation factors is decreased. &lt;ref&gt;[3]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[4]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diet for patients taking warfarin==
It is recommended to avoid food which is rich in vitamin K, for example, green leafy vegetables, liver, and vegetable oils.

How medicine works can be affected by the food people eat. Warfarin is a medicine prescribed for people with high risk of forming blood clots. It can prevent harmful blood clots, which may block the flow of blood to the heart or brain from forming.  Vitamin K is a vitamin usually found in leafy green vegetables. In contract of Warfarin, vitamin K plays a major role in blood clotting in the body. It is used to reverse the effects of “blood thinning” medications like Warfarin. Warfarin decreases the activity of vitamin K and lengthening the time it takes for a clot to form. Therefore, in order to make warfarin work effectively, it is very important to keep vitamin K intake as consistent as possible. First, keep intake of high vitamin K foods consistent. Second, do not have large changes in the medium vitamin K foods intake. Third, be careful about dietary supplements. It is not wise to take vitamin E or fish oil supplements. Finally, dietitian or physician may restrict cranberry juice from your diet.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:AmericanShubunkinRodsan18c.jpg|200px|right]]
This is a guide to modify a cylindrical container into an aquaponic fish or aquatic animal tank for inclusion in a hydroculture system. A barrel, over-sized bucket or new container (garbage) bin can be used to make this aquatic tank: containers that are over 30 gallons are ideal for this project. The purpose is to use ornamental fish waste to fertilize plants. Here are project assembly components to choose from.

==Components==
All component materials should be nonhazardous/noncancerous. For tools and supplementary instructions see: [[Hydroculture/DIY|hydroculture DIY]]
* cylindrical plastic container: new plastic recycle bin, barrel or over-sized bucket
* o-rings
* threaded elbow
* corresponding threaded adapters
* water pump
* washer with screen
* Additional pipe, o-rings and connectors: use 1/2in to 1in pipe and smaller tubing for water flow.
** smaller size tubing and pipes are suitable for drainage. 1in piping offers less restriction, and larger sizes are unnecessary for water flow.
* pipe primer and cement

==Aquatic tank==
For an outdoor aquatic tank an overflow connection with a screen must be installed close to the top. Use two threaded fittings, with a washer with screen in between: it may not be necessary for this connection to be especially watertight.

==Water pump==
High voltage water pumps can be a ''hazard'' if damaged or mishandled. BLDC pumps are efficient and usually operate on a much safer voltage. An airlift pump may also work, if the aquaponics system doesn't require high water pressure.  Use wider diameter pipe to carry the water above the height of the tank, then it can be diverted into multiple smaller channels. ''No'' electrical connections or not watertight components may be exposed to water. Plug components higher than water-level or have a drip loop, so water does not drip into an electrical socket or other connection. The choices of how to transfer water from the aquatic tank to the plants are as follows.
===External===
For an external water pump, a hole has to be cut into the side of the cylindrical container, 1/3 way from the bottom. This must b
===Internal===
Make connections from water pump connection to wider diameter pipe, using proper connectors. The pump's electrical wire must be long enough, and it cannot be exposed to potential damage, and the connection away from potential water contact. On the side top of the aquatic tank, drill a hole to insert a threaded plug and o-ring from the outside. From the inside fit on pvc threaded ''snap tee'', o-rings to the threaded plug. The snap tee is to hold the pipe attached to the pump vertically inside the tank.

===Airlift pump===
For an airlift pump, smaller diameter pipe keeps air and water pressure higher allowing water to flow further. This can limit the height a water-flow can reach and water-flow pressure. Micro-sprinklers may be useful as micro-drippers in this case. 

==Options==

===Connect to other hydroculture systems===
This aquaponic setup can be connected to an aeroponic or hydroponic system.

===Growbed===
If the growbed or plant container is to be lower than the tank, a check valve and additional water pump is required.

==What Is A Destination?==
A destination is a place you need to go in a game to win the said game. There are often obstacles in the way who are either there by coincidence and just like to squash, slash or in some way harm you, or don't want you to get to your destination. All great games have something like it. It could a checkered line in a racing game or an enemy that needs to be defeated. It's your decision.

{{BBR/Note|
'''BLENDER NOTE: For The Novice'''

What is a material? It's a data block on an object that stores things like whether that object is invisible, if it reflects, if it gives off light, etc.. Objects are also recognised in the BGE with their material. You don't need a material but it helps. For more info:

==Now To Make It==
Now let's have a destination. Find a nice place that the character must walk to. Add an empty there or maybe an object with great twists and turns. Make it obvious that you need to get to it or that it is of great importance in the game. Now make sure that the character has a material on it like Hero or Main Char or Char. This material will be used to figure out if the character has walked into the object.

Select the destination object. Now add a Touch Sensor, an And and a Scene Actuator. Connect them all. Now take the touch sensor and select the character's material in its field. This will detect when an object with the material [Character's Material] touches it.

===Scenes Are What?===
{{BBR/Note|
'''BLENDER NOTE: For The Novice'''

What are scenes? For ease you may go to [[Beyond Blender Render/Scenes|this page]] for more information.}}
Now we must add a scene. Name it something like WIN or MWAH HA HA I WON or something like that. Wait.  What are scenes for in the BGE? We know [[Beyond Blender Render/Scenes|here]].

{{BBR/Note|
'''BLENDER NOTE: For Everyone'''

A text object is basically text that can be seen in a render. You can scale, rotate and move it like a normal object but you can still edit it like text.

To edit the text in a text object select it and than press '''TAB'''. Write any thing you want like you do in a normal text editor. When you're done press '''TAB''' again.}}

We used Won for the scene name. Add some text in the Won scene and write some nice message.

Now head back to the gameplay scene. Select the destination object. Now let's compare our logic and correct it if necessary:

[[File:Won logic1.png|800|center|Let's set a new scene. Use this idea for any new scene.]]

Now let's save. This is important in Blender because it can occasionally crash. Save as much as possible and remember: Blender doesn't ask you if you want to save when you close!

Now start the game engine. Let's see what it's like.

Now this is boring! We need some obstacles! Well, let's make a landscape.

[[File:Trp cage folding.gif|x300px|right|frame|Simple example of a molecular dynamics cage that shows the folding of a small amino acid chain, the tryptophan cage, in implicit solvent.]]
Classical molecular dynamics (MD) is a branch of computational chemistry that focuses on simulating the motion of particles according to Newton's Laws of Motion.&lt;ref&gt;Meller, Jarosaw. &quot;Molecular Dynamics&quot; Encyclopedia of Life Sciences, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Atoms are approximated as &quot;balls on springs,&quot; which allows for the application of the following laws:

&lt;math&gt; f = ma &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; v = v_0 + at &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; x = vt + \frac 1 2 a t^2 &lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt; is position, &lt;math&gt; v &lt;/math&gt; is velocity, &lt;math&gt; a &lt;/math&gt; is acceleration, and &lt;math&gt; t &lt;/math&gt; is time.

Classical MD approximations treat bond and angle potentials as harmonic, and dihedrals as periodic. This allows for expression of the energy of a system with an equation similar to the following used by the AMBER molecular dynamics program: &lt;ref&gt; R. Salomon-Ferrer, D.A. Case, R.C.Walker. An overview of the Amber biomolecular simulation package. WIREs Comput. Mol. Sci.(2012) &lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt; E_{\rm total} = \sum_{\rm bonds} K_r (r - r_{eq})^2
                     + \sum_{\rm angles} K_\theta (\theta - \theta_{eq})^2
                     + \sum_{\rm dihedrals} {V_n \over 2} 
                                       [1 + {\rm cos}(n\phi - \gamma)] 
          
                     + \sum_{i&lt;j} \left [ {A_{ij} \over R_{ij}^{12}} - 
                                          {B_{ij} \over R_{ij}^6} + 
                                          {q_iq_j \over \epsilon R_{ij}} 
                                 \right ]
                     + \sum_{\rm H-bonds} 
                            \left [ {C_{ij} \over R_{ij}^{12}} - 
                                    {D_{ij} \over R_{ij}^{10}} \right ] &lt;/math&gt;

Simulations are conducted in a series of &quot;time steps.&quot; In each step, the force on each atom is calculated according to the derivative of the energy equation. The atom is moved a certain distance corresponding to the magnitude and direction of the force over the size of the time step. The process is repeated over many time steps, iteratively calculating forces and solving the equations of motion based on the accelerations from the forces, and produces results that mimic complex behavior from docking of pharmaceutical compounds to the folding of simple proteins.

[[File:Mdalgorithm.PNG|x200px|right|frame|A simplified view of the steps a molecular dynamics simulation will take. Production MD codes use more complicated versions of this algorithm that incorporate temperature and pressure control.]]

==Limitations==

===Quantum Effects===
Although atoms are known to behave according to the Schroedinger equation rather than by Newton's Laws, classical methods can be used with reasonable accuracy. A good indication of this can be given by checking the De Broglie wavelength of the particles involved &lt;ref&gt;J. P. Hansen and I. R. McDonald, Theory of Simple Liquids, 2nd Ed., Academic, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;:

&lt;math&gt; \Lambda = \sqrt{ \frac {2\pi\hbar^2} {Mk_BT} } &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; M &lt;/math&gt; is the atomic mass and &lt;math&gt; T &lt;/math&gt; is the temperature. The classical approximation is justified when &lt;math&gt; \Lambda \ll &lt;/math&gt; the mean nearest neighbor separation between particles. So for heavier systems, such as organic molecules, the classical approximation is reasonable, but for light systems such as H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, He, or Ne, the method loses considerable accuracy.

Since atoms are approximated as discrete particles, interactions of smaller particles cannot be correctly modeled with classical MD.&lt;ref&gt;Ercolessi, Furio. &quot;A Molecular Dynamics Primer&quot; University of Udine Spring College in Computational Physics, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; 
Making and breaking chemical bonds, noncovalent reaction intermediates, and proton or electron tunneling all cannot be simulated with this method. Simulations at very low temperature are also problematic, as near absolute zero classical mechanics are increasingly disfavored for quantum  explanations. Quantum molecular dynamics methods exist for simulations that can be more electronically realistic, but at much greater computational cost.

===System size and timescale===
The number of atoms and amount of time that may be simulated is directly related to available computing power. Although the entirety of a small virus has been simulated before,&lt;ref&gt;Peter L. Freddolino, Anton S. Arkhipov, Steven B. Larson, Alexander McPherson, and Klaus Schulten. Molecular dynamics simulations of the complete satellite tobacco mosaic virus. Structure, 14:437-449, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; the majority of fine-grained, all-atom simulations that take place are on the scale of proteins rather than organelles or complex assemblies. This is because the length of time that is necessary to simulate to observe results directly relates to system size:

==== Table  - Timescales of molecular processes====
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Secs&lt;th&gt;name &lt;th&gt; Process
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;10&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;th&gt; &lt;th&gt; Surface reorganizations
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;th&gt; milliseconds &lt;th&gt; Protein Folding
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;th&gt; 10 nanoseconds &lt;th&gt; NMR
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;th&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;+3&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;th&gt; Brownian dynamics
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;th&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;sup&gt; &lt;th&gt; Lattice Monte-Carlo
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;th&gt; picoseconds &lt;th&gt; Fast vibrations
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;10&lt;sup&gt;−15&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;th&gt; femtoseconds &lt;th&gt; Electronic excitation
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

So, the larger the system, the longer the simulation needs to be run to observe relevant behavior. Today, computer hardware specifically designed for molecular dynamics simulations&lt;ref&gt;David E. Shaw, Martin M. Deneroff, Ron O. Dror, Jeffrey S. Kuskin, Richard H. Larson, John K. Salmon, Cliff Young, Brannon Batson, Kevin J. Bowers, Jack C. Chao, Michael P. Eastwood, Joseph Gagliardo, J.P. Grossman, C. Richard Ho, Douglas J. Ierardi, István Kolossváry, John L. Klepeis, Timothy Layman, Christine McLeavey, Mark A. Moraes, Rolf Mueller, Edward C. Priest, Yibing Shan, Jochen Spengler, Michael Theobald, Brian Towles, and Stanley C. Wang (July 2008). &quot;Anton, A Special-Purpose Machine for Molecular Dynamics Simulation&quot;. Communications of the ACM (ACM) 51 (7): 91–97.&lt;/ref&gt;
can run approximately 17 microseconds of a 23,000 atom system in one day with a 0.5 femtosecond timestep. On the same system, a general-purpose parallel supercomputer can obtain on the order of a few hundred nanoseconds of simulation time.

==Thermostats==
Using an approach based on Newton's equations of motion, a simulation is obtained in the &quot;microcanonical ensemble&quot;, which is a constant energy system (nVE). This is unrealistic, however, and in order to produce accurate comparisons to experiment, simulations are most commonly done in the canonical ensemble, which features constant temperature (nVT).&lt;ref&gt;Hunenberger, Phillipe. Thermostat Algorithms for Molecular Dynamics
Simulations DOI:10.1007/b99427&lt;/ref&gt;This temperature must be maintained with an algorithm, which is called a thermostat. There are several thermostats that are commonly used, each of which has its advantages and disadvantages in terms of reliability, accuracy, and computational expense.

A typical simulation involves an MD equilibration phase, at which the structure is simulated at constant temperature for a certain amount of time at 0K, a heating phase where the system is gradually heated to the desired temperature (often 300K), and a final production simulation at that constant temperature. The initial equilibration is necessary not to move the structure to a chemical equilibrium but rather to an energetic minimum (which will usually be near the chemical equilibrium state). If the equilibration were omitted and the simulation run in a region with high energy, the simulation will continue to sample highly energetic phase space, producing results that will be inconsistent with experimental data.&lt;ref&gt;Finnerty, J. &quot;Molecular Dynamics meets the physical world: Thermostats and Barostats&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Langevin Theromostat===
This thermostat follows the Langevin equation of motion rather than Newton's, where a frictional force proportional to the velocity is added to the conservative force, which adjusts the kinetic energy of the particle so that the temperature is correct.&lt;ref&gt;Adelman, S.A. and J.D. Doll, Generalized Langevin Equation Approach for Atom-Solid-Surface Scattering - General Formulation for Classical Scattering Off Harmonic Solids. Journal of Chemical Physics, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;

The system is then described by the equation:

&lt;math&gt; ma = -v\xi + f(r) + f' &lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; are mass, velocity, and acceleration of the particle. &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt; is a frictional constant, and &lt;math&gt;f'&lt;/math&gt; is a random force that will add kinetic energy to the particle. It is sampled from a Gaussian distribution where the variance is a function of the set temperature and the time step. This balances the frictional force to maintain the temperature at the set value.

===The Anderson Thermostat===
This thermostat couples the system to a heat bath at the desired temperature. The bath is represented by collisions with a stocastic particle on randomly selected system particles. 

It has been shown&lt;ref&gt;E, W. and Li, D. (2008), The Andersen thermostat in molecular dynamics. Comm. Pure Appl. Math., 61: 96–136. doi: 10.1002/cpa.20198&lt;/ref&gt; that the addition of stochastic collisions to the Newtonian MD system results in the simulation being a Markov chain that is irreducible and aperiodic. This implies that the generated distribution with Anderson's algorithm is not a canonical distribution.

This thermostat will randomly affect velocities of particles, which results in nonphysical dynamics in the simulated system.

===The Gaussian Thermostat===
This thermostat strongly couples the system with a heat bath set to the desired temperature. Here, the change in momentum for each particle is represented as:&lt;ref&gt;J. Clarke D. Brown. Mol. Phys., 51:1243, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{dp_i}{dt} = \displaystyle\sum_{j}^{N} (F_{ij}|q_i-q_j|) - p_i\alpha &lt;/math&gt;

This rescaling destroys dynamic correlations very quickly, and therefore does not maintain the canonical ensemble.
 
===The Berendsen Thermostat===
This thermostat, first presented in 1984&lt;ref&gt;Berendsen, H.J.C., et al., Molecular-Dynamics with Coupling to an External Bath. Journal of Chemical Physics, 1984. 81(8): p. 3684-3690.&lt;/ref&gt; involves re-scaling of the velocities of each particle in a manner that controls the temperature.

Similar to the Gaussian thermostat, the system is coupled to a heat bath with the desired temperature, although this algorithm uses weak rather than strong coupling, where the temperature of the system is corrected such that the deviation in temperature decays exponentially with some time constant &lt;math&gt;\Tau&lt;/math&gt; proportional to the timestep:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{dT}{dt} = \frac{T_0-T}{\Tau}&lt;/math&gt;

===The Nose-Hoover Thermostat===
This thermostat adds an extra term, &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; to the Newtonian equations of motion, producing the following second-order differential:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{dp_n}{dt} = \displaystyle\sum_{i}^{N} \frac{|p_i|^2}{2m_i} - \frac{3}{2}nk_BT &lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is mass, &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the desired temperature, and &lt;math&gt;k_B&lt;/math&gt; is the Boltzmann constant. The heat bath is given some mass, &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;, which for Nose's suggested value of &lt;math&gt;6nk_BT&lt;/math&gt; produces the above equation for the momentum change of each individual particle.

With this thermostat, the energy of the simulated system fluctuates, but the total energy of the system and heat bath is conserved. If the system is ergodic (all accessible microstates are equally probable), then this system gives the canonical ensemble.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, R. G. (1982). Advanced Physics 31: 669&lt;/ref&gt;

==Force fields==
Molecular dynamics simulations require a &quot;force field,&quot; which lists the parameters involved in each type of interaction in the energy equation. For example, the AMBER force field requires parameters for bond equilibrium length, bond force constant for every possible combination of two atom types, angle equilibrium value, and angle force for every combination of three atom types, dihedral equilibrium phase, dihedral force constant, and dihedral periodicity for every combination of four atom types. Additional parameters also describe the nonbonded (electrostatic) forces for each atom as well.

The development and analysis of these parameters, which collectively are called a force field, is a focus of molecular dynamics research.

===Force field development===
Parameters for classical molecular dynamics ideally lead to behavior that closely approximates that of actual molecules on an atomistic level, which are in reality governed by quantum phenomena. The classical parameters are developed such that this is true- once an energy and force equation (such as the AMBER equation) has been made to establish the paradigm for the system, parameters are derived such that calculated values with them match those calculated with quantum mechanical methods or experiment. Due to the lack of availability of experimental data for the wide variety of molecules and molecular conformations necessary to develop a force field, data from quantum calculations on the systems are used instead.

Force fields are developed for specific classes of molecules. For example, AMBER provides the Amber ff99SB forcefield for proteins&lt;ref&gt;Lindorff‐Larsen, Kresten, et al. &quot;Improved side‐chain torsion potentials for the Amber ff99SB protein force field.&quot; Proteins: Structure, Function, and Bioinformatics 78.8 (2010): 1950-1958.&lt;/ref&gt;, the Glycam forcefield for carbohydrates,&lt;ref&gt;Kirschner, Karl N., et al. &quot;GLYCAM06: a generalizable biomolecular force field. Carbohydrates.&quot; Journal of computational chemistry 29.4 (2007): 622-655.&lt;/ref&gt; and the newly developed lipid forcefield GAFFLipid.&lt;ref&gt;Dickson, C. J., Rosso, L., Betz, R. M., Walker, R. C., &amp; Gould, I. R. (2012). GAFFlipid: a General Amber Force Field for the accurate molecular dynamics simulation of phospholipid. Soft Matter.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, a &quot;General AMBER Force Field,&quot; or GAFF, has been developed for the parameterization of small ligands and other molecules that do not fit into the broad force field categories.

The accuracy of a force field is critical to simulation accuracy. Simple terms, such as dihedral force constants, can have an extremely large effect on overall simulations. In fact, inaccurate dihedral parameters for the protein backbone &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; angles produced simulations that were excessively disposed to alpha helix formation, a fact which affected numerous results.&lt;ref&gt;Best, Robert B., Nicolae-Viorel Buchete, and Gerhard Hummer. &quot;Are current molecular dynamics force fields too helical?.&quot; Biophysical journal 95.1 (2008): L07-L09.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Freddolino, Peter L., et al. &quot;Force field bias in protein folding simulations.&quot; Biophysical journal 96.9 (2009): 3772.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lindorff‐Larsen, Kresten, et al. &quot;Improved side‐chain torsion potentials for the Amber ff99SB protein force field.&quot; Proteins: Structure, Function, and Bioinformatics 78.8 (2010): 1950-1958.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, force field development has been complicated by the lack of availability of energy and force data to fit to. Force field parameters are generated by fitting the parameters such that the energy of a structure or the predicted forces on each atom predicted using the parameters matches the energy or forces generated by ab initio quantum calculations. These calculations are extremely expensive, and as a result considerable extrapolation is usually made from one set of parameters to a general one in order to avoid re-doing the calculations. For example, using parameters generated for the protein backbone of tetra-alanine as describing the backbone of any protein.

The availability of increasing computing power, more efficient algorithms, and knowledge of past methods proves promising for future parameter development. For example, side-chain parameters for various amino acids may be calculated separately and then added in to a general parameter set in order to characterize each amino acid individually.&lt;ref&gt;Lindorff‐Larsen, Kresten, et al. &quot;Improved side‐chain torsion potentials for the Amber ff99SB protein force field.&quot; Proteins: Structure, Function, and Bioinformatics 78.8 (2010): 1950-1958.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Force field accuracy===
Classical force fields have been developed by fitting the classical parameters such that they give results consistent with experimental and quantum data. They are categorized by the type of biomolecule- protein, carbohydrate, and lipid forcefields have been developed separately for all major MD programs. However, this categorization is still quite broad, and can neglect system-specific interactions.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''p73''' is part of the [[Structural Biochemistry/p53|p53]] family of [[Structural Biochemistry/Transcription|transcription]] factors that also includes p63. The family is well known for their ability to regulate cell cycle arrest and [[Structural Biochemistry/Apoptosis|apoptosis]].  p73 and p63 are both structurally and functionally similar to p53, and it is believed that they are also [[Structural Biochemistry/Tumor suppressor genes|tumor suppressor proteins]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Bisso&quot;&gt;Andrea Bisso, Licio Collavin, and Giannino Del &quot;p73 as a Pharmaceutical Target for Cancer Therapy&quot; Laboratorio Nazionale CIB, Area Science Park, Padriciano 99, 34149 Trieste, Italy. Dipartimento di Scienze della Vita, Universitàdi Trieste, Via L. Giorgieri 1, 34100, Trieste, Italy&lt;/ref&gt;. The monomer of p73 has a 50% homology with p53 causing the folding in both proteins to be very similar.&lt;ref name =&quot;Viadiu&quot;/&gt; Even thought both proteins have a very similar structure and function, while 50% of cancers have a mutated p53 protein, but only 0.5% of cancers have a mutated p73 protein which is of great interest to scientists.&lt;ref name=&quot;Viadiu&quot;&gt;Viadiu, Hector. &quot;Gene Recognition by the P53 Protein Family.&quot; CHEM 114A Lecture.

[[File:Protein_TP73_PDB_1cok.png|thumb|Picture of p73]]

==Structure==
The p73 protein has a [[Structural Biochemistry/Nucleic Acid/DNA|DNA]] domain structure very similar to p53. The p73 protein is larger than the p53 protein as it has a 636 amino acid sequence.&lt;ref name =&quot;Viadiu&quot;/&gt; Like p53, there are three structural domains that include a transactivation domain (TA) that is a proline-rich sequence following the N terminus of p73, a central DNA-binding domain (DBD) and a C terminus with an oligomerization domain (OD).&lt;ref name =&quot;Allocati&quot;&gt;N. Allocati, C. Di Ilio, V. De Laurenzi, p63/p73 in the control of cell cycle and cell death, Experimental Cell Research, Volume 318, Issue 11, 1 July 2012, Pages 1285-1290, ISSN 0014-4827, 10.1016/j.yexcr.2012.01.023.(http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014482712000444)
&lt;/ref&gt; Because there are from the same protein family, p73 shares a 50% degree of sequence homology with p53, especially in the DBD.&lt;ref name=&quot;Viadiu&quot;/&gt; The similarity in sequence leads to a similar folding structure which allows p73 to function in a very similar way to p53, such as recognizing and regulating targets of the p53 protein.&lt;ref name=&quot;Viadiu&quot;/&gt; However, the oligomerization domains are less conserved between the two proteins. In this area, p73 is more similar to p63 as it can hetero-oligomerize with p63, but not with p53. &lt;ref name=&quot;Bisso&quot; /&gt;

Various isoforms of p73 exist. There are isoforms that posses a transactivation site similar to the site on p53 and are denoted by TAp73. Other isoforms are ΔNp73 which were originally form the TAp73 promoter transcription do not have the N-terminal transactivation domain due to aberrant splicing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Maas&quot;/&gt;  Studies that shown that knockout of TAp73 in mice made the mice more susceptible to carcinogens and thus more tumor-prone. However, ''in vivo'' knockout of ΔNp73 actually reduced tumor growth showing that the two different isoforms of the gene can cause different results.&lt;ref name =&quot;Maas&quot;&gt;Maas, Anna-Maria, Anne Catherine Bretz, Elisabeth Mack, and Thorsten Stiewe. &quot;Targeting P73 in Cancer.&quot; Cancer Letters (2011): n. pag. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Function==
===Similarities and Differences with p53===
The p53 family proteins each work in different pathways, but they do have some overlapping functions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Viadiu&quot;/&gt; 
*MDM2 degrades both p53 and p73. 
*p53 and p73 both have a role in triggering apoptosis
However, it has been shown that cells with only p53 knocked-out have a different chemosensitivity than cells with both p53 and p73 knocked-out&lt;ref name =&quot;Irwin&quot;&gt;Irwin, Meredith S. &quot;Family Fued in Chemosensitivity.&quot; Cell Cycle 3.3 (2004): 319-23. PubMed.gov. Web. 14 Nov. 2012. &lt;http://www.landesbioscience.com/journals/cc/irwinCC3-3.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; In chemotherapy, patients are given drugs that target fast-growing cells and kills them. Cancer cells are reproducing very quickly and thus are more likely to be the targets of these drugs, however other faster-grwoing cells such as hair and the lining of the stomach can also be targets of these drugs. In some ''in vivo'' and ''in vitro'' studies, it has been observed that mutated p53 is actually able to bind to p73 and inactivate the protein, causing the cells to be more chemoresistant. &lt;ref name =&quot;Irwin&quot;/&gt; 

===Cell Cycle===
TAp73 can stop the cell cycle during the G1 and G2 phases. In the G1 phase, TAp73 arrests the cell cycle by transcriptional up-regulation of p21 and p57/Kip2 which are proteins that prevent the cell cycle from continuing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Allocati&quot;/&gt; In the G2 phase, p73 represses G2/M regulators that include CDC25B, CDC25C, Cyclin B1, Cyclin B2, cdc 2 and Topoisimerase IIα, thus preventing the cell from leaving the Interphase and entering [[Structural Biochemistry/Mitosis|Mitosis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Allocati&quot;/&gt; Even in mitosis, when p73 is presumed to be hyper-phosphorylated and very inactive, it still plays a role that is can transcribe p57/Kip2 genes which are negative regulators of cell proliferation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Allocati&quot;/&gt; TAp73 has also been shown to interact with spindle assembly checkpoints and helps with that activity and malfunction at this point is believed to be the reason for tumorigenesis.&lt;ref name=&quot;Allocati&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Maas&quot;/&gt;

===Cell Death===
TAp73 can also signal for cell death to occur through various mechanisms. Through the mitochondrial pathway, TAp73 is able to up-regulate Bax and promote its movement to the [[Structural Biochemistry/Cell Organelles/Mitochondria|mitochondria]] which occurs when Bax has received apoptotic signalling.&lt;ref name=&quot;Allocati&quot;/&gt; Through the endoplasmic reticulum stress pathway, p73 up-regulates scrotin, a gene that can induce apoptosis, in the ER as well as in supra-basal keratinocytes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Allocati&quot;/&gt;. It can also modulate the death receptor pathway and can induce CD95 expression (a death receptor).&lt;ref name=&quot;Allocati&quot;/&gt;
==ΔNp73== 
This isoforms of p73 is believed to be the negative of not only TAp73 but also p53 by inhibiting growth suppression and apoptosis. ΔNp73 repressed TAp73 transcipriton activity by forming inactive oligomers and competes with p53 for DNA biding sites.&lt;ref name=&quot;Allocati&quot;/&gt; It has been shown that in cancer cells that reductino of ΔNp73 results in apoptosis.&lt;ref name=&quot;Maas&quot;/&gt; However, there is a feedback loop pathway that occurs when TAp73 and p53 are active that induces ΔNp73 creating a auto-regulatory feedback loop so that there are not too many active TAp73 and p53 molecules. It has also been shown that if DNA damage is detected, this triggers the degradation of ΔNp73, thus allowing TAp73 to function.&lt;ref name=&quot;Allocati&quot;/&gt;

One possible way of increasing the amount of TAp73 and decreasing the amount of ΔNp73 is by controlling the splicing of the TAp73 promoter transcripts. In hepatocellular carcinoma cells, the aberrant splicing responsible for changing the transcripts form TAp73 to ΔNp73 was caused by depletion of the splicing factor Slu7. This depletion of Slu7 was caused by c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 (JNK-1) activity which, in turn, was caused by activation of EGFR by AR.&lt;ref name=&quot;Maas&quot;/&gt; Another way of increasing the TAp73/ΔNp73 ratio to favor TAp73 is through using the COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib which has been shown to increase TAp73β in neuroblastoma cells.&lt;ref name=&quot;Maas&quot;/&gt;
==Regulation of p73==
In most solid tumors, there is actually an abundance of p73, however it is not able to do any anti-tumor activity because it is blocked by various inhibitors that include family proteins like ΔNp73, ΔNp63, mutant p53 and non-family proteins such as MDM2, iASPP or mTOR.&lt;ref name=&quot;Maas&quot;/&gt; Because of the many and complex functions of p73, it is regulated after it has already been transcribed by changing the stability or the protein, the location of the protein and the ability of the protein to bind to promoters. p73 is regulated though its degradation through the ubiquitin system.&lt;ref name=&quot;Allocati&quot;/&gt; MDM2 which is responsible for degrading the p53 protein can also bind to p73. However, instead of degrading the protein, it moves it to nuclear speckles and changes it's transcriptional activity. The E3 ubiquitin ligase ITCH binds to p73 to promote degradation of the protein in normal conditions. In times of stress, ITCH is downregulated and p73 and p63 levels are allowed to increase. Unlinke MDM2, ITCH is exclusive to p63 and p73.&lt;ref name=&quot;Allocati&quot;/&gt; Other genes that can regulate p73 include: PIAS1 that sumoylates p73 thus reducing the transcriptional activity of p73 and allowing the cell to leave the G1 phase of the cell cycle. p73's transcriptional activity is also reduced when Cyclyn/CDK complexes threonin phosphorylate it. SIRT1 inhibits the the acetylation of p73 thus decreasing the activity of p73.&lt;ref name=&quot;Allocati&quot;/&gt; 
==Experiments==

===Regulating DNA Damage Repair &lt;ref name=&quot;Zaika&quot; /&gt;===
When normal cells were exposed to bile acids, the role of p73 was activated in response to DNA damage. Increased amounts of DNA damage due to bile acid exposure triggered only the response of p73; this result indicated that p73 induction is independent to p53 and p63, but dependent on the selective activation of c-Abl-kinase. The p73 induction activates transcription of two glycosylases, SMUG1 and MUTYH, to conduct base excision repair. When p73 is deficient, an apparent increase of DNA damage is present &lt;ref name=&quot;Zaika&quot;&gt;Zaika, Elena, Jinxiong Wei, Dengping Yin, Claudia Andl, Ute Moll, El-Rifai, and Alexander Zaika. “p73 Protein Regulates DNA Damage Repair.” FASEB Journal. 25. (2011): 1-9.Print.&lt;/ref&gt;. 

The causes for esophageal adenocarcinoma involve the severe progressions of gastroesophageal reflux disease, where gastric juices mix with bile acids and enter the esophagus. Exposing the esophagus to gastric acids and bile acids leads to inflammation and tissue damage. In addition, bile and acid refluxes induces genotoxic stresses, which increases ROS and RNS production and consequently causes damage to the DNA through oxidation. 

====Methodology&lt;ref name=&quot;Zaika&quot;/&gt;. ==== 
'''Cells cultures, transfection, retroviral infections, and BA treatment'''
&lt;br /&gt;
Primary fetal esophageal fibroblasts, human nontumorous esophageal epithelial cell line, and p53-null esophageal adenocarcinogen cell lines were cultured in DMEM. hTERT-immortalized esophageal epithelial EPC2 cells were grown in KSFM medium with bovine pituitary extract and epidermal growth factors. P73 was then inhibited using lentiviral transduction with shRNA or transfection of RNA, which both targeted a specific sequence found in all the isoforms. 

'''Antibodies, immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence'''
&lt;br /&gt;
Antibodies were used for following various proteins: p73, p63, c-Abl, phospho-c-Abl, phospho-p53, β-actin, phosphohistone H2A.X, phosphotyrosine, 8-oxoguanine, p53, p21, PUMA, SMUG1, MUTYH, and nonspecific rabbit IgG. Immunoprecipitation was conducted using anti-p73 antibody and analyzing tyrosine phosphorylation of p73 using Western blotting. When conducting immunofluorescence, cells were grown to 50% confluency on chamber sides. Phospho-Histone and 8-oxoG were stained and the intensities of the fluorescent signal were measured. 

'''Real-time PCR and chromatin immunoprecipitation'''
&lt;br /&gt;
RNA was isolated, the total RNA was reverse transcribed with a high capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit, and real-time PCR was used. Chromatin immunoprecipitation was conducted on p73 antibody and a nonspecific rabbit IgG was used as a negative control for HET-1A cells. The p73 binding sites were then analyzed. Certain sequences of primers were used to analyze p73, MUTYH, SMUG1 mRNA levels and ChIP.

'''PCR array, comet, and abrasic site quantification assays'''
&lt;br /&gt;
Comet assays were performed with modifications to the protocol. The cells were mixed with a low melting temperature agarose and applied to a pre-agarose coated slide. A buffer was used to induce cell lysis and then proceeded in electrophoresis under alkaline conditions. The slide was then stained for analysis using CometScore Software. In p73 deficient and the HET-1A cells, the mRNA expressions were compared and analyzed. 

'''Surgical Procedures and immunohistochemistry'''
&lt;br /&gt;
Mouse strains that carried the wild type p73 and normal p73 genes were analyzed. Esophagojejunostomy was conducted on these mice that carried the wild type p73 and normal p73 genes. The 15-week mice were euthanized and the lower esophagus was removed for analysis by immunohistochemistry. 

====Results &lt;ref name=&quot;Zaika&quot; /&gt;====
Nontumorous esophageal HET-1A cells were treated with a BA mixture and the DNA damage was analyzed by immunofluorescence using phospho-H2A.X  and 8-OxoG antibodies. A small exposure to the BA mixture inflicted DNA damage through oxidation and strand breakage. The presence of the p53 family upon BA/A treatment was then analyzed. Despite the presence of DNA damage, there was a lack of increased phosphorylation of p53 at serine 15 to induce p53 activation. P53 was only present when the HET-1A cells were treated with a DNA damaging drug called cisplatin. After BA/A treatment, p53 levels decreased and were undetected after a long duration of time. BA/A treatment of SKGT-4 cells resulted to an up-regulation and activation of p73; the analysis revealed that p73 induction is independent of p53. Because the mRNA levels of p73 were not increased in the epithelial cells, it indicated that the up-regulation occurred at the post-translational stage. The presence of c-Abl protein kinase induces the tyrosine phosphorylation, which then activates the p73 protein. 

By inhibiting p73 proteins, increased oxidative DNA damage is apparent. P73 activates SMUG1 and MUTYH that are involved in base excision repair by directly binding to these two glycosylases and regulates its transcription. Therefore, the down regulation of p73 proteins decreases the two glycosylases of SMUG1 and MUTYH&lt;ref name=&quot;Zaika&quot; /&gt;.

=Phagoptosis=


==Definition==
Phagoptosis is a term proposed by Guy. C. Brown and Jonas J. Neher to describe death of working cells by phagocytosis (the engulfing of a cell by a macrophage). The word is derived from two words in ancient Greek: 'phagein' which means to devour and 'ptosis' which means to fall or die.&lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot; /&gt; Thus the term, phagoptosis means death by being swallowed. Phagoptosis is also known as &quot;primary phagocytosis&quot;. 

Simply stated, phagoptosis is caused by the exposure of “eat me” signals or the loss of “don’t eat me” signals on the cell surface. The exposure and loss of these signals is reversible, thus cell death can be prevented by preventing phagocytosis. &lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot;&gt;Brown GC, Neher JJ, [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22682109 “Eaten alive! Cell death by primary phagocytosis: 'phagoptosis'”], ‘[PubMed]’, 27 June 2012. Retrieved on October 28, 2012. &lt;/ref&gt;.

==Background==

Phagoptosis is a nascent term, combining the ideas of phagocytosis and cellular apoptosis (autonomous cell death). While not yet a confirmed phenomenon in macroorganisms, phagoptosis has been proposed as an explanation for various homeostatic and pathological processes in the body that induce the engulfing of healthy or unhealthy cells by a macrophage. Phagoptosis has been proposed, therefore, to be both a contributor to cellular degenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s or Alzheimer’s, whereby healthy neurons are destroyed, and a natural aging tool used by the body to rid itself of unhealthy cells, such as the consumption of old erythrocytes.

Since the 1880s, the work of Russian biologist Ilya Ilyich Mechnikov has led us to believe that phagocytosis, a form of cell destruction, was beneficial because only dead or dying cells were targeted. However, modern-day scientists have found that sometimes healthy, viable host cells can also be marked for cell death; this process is called phagoptosis (or primary phagocytosis).
&lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot; /&gt;.

===Types of Cell Death===
1. Autophage: mediated by autophagic in which the cell is eating itself to cause its own death.&lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot;&gt;Brown GC, Neher JJ, [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22682109 “Eaten alive! Cell death by primary phagocytosis: 'phagoptosis'”], ‘[PubMed]’, 27 June 2012. Retrieved on October 28, 2012. &lt;/ref&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;
2. Apoptosis: mediated by caspases and it is a program of cell death (PCD).&lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot;&gt;Brown GC, Neher JJ, [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22682109 “Eaten alive! Cell death by primary phagocytosis: 'phagoptosis'”], ‘[PubMed]’, 27 June 2012. Retrieved on October 28, 2012. &lt;/ref&gt;. &lt;br /&gt; 
3. Necrosis: cell injuries causes cell death within high stress level of cell structures. &lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot;&gt;Brown GC, Neher JJ, [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22682109 “Eaten alive! Cell death by primary phagocytosis: 'phagoptosis'”], ‘[PubMed]’, 27 June 2012. Retrieved on October 28, 2012. &lt;/ref&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;
4. Cornification: cell death due to conversion of proteins  &lt;br /&gt;
5. Shedding:cell death caused by replacement in cell structures. &lt;br /&gt;
6. Phagoptosis: cell death caused by phagocytosis with macrophages. &lt;br/&gt;

'''&lt;u&gt;Apoptosis&lt;/u&gt;''' &lt;br /&gt; 
Apoptosis is sometime referred to as “programmed cell death.” It is when the cell relatively speaking commits suicide. It generally occurs in response to certain signals in the body It is better than necrosis because it follows a structured routine and is not random like necrosis. When a cell undergoes apoptosis, the protein caspases will be calld upon to break down the any cellular components necessary for survival. The enzyme DNases is also released to destroy any DNA in the nucleus of the cell, thus eliminating any existence of that cell in that area. Aside from the production of caspases and DNases, cells that goes through apoptosis will release a signal to macrophages telling them to clean up any remaining debris. The macrophages clean everything up giving no opportunity to the dead cell to damage nearby cells. &lt;br /&gt; 

Apoptosis is actually important to human development as it gives human the fingers and toes feature that human possesses. Originally the 10 fingers are all connected to a web-like feature, but apoptosis is what causes that web to be broken down and destroyed, leaving human with 10 fingers and toes instead of four web like hands and feet. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot; /&gt;.



'''&lt;u&gt;Necrosis&lt;/u&gt;'''&lt;br /&gt; 
Necrosis is when cells and tissues die randomly, meaning it is not programmed. It is caused by inflammation, injury, cancer, toxins, etc that may harm the body. The problem with necrosis is that when cells die they do not send signals to nearby phagocytes that order them to clean up the dead cell. Therefore it is harder for the body’s immune system to react and clean up the dead cell if it goes through necrosis, causing build up of dead tissue or cell debris a that location. Cells that goes through necrosis may also release harmful chemicals that may hurt or kill nearby cells. &lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot; /&gt;.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
'''&lt;u&gt;Phagoptosis&lt;/u&gt;'''

Phagoptosis is a form of cell death when phagocytes is the primary cause of cell death, which is provoked by cells displaying “eat-me-signals” instead of “don’t eat me signals.” Initially the cell produces “find me signals,” that triggers chemotaxis of phagocytes. Upon arrival the cell will either produce “eat me signals” or “don’t eat me signals” and the will ultimately determine if the cell will live or die. The most abundant form of eat me signal is the phospholipid PS found on the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane of the cell. The eat me signal comes out of the cell as a result of calcium-activated phospholipid scramblase that causes the phospoholipid to shuffle the inner leaflet from the outer leaflet, exposing the eat-me-signal. There are different ways PS can be exposed onto the cell such as, calcium elevation, ATP depletion, oxidative stress, fusion of intracellular vesicles with plasma membrae, necrosis, and apoptosis. All of these can cause a cell to release PS signals and hence result in their removal by phagocytes. &lt;br /&gt;
A way a cell can protect itself from phagocytes is producing “don’t-eat-me-signals”. A type of “don’t-eat-me-signals” that a cell displays is CD47, CD200, etc. CD47 is the most abundant “don’t-eat-me-signal” expressed by a cell. Though if the “don’t-eat-me-signal” is disrupted then phagoptosis may occur. &lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot; /&gt;.

=== Problems due to Cell Death===
Even though Phagoptosis support cell to shape development in cell structures, removes excess and defective cells, and protect cells from pathogens and other cancerous cells, over-excess process of Phagoptosis can cause diseases that might harm the cell replication, production and its natural cycle. Due to the malfunction and irregularity of cell death can lead to lack of important cells in our bodies. For example, excess PS exposure in brain cell structure can terminate not only old and phagocytic neurons but also important neurons that supports our brain cells. Neurons cells are phagocytised by Microglia (Microphage in brain cells) which is caused due to Inflammation Activation. Microglia can eat apoptic neurons to reduce debris or inflammation to help cell circulation and stay in good shape for brain cells&lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot;&gt;Brown GC, Neher JJ, [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22682109 “Eaten alive! Cell death by primary phagocytosis: 'phagoptosis'”], ‘[PubMed]’, 27 June 2012. Retrieved on October 28, 2012. &lt;/ref&gt;.; However, it also can destroy viable neurons and neuronal processes which disintegrate the healthy process of cell, neurons in brain; thus, affecting other healthy brain cells and causing cerebral diseases or disorders like Frontotemporal Degeneration (FTD). Frontotemporal Degeneration (FTD) is heterozygous, inactivating mutation in the progranulin gene due to lack of neurons in brain cells. &lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot;&gt;Brown GC, Neher JJ, [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22682109 “Eaten alive! Cell death by primary phagocytosis: 'phagoptosis'”], ‘[PubMed]’, 27 June 2012. Retrieved on October 28, 2012. &lt;/ref&gt;. It is caused when there is lack of neurons in brain cell due to excess activities of Phagocytosis by Microglia. Many neurons were phagocytised, so it caused inactivating mutation that malfunction the role of progranulin genes in DNA. This FTA disorder is also contributed to causes of Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. &lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot;&gt;Brown GC, Neher JJ, [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22682109 “Eaten alive! Cell death by primary phagocytosis: 'phagoptosis'”], ‘[PubMed]’, 27 June 2012. Retrieved on October 28, 2012. &lt;/ref&gt;.

===Cell Stress===
Cell Stress causes several difference responses including phagoptosis, but the response depends on the amount of cell stress present. The different responses include: adaptation, phagoptosis, apoptosis, and necrosis. These lowest stress level would cause adaptation and as the stress level rises the other responses follow accordingly.
[[File:Cell Stress|thumbnail|The cell has several different responses to cell stress. Different levels of stress cause different responses.]]

Numerous conditions may cause cell stress. Temperature shifts such as heat shock could cause proteins in the cell to denature. Heavy metals can change the conformation of the protein and therefore the function. Free radicals can cause proteins to be fragmented. Fragmentation of proteins render them ineffective. Solvents such as ethanol can cause translation errors. Cell stress response can be the upregulation of some genes and the downregulation of others. In essence, response to cell stress can either cause some proteins to be produced more and others to be produced less depending on the situation. Regulation of cell stress is different in prokaryotes and eukaryotes mainly due to codon differences. &lt;ref name=&quot;cell stress response&quot;&gt;[http://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijcb/2010/214074/ cell stress response], November 20, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cell-In-Cell Phenomena: Entosis and Cannibalism==
Cell-In-Cell phenomena is most likely seen in tumor cells, especially those are very strong and metastatic. Tumor cells can engulf immune cells which eventually kills tumor cells; On the other hand, tumor cells can also engulf other tumor cells for survival or protection from other harms. Some tumor cell can go through cannibalism process (Cell-In-Cell Phenomena) to protect themselves from immune cells; and Entosis process can happen to both tumor and normal cells. 



===Entosis===
Entosis is caused when tumor cell invade each other; it is caused when detached from Extracelluar Matrix. This Entosis process can cause either survival of the cells or death of invading cells by Lysosome Digestion. Entosis mostly happen in animal cells because animal cells are mostly attached to extracellular matrix for their survival. When some cells are detached from ECM (Extracellular Matrix), they lose the adhesion and cells start to push into their neighboring cells; thus, sometimes, Entosis is considered as interaction between two neighboring cells. Interestingly, cells which are locked due to the result of Entosis are alive and they can divide themselves inside another cells.  Entosis is also referred to &quot;cell-in-cell structures&quot; which indicates the loss of attachment from extracellular matrix. In other word, It is process by which tumor cells invade each other when detached from matrix and it is relatively common in malignant cancers. &lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot;&gt;Brown GC, Neher JJ, [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22682109 “Eaten alive! Cell death by primary phagocytosis: 'phagoptosis'”], ‘[PubMed]’, 27 June 2012. Retrieved on October 28, 2012. &lt;/ref&gt;.



===Cannibalism===
Cannibalism is caused when cells eating up each other for survival and protection due to damages or infection. For example, Wang ''et al'' found out some tumor cell can go proceed apoptic cell death. From the bodies of patients who have Huntington's disease, immortalised lymphoblasts phagocyotes are eating up each other to survive in tough condition or to replenish and protect themselves. However, whether restriction of phagocytosis will be able to avoid cell death in cell-in-cell phenomena is still questioned. &lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot;&gt;Brown GC, Neher JJ, [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22682109 “Eaten alive! Cell death by primary phagocytosis: 'phagoptosis'”], ‘[PubMed]’, 27 June 2012. Retrieved on October 28, 2012. &lt;/ref&gt;.

==Types of Signaling and Known Pathways==

What can cause a macrophage to consume a cell? Many intercellular interactions occur via chemical signaling; the cell displays certain compounds outside of the plasma membrane, to which other cells respond thanks to receptors on the exteriors of their plasma membranes. While some of these compounds invoke phagoptosis, others repulse it and it is the net amount of these &quot;eat me&quot; versus &quot;don't eat me&quot; signals that determine the final fate of the cell. Three main compounds have been proposed to signal macrophages to engulf a cell, each with its own signaling pathway that causes the compound to be expressed or suppressed on the plasma membrane.


===Attractive Signals===


1. PS (phosphidatylserine)—normally suppressed by an ATP-operated inhibitor called aminophospholipid translocase, which actively pumps PS to the inner membrane of the cell, PS has been shown to, under certain circumstances, lead to phagocytosis of so-called “activated” T cells. PS binds to the receptor Tim-4 on phagocytes, which signals the phagocyte to engulf the cell. If there is no ATP to run the translocase or if there is an overabundance of free calcium in the cytoplasm, the translocase stops running, and another membrane protein called scramblase randomizes the exposure of PS in the cell membrane, potentially exposing it to free phagocytes for endocytosis. This process can happen even in healthy cells.PS exposure can also occur due to oxidative stress which activates the scramblase and prevents translocase. Another result of PS exposure is when the intracellular vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane.

In summary, there are 5 ways that the PS “eat me” signal can be exposed: elevation in calcium levels, lack of ATP, oxidative stress (which activates scramblase and stops translocase), fusion of intracellular vesicles with plasma membrane, necrosis, or apoptosis. Another requirement for phagocytosis to be carried out is the presence of macrophages that are capable of attaching to PS. 

In order for macrophages to recognize PS, different receptors must be activated. Resting macrophages express the following PS receptors: Tim4, stabilin-1, stabilin-2, and BAI1. On the other hand, macrophages that are activated express the protein MFG-E8 and its receptor, vitronectin, in addition to the MerTK receptor. 

Furthermore, it is important to note that PS exposure does not always equate to cell death; the cell type and surrounding conditions also plays a role. For example, when purified PS is added to 3 different cell lines, the viable cells show an elevation of PS on their surfaces. This stimulated phagocytosis as expected, but as soon as the PS was “internalised”, phagocytosis was inhibited. In other cases such as that of lymphoma cells, PS exposure is not enough to even initiate phagocytosis because either the cells also expressed “don’t eat me” signals or they required another signal to co-stimulate phagocytosis. 
&lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot;&gt;
[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968000412000709#], An article proposing the coining of the new term &quot;phagoptosis&quot; as an intentional cell reaction to stress and a natural homeostatic process.&lt;/ref&gt; However, PS exposure on viable cells can be reversed. When neutrophils are activated they have galectins that induce PS on the surface of the cell. If the galectin is removed before the macrophages detect it, then phagoptosis will not occur.



2. CRT (cell-surface calreticulin)—CRT is abundant in cells, particularly in the endoplasmic reticulum. Its transport to the exterior of the cell (exocytosis) can cause it to behave as an attractive signal to phagocytes, which have the CRT receptor LRP (lipoprotein receptor-related protein).  Rather than actively displaying CRT as a self-destructive signal, a stressed cell will decrease the repulsive chemical signal CD47 (discussed in the subsequent section), after which a phagocyte will become attracted to excess CRT on the external surface of the target cell. This is an especially prevalent mechanism in cancer cells, which actively attempt to display the CD47 signal. Cancer cells require strong exposure of &quot;don't-eat-me&quot; signals in order to prevent phagoptosis. While CRT is tied to the surface of a cell, it can also send signals to bind proteins, PS, or C1q on target cells. This will stimulate phagocytosis through the LRP, which is on the phagocyte.

An “eat me” signal similar to CRT is thrombospondin 1 (TSP). Like CRT, TSP1 activates phagocytosis with the use of lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) on the phagocyte. 
&lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot; /&gt;


3. MFG-E8 (milk fat globule EFG-like factor-8)—This chemical signal binds to the phagocytotic initiator MerTK (Mer tyrosine kinase) on the phagocyte with the help of several connecting or “bridging” compounds, including Gas-6, protein S, galectin-3, tubby and Tulp 1. These can interact with PS and other receptor proteins in complicated pathways to induce phagocytosis on white blood cells called neutrophils.&lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot; /&gt;

===Repulsive Signals===


In addition to these attractive signals, there are repulsive signals that cells can display to actively prevent phagocytosis. While the attractive signals may be displayed as a result of cellular stress, repulsive signals are altogether more specific. Some repulsive signals include:

1. CD47 (Cluster of Differentiation 47: CD47 is the inhibitory membrane protein expressed on the surface of the majority of cells. It binds to signal-regulatory proteinα (SIRP-α) on the phagocyte. Examples of cells that use this protein as a 'don't eat me' signal include erythrocytes (red blood cells), cancer cells, and platelets, T-cells. In clinical studies performed on mice with cancerous growths, it has been found that blocking of this protein results both reduction of tumor size and spread throughout the body as a result of phagocytosis. &lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot; /&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Williams, Sarah C.P. [http://news.sciencemag.org/sciencenow/2012/03/one-drug-to-shrink-all-tumors.html &quot;One Drug to Shrink All Tumors&quot;], '[AAAS]', 26 March 2012. Retrieved on 28 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;


2. Sialic-Acid Derivatives: These react with a variety of receptors, such as cofactors to prevent phagocytosis. Modifications of sialic-acid on cell surfaces can stop C3b and C1q from binding and signaling nearby macrophages. Sialic acid can be removed from the cell surface by implementing neuraminidase and doing so can induce phagocytosis. Siglec-11, a receptor on brain microphages (microglia), can prevent inflammation and phagocytosis of neurons by binding to their surface. However, Siglec-11 requires polysialylated proteins to be present on the cell surface. &lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot; /&gt;


3. PAI-1: PAI-1 (or plasminogen activator inhibitor-1) is another major repulsive signal in cells. Neutrophil cells are an example of a cell type that mainly uses PAI-1 as its repulsive signal.&lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot; /&gt;


4. CD200 (Cluster of Differentiation 200): This is a protein expressed on the membrane of certain cells. In the case of myeloid cells, it can prevent phagocytosis by releasing an inhibitory signal.&lt;ref&gt;Carclay AN, Wright GJ, Brooke G, Brown MH [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12072366 &quot;CD200 and membrane protein interactions in the control of myeloid cells&quot;], '[NCBI]', 23 June 2002. Retrieved on 28 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===How Attractive and Repulsive signals Work Together===

1.  However, it is important to note that the display of an “eat me” signal alone may not be sufficient to induce phagocytosis. Despite having “eat me” signals on its surface, a cell may not be attacked by phagocytes because it also displays “don’t eat me” signals. The proportion of “eat me” signals such as PS to “don’t eat me” signals such as CD47 plays a major role in determining how the cell will be recognized by macrophages. Furthermore, the type of cell as well as its environment also influences the degree of influence that signals monitoring cell death will have. Multiple cell types require a cooperative protein or PS oxidation to undergo phagocytosis. &lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot; /&gt;

==Phagoptosis in Model Organisms==

Much of the information about cell death has been obtained from model organisms, such as ''Caenorhabditis elegans'' (a species of transparent nematode) and ''Drosophila melanogaster'' (a species of fly commonly used in laboratories).&lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot; /&gt;

===Phagocytosis in Development===

[[File:Adult Caenorhabditis elegans.jpg|thumbnail|right|Caenorhabditis elegans, a nematode around 1mm in length.]]
In ''C. elegans'' it has been found that a combination of loss-of-function mutants in ''ced-1'' as well as in ''ced-3'' (two transmembrace receptors in ''C.elegans'')&lt;ref&gt;Zhou Z, Hartwieg E, Horvitz HR. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11163239 &quot;CED-1 is a transmembrane receptor that mediates cell corpse engulfment in C. elegans.&quot;], '[NCBI]', 12 January 2001. Retrieved on 28 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; led to reduced apoptosis as well as reduced phagocytosis, indicating that both are important factors in programmed cell death during development of the species. This also prevented some death from mutation and toxins. From this it was concluded that light stress on the cell (such as weak activation of caspase, which is involved in apoptosis) is not enough to cause a cell to die, but in conjunction with PS exposure could cause phagoptosis. By removing the srgp-1 gene, which prevents phagocytosis of PS-exposed cells, it was found that rates of phagocytosis in normally apoptotic cells and other stressed cells increased. &lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot; /&gt;

[[File:Drosophila melanogaster - side (aka).jpg|409.5x212px|thumbnail|right|Drosophila melanogaster, a species of fly often used for genetic testing.]]





In ''D. melanogaster'', developmental cell death is caused by 3 proteins: Hid (head involution defective), Rpr (Reaper), and Grim. All of these induce apoptosis of the cell by binding to the caspase inhibitor DIAP1. This leaves developmental phagocytosis intact, which seemed to remove most of the cells normally lost in development. This indicates that while apoptosis might not be essential for development of ''D. melanogaster'', phagocytosis might be. One of the mechanisms through which phagoptosis occurs in ''D. melanogaster'' is the ER protein pretaporter, which is expressed externally on the surface of cells. There is also competition between cells of different genotypes within ''D. melanogaster'' through induced phagoptosis of surrounding cells. &lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot; /&gt;





==Turnover of Cells Due to Phagoptosis==
Phagoptosis is one of the main forms of cell death, causing turnovers of erythrocytes, neutrophils, T-cells and many other cells &lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot; /&gt;.

===Erythrocytes===
Erythrocytes are red blood cells. The highest rate of cell death in the body is caused erythrophagocytosis, the cell destruction of red blood cells. Two million red blood cells, or erythrocytes, are produced every second in the human body. They live for about 120 days and then are destroyed by macrophages in the spleen, liver, and bone marrow in such a way that equals its rate of production. Instead of undergoing apoptosis, red blood cells display “eat me” signals such as PS. A loss of CD47 “don’t eat me” signals in old red blood cells is enough to cause rapid phagocytosis.

Older erythrocytes tend to get phagocytized more because they contain more &quot;eat-me&quot; signals such as PS, phosphidatylserine. When PS is exposed on the cell’s surface, a macrophage senses this and phagocytizes the red blood cells. This can be reversed by other signals such as CD47 on the cell’s surface, binding to the macrophage’s SIRPα receptors. As erythrocytes become older, they lose CD47 signal, causing phagocytosis of erythrocytes. It was found that older erythrocytes live longer when there were depletion of macrophages, which concludes that phagoptosis was the reason for red blood cell's turnover. &lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot; /&gt;

*The phagocytosis of red blood cells is mediated by “eat me” signals such as PS as well as “don’t eat me” signals such as CD47. Erythrocytes are particularly excellent for studying the regulation of phagocytosis because they are destroyed at the same rate they are produced, giving them the highest rate of cell death in the human body.  Every second, about 2 million red blood cells are formed in the bone marrow. Each cell has a life span of approximately 120 days. As erythrocytes get older, they begin to display more “eat me” signals and fewer “don’t eat me” signals on their surface. Signals that prevent phagocytosis such as CD47 act on the SIRPa receptors of macrophages, preventing them from attacking viable erythrocytes. Having more “don’t eat me” signals or having fewer macrophages will prolong the survival of older erythrocytes. &lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot; /&gt;

===Neutrophils===
Neutrophils, which are the most plentiful type of white blood cell, are quite different in comparison to erythrocytes. Like red blood cells, neutrophils are also produced in bone marrow and destroyed in the spleen, liver, and bone marrow. They are created at a rate of 0.5-1 million per second in humans, with a lifespan of about 5 days. What’s peculiar about these white blood cells is that the younger cells are just as susceptible to phagocytosis as the older cells. When isolated, neutrophils undergo spontaneous apoptotic cell death. For neutrophils, the protein PAI-1 is a “don’t eat me” signal. When PAI-1 is blocked, CRT becomes the main “eat me” signal. Neutrophils are the only leukocytes to expose CRT without the need of a stimulus, which would explain their fast renewal rate in the body. They also have the ability to eat activated platelets and small cells such as bacteria.  

Also, phagocytosis is not the only cause of turnovers in neutrophils like it is for erythrocytes; instead spontaneous apoptosis occurs when neutrophils are isolated. &lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot; /&gt;

When CRT is expressed on neutrophil’s surface, it signals the drive of phagocytosis by macrophages. In contrast, PAI-1 expresses the signal that prohibits phagocytosis, but depletion of this signal causes increasing chance of it being phagocytized. This can be reversed by adding PAI-1 proteins that binds to the white blood cell’s surface, barring phagoptosis.&lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot; /&gt;

Neutrophils can also act as phagocytes, but only devouring smaller bacterias.&lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot; /&gt; 

Like erythrocytes, neutrophils are also made in the bone marrow. However, neutrophils only have a lifespan of 5 days before they are phagocytised. Another noteworthy difference between neutrophils and erythrocytes is that unlike for an erythrocyte, the phagocytosis of a neutrophil is not concurrent with its age. “Younger neutrophils are just as likely to be phagocytised as older neutrophils. (p. 328)” The protein PAI-1 acts as the primary signal preventing phagocytosis on neutrophils. When this “don’t eat me” signal is removed, viable neutrophils are attacked by macrophages. Like PS, the PAI-1 protein also exhibits reversible binding. Adding the protein back to the surface of neutrophils will decrease their rate of phagocytosis.  The phagocytosis of neutrophils is also influenced by antibodies that block PAI-1. When PAI-1 is blocked, the “eat me” signal CRT can induce phagocytosis of neutrophils that are still viable leading to a decreased immune response.  Although CRT acts as the primary eat me signal on neutrophils, neutrophils can also be stimulated to bring PS to their surface, encouraging attack by surrounding macrophages. The phagocytosis of red blood cells is mediated by “eat me” signals such as PS as well as “don’t eat me” signals such as CD47. Erythrocytes are particularly excellent for studying the regulation of phagocytosis because they are destroyed at the same rate they are produced, giving them the highest rate of cell death in the human body.  Every second, about 2 million red blood cells are formed in the bone marrow. Each cell has a life span of approximately 120 days. As erythrocytes get older, they begin to display more “eat me” signals and fewer “don’t eat me” signals on their surface. Signals that prevent phagocytosis such as CD47 act on the SIRPa receptors of macrophages, preventing them from attacking viable erythrocytes. Having more “don’t eat me” signals or having fewer macrophages will prolong the survival of older erythrocytes. &lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot; /&gt;

===T-Cells===
T-Cells play an active role in adaptive immunity. These cells activate themselves by attaching to part of antigens and proliferate to leave memory T-cells for secondary immune responses. The activation of T-cells leads to PS exposure and recognition by the Tim-4 receptor, which leads to phagocytosis; thus, carrying out its role to destroy the body's foreign invaders. The Tim-4 receptors on phagocytes are blocked when antigens are introduced during immunization or during infection with influenza virus. This decreases the production of antigen-specific T cells which in return will increase immune responses to those antigens. Similar to erythrocytes, neutrophils, platelets, the turn over of T-cells is regulated by the CD47 signal. Once the T-cell loses that signal, it will be devoured by macrophages. &lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot; /&gt;

===Hemophagocytosis===
Phagoptosis has been linked to multiple inflammatory and immune disorders, where viable blood cells are attacked by macrophages. A reduction in red or white blood cell count is known as cytopenia. Individuals with cytopenia often have compromised immune systems and are vulnerable to infection. Inflammation can induce the increased phagocytosis of red blood cells by causing these cells to display “eat me” markers, primarily PS, on their surface. Inflammation also increases the capability of macrophages to target red blood cells. &lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot; /&gt;  Hemophagocytosis is difficult to treat because inflammation plays a vital role in the immune response by isolating foreign substances which may potentially be harmful so they can be destroyed by phagocytes. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000821.htm &quot;Immune response&quot;], '[Medicine Plus]', Retrieved on 28 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opportunities for Future Research==

There is still much research to be done with phagoptosis, but early experiments indicate that certain instances of cell death such as erythrocytosis, neutrophil “cannibalism,” and unnatural neurodegeneration, which were once attributed to apoptosis, may be the result of this more complicated process. Further research may be able to illicit specific solutions to problems that apoptosis models could not adequately describe, which in turn, could provide an opportunity to develop new treatments for degenerative diseases.

===Neurodegeneration===

While there are many different health problems that arise with unnecessary phagoptosis, one of the most serious of these comes from loss of neurons in the brain. This is particularly harmful because neurons are not able to be regenerated. Therefore, permanent damage may result from microglia, the macrophage in the brain responsible for consumption of neurons among other tasks, engulfing any neuron that exposes inflammation, whether or not that neuron is viable. It has been recently discovered that a major cause of frontotemporal degeneration (FTD) is linked to inactivation of the progranulin gene which inhibits phagocytosis. This suggests that Parkinson's disease, Alzheimers, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis may be controlled by phagocytosis control in the brain. Controlling phagocytosis in the brain can be done, for example via PS blocking, which should stop all loss of viable neurons without having to inhibit inflammation.&lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot; /&gt; 

Although there are problems with unnecessary phagoptosis in the brain, phagoptosis can also be potentially beneficial in the brain as well. Microglia, or brain macrophages, can also devour apoptotic neurons (neurons which have been programmed to die), reducing the debris and inflammation. There are some cases where the microglia's ability have been impaired due to inflammation, which impairs its ability to classify which neuron to devour, mistaking viable neurons for apoptotic neurons during phagocytosis.&lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot;&gt;[http://www.jimmunol.org/content/185/10/6317t]&lt;/ref&gt;

Phagoptosis performs many beneficial functions in the body including defense against harmful pathogens and regulation of the inflammatory response. However, recent studies indicate that it may be a primary culprit of diseases associated with frontotemporal degeneration. FTD is caused by phagoptosis of viable neurons, which is normally prevented by a protein known as progranulin which regulates phagoptosis in the brain. Mutations in the gene that codes for progranulin are associated with Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and other neurodegenerative diseases. &lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot; /&gt; 
===Cancer Research===

It has been discovered that cancer cells contain high quantities of exposed CD47 protein which contributes to their low rate of consumption by macrophages. Potential research may find inhibitors or antibodies against CD47 that may help induce natural death of cancer cells. For example, in leukaemic cells, it has been discovered that the addition of CD47 antibodies is enough to eradicate several types of leukemia from model organisms such as mice.&lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Several applications are examined to illustrate the idea of phagoptosis:&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Example !! Eat me signal!! Don't eat me signal
|-
| C elegan || &quot;PS exposure: reversed by ATP-dependent translocase tat-1, disruption of tat-1 exposes PS 
on surface of viale cell induce phagocytosis. PS exposure Downregulated by srgp-1&quot;
 || 
|-
| Drosophila || Death induced by Hid, Rpr and Grim protein, bind to DIAP1, adtivate caspases to induce apoptosis. Knockout of IAP of DIAP1 prevent apoptosis, but doesn't affect phagocytosis--apoptosis not required for Drosophila,while phagocytosis required. Pretaproter act as eat me signal || 
|-
| &quot;
Erythrocytes red blood cells&quot;
 || no apoptosis, old erythrocytes phagocytosed by &quot;eat me signal&quot; PS and altered Band 3 transporter.
 || Phagocytosis inhibited by CD 47 on erthroyte surface, acts on macrophage SIRP receptor. Expression of CD47 reduce in old eryghrocytes--promote phagocytosis. Knockdown of PS-receotors stabilin-1 and stabilin-2 block phagocytosis
|-
| Neutrophils (white blood cell)  || &quot;phagocytes by spleen, liver and bone marrow. Young neutropils are as likely to be phagocytised neutrophils undergeo spontaneous apoptosis when isolated (contrast to Erythrocytes)neutrophil turnover is independent of apoptosis(similar to erythrocytes)&quot;&quot;eat me&quot;&quot; signal: CRT (via LRP) when PAI1/CD47 blocked Uniqueness: exposeCRT constitutively--turnover depleted by CD47-blocking antibodies&quot;&quot;eat me&quot;&quot; signal: oxidised PS and lyso-PS&quot;
 || &quot;don't eat me&quot; signal: PAI-1 on neutrophils, PAI-1 can inhibit interaction between CRT and LRP&quot;

|-
| Platelets || platetes are phagocytosed by neutrophils cayse downregulating blood clotting via phago || Don't eat me signal: CD47.CD47 expression on platelets, such that platets lacking CD47 are rapidly cleared
|-
| T cells || Antigen recognition causes PS exposure on surface of activated T cells. T cell surface PS is recognized by PS receptor Tim-4, mediating phagoptosis. During immunisation with antigen blocking Tim-4 on phagocytes, increase subsequent immune responses to those antigen.  expressing Tim-4 in phagocytes decrease # of T cells || &quot;don't eat me&quot; signal: CD47 regulate T cell turnover. Bax/Bak double knockout mice, can't perform apoptosis, have large expansion of T and B cell, so apoptosis contributes to turnover.
|-
| Hemophagocytosis entosis and cell cannibalism || found in infectious and inflammatory disorder activatedmacrophage engulf viable blood cells inflammation increase both phagocytic capacity of macrophage and PS exposure of leukocytes, so inflammation induced hemophagocytosis and cytopenia. || 
|-
| Neurons and inflammatory neurodegeneration || viable neurons are phagocytised by microglia in brain. Inflammatory activation caused the microglia to become highly phagocytic and release phagocytic adaptorprotein MFG-E8, which induce reversible PS exposure on neurons and lead to neuronal phagocytosis.blocking exposed PS, MFG-E8 prevent neuronal loss without inhibiting inflammation.  Inflammation in brain causemicroglia to eat viable neurons, can be prevented by blocking phagocytic signaling. microglia can spontaneously phagocytise viableneurons, which increase by removal of surface sialic acid residue || Progranulin inhibit phagocytosis of apoptotic and PS-exposed cells in vivo, so neuronal loss in FTD is caused by phagoptosis that progranulin normally suppresses
|-
| Cancer || Cancer can be limited by antibody and complement-dependent phagocytosis of cancer cells, or by induction of &quot;eat me&quot; signals by macrophage and T cells. &quot;eat me&quot; signal is CRT: drive phagoptosis one CD47 is neutralised. || cancer cell overexpress &quot;don't eat me&quot; signal CD47 antibodies against CD47 induce phagocytosis of leukaemic cells by macrophage--completely clear leukaemia.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Long non-coding RNAs, also known as lncRNAs, are similar in structure to mRNAs. However, lncRNAs are unique in that they do not function in any protein-coding. Chemical probing and structural studies have been methods to understand the structures of several IncRNAs, this includes the structure of the ribsome [1]. Other research that applies to IncRNAs is the approach to measure the secondary structure of RNA. Furthermore, as the name suggests, lncRNAs are long (or large) transcripts produced by mammalian genomes. 

==History==
Before many advances in technology that enabled the present day’s depth of research on RNA molecules, lncRNAs were discovered and characterized. Initially, these molecules were thought to function similarly to other RNA, coding for proteins. However, subsequent data from experiments showed that lncRNAs lacked open-reading frames (ORF), which proved that these transcriptions could not possibly code for proteins. 

Even though it has been determined that lncRNAs do not participate in protein synthesis, the question still remains as to what are the functions of these transcriptions. Although the significant mysteries of lncRNA mechanisms remain unanswered, according to Moran, Perera and Khalil’s paper, “numerous publications in the past several years have now documented important functions for lncRNAs, affecting many biological processes, including regulation of gene expression, dosage compensation, genomic imprinting , nuclear organization and compartmentalization, and nuclear-cytoplasmic trafficking.” &lt;ref name=&quot;Khalil&quot;&gt;Khalil, Ahmad M., Victoria A. Moran, Ranjan J. Perera. &quot;Emerging Functional and Mechanistic Paradigms of Mammalian Long Non-Coding RNAs.&quot; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3413108/. 5 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Functional Long Non-Coding RNAs Present in Mammals==
Long non-coding RNAs fall into three categories: intronic long-non coding RNAs, natural antisense transcripts, and long intervening non-coding RNAs. Although it is confirmed that the human and other mammalian genomes produce these various types of lncRNAs, it is yet to be discovered precisely the roles of these molecules in biological processes, nor their mechanisms of action. Such topics are still left to debate in many various hypotheses.

===Intronic Long Non-Coding RNAs (Intronic lncRNAs)===
As the name suggests, intronic long non-coding RNAs (intronic lncRNAs), are expressed only from the introns of protein coding genes.

===Natural Antisense Transcripts (NATS)===
Natural antisense transcripts, abbreviated as NATs, are transcripts that overlap with protein-coding genes and are transcribed in the antisense direction. These molecules were discovered in the early 2000s, when over 11,000 lncRNAs were identified in a mouse. After further inspection, it was determined that a significant amount of these lncRNAs were NATs. Moran, Perera and Khalil write that in a different study, it was found that “40% of protein-coding genes in human cells also express NATs.”&lt;ref name=&quot;Khalil&quot;/&gt;
NATs have been studied throughout the past decade, and research demonstrated that NATs have a specific function: they regulate the protein-coding genes with which they overlap. 

===Long Intervening Non-Coding RNAs (lincRNAs)===
Recently, lncRNAs have been expressed in the “intergenic” regions of the genome, or stretches of DNA that have few or no genes. These lncRNAs have been named long intervening non-coding RNAs, or lincRNAs. 

Before RNA sequencing technologies, researchers utilized the known fact that “actively transcribed protein-coding genes typically display a specific histone modification pattern” and were then able to isolate lincRNAs. These results showed that both human and mice genomes create over 3300 lincRNAs. RNA sequencing technology confirmed these results, exposing many more lincRNAs. Presently, it is projected that human DNA as a whole produces over 8000 lincRNA, over half of which are considered to be “high confidence lincRNAs.”&lt;ref name=&quot;Khalil&quot;/&gt; These high confidence lincRNA are located in various regions of the cell, both in the nucleus and cytoplasm, and are believed to potentially play roles in cell identity.

==Known Functions of Long Non-Coding RNAs==
Even though only a small proportion of lncRNAs have been examined through experiments, the emerging result is that these molecules participate in many biological contexts. 

===Regulation of Gene Expression===
Although gene regulation typically requires many different factors due to its complexitry, recent studies reveal that lncRNAs contribute to gene regulation by various mechanisms. 

A known, well-studied lncRNA called Xist is an example of these gene-regulating lncRNAs. Xist is responsible for the initiation and spreading of the inactivation of X chromosomes in female somatic cells. Although Xist’s specific mechanism in achieving this function is unknown, it is accepted throughout the scientific community that Xist is required to inhibit hundreds of genes on the inactive X chromosome.

Another process that lncRNAs participate in to regulate gene expression is called genomic imprinting. Genomic imprinting requires very tight regulation, mainly because the expression of imprinted genes play critical roles on mammalian development, and the level of expression between the two alleles of an imprinted gene can vary greatly from one gene to another. A considerable amount of lncRNAs, alongside mRNAs, actively regulate the expression of protein-coding genes ''in cis''. “Air,” one of these gene expression regulatory lncRNAs, silences three imprinted genes in cis by localizing to chromatin.

Genes can also be regulated by lncRNAs in trans. One such lncRNA called HOTAIR, which is actually a lincRNA, regulates human HOXD genes expression ''in trans''. 

===Maintenance of Pluripotency===
Pluripotency is the ability of a stem cell to give rise to the three germ layers: mesoderm, endoderm, and ectoderm. 

Although previous studies expressed that there are key transcription and chromatin factors that are required to maintain pluripotency, it has also been discovered that some of these transcription factors bind to the promoters of many lincRNAs in mice. Another study also indicated that two specific lincRNAs are required to maintain pluripotency as well. 

In-depth research focused on the role of lincRNAs in pluripotency maintenance; this lead to a specific study that demonstrated that 26 lincRNAs are required for pluripotency maintenance. Each of these lincRNAs was determined to lead to “either an exit from the pluripotent state or activation of lineage commitment programs.”&lt;ref name=&quot;Khalil&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that lincRNAs act as sensors, sensing the environment of the stem cell and alerting the stem cell to remain pluripotency or to change according to alterations in the environment.

===Nuclear Organization: Formation of Paraspeckles===
The regulation of gene expression takes place at multiple levels, such as before, during or after transcription, or during translation. Recently, nuclear structures called paraspeckles are suggested to be participants in gene regulation after transcription has taken place. However, paraspeckles have been observed to be dynamic structures that are absent at certain stages during development. The fact that the appearance of paraspeckles coincide with the activation of a lncRNA called nuclear-enriched autosomal transcript 1, or NEAT1, is evidence that supports the conclusion that NEAT1 is a required molecule for the formation of paraspeckles. Furthermore, the depletion of NEAT1 causes the subsequent loss of paraspeckles in the nucleus; likewise, the overexpression of NEAT1 leads to an increase in paraspeckles. Such observations have suggested the essential role of NEAT1 in paraspeckle formation and maintanence in the nucleus.

===Regulation of Alternative Splicing===
Alternative splicing of pre-mRNAs leads to proteomic complexity due to its production of several protein products with different functions from a single mRNA. A lncRNA called metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1, or MALAT1, is identified as having an important role in the alternative splicing of pre-mRNAs. This is supported by the fact that MALAT1 localizes to nuclear speckles, which actually contain several proteins associated with alternative splicing. In particular, MALAT1 regulates the phosphorylation of specific proteins that are involved in the regulation and splicing sites of pre-mRNAs. Furthermore, it has been proven that the depletion of MALAT1 affects patterns in alternative splicing of pre-mRNAs. However, despite the discovery of MALAT1, it has yet to be determined if other lncRNAs participate in the regulation of alternative splicing. 

==How Long Non-Coding RNAs Exert Their Effects==
Although researchers have yet to discover all there is to know about the detailed mechanisms of action for lncRNAs, there are several mechanisms by which lncRNA exert their effects which can be explained.

===Long Non-Coding RNAs as Guides for Chromatin-Modifying Complexes===
Although chromatin-modifying complexes and DNA methytransferases function by enzymatically modifying chromatin and DNA to activate and repress genes, the question as to how these enzymes, without DNA binding capacity, recognized their target genes. It has recently been suggested that some lncRNAs act as guides for chromatin-modifying complexes and other nuclear proteins to specific locations so that these molecules can exert their respective effects. 

Both the lncRNAs HOTAIR and Air target and direct chromatin-modifying complexes to their target genes; the only difference between both of these lncRNAs is that HOTAIR binds ''in trans'', whereas Air binds ''in cis'' [[#Regulation of Gene Expression|(this is concurrent with their gene-regulating functions, which are mentioned in the 
“Regulation of Gene Expression” section)]]. Recent evidence illustrates that in this process, the lncRNA binds to chromatin first, and then serves as “docking station” for chromatin-modifying complexes.

===Long Non-Coding RNAs as Structural Links in Ribonucleoprotein Complexes===
Although the specific molecular composition of most ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNPs) that surround RNAs in the cell has yet to be established, studies have expressed that lncRNAs exist in the cell as RNPs. For example, the lncRNA Xist has been shown to interact with a specific transcription factor which aids in connecting Xist to the inactive chromosome; Xist forms a molecular bridge of sorts to connect this transcription factor and a chromatin-modifying complex in order to repress genes on the inactive chromosome. 

Other lncRNAs, such as NEAT1 and MALAT1, form molecular scaffolds for several proteins. In doing so, they can regulate the functions of these proteins. However, it is not known as to how these lncRNAs recognize their respective proteins and commence the formation of these molecular scaffolds in the nucleus.

===Long Non-Coding RNAs as Regulators for Distinct Transcriptional Programs===
Several lncRNAs have been shown to respond to specific stimuli in the cell environment. Consequently, they are triggered to activate specific transcriptional programs that allow for cell response to these stimuli. In certain cases, lncRNAs act as negative regulators. For example, the lncRNA growth arrest specific 5 (GAS5) serves as a negative regulator of glucocorticoid receptors (GR), which are a specific class of nuclear receptors. When activated, GAS5 interacts with the GRs, inhibiting this class of nuclear receptors from binding to their specific DNA response elements and carrying out their function. Thus, lncRNAs act as modulators of the effects a transcription factor can lead in changes in gene expression, as well as the cell’s ability to respond to stimuli from the cell’s environment.

==Potential Roles of Long Non-Coding RNAs in Human Disease==
Although only a few lncRNAs have been linked to human disease, recently, in some cases, scientists have observed strong associations between lncRNAs and human disease. According to Moran, Perera and Khalil’s paper, “lncRNAs have been found to be dysregulated in a wide range of human diseases and disorders, including various types of cancers.”&lt;ref name=&quot;Khalil&quot;/&gt; Even though the mechanisms of most lncRNAs have not been fully discovered in its entirety, several studies have begun to bring clues as to the mechanisms of few lncRNAs. In the article &quot;Genome Regulation by Long Noncoding RNAs.&quot; Rinn and Chang mention about the alteration of IncRNAs in human cancers, &quot;Dozens of lncRNAs have been documented to have altered expression in human cancers and are regulated by specific oncogenic and tumor-suppressor pathways, such as p53, MYC, and NF-κB recently described a class of lncRNAs that show periodic expression during the human cell cycle, and many of these are dysregulated in expression in human cancer samples.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;Rinn&quot;&gt;Rinn, John L., and Howard Y. Chang. &quot;Genome Regulation by Long Noncoding RNAs.&quot; National Center for Biotechnology Information. U.S. National Library of Medicine, n.d. Web. 07 Dec. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
Cancer has been the disease most studied and researched and it leaves the possibility that IncRNAs are involved in the pathogenesis of many other diseases. In future studies, it is necessary to study potential IncRNA transcripts in regions that do not contain protein-coding genes since this are strongly associated with human diseases.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Oxycodone is a type of analgesic, oral medication used to relieve moderate to severe pain. It was developed in Germany in the year 1916 as an attempt to improve on the existing opioids, drugs derived and used by opium poppy for therapeutic benefits. A few common examples of compounding are non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen and oxycodone with acetaminophen. Numerous brand names include OxyContin, a Purdue Pharma brand for the time-release oral oxycodone variation, Roxycodone, and Xanodyne. 
[[File:Roxycodone 30mg.jpg|thumb|Xanodyne pharmaceutical 30mg Roxicodone immediate release tablet]]

==Prescribed Usages==
Oxycodone is mainly used to alleviate moderate to severe pain, as well as managing acute chronic pain. It can also be used an alternative to severe diarrhea and irritable bowel syndrome when commonly prescribed drugs do not work effectively. Oxycodone causes less sedation, respiratory distress, pruritus, and nausea than morphine, therefore making it easier for the body to tolerate it than morphine. If oxycodone is taken as a combination product, make sure to read all information about the ingredients and to ask your doctor and pharmacist for more information for safe usage. 

==Adverse Effects==
The most common negative side effects reported are disturbing nightmares, memory loss, fatigue, dizziness, constipation, mood changes, flushing, lightheadedness, headaches, dry mouth, itching, heavy sweating, anxiety, and diminished vision. A few patients have experienced abdominal pain, diarrhea, loss of appetite, urine retion, dyspriea, and impotence. Overdose effects include shallow breathing, clammy skin, hypotension, miosis, respiratory arrest, and death. 
[[File:Side effects of Oxycodone.png|thumb|right|Main [[adverse effect|side effects]] of oxycodone&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=American Society of Health-System Pharmacists|title=Oxycodone|publisher=U.S. National Library of Medicine, MedlinePlus|date=2009-03-23|url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a682132.html|accessdate=2009-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

==Dosage and Administration==
Oxycodone comes in a variety of forms: as a solution (including concentrated), a tablet, capsule, and long-acting/extended-release. The previous list of oxycodone forms are usually taken with or without food every 4 to 6 hours, depending if the medication is needed for temporary pain or as a regularly scheduled form of medication Always follow the directions on the prescription label and ask a doctor or pharmacist to explain any information that you do not fully understand. 

As mentioned before, it can be taken orally or intranasally using intravenous injections or rectally. 60-87% of all Oxycodone usage are through oral administration, with the rest remaining Compared to morphine, it can be 1.5 to 2 times as potent when taken orally. Because of its potency, a doctor will likely start a patient on a low dosage and increase it over time if the pain is not managed. The body can grow accustomed to the medication, and when that occurs the doctor may need to increase the dose.

This medication can be habit-forming, and consequently a patient must not take a larger dose. A patient also cannot take oxycodone more often than prescribed or take it for a longer period of time than recommended by his doctor.  Do not stop taking the medication abruptly; you may experience symptoms of withdrawal. 

==Withdrawal==
When a patient suddenly discontinues the medication, he may experience symptoms such as anxiety, panic attacks, insomnia, muscle pain, nausea, fevers, flu-like symptoms (runny noses, sneezing, chills, watery eyes, etc.) and muscle weakness. When withdrawal occurs, the doctor usually decreases the dosage gradually. Most cases of severe withdrawals are associated with those addicted and using Oxycodone illegally. The experience of withdrawals from Oxycodone are unique to each individual due to the differences in metabolism etc. Therefore even with the same amount of dosage, one person might experience a withdrawal much worse than the next man. Withdrawal effects can be diminished by proper detox procedures. &lt;ref name=&quot;oxycodone&quot;&gt;[http://www.novusdetox.com/oxycodone-withdrawal-symptoms.php oxycodone], October 28, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Druge Abuse==
Oxycodone is a powerful drug used by young teens as well as adults. The drug puts users on a advantage high. Since it is a relief medication, it provides users with a calm relief feeling for a few hours as it enters their bloodstream. The tolerance of taking the drug becomes increasingly higher as users ingest the drug more often. As addiction becomes imminent, certain side effect may come into play and also ruin the social life of drug abusers. Some of the effects addiction leads to are: constantly thinking about oxycodone, obtaining numerous amounts of the drug, taking the drug secretly in order to hide it from others from knowing, lying to loved ones, and feeling pain and restless thoughts during nights of sleep. And because oxycodone contains acetaminophen, taking high doses of the drug can lead to liver problems in the future and sometimes even death.

==Special Precautions==
Oxycodone is a sensitive and potent medication, and consequently have a few precautions before taking it. Inform your doctor and pharmacist: 
*If you are allergic to certain medications such as codeine, hycodan, and any other medications 
*If you are taking other medications (including vitamin or nutritional supplements) you are taking or plan to take.
*If you have or ever have had asthma, lung disease, or paralytic ileus
*If you continue to drink or have ever drunk large amounts of alcohol and if you have used any street drugs (including overdosing on a medication)
*If you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant, or if you are breast-feeding
*If you are about to have surgery (including dental work)

==Brand Names==
Oxycodone also go under the name of:
*Dazidox 
*Endocodone
*Oxy IR 
*ETH-Oxydose
*Oxyfast
*Roxicodone
*Oxycontin
*Oxexta

'''Introduction:''' 

Cardiolipin, the signature phospholipid of mitochondria, is a lipid dimer. The structure consists of two phosphatidyl groups bridged by a glycerol. The four acyl chains distinguish it from typical phospholipids which have two acyl chains. It is synthesized in the inner membrane of the mitochondria complex. In contrast with other phospholipids, cardiolipin remains firmly associated with mitochondrial membranes.

'''Synthesis:'''

In eukaryotic cells, cardiolipin synthesis takes places in the mitochondrion. Key steps such as the dephosphorylation of phosphatidylglycerolphosphate and the initiation of the cardiolipin remodeling cascade were identified to be linked with enzymatic activity. The biosynthesis begins with phospahtidylglycerolphosphate synthase (Pgs1) catylyzing the first step of the reaction producing phosphatidylglycerolphophate (PGP) from the condensation of cytidine 5'diphosphate-diacylglycerol (CDP-DAG) and glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P). PGP is then dephosphorylated to phosphatidylglycerol (PG)by a phosphatase identified as Gep4 and PTPMT1. Gep4 was identified in yeast for genetic interactors of prohibitins. PTPMT1 was discovered in mice. Next, cardiolipin synthase forms an immature cardiolipin from PG and CDP-DAG characterized by a random assortment of attached acyl chains that vary in length. The final phase of cardiolipid synthesis is acyl chain remodeling defined by the symmetric incorporation of unsaturated longer fatty acyl chains. The remodeling is initiated by a phospholipase specific to the organism. In yeast, the phospholipase is cardiolipin deacylase (Cld1) and in mammals the calcium-independent iPLA2γ. The phopholipase removes an acyl chain from the immature cardiolipin generating the intermediate, monolysocardiolipin (MLCL). The regeneration of cardiolipin from MLCL involves three different enzymes, tafazzin (Taz1), monolysocardiolipin acyltransferase 1 (MLCLAT1), and acyl-Coa:lysocardiollipin acyltransferase-1 (ALCAT1). MLCLAT1 and ALCAT1 utilize acyl-CoA as an acyl chain donor for the reacylation of MLCL. Taz1 is a transacylase that takes an acyl chain from another phospholipid, preferably phosphatidylcholine (PC) and adds it to MLCL. Each of these remodeling enzymes resides in a specific subcellular compartments for distinct functions. Taz1 and MLCLAT1 remodeling generates the mature cardiolipin while ALCAT1 remodeling produces the &quot;bad&quot; cardiolipin associated with pathologic processes. 



'''Functions:'''

Cardiolipin is the center of mitochondrial physiology. It plays a major role in the organization of the protein components of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS)[2]. It improves the efficiency and adaptability of the OXPHOS machinery by two mechanisms. First, cardiolipin stabilizes higher order respiratory complexes. This increases the efficiency of electron flow and ADP/ATP exchange. In addition, cardiolipin acts as a protein trap to restrict the flow of electrons. Without cardiolipin, the functionality of the electron transport chain is reduced resulting in a weaker electrochemical gradient (ΔΨ).

{{BBR/Note|
'''BLENDER NOTE: For The Novice'''

What are scenes? They are like different worlds in a .blend (that being the file format of Blender). You can use them for anything you think will work. To toggle your scene look at the pull down menu at the top of the window (generally with the text &quot;scene&quot; in it. You can add scenes from this menu and when there are more then one you may toggle between them.}}

What ''are'' scenes '''for'''? Here are the many uses:

==HUD==
Do you know what a HUD is? It stands for '''H'''eads '''U'''p '''D'''isplay and basically has your points, health or whatever you want to be told during gameplay. In Blender you create a separate scene for the HUD and get it to overlay on the gameplay. It looks like a normal HUD... because it '''is'''!

==Too Bad, You Lost!==
Don't you want consolation in a game when you lose? Add another scene and write something funny, sympathizing or weird.

==Surprise, You Won!==
If you won you want to be told that you have and maybe some of the variables giving you that win. Another scene and you're in business.

==The Game Is &lt;u&gt;''Paused''&lt;/u&gt;==
You want pause menus? When you press the button it will bring up a scene that displays your options.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Topical
For topical drug administration, drugs are applied directly to the affected area. The effect reminds in the local area. The advantage of topical administration is that drugs can be given to the patient. No trained personnel are required for application. Usually, there is no pain involved in administration. Side effects are very minimal. 

		Epicutaneous
Drugs are applied directly onto the skin surface. This administration can be used to test if a patient is allergic to certain drugs or substance. Epicutaneous administration can also be used for local anesthesia to relieve minor pain for cuts or burns.
		Eye drops
Drugs are applied directly into the affected eye. Eye drops are saline-containing liquid. Examples of eye drops are rinse eye drops, Glaucoma eye drops, steroid and antibiotic eye drops.
		Inhalational
Drugs are inhaled through the mouth by the patient. Inhalational administration drugs can be used to treat asthma or acute infection in upper airway. The advantage of inhalational administration is that the response of body is much faster than oral administration because the drug does not have to go through the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Also, because the drug does not have to go though liver, so the damage to liver is minimized. 
		Intranasal route
Intranasal route administration is also known as nasal spray. Examples of nasal spray are decongestant nasal spray or allergy relive.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Chromosome Overview==

[[File:Schéma d'un Chromosome.png|thumb|MAuthor H'arnet]]


During mitosis and meiosis chromatin fibers coil and condense into '''chromosome''' structures. Each chromosome is made up of '''chromatin''', a complex of proteins and DNA. The chromosomes are long pieces of DNA that are found in the center of the nucleus inside the cells. 
'''Centromeres''' are a constricted region on the chromosome, which determines its appearance. Centromeres can be placed along different points along the length of the chromosome classifying it as metacentric, submetacentric, acrocentric or telocentric depending on centromere location. Chromosomes are cellular structure carrying genetic material located in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells and contain DNA molecules and proteins. Somatic cells from the same species contain identical number of chromosomes, which represents the '''diploid number''' (2n). Chromosomes exist in pairs; referred to as '''homologous chromosomes''', one homologous chromosome is inherited from the organism’s mother and one from the father. Homologous chromosomes share genetic similarities such as a '''locus,''' an identical gene site along their length. On the other hand, bacteria and viruses contain only one chromosome. A normal human cell contains 46 chromosomes in its nucleus. Sex cells contain 23 chromosomes in humans. '''Haploid number''' (n) of a chromosome is one half the diploid number. During meiosis, diploid number of chromosomes are converted to haploid number as gametes are formed. Sex determining chromosomes X and Y are not often homologous. Females carry two homologous X chromosomes while males carry one Y and one X chromosome, which are not homologous but contain homologous regions and behave homologous in meiosis.
However, &quot;the remaining chromosomes are refered to the autosomal chromosomes and they are known as chromosome pairs 1 through 22&quot; (University of Maryland).

==Chromosome Mutations==


[[Image:Haploid, diploid ,triploid and tetraploid.svg|thumb|right|200px|Ehamberg]]


'''Chromosome mutations''', occur when change in the total number of chromosomes are effected by deletion or duplication of genes or chromosome segments and rearrangement of genetic material within or among chromosomes. '''Aneuploidy''' is a condition in which one or more chromosomes are present in extra copies or are deficient in number but not a complete set. To be more specific, the loss of a single chromosome from a diploid genome (diploid cell-cell containing two set of chromosomes (2n), one set inherited from each parent) is called '''monosomy''' (2n-1). The gain of one chromosome is called '''trisomy''' (2n+1). A condition with complete set of haploid chromosome is called '''euploidy'''. There are events in which organisms have more than two sets of chromosomes; '''triploids''' for example are organisms with three sets of chromosomes. '''Tetraploids''' have four sets of chromosomes.

Chromosome mutations result in serious problems such as '''Turner syndrome''', a monosomy in which females may contain all or part of an X chromosome. Monosomy for autosomes is usually lethal in humans and other animals. '''Klinefelter syndrome''', a trisomy genetic disorder in males caused by the presence of one or more X chromosome. The effects of trisomy are similar to those of monosomy. Down syndrome is the only autosomal trisomy in humans that has a substantial number of survivors one year after birth. Trisomy in chromosome 21 is the cause of Down syndrome and it affects 1 infant in every 800 live births.

==Polyploidy==

[[File:Polyploidization.svg|thumb|Ilmari Karonen]]

'''Polyploidy''', is an occurrence in which more than two sets of haploid chromosomes are present. This condition is rare in animal species but common in lizards, amphibians, fish, and very common in various plants. Polyploidy originates in two ways: (1) '''autopolyploidy''' the addition of one or more extra sets of chromosomes of the same species; (2) '''allopolyploidy''' is the combination of chromosome sets from different species. Autopolyploidy have sets of chromosomes identical to parent species.  Autotriploids for example can be represented as AAA and can arise from the failure of all chromosomes to separate during meiotic division, which result in a diploid gamete. The fertilization of the gamete by a haploid gamete results in the production of a zygote with three sets of chromosomes. Autotriploids often produce genetically unbalanced gametes with odd numbers of chromosomes. Autotetraploids can be represented by AAAA and are most likely to produce balanced gametes in sexual reproduction.

==Deletion and Duplication==
[[Image:Deletion vectorized.svg|thumb|right|200px|National Human Genome Research (USA)]]

[[Image:Gene-duplication.png|thumb|left|200px|National Human Genome Research (USA)]]

'''Deletion''' in chromosomes occurs when a chromosome breaks in one or more places and a portion is lost or missing. Deletions can occur either near one end or within the chromosome, which are known as intercalary deletions. '''Deletion loops''' are unpaired regions of the normal homolog which occurs when synapsis between a chromosome with intercalary deletion and a normal homolog.  The size of the chromosome deletion can determine the survival of the organism and unlike large deletions, small deletions can result in survival. '''Duplications''' in chromosomes occur when a large piece of chromosome is present more than once in the genome. They can arise from unequal crossing over between synapsed chromosomes during meiosis.

==Chromosome Theory of Inheritance==
In the 1902, Walter Sutton and Theordor Boveri proposed that how the chromosomes are transmitted is the same as Mendel's Theory of how genes are transmitted. Genes are located on chromosomes. Chromosomes segregate and assort independently during meiosis. The evidence comes from Morgan's experiment with fruit flies. In 1910, Thomas Hunt Morgan started his work with Drosophila melanogaster, a fruit fly. He chose fruit fly because they can be cultured easily, are very prolific, have short generation time, and have only four pair of chromosomes that can be easily identified under the microscope. They have three pair of autosomes and a pair of sex chromosomes. At that time, he already know that X and Y have to do with gender. He used normal flies with red eyes, and mutated flies with white eyes and cross breed them. He was able to conclude that gene for eye color was on the X chromosomes. Males have only 1 X, Y does not carry gene for eye color.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Acetyl-CoA==
Acetyl coenzyme A, or better known as acetyl-CoA, is an important molecule used in metabolic processes. It is primarily used by the body for energy production through the citric acid cycle, or Krebs cycle. 

==Formation==

Acetyl-CoA is a product of the oxidation of several amino acids, pyruvate and fatty acids. 
It is formed after pyruvate enters the mitochondria via active transport. The oxidation transformation that converts pyruvate into acetyl-CoA is known as a pyruvate dehydrogenase reaction. In this process, each pyruvic acid molecule loses one carbon atom, and combines with oxygen to produce carbon dioxide. This carbon dioxide is then exhaled out of the cell. This process is catalyzed by a complex of three enzymes through a process known as pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC). &lt;ref&gt;http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-acetyl-coa.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Functions==
The main function of Acetyl-CoA is to carry acyl groups or thioesters. It is the precursor to HMG CoA, an important part of cholesterol and ketone synthesis. It can also be found as a vital reagent in the synthesis of fatty acids and sterols, as well as the oxidation of fatty acids as well as the breaking down of many amino acids. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.hmdb.ca/metabolites/HMDB01206&lt;/ref&gt;

Acetyl-CoA is well known as the junction between Glycolysis and the Citric Acid Cycle as well as an essential component in balancing between carbohydrate and fat metabolism. Acetyl-CoA has also been a central metabolite that is involved in many metabolic transformations within the cell. The acetyl group of the acetyl-CoA is used to oxidize via the TCA cycle to reduce NAD+ and FAD to NADH and FADH2, respectively. These products are then used to fuel ATP production through the electron transport train.

In May 2011, Ling Cai et al. found that Acetyl-Coa functioned as a carbon-source rheostat that signals the initiation of the cellular growth program by promoting the acetylation of histones specifically at growth genes. By intimately coordinating with nutrient availability, the acetyl-CoA was concluded to play as a critical signal for metabolic growth and proliferation.

Activation of acetyl-CoA: Some acetyl groups within the cell are tagged with coenzyme A (CoA). Acetyl-CoA molecules are tagged at the back end by a process called condensation with carbon dioxide, catalyzed by acetyl-CoA carboxylase in order to redirect acetyl groups into fatty acid biosynthesis.

      <comment>/* Order or Reactions */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
When studying Chemistry, it is important to consider both the chemical properties of the reactants and the conditions under which the reaction occurs, the mechanism by which it takes place, the rate at which it occurs and the equilibrium toward which it proceeds. The law of mass action states that the rate of a chemical reaction at a constant temperature depends only on the concentrations of the substances that influence the rate, which are usually one or more of the reactants, but can occasionally be a product. Another influence on the rate can be caused by the presence of a catalyst that does not appear in the balances chemical equation. The rate law can only be experimentally determined and can be used to predict the relationship between the rate of a reaction and the concentrations of reactants.

==Rate Equation==
For almost all forward and irreversible reactions, the rate is proportional to the product of the concentrations of the reactants, each raised to some degree. For example, for the reaction aA+bB-&gt; cC +dD, the rate is proportional to [A]^m[B]^n, that is: rate = k[A]^m[B]^n 
The k is the rate constant. Multiplying the units of k by the concentration factors raised to the appropriate powers give the rate in units of: concentration/time.
The proportionality factor, k called the rate constant, is a constant at a certain temperature. There are dimensions in the constant and it can be easily determined by using dimensional analysis of a particular rate law.. It is commonly known that as the value of the k value increases, the reaction speed increases.

==Rate Law Determination through Experiment==
The value of k (constant), x and y in the rate law equation (rate= [A]^m[B]n) must be determined experimentally for a given reaction at given temperature. the rate is measured as a function of the initial concentrations of the reactants A and B.
==Order or Reactions==
Chemical reactions are often classified on the basis of kinetics as zero-order, first-order, second-order, mixed order, or higher-order reactions. The general reaction aA + bB → cC + dD will be used in the discussion next. 
First lets note what each of these orders means in terms of initial rate of reaction effect:
# Zero-order in the reactant—there is no effect on the initial rate of reaction
# First-order in the reactant—there initial rate of reaction doubles
# Second order in the reactant—the initial rate of the reaction quadruples
# Third order in the reactant—the initial rate of reaction increases eightfold



The equation of rate law &lt;ref name=&quot;rate law&quot;/&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
-r_A = k_A(T)fn(C_A, C_B, ...)
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;k_A&lt;/math&gt; is the specific rate of reaction, which also called the rate constant. 
   

Generally, four reactions are involved with rate laws. The homogeneous reactions include only one phase. The Heterogeneous reactions include two or more phases, and usually appear at the interface between the phases. The reversible reactions depend on the concentrations of reactants and products that can react in both directions. The irreversible reactions react in only one direction until one of the reactants is exhausted. 

Generally, there are four types of reaction order. The most common form is 

&lt;math&gt;          
-r_A= k_A C_A^aC_B^b
&lt;/math&gt;


The units of the specific reaction rate constant are

&lt;math&gt;           
k = (Concentration)^{1-n} / Time
&lt;/math&gt;
 

The four types of reaction order:
 
*Zero-order (n=0): 		      &lt;math&gt;-r_A= k_A&lt;/math&gt;
 	
The unit of k of zero-order is &lt;math&gt;mol/dm^3/s&lt;/math&gt;
 
*First-order (n=1): 		     &lt;math&gt;-r_A= k_A C_A &lt;/math&gt;              
 	
The unit of k of first-order is &lt;math&gt;s^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;
 
*Second-order (n=2): 	     &lt;math&gt;-r_A = k_A C_A^2&lt;/math&gt;
  	
The unit of k of second-order is &lt;math&gt;dm^3/mol/s&lt;/math&gt;
 
*Third-order (n=3): 	             &lt;math&gt;-r_A = k_A C_A^3&lt;/math&gt;
	
The unit of k of third-order is &lt;math&gt;(dm^3/mol)^2/s&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Gene regulation is often affected by variations stemming from the chromatin. A multitude of mechanisms play roles in gene regulation, including “regulation of the core transcription machinery, recruitment of the transcriptional activators or repressors, and altering chromatin structure via post-translational covalent modification of histone proteins.” Yet the most studied and proven mechanism roots from variations of chromatin architecture. Recent research has pointed to a variety of metabolic molecules to be responsible for modulation of genes. Some key metabolic regulators found were: Acetyl-CoA, NAD+, SAM and alpha-KG.

In a landmark study by Kaochar et al., acetylation was found to play a major role in histone modifications, which ultimately leads to gene transcription.

&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22944281&lt;/ref&gt;

==Acetyl-CoA==
== History==

In 1964, Allfrey et al. found that the acetylation of the histone tails facilitated access to DNA for transcription by neutralizing the positive charge of lysine side chains. This is due to the fact that many transcription factors interact directly with the acetylated lysines. A significant correlation was found between the ability of a protein to acetylate histones and activate transcription.

== Mechanism == 

The wide range of post-translational modifications of histone proteins allow chromatins to take on a variety of structures. This, in turn, contributes to the cell’s ability to control gene expression.</text>

== This game was invented by protein researcher David Baker and his fellow computer scientists from University of Washington. The objective of fold.it is find the best structure(the one that is in the lowest energy level)for desire protein. Players use tools like building hydrogen bonds or rotating the structure around. They collect points as they lower the energy of the structure. Players of fold.it are mostly people who don't have knowledge in protein structures. However, these players has done a lot of amazing works in improving our knowledge of proteins. One of the biggest accomplishments they have done was finding the three dimensional structure of a virus that cause AIDS in monkey in 2011. While the supercomputer tried to solve this protein folding problem for 15 years,a group of gamer found the solution in as short as three weeks. This group of gamer didn't want to reveal their real names but their passion for the game has advanced protein study significantly.
If you want to be part of this evolutionary game, you can go to http://fold.it/. The game has a clear interface and is very easy to start. As you learn how to use different tools you can use for the game, you also learn more about all the different amino acids interactions in real actions and see it happen in the game.

      <comment>/* Kinetic Control */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Background ==

Product ratios of reactions can be changed according to the conditions in which the reaction occurs.  Depending on the kinetic and thermodynamic control of the reaction, product ratios can vary dramatically. An example of this is the hydrobromination of 1,3-butadiene at 40&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C v.s 0&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C.  At 0&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C, the reaction is under kinetic control and the products favor 3-Bromo-1-butene over 1-Bromo-2-butene in a 70:30 mixture.  However at 40&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C, the reaction is under thermodynamic control and favors the 1-Bromo-2-butene product with a 15:85 ratio. &lt;ref name = &quot;Schore&quot; /&gt;

Chemical reactions can be controlled by thermodynamic or kinetic means. When a reaction can yield two different products, the reaction conditions change the outcome and therefore the products. When conditions of a reaction changes, the reaction itself may change. Some conditions to be considered are temperature, pressure, light, or even solvent. The difference between thermodynamic and kinetic conditions is that thermodynamic factors associate with the relative stability of the molecules while the kinetic factors are associated with the rate of product formation. This phenomena of different products can only occur when there are two different paths with two different activation energies or energy required to make the reaction progress. In essence, when temperature is low the reaction undergoes kinetic control where the major product is the one that comes from the quickest reaction. When temperature is high, the reaction undergoes thermodynamic control which provides the more stable system and product. Under kinetic control the reaction is rate based and is not reversible, but under thermodynamic control the reaction is in equilibrium and is also reversible under the correct conditions. &lt;ref name=&quot;control&quot;&gt;[http://www.chem.ucalgary.ca/courses/350/Carey5th/Ch10/ch10-3-3.html control], November 20, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Thermodynamic Control ==

When the product ratio of a reaction depends upon the thermodynamic stability of the products, a reaction is said to be under thermodynamic control. In the hydrobromination of 1,3-Butadiene at 40&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C, the ratio of the products favors the more stable isomer, as it is under thermodynamic control. At higher temperatures or over long periods of time, the more stable isomer will dominate as the two isomers will be in equilibrium and rapidly interconvert.&lt;ref name =&quot;Schore&quot;&gt;Schore, Neil E. (2011). Organic Chemistry Structure and Function 6th Edition. W. H. Freeman&lt;/ref&gt;

Thermodynamic control of a reaction favors the more thermodynamically stable molecule. This reaction pathway is selected for by using long reaction times or high temperatures. Long reaction times or high temperatures will give the molecules more energy to surpass the lower kinetic pathway to eventually make its way over to the more stable thermodynamic product. Even though molecules have already taken the kinetic pathway, with enough time or high enough temperatures, the molecules will have the energy to go back and overcome the higher activation energy in order to rest in the more stable state or product. Essentially, with enough time or temperature molecules will select for the thermodynamically controlled pathway and end as the more stable product. &lt;ref name=&quot;control&quot;&gt;[http://www.chem.ucalgary.ca/courses/350/Carey5th/Ch10/ch10-3-3.html control], November 20, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Kinetic Control ==

A product ratio that follows the relative rates of formation, such as the hydrobromination of 1,3-butadiene at 0&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C, is said to be under kinetic control.  The reason 3-Bromo-1-butene dominates is because at 0&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C, the reverse formation is much slower than at 40&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C so the isomers are not rapidly inter-converting.&lt;ref name = &quot;Schore&quot; /&gt;

Kinetic control favors shorter reaction times. This is also the path that requires less energy or has a lower activation energy. This is because at the start of a fast reaction more molecules will go towards the kinetic lower energy path and if stopped short, the molecules will not have a chance to return and take the thermodynamic path. Also, low temperature favors the kinetic pathway because it does not give the molecules that already took the kinetic path enough energy to return back to the starting material and then take the thermodynamic path. The way to get the kinetic product is to use short times for reactions to trap the kinetic product or use high temperatures.  &lt;ref name=&quot;control&quot;&gt;[http://www.chem.ucalgary.ca/courses/350/Carey5th/Ch10/ch10-3-3.html control], November 20, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is how to build a simple aeroponic bucket.

==Materials==
All component materials should be nonhazardous/noncancerous. For tools and supplementary instructions see: [[Hydroculture/DIY|hydroculture DIY]]
* 5 gallon bucket with lid
* pump: fountain
* pex tubing
* sprinkler head: grass type
* plastic grommet: larger than plug socket depending on configuration

==Process==
Modification on the bucket is optional. Cut holes in the lid for net pots. Then cut a hole for a grommet, either in the lid or close to the top of the bucket. This is to protect the wire from damage that could cause an electrical hazard. 

The water pump can be super-glued or tie wrapped to a heavy object to keep it from moving.
Place water pump inside the bucket, thread the wire through the grommet. Water can spill out of here, so keep electrical connections higher than and away from this.
The remaining space between the wire and the grommet can be filled in, without a material that can scratch or otherwise damage the electrical wire: cut a slit in a smaller grommet to fit around wire.

Fit pex tubing on water pump connector. Some grass sprinkler heads will fit inside of the pex tubing.

Now it is time for finishing touches.

      <comment>/* Types of Noise */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">

Noise can be defined as random fluctuations of a signal.  Noise caused by stochastic fluctuations in genetic circuits (transcription and translation) is now appreciated as a central aspect of cell function and phenotypic behavior. Noise has also been detected in signaling networks, but the origin of this noise and how it shapes cellular outcomes remain poorly understood. The noise in signaling networks results from the intrinsic promiscuity of protein-protein interactions (PPIs), and that this noise has shaped cellular signal transduction. Features promoted by the presence of this molecular signaling noise include multimerization and clustering of signaling components, pleiotropic effects of gross changes in protein concentration, and a probabilistic rather than a linear view of signal propagation.

== Types of Noise ==
=== Genetic Noise ===
Genetic noise is caused by the random fluctuations of signals during the processes of transcription and translation in DNA replication.  The noise can cause genes to express differently.  For example, two genetically identical cells can behave differently due to the influence of noise.  This random gene expression may allow the cell to suddenly be able to resist a substance that would originally have killed it if the noise did not cause the cell to change.  
=== Signaling Noise  ===
Noise in signaling is caused by the numerous amount of protein-protein interactions(PPI) due to its promiscuous nature.  Since proteins interact with many other types of proteins in a short period of time, many signals are being produced. The promiscuity of PPIs that create signal noise may help the recovery of cell functions through homologous pathways. This signaling noise may also be important for increasing robustness of signaling between cells by dampening incorrect events. Increasing robustness of signals can be due to multimerization, functional selectivity, and also pleiotropic effects. There has been research that shows that noise plays a role in epigenetic memory by affecting the central switches of cell functions. There is also speculation that changes in levels of signaling noise may be related to human diseases. By understanding how signaling noise affects cell function, researchers and scientists can finally get a better idea on its affect on diseases or also on propagation of epigenetic memory.

== Noise Threshold ==
Noise creates a threshold for signals to cross before a signal can create an effect.  This threshold prevents many irrelevant signals due to the promiscuous nature of PPI to cause an effect.  A single signal from a receptor cannot overcome the noise threshold by itself. To overcome this threshold, multiple receptors must come together to create a signal large enough to overcome the signal.  The process of which multiple receptors come together is called multimerization.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22341496&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Multimerization ===
Multimerization is the clustering of multiple receptors which together create a noise which surpasses the background noise in the cells. This is the first method of overcoming the noise threshold so that signals can be sent appropriately and accordingly. When the receptors sending the same signal join together, the signal is then amplified which allows it to be sent. In contrast, when there is just one or a few receptors, the combined noise of their signals will less likely be greater than the threshold, resulting in no signal being sent. 

=== Functional Selectivity ===
Functional selectivity is another way to allow signals to be sent through a &quot;proof-reading&quot; method. If the components of the signal are all present and in the exact order in which the signal consists of, then the signal will be sent. If there are some but not all of the components of the specific signal, then that signal will not be sent. This method can be referred to as &quot;proof-reading&quot; because the body makes sure that the signal components are all correct in order for the process to proceed. The body will &quot;proof-read&quot; for any mistakes and correct them to allow signals to proceed.

=== Pleiotropic Effect ===
Pleiotropic effect is when the body produces more of one specific molecule that will lead to the surpassing of the noise threshold which results in a signal being sent. This effect does not necessarily mean that the number of receptors will change (like in multimerization). Instead, the concentration of a molecule is what changes in order to increase the chances of sending a signal. The body can also reduce the chance of a sending a harmful signal by reducing the concentration of a molecule related to the harmful signal. This way the noise level of the harmful signal will not surpass the noise threshold and will not be sent.

== Human Interactome ==
[[File:Human interactome.jpg|center|400px|Human Interactome]]

The human interactome is a large intricate network of thousands of protein-protein interactions (PPIs). It contrasts the classical idea that protein interactions follow a linear signaling pathway. Within the human interactome, proteins not only interact with one other protein, but they interact with many different proteins. This could also be seen as proteins having multiple protein partners to communicate with. The interaction of several proteins is what makes up the promiscuity of these PPI networks. The human interactome is a huge discovery because it allows researchers to search deeper into its relationship with diseases and genetics. 


There are three different ways to see whether interactome networks have been established.
The first is through a compilation of interactions from published work. There are usually some established literature-based work on the physical or biochemical interactions done by other researchers which can reassure that the interaction network does exist. The second way is through computational predictions which are based on the structural information of a protein, sequence and gene-order, and the existence of genes in genomes that transfer interactions between organisms (via orthology mapping). Though this way might be quick, the lack of experimental proof due to indirect 'orthogonal' information makes this a not so strong approach. The last approach is through systematic mapping strategies applied towards large groups of genomes and proteomes. Because of the advancement in technology, researchers and scientists are able to put together interactomes in shorter periods of time (than before).

      <comment>/* The Demethylation Pathway */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
Derived from the Greek, epigenome means &quot;above&quot; the genome. The epigenome consists of chemical compounds that modify, or mark, the genome in a way that tells it what to do, where to do it and when to do it. The marks, which are not part of the DNA itself, can be passed on from cell to cell as cells divide, and from one generation to the next.

==Effects of Epigenome==
The protein-coding parts of your genome, called genes, do not make proteins all of the time in all of your cells. Instead, different sets of genes are turned on or off in various kinds of cells at different points in time. Differences in the types and amounts of proteins produced determine how cells look, grow and act. The epigenome influences which genes are active — and which proteins are produced — in a particular cell. So, the epigenome is what tells your skin cells to behave like skin cells, heart cells like heart cells and so on.

==Epigenetic Modification==

Epigenetics involves heritable gene functions that are not attributed to changes in the cell’s DNA sequence. Some known examples of epigenetic modifications include DNA methylation and histone modification.

===DNA Methylation===

[[File:DNA methylation.jpg|thumb|DNA methylation of a DNA strand and its complimentary strand]]

DNA methylation is the process of adding a methyl group to a DNA sequence. This reaction is catalyzed by an enzyme known as DNA methyltransferase (DNMTs). There are two types of DNMTs: De novo DNMTs and Maintenance DNMTs. De novo DNA methyltransferase enzymes initially attaches the methyl group to a DNA strand. Maintenance DNMTs copy the methylation from an existing DNA strand onto the complimentary strand after replication. DNMTs recognize regions where a cytosine nucleotide is placed next to a guanine nucleotide along the base sequence. This region is known as CpG, where a phosphate group binds a cytosine to an adjacent guanine.

DNA methylation processing is used to repress gene expression. The methylation blocks the promoter site at which transcription factors bind to, thus stopping the gene expression. Though DNA methylation is very stable, the reaction can be reversed by a different group of enzymes.

===De Novo Methylation in Cancer===
Alterations to DNA methylation patterns play a major role in the onset of cancer. In fact, all tumors that have been studied exhibit changes in DNA methylation. Early studies seem to suggest that widespread demethylation is characteristic of cancer. One type of methylation pattern is called de novo methylation. In this process, the polycomb complex (PRC2) targets genes that, under normal conditions, have unmethylated CpG island promoters. These genes are repressed due to the methylation of H3K27. Methylation of H3K27 is mediated by  the histone methylase EZH2. The methylated H3K27 then binds to the chromodomain-containing complex (PRC1), thereby giving rise to a type of heterochromatin. During normal development, targeted de novo methylation can take place at certain sites on DNA. Similarly, it can occur abnormally in cancer. The explanation offered for this phenomenon suggests that the histone methylase EZH2 recruits Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b. Some studies show that the polycomb complex PRC2 may be released from the methylated islands. This event results in a more stabilized form of methylation-mediated repression, which occurs instead of the flexible polycomb repression mechanism. 

Many believe that de novo methylation is a completely random process. This theory helps to explain the presence of methylated tumor suppressor genes in some cancer types. However, more recent research reveal DNA methylation in cancer to involve hundreds of CpG islands that are methylated in a more pre-determined way. Under the older theory, it is believed that DNA methylation causes genes to become inactivated. In contrast, the newer theory revealed that the genes targeted for methylation have already been inactive. Many of these targeted genes have a polycomb complex nearby, which may explain how the methylases are recruited to carry out the gene modification. Thus, the newer theory based on programmed methylation suggests that de novo methylation in cancer  occurs on gene sites that were targeted regardless of whether the genes are active or inactive. The target sites are also independent of whether the genes affect tumorigenesis. Nonetheless, studies on human colon cancer reveal the possibility that DNA methylation can cause a more permanent repression mechanism than that of the normally flexible polycomb repression mechanism; this observation links DNA methylation to tumorigenesis.


===Fragile X Syndrome===
Fragile X Syndrome is a developmental disease that eventually causes mental retardation. This disease occurs when abnormal de novo methylation causes the repression of the FMR1 gene early in development. Abnormal de novo methylation is believed to be the cause of Fragile X syndrome due to the fact that inactivation of the FMR1 gene is observed to occur alongside a process known as H3K9me3 heterochromatinization. From these studies, scientists believe that the programming of all abnormal modifications may proceed through a single mechanism in which histone methylases mediate random DNA methylation and repression. 


===The Demethylation Pathway===
Active demethylation occurs in a step-wise manner that results in a modification of 5-methylcytidine (5mC). This modification allows the molecule to be recognized for removal and replacement by repair; the modified 5-methylcytidine is replaced with unmethylated cytosine. The following steps depict the pathway suggested for active demethylation: 

1. Hydroxylation: An enzyme known as ten-eleven-translocation (Tet) catalyzes the hydroxylation of the methyl group on 5-methylcytidine, thereby forming 5-hydroxymethylcytidine (5hmC). 

2. Deamination: Activation-induced deaminase (Aid) or Apobec family proteins replaces the amine group of 5-hydroxymethylcytidine with a doubly bonded oxygen atom. This new molecule is called 5-hydroxymethyluridine (5hmU). 

3. Glycosylation: A glycosylase (Mbd4 or Tdg) essentially removes the 5-hydroxymethyluridine structure from the sugar-phosphate backbone. What is left is an apyrimidinic acid residue.

4. Repair: The apyrimidinic acid residue is replaced with cytosine (C) through a repair process such as nucleotide excision repair (BER or NER).

===Histone Code===

The hypothesis of the histone code, a recent postulation by Strahl and Allis &lt;ref&gt;http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v406/n6796/abs/406593a0.html&lt;/ref&gt;, suggests that it is a number of histone modifications at a particular locus that is involved in determining what genes are expressed or suppressed.  This expression is a heritable epigenetic factor that allows regulatory proteins to have an effect on gene expression.  By changing the charge of histones or the addition of structural proteins, genes can be essentially turned on or off.  But the question of whether it is the combination of histone modifications working in concert or a cumulative effect of numerous modifications is a topic of current debate&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968000410000940&lt;/ref&gt;.  Histone modifiers consist of residue specific proteins and reader proteins allow for these epigenetic changes to be transmitted post-translationally.

===Transcriptional Histone Modifications ===

Acetylation of histones has been associated with increased transcription of specific genes&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968000410000940&lt;/ref&gt;. Several acetyltranserfase compounds have been documented that allow acetylation of histone complexes and increase genetic transcription.  Using genome mapping techniques, it has been shown that the most acetylated regions are responsible for the highest rates of transcription.  However, the acetylation is relatively dynamic, often only lasting for several minutes&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968000410000940&lt;/ref&gt;.  This suggests that it is the frequent acetylation that has a role in the promotion of a genetic region rather than simply the presence of acetylated histones.  

Lysine methylation in histones that leads to decreased transcriptional activity is much longer lived in relation to acetylation.  Mono, di, and tri-methylation is part of an indexing system that is involved in epigenetic control and each manner of methylation has a different longevity&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968000410000940&lt;/ref&gt;.  Additionally, methylation has a longer turnover rate than phosphorylation.

Serine, Threonine, and Tyrosine can be phosphorylated as another impermanent epigenetic control factor that occurs on histone tails.   During mitosis, core histone tails are occasionally phosphorylated in a process that is initiated then spreads throughout the genome&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968000410000940&lt;/ref&gt;.  Phosphorylation has been linked to acetylation and other post transcriptional modifications.

===Histone assembly and deposition===

As chromatin is assembled, histones are constructed in the cytoplasm and transported through the nuclear membrane to be deposited on DNA.  Generally, histone assembly and placement is concurrent with S-phase progression.  Histones are initially modified on their journey into the nucleus and placed at the replication fork of the chromatin then further modifications are made within the first few minutes of placement.  However, further modifications like the methylation of lysine occur after longer periods of time, indicating the importance of epigenetic changes&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968000410000940&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Inheritance of the epigenetic code===

For histone modifications and the epigenetic code to be heritable, the cell must be able to initiate modification, alter modifications, and transmit modifications to future copies of the genetic code.  As mentioned previously, acetylation of histones has a rapid turnover, which does not strongly suggest a lasting or heritable epigenetic control.  Even in situations where acetylation is observed for longer durations, it is usually seen to attract proteins responsible for increasing levels of acetylation, and is not likely responsible for the heritability of epigenetic codes&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968000410000940&lt;/ref&gt;.  Methylation, however has been observed to have a prolonged binding and increased stability of reaction and could be responsible for a transmittable epigenetic code.  Although it is still to be determined if there is a “histone code” that carries epigenetic changes as DNA is copied, a code based on methylation of histones is the most likely type of histone modification to be involved.

==Epigenome and cancer==
Cancers are caused by a combination of changes to the genome and the epigenome.

Adding or removing methyl groups can switch genes involved in cell growth off or on. If such changes occur at the wrong time or in the wrong cell, they can wreak havoc, converting normal cells into cancer cells that grow wildly out of control.

For example, in a type of brain tumor called glioblastoma, doctors have had some success in treating patients with a drug, called temozolomide, that kills cancer cells by adding methyl groups to DNA. But that's only part of a very complex picture. Cells also contain a gene, called MGMT, that produces a protein that subtracts methyl groups — an action that counteracts the effects of temozolomide. In some glioblastomas, however, the switch for the MGMT gene has itself been turned off by methylation, which blocks production of the protein that counteracts temozolomide. Consequently, glioblastoma patients whose tumors have methylated MGMT genes are far more likely to respond to temozolomide than those with unmethylated MGMT genes.

Changes in the epigenome also activate growth-promoting genes in stomach cancer, colon cancer and the most common type of kidney cancer. In other cancers, changes in the epigenome silence genes that normally serve to keep cell growth in check.

To come up with a complete list of all the possible changes that can lead to cancer, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has started a project called The Cancer Genome Atlas. Beginning with glioblastoma, these researchers are comparing the genomes and epigenomes of normal cells to those of cancer cells. They are looking for any changes in the DNA sequence, called mutations; changes in the number and structure of chromosomes; changes in the amounts of proteins produced by genes; and changes in the number of methyl groups on the DNA.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Overview==
[[File:MCS.JPG|thumb|Schematic Diagram of the MSCs in a Eukaryotic Cell]]
Two organelles in a cell come in contact via membrane contact sites (MCS).  Membrane contact sites govern the signaling and crossing of ions and lipids from one cellular organelle to the next.  Even though research on MCS have been going on for over 50 years now, there is still so much more to uncover regarding their function, structure and regulation.  To this date, there are multiple studies done on three main contact sites: the nucleus-vacuole junction, mitochondria-ER, and plasma membrane-ER contact sites.  Having membrane- bound organelles is a special characteristic for eukaryotic cells, as it allows for specialized functions in different compartments of the cell.  Two organelles exchange information through interorganellar or MCS when they are in close proximity.  To visualize their communication, a technique such as electron microscopy was employed.  This technique first arose in the 1950s when the close apposition of endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria was first seen.  Ever since then, similar electron microscopy techniques were used to visualize contact sites in cells between the endoplasmic reticulum and: mitochondria, vacuoles, Golgi, chloroplasts and plasma membrane.  Since most studies were conducted without molecular markers, they usually refer to proximity of around 30 nanometers between two organelles’ membranes.  Unfortunately, there is still no excellent 3D model visualization of MCS.  However, in the recent years, there is an increase in the studies of the proteins that reside in the membrane sites and molecular determinants needed to create MCS. 


===The Nucleus-Vacuole Junction (NVJ)===

    
The membrane contact site between the nucleus and the vacuole is known as the nucleus-vacuole junction (NVJ).  The primary study is of the yeast cell Saccharomyces cerevisiae, in which the vacuolar membrane, inner nuclear membrane, and the ER membrane is bridged through NVJ.  Nucleus-vacuole junctions are the best studied MCS to this date. NVJ is made of vacuolar protein Vac8 and the ER-localized protein Nvj1. If one of these two proteins is missing from deletion of genes, the MCS will not be made and there would not be contact between two organelles. &lt;br&gt; : There have been two cellular functions suggested for the NVJ.  The first one is piecemeal microautophagy of the nucleus.  This is a process that marks a part of the yeast nucleus for degradation in the vacuole lumen.  Piecemeal microautophagy of the nucleus is stimulated during nitrogen or carbon starvation and requires autophagic parts shared between the electrochemical gradient across the vacuolar membrane, the selective cytoplasm to vacuole, and unselective microautophagy.  The second suggested function of NVJ is lipid biosynthesis.  The two proteins that participate in lipid biosynthesis, Osh1 and Tsc13, reside in the NVJ. Osh1 comes from the yeast oxysterol-binding protein homology family whose role includes lipid sensors and lipid transfer.  However, there is no evidence that shows NVJ regulates lipid biosynthesis because localization of osh1 in NVJ is exclusive to stationary phase. In addition,  OSH1 is not needed for forming NVJs or for the piecemeal microautophagy of the nucleus in starved cells. The other protein resides in NVJ (Tsc13) is responsible for catalyzing the terminal step in biosynthesis of very-long-chain fatty acids(VLCFAs). These fatty acids can affect the structure and fluidity of membranes. Although we have pretty good understanding of these two enzymes, we haven't figured out why they reside in NVJ or if there are other proteins that are in the NVJ.&lt;br&gt; : Similar contact sites between ER and the endosome/lysosome (for eukaryote cells) have been observed. Instead of osh1, late endosome-localized oxysterol-binding protein-related protein 1L(ORP1L) works as a cholesterol sensor and it sense level of cholesterol by changing its conformation. Through the change of conformation, ORP1L tells ER how much cholesterol there is in the cell. &lt;br&gt; : Although NVJ is the most studied membrane contact site, we still don't know how much it can do for a cell.

===The Mitochondria-ER contact site===
The second most-studied MCS is the mitochondria-ER site.  This site is primarily visualized via electron microscopy.  The section of ER that co-purifies with the mitochondria, known as mitochondria-associated membrane fraction (MAM), is researched extensively on.  The two main functions of this site is lipid biosynthesis and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;  homeostasis.  Early research showed that the MAM fraction encompasses enzymes that participate in phospholipid biosynthesis.  In addition, the mitochondria and ER must work together to make certain lipids. For example, let’s take a closer look in the biosynthetic pathway of phosphatidylcholine.  The substrate for this pathway is made in the ER, which then enters the intermembrane space of the mitochondria to produce phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), and then PE goes back to the ER to synthesize phosphatidylcholine.  This process shows that the ER and mitochondria collaborate to produce certain lipids.  On the other hand, ER-mitochondria MSCs is responsible for the transmission of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; .  Homeostasis of mitochondrial Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;  is important because Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; regulated the ATP production rate.  Furthermore, an overload of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;  can trigger cell death.

===The PM-ER contact site===


There are many contact sites of ER-PM in different cell types.  The function of ER-plasma membrane contact sites is similar to that of the mitochondria-ER junctions, since Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; homeostasis and lipid synthesis and trafficking take place there.  As mentioned above, Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; regulation is crucial as it is also responsible for protein synthesis, folding, and signaling.  In excitable cells, the global calcium signal is generated by the coupling of PM depolarization and ER calcium release.  In non-excitable cells, calcium influx is controlled by detecting luminal ER Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;  levels.  Research has showed that the PM-ER contact site is involved in non-vesicular lipid trafficking. We know that lipids are insoluble in water. So to transfer lipid from its synthesis sites to its desired work place, one must shield the lipid. In fact, couple families of lipid transfer protein (LTPs) that can perform this task have been found on the contact sites. One of them is oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP) related proteins(ORPS). The oxysterol-binding protein related protein is of a big LTP family which is conserved from yeast to man. It binds to sterols and scientist believe it helps to transfer non-vesicular sterol between the ER and PM.  Even though PM-ER contact sites is crucial for Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;  and lipid signaling,  we still cannot identify the tether proteins that mediate such contact. One strong possible protein for PM-ER contact sites is a class  of highly conserved protein called junctophilins. It can stabilize the junctions by anchoring ER/SR to the PM, giving a structual basis for physiological coupling between PM and ER/SR Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;  channels.
Further investigation is necessary to map the molecular machinery for the regulation and generation of PM-ER contact sites.

=== Conclusion of the Membrane Contact Sites (MCS) ===
Functions of MCS was established first as a site of trafficking of lipids and ions. However, as more and more studies done on MCS, we know that MCSs are also responsible for signaling, effective transmission of metabolic cues within cell, organellar inheritance control mechanism. We are not clear on how MCS perform these tasks yet but better understanding of MCS would be achieved once we figure out its molecular components.

==Introduction==
Norethindrone (or norethisterone)  is a form of female hormone that prevents ovulation (the release of egg from an ovary). This medicine causes changes in a woman's cervical mucus and uterine lining, making it harder for sperm to reach the uterus and therefore harder for conception.

Norethindrone is used for birth control (contraception) to prevent pregnancy. Norethindrone is also used to treat menstrual disorders, endometriosis, or abnormal vaginal bleeding caused by a hormone unbalance.

==Side Effect==
Immediately contact for medical help if you have any of these signs of an allergic reaction after consuming Norethindrone: 
# hives 
# difficulty breathing 
# swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat.

Stop using this medication and call your doctor if you have any of these serious side effects:

# sudden numbness or weakness, especially on one side of the body;
# sudden headache, confusion, pain behind the eyes, problems with vision, speech, or balance;
# pain or swelling in one or both legs;
# migraine headache;
# swelling in your hands or feet, rapid weight gain;
# symptoms of depression (sleep problems, weakness, mood changes);
# severe pelvic pain;
# chest pain or heavy feeling, pain spreading to the arm or shoulder, nausea, sweating, general ill feeling; or
# nausea, stomach pain, low fever, loss of appetite, dark urine, clay-colored stools, jaundice (yellowing of the skin or eyes).
# Less serious side effects may include:
# mild nausea, vomiting, bloating, stomach cramps;
# breast pain, swelling, or tenderness;
# dizziness;
# freckles or darkening of facial skin;
# increased acne or hair growth;
# changes in weight;
# vaginal itching or discharge;
# skin itching or rash;
# changes in your menstrual periods, decreased sex drive; or
# mild headache.

==History of Synthesis==
In 1951, norethindrone was synthesized by chemists Luis Miramontes, Carl Dijerassi, and George Rosenkranz at Syntex in Mexico City.

      <comment>/* Allele Frequency in Subpopulations */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Gene flow is the movement of genes from one population to another through the transfer of alleles. This can occur within a population as well as across a population.  Gene flow includes lots of different kinds of events, such as pollen being blown to a new destination or people moving to new cities or countries. If genes are carried to a population where those genes previously did not exist, gene flow can be a very important source of genetic variation. In the graphic below, the gene for brown coloration moves from one population to another.


[[File:Gene flow final.png|thumbnail]]

The rate of gene flow depends on the capability of individual organisms. For example, a wind-pollinated corn will have a possible gene flow range of about 50 feet whereas fruit flies have migrated from over 15km.

==Random Drifts==
Random drifts: the idea of allele frequencies in gene flow is that all alleles have an equal opportunity of being transfered. Although some alleles appear to be more favorable, this is accounted by its increased appearance in the population. Random drift is the important mechanism of evolution. One aspect of genetic drift is the random nature of transmitting alleles from one generation to the next, given that only a fraction of all possible zygotes become mature adults. The easiest case to visualize is the one which involves binomial sampling error. If a pair of diploid sexually reproducing parents (such as humans) have only a small number of offspring, then not all of the parent's alleles will be passed on to their progeny due to chance assortment of chromosomes at meiosis. In a large population, this will not have much effect in each generation because the random nature of the process will tend to average out. But in a small population the effect could be rapid and significant.

==Gene Flow in Humans==
Gene flow in humans can be primarily accounted by migration. For example, the Vietnam War caused the mating of US soldiers with Vietnamese women, thus leading to a differing gene pool frequency.  
The loss or gain of people can also affect the gene flow. For example, if red-haired Scottish were to move out of the country, then the next generations of Scottish would consist of fewer red-heads.
Population genetic studies are mainly based on the description of genetic variability and on interpopulational comparisons using genetic distance measures. The evolutionary dynamics of the populations are inferred from these parameters and accurate estimates of gene flow may be critical. The present study reevaluates the role of gene flow in human populations by different statistical methods from a number of microsatellite and protein polymorphism data. The estimated number of individuals exchanged per generation (Nm) was greater than 1 in all data sets with all statistical methods. The correlation between geographic and genetic distances suggests a pattern of isolation by distance, characteristic of demographic and genetic equilibrium conditions among populations worldwide. Thus the high values of Nm may be interpreted as a reflection of high gene flow between geographically close populations. As expected, gene flow appears to exert a pivotal role in the genetic history of humans.

==Gene Flow between Species==
Gene flow can occur between species through viruses. The DNA of one cell is extracted by a virus and injected into another.
The extent of this type of gene flow between humans is unclear at the moment, although estimates of 40-50% are plausible. However, this can be observed in several species such as insects, fish, reptiles, mammals, and especially microorganisms.

Researchers hypothesize that differential gene flow across species boundaries is a pattern resulting from selection, in which the absence of selection on some traits or alleles between species results in gradual transitions of these traits across a hybrid zone. In contrast, ongoing selection to maintain species at other traits prevents the dispersal of alleles across species boundaries and is expected to produce a pattern of steep transitions of traits across a hybrid zone. In house mice, researchers found that alleles near the center of the X chromosome exhibit steep transitions across the hybrid zone, and these alleles are in a region previously shown to be associated with hybrid sterility. This work demonstrates the utility of hybrid zones to test for the effect of selection on interspecies gene flow in particular regions of the genome. 

By continuing to study hybridizing species and hybrid zones, researchers can further understand which sets of genes have permissible gene flow and which are more restricted. Then, by studying genes in the latter category, scientists can learn which genes or gene sets may be important in maintaining species integrity in the face of gene flow.

==Allele Frequency in Subpopulations==
The average allele frequency can be calculated via this formula:
pt = p + (po - p ) (1-m)^t

p is the frequency of alleles in generation t
m is the migration rate
o is the initial frequency of an allele in a subpopulation
t is the number of generations

OMPG is used to provide a balance between drift and gene flow and allow heterozygosity by minimizing the loss of alleles.

Given subpopulation size, number of subpopulations, the migration rate m, generations to evolve, this script shows changes of allele frequencies among subpopulations at single locus, which results from the effect of migration. All subpopulations have equal number of individuals.
Migration is depicted in the form of a N*N matrix, which is consisted with identical non-zero values at non-diagonal positions and zero on the diagonal line, where N is the number of subpopulations. Sum of values of elements on row i (i = 1, 2, …, N) of the migration matrix equals to the migration rate, thus it ensures that every individual in subpopulation i has probability m to become a migrant, and such a migrant has equal possibility of entering any other subpopulation. Initialization of allele frequencies among subpopulations is to use a list of numbers, which have counts equal to number of subpopulations and been set evenly distributed between 0 and 1, including 0 and 1. Therefore, the average allele frequency named theoretical value that all subpopulations share after a long term of evolution will be 0.5.

      <text xml:space="preserve">“Better medical treatments do not always require stronger medicine. The effectiveness of chemical agents depends on the method of administration. So treatment can often be improved by finding optimal drug formulation of delivery system.” (Professor Mark Saltzman)
As the result, many chemists, biochemists, pharmacists, bioengineers, and chemical engineers work to improve the administration of the drugs instead of find the stronger medicine.  There are three categories of drug administration, topical, parenteral, and enteral.

Drug Administration Routes refers to the various ways of inserting a drug or other chemical inside a patient or animal in order for the chemical to be absorbed into the blood and delivered to the target tissue.
There are several known ways to administer drug into an organism, but the easiest and the most commonly used method is through injection. 

==Topical Administration==
For topical drug administration, drugs are applied directly to the affected area. The effect reminds in the local area. The advantage of topical administration is that drugs can be given to the patient. No trained personnel are required for application. Usually, there is no pain involved in administration. Side effects are very minimal. 

==Epicutaneous==
Drugs are applied directly onto the skin surface. This administration can be used to test if a patient is allergic to certain drugs or substance. Epicutaneous administration can also be used for local anesthesia to relieve minor pain for cuts or burns.

===Eye Drops===
Drugs are applied directly into the affected eye. Eye drops are saline-containing liquid. Examples of eye drops are rinse eye drops, Glaucoma eye drops, steroid and antibiotic eye drops.

===Inhalational===
Drugs are inhaled through the mouth by the patient. Inhalational administration drugs can be used to treat asthma or acute infection in upper airway. The advantage of inhalational administration is that the response of body is much faster than oral administration because the drug does not have to go through the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Also, because the drug does not have to go though liver, so the damage to liver is minimized. 

===Intranasal Route===
Intranasal route administration is also known as nasal spray. Examples of nasal spray are decongestant nasal spray or allergy relive.

==Parenteral Drug Delivery==
Parenteral drug delivery has systematic effect on the body, meaning that the drugs do not stay specifically at one area, but body as a whole. In parenteral drug delivery, substance is given by routes other than the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, including intravenous injection, subcutaneous injection, intraarterial injection, etc.

===Intravenous Injection===
The substance is injected into the vein. The substance can be drugs. The first intravenous injection every given to a patient was in 1667. The advantages of intravenous injection are that the response is very rapid, the dosage of the drug can be easily controlled, and veins are insensitive to irritation by irritant drugs at higher concentration. However, there are many disadvantages of intravenous injection. First of all, it is not always easy to find a suitable veins. Veins disappear when a patient is under high pressure or tension. Second of all, intravenous injection can be toxic due to its fast response from the body. Third of all, a trained personnel is required, and the drug cannot be given to the patients. Last of all, it is rather expensive to prepare sterilizing the needles.

===Intramuscular Injection===
The substance is injected into the muscle. The substance can be vaccines or antibiotics. The advantages of intramuscular injection are that large volume of drugs can be applied and a sustainable release of drugs is possible. Muscles can act as an adsorption compartment. When the concentration of drug inside of the body is low, the muscle can slowly release the drugs into the body. However, there are also many disadvantages of intramuscular injection. Trained personnel are required for intramuscular injection; the drug cannot be given to the patients. Absorption is sometimes erratic, especially for poorly soluble drugs. The solvent of the drug may be released faster than the drug, causing the drug to precipitate at the site of injection and therefore immobilizes the drug.

===Subcutaneous Injection===
Subcutaneous injection is injection under the skin. Insulin is a good example for subcutaneous injection. The advantages of subcutaneous injection are that the drugs can be given to the patient because no trained personnel are needed, and the adsorption, even though slow, but is usually complete. The adsorption can be improved by applying massage or heat on the injected site. However, subcutaneous injections are very painful, irritating drugs can cause damage in the skin, and only a small dosage of drug can be applied. 

Below is a picture illustrating the difference between different kinds of injections.


===Intraarterial Injection===
Intraarterial injection is injection into the artery. 

===Intradermal Injection===
Intradermal injection is injection into the skin itself. Examples are skin testing for some allergen or tattoo.

===Transdermal===
Transdermal patch utilizes diffusion through the skin to sustain drug released. Examples are transdermal patch. Picture below demonstrates the difference between traditional intramuscular injection and a transdermal patch. As can be seen from the illustration, intramuscular injection can be much more painful than transdermal patch.

[[File:Transdermal microneedles.png|thumb|Illustration of skin penetration of a traditional intramuscular injection and a novel transdermal patch. The needles of transdermal patch are much smaller and shorter than that of intramuscular needle.]]

==Enteral==

===Oral===
		Many drugs can be made into tablets or capsules. The advantages of oral administration is that it is portable, convenient, easy to take, and not painful. It is cheap because the tablets do not need to be sterilized and can be produced in large quantities. However, oral administration can be sometimes inefficient because high dosage or low soluble drugs suffer low bioavailability. The drug will also be metabolized in the liver during adsorption, which is known as the first-pass effect. Also, the food the patient consumes may also alter the effect of the drugs. The drug can also be damaging to the normal gut flora in the GI tract. Last of all, oral drugs cannot be given to unconscious patient. 
===Rectal===
		Various drugs are produced in suppository or enema form.
===Gastric feeding tube===
		Many drugs or nutrition can be given to unconscious patients through gastric feeding tube.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In this tutorial we'll create a &quot;number-guessing game&quot;.

It goes as follows: somebody thinks a random number and you try to guess it in as few attempts as possible.

Each time you make a guess, you are given you one of the following answers:

# &quot;My number is bigger&quot;
# &quot;My number is smaller&quot;
# &quot;You guessed right!&quot;

When you finally guess the number, the game ends.

We'll start with a version without UI, and then make it more interactive.

== A first Implementation ==

In our case it is the computer the one &quot;thinking&quot; the random number. But how do we generate random numbers in Smalltalk to begin with? 

By reading the help of class &lt;code&gt;Random&lt;/code&gt;, we come across this two handy usage forms:

&lt;source lang=&quot;smalltalk&quot;&gt;
(6 to: 12) atRandom.
10 atRandom.
&lt;/source&gt;

You can try that out in a Workspace.

Let's begin by creating a class &lt;code&gt;NumberGuessingGame&lt;/code&gt;. It should have the instance variable &lt;code&gt;number&lt;/code&gt;, which will hold the random number the player will try to guess.

Here is the class template:

&lt;source lang=&quot;smalltalk&quot;&gt;
Object subclass: #NumberGuessingGame
  instanceVariableNames: 'number'
  classVariableNames: ''
  poolDictionaries: ''
  category: 'Smalltalk-Fun'
&lt;/source&gt;

We'll implement the initialization method as follows:

&lt;source lang=&quot;smalltalk&quot;&gt;
initialize
  number := (1 to: 100) atRandom.
&lt;/source&gt;

For now we'll be interacting with the game directly through the Workspace. 
Go to a Workspace and create an instance of our game:

&lt;source lang=&quot;smalltalk&quot;&gt;
game := NumberGuessingGame new.
&lt;/source&gt;

But we can't play yet! We would like to make guesses and receive an answer. It should work like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;smalltalk&quot;&gt;
game responseForGuess: 34.  &quot;My number is bigger&quot;
game responseForGuess: 70.  &quot;My number is smaller&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

An simple implementation of this method could look like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;smalltalk&quot;&gt;
responseForGuess: guess
  (number &gt; guess) ifTrue: [^ 'My number is bigger'].
  (number &lt; guess) ifTrue: [^ 'My number is smaller'].
  ^ 'You guessed right!'
&lt;/source&gt;

And now the game can begin.

Try it out in the Workspace, by entering guesses and &quot;print-it&quot; to see the answer.

== Better Interaction ==

Although it is possible to play by printing message-sends in the Workspace, it's not as inviting as it could be. Let's make this a more &quot;interactive&quot; experience.

For basic using interaction, like showing alerts or asking for information, there is the class &lt;code&gt;UIManager&lt;/code&gt;. There is a &quot;default&quot; (singleton) instance of this class already present in the system and ready to use.

First, we'll have the game ask us a number. The way to ask for input is by using the method &lt;code&gt;request:&lt;/code&gt;. It shows a dialog box where the user can enter some text. The call returns that text as a string. Try this in a Workspace, and make sure you &quot;print&quot; the resulting value:

&lt;source lang=&quot;smalltalk&quot;&gt;
UIManager default request: 'What is your name?'.   &quot;James Bond&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

The dialog looks like this:

[[File:Smalltalk UIManager requesting name.png|thumbnail|none|Dialog-box requesting name]]

Second, we'll have the game tell us in a dialog box what the response is. This time the method is &lt;code&gt;inform:&lt;/code&gt;. Expanding on the example above, select and evaluate these statements:

&lt;source lang=&quot;smalltalk&quot;&gt;
| name |
name := UIManager default request: 'What is your name?'.
UIManager default inform: 'Hello, ', name.
&lt;/source&gt;

It should look like this:

[[File:Smalltalk UIManager showing name.png|thumbnail|none|Dialog-box showing message]]

Armed with this knowledge we can implement our corresponding methods. One to ask for a number guess, and the other to show a response to the player:

&lt;source lang=&quot;smalltalk&quot;&gt;
askForGuess
  ^ (UIManager default request: 'What is your guess?') asNumber.

showResponseToGuess: guess
  | response |
  response := self resposeForGuess: guess.
  UIManager default inform: response.
&lt;/source&gt;

Remember how the return value of &lt;code&gt;request:&lt;/code&gt; is of kind &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt;? This is why we are converting it to a number with &lt;code&gt;asNumber&lt;/code&gt;.

It seems that we are ready to use these two methods together. Let's do just that in a new method:

&lt;source lang=&quot;smalltalk&quot;&gt;
play
  | guess |
  guess := self askForGuess.
  self showResponseToGuess: guess.
&lt;/source&gt;

Go ahead and try it out in the Workspace:

&lt;source lang=&quot;smalltalk&quot;&gt;
game play.
&lt;/source&gt;

This is how the guess-input should look like:

[[File:Numberguess-ask-guess.png|thumb|none|Asking for a guess]]

This is how a response should look like:

[[File:Numberguess-number-bigger.png|thumb|none|Showing a response]]

== The game-loop ==

As you might have noticed, our game is short-lived. It only asks and responds once. Then it stops.

We need to do this repeatedly until the number is correctly guessed. The way to repeat a block of statements in Smalltalk is precisely by using the class &lt;code&gt;Block&lt;/code&gt;. Take a look at this class, especially in the category &quot;controlling&quot;.

We'll be using the method &lt;code&gt;doWhileFalse:&lt;/code&gt; in order to keep asking until the guess equals the random number. We use &lt;code&gt;doWhileFalse:&lt;/code&gt; and not &lt;code&gt;whileFalse:&lt;/code&gt; because we want our block to be evaluated at least once, so that &quot;guess&quot; has at least one initial value.

The new version of &lt;code&gt;play&lt;/code&gt; looks like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;smalltalk&quot;&gt;
play
  | guess |
  [ guess := self askForGuess.
  self showResponseToGuess: guess ] doWhileFalse: [ guess = number ].
&lt;/source&gt;

Try it out:

&lt;source lang=&quot;smalltalk&quot;&gt;
game play.
&lt;/source&gt;

Now the game-loop is in place. The only problem is that the game keeps &quot;remembering&quot; the initial random number. Even after you won.

One solution of course is to &quot;re-initialize&quot; the game on the Workspace, like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;smalltalk&quot;&gt;
game initialize.
&lt;/source&gt;

It would be much nicer if this as part of our game-loop... but where exacly? Let's look at our alternatives:

* Before the game begins? It doesn't seem right, since we already chose a random number when the game was initialized.
* After the game finishes? It doesn't seem right either, since you could want to ask for the random number after you won.

This seems like a dilemma. If we just could know if a game was won or not... then we could re-initialize the game at the beginning, only if it was previously won. 

We'll just add that information to our game.

=== Adding game status ===

In order to store the game status we will introduce a new instance variable. 
Modify the class to look like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;smalltalk&quot;&gt;
Object subclass: #NumberGuessingGame
  instanceVariableNames: 'number finished'
  classVariableNames: ''
  poolDictionaries: ''
  category: 'Smalltalk-Fun'
&lt;/source&gt;

The variable &lt;code&gt;finished&lt;/code&gt; will be initially &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;, and become &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; when the game was won.

Accordingly, change the initialization method like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;smalltalk&quot;&gt;
initialize
  number := (1 to: 100) atRandom.
  finished := false.
&lt;/source&gt;

Now we are ready to make the necessary changes to the &quot;game-loop&quot;.

Our first change will be:

&lt;source lang=&quot;smalltalk&quot;&gt;
play
  | guess |
  finished ifTrue: [self initialize].
  [ guess := self askForGuess.
  self showResponseToGuess: guess ] doWhileFalse: [ guess = number ].
&lt;/source&gt;

This makes sure that if we re-start the game, it will pick re-initialize itself if the game was finished. And remember that in the initialization we set &lt;code&gt;finished&lt;/code&gt; back to &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;.

However, something is missing: we never set &quot;finished&quot; to &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; after the game is won! 
Let's do just that:

&lt;source lang=&quot;smalltalk&quot;&gt;
play
  | guess |
  finished ifTrue: [self initialize].
  [ guess := self askForGuess.
  self showResponseToGuess: guess ] doWhileFalse: [ guess = number ].
  finished := true.
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Refactoring the game-loop ===

The &quot;play&quot; method now does what we want. But the intention is somehow lost in too many low-level details. This goes against the &quot;Smalltalk way&quot; of doing things, and could use some refactoring. 

==== Separation of concepts ====

We'll try to separate concepts to different, intention revealing, methods. But before we do, allow me modify the assignment of &lt;code&gt;finished&lt;/code&gt; so that it's confined to the repeating block. You'll see why later:

&lt;source lang=&quot;smalltalk&quot;&gt;
play
  | guess |
  finished ifTrue: [self initialize].
  [ guess := self askForGuess.
  self showResponseToGuess: guess.
  finished := (guess = number) ] doWhileFalse: [ finished ]
&lt;/source&gt;

A first consequence of this change is that we can switch to the more intuitive &lt;code&gt;whileFalse:&lt;/code&gt; (at least if you have experience in other programming languages). Since we don't have &quot;guess&quot; in the condition anymore, we can re-structure our look like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;smalltalk&quot;&gt;
play
  | guess |
  finished ifTrue: [self initialize].
  [ finished ] whileFalse: [ 
    guess := self askForGuess.
    self showResponseToGuess: guess.
    finished := (guess = number) ]
&lt;/source&gt;

Now, let's try to find out what our method is doing. We could come up with:

# It makes sure the game is properly re-initialized, if needed
# It performs the steps of a game interation
# It repeats the steps in a loop until the game is won

We'll refactor the re-initialization and the game-iteration to these methods:

&lt;source lang=&quot;smalltalk&quot;&gt;
reinitializeIfNeeded
  finished ifTrue: [ self initialize ]

doOneIteration
  | guess |
  guess := self askForGuess.
  self showResponseToGuess: guess.
  finished := (guess = number).
&lt;/source&gt;

The refactored version of &lt;code&gt;play&lt;/code&gt; now looks like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;smalltalk&quot;&gt;
play
  self reinitializeIfNeeded.
  [ finished ] whileFalse: [ self doOneIteration ]
&lt;/source&gt;

==== Different levels of abstraction ====

Something just does not feel right about the presence of &lt;code&gt;finished&lt;/code&gt; in both &lt;code&gt;doOneIteration&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;play&lt;/code&gt;. And that is that we are mixing abstraction levels: we have nice intention-revealing methods for the user interaction, the game-iteration and re-initialization, yet we still deal with the &lt;code&gt;finished&lt;/code&gt; variable directly. This is not elegant and something we could also improve.

For that, let's create these methods:

&lt;source lang=&quot;smalltalk&quot;&gt;
isFinished
  ^ finished 

beFinished
  finished := true.
&lt;/source&gt;

And modify the calling sites accordingly:

&lt;source lang=&quot;smalltalk&quot;&gt;
doOneIteration
  | guess |
  guess := self askForGuess.
  self showResponseToGuess: guess.
  (guess = number) ifTrue: [self beFinished ]

play
  self reinitializeIfNeeded.
  [ self isFinished ] whileFalse: [ self doOneIteration  ]
&lt;/source&gt;

Before you go any further and try to play, make sure you re-initialize the game instance in the Workspace one last time:

&lt;source lang=&quot;smalltalk&quot;&gt;
game initialize.
&lt;/source&gt;

Otherwise you'll get an error when you try to &quot;play&quot;. This is because we introduced a new variable (&lt;code&gt;finished&lt;/code&gt;) that remained un-initialized (with &lt;code&gt;nil&lt;/code&gt;) in our existing instance. Alternatively, you can create a new instance altogether:

&lt;source lang=&quot;smalltalk&quot;&gt;
game := NumberGuessingGame new.
&lt;/source&gt;

Now we are ready to play again, as many times as we want.

== Number of tries ==

The goal of this game is not only to guess a number, but to do so in &quot;as few attempts as possible&quot;.

In order to make the game more challenging we could tell the user how many times he/she tried at the end. Let's introduce a new instance variable for this purpose:

&lt;source lang=&quot;smalltalk&quot;&gt;
Object subclass: #NumberGuessingGame
  instanceVariableNames: 'number finished tries'
  classVariableNames: ''
  poolDictionaries: ''
  category: 'Smalltalk-Fun'
&lt;/source&gt;

Don't forget to initialize it:

&lt;source lang=&quot;smalltalk&quot;&gt;
initialize
  number := (1 to: 100) atRandom.
  finished := false.
  tries := 0.
&lt;/source&gt;

Each time the player makes a guess, this counter should go up by one. We stick to our hesitation to manipulate instance variables without revealing our intention, so we create this method:

&lt;source lang=&quot;smalltalk&quot;&gt;
increaseTries
  tries := tries + 1
&lt;/source&gt;

And call it thus:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;smalltalk&quot;&gt;
doOneIteration
  | guess |
  guess := self askForGuess.
  self showResponseToGuess: guess.
  self increaseTries.
  (guess = number) ifTrue: [self beFinished ]
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The message at the end also needs to be changed. It should mention the number of tries. 

One way to accomplish this is by concatenating two strings:

&lt;source lang=&quot;smalltalk&quot;&gt;
'Number of tries: ', tries asString.
&lt;/source&gt;

Another by using the &lt;code&gt;format:&lt;/code&gt; method of &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt;:

&lt;source lang=&quot;smalltalk&quot;&gt;
'Number of tries: {1}' format: {tries}.
&lt;/source&gt;

And yet another, by using streams:

&lt;source lang=&quot;smalltalk&quot;&gt;
'' writeStream
  nextPutAll: 'Number of tries: ';
  nextPutAll: tries;
  contents.
&lt;/source&gt;

To better illustrate, we'll combine the last two. This is how it looks like:

&lt;source lang=&quot;smalltalk&quot;&gt;
resposeForGuess: numberGuess
  number &gt; numberGuess
    ifTrue: [ ^ 'My number is bigger' ].
  number &lt; numberGuess
    ifTrue: [ ^ 'My number is smaller' ].
  ^ '' writeStream
      nextPutAll: 'You guessed right!';
      cr;
      nextPutAll: ('Number of tries: {1}' format: {tries});
      contents
&lt;/source&gt;

It it very correct and object oriented, but looks pretty much complicated for just concatenating two strings and a number. 

Of course that part could also be written like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;smalltalk&quot;&gt;
  ^ 'You guessed right!
Number of tries: {1}' format: {tries}.
&lt;/source&gt;

It is up to you.

However, if when choosing this variant you have to be careful that the sentence &quot;Number of...&quot; really is at the beginning of the next line. This is because within string-literals Smalltalk will honor all newlines, tabs, etc. In our case we have an explicit newline character.

Now play again, and see how many tries you need in average to beat the computer.

=== Steroid and Thyroid hormones ===
[[File:Steroid and Thyroid hormones.jpg|thumb|Steroid and Thyroid hormones]]

Both of them are hormones which are lipid soluble. These hormones can pass across the cell membrane and enter into cytosol or even the nucleus. Cholesterol is the single precursor molecule for Steroid hormones. The estrogens (female sex hormones) and androgens (male sex hormones) are two classes of steroid hormones. Estrogen can diffuse across the membrane of a target cell and interact with a specific receptor with the cytoplasm. After forming of steroid-receptor complex, it can pass through nucleus membrane and enter into the nucleus. In the nucleus, it changes the transcription of mRNA for certain protein.

Thyroid hormones can regulate growth. Also it can play a role in stimulating the breakdown of proteins, fats, and glucose. Thyroid hormone secreted from the thyroid gland. They similarly diffuse across the plasma membrane and get into the nucleus. The thyroid-receptor complex influences certain transcription essential for some metabolic processes.&lt;ref&gt;Berg, Jeremy M., Tymoczko, John L., and Stryer, Lubert. Biochemistry. 6th ed. New York, N.Y.: W.H. Freeman and Company, 2007: 211.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Differences Between Androgen and Estrogen ===

Firstly, a hormone is produced chemically through the endocrine gland and possesses a specific effect on the activities of various organs in the body. Specific activities with which hormones help are growth and development, sexual function, reproduction, mood, and metabolism. The major endocrine glands through which hormones are produced are the pituitary, pineal, thymus, pancreas, thymoid, and adrenal glands. The primary male and female hormones are called the androgen and the estrogen. Males can produce these hormones in the testes, while women produce them in the ovaries. Although males and females possess both of these types of hormones, they possess them in significantly different amounts. For instance, the majority of males produce an immense amount testosterone, a form of an androgen, whereas women barely produce any amount. This relationship is the same with a male possessing levels of estrogen. Males still do produce this hormone, but in extremely small amounts daily.


Androgen: They are a group of hormones that play a role in male characteristic traits and reproductive activity. It is also considered a steroid, such as testosterone, that regulates the development of masculine characteristics. The male characteristics that androgens help develop include secondary sex characteristics that boys develop when going through puberty. Also, androgens influence sperm-cell formation and sexual interest and behavior. 
Androgens may be called &quot;male hormones.&quot; Both men's and women's bodies produce androgens, just in differing amounts. In fact, androgens have more than 200 actions in women.
The principal androgens are testosterone and androstenedione. They present in much higher levels in men. Other androgens include dihydrotestosterone (DHT), dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and DHEA sulfate (DHEA-S).
In a woman's body, one of the main purposes of androgens is to be converted into the female hormones called estrogens.
In women, androgens are produced in the ovaries, adrenal glands and fat cells. In fact, women may produce too much or too little of these hormones-disorders of androgen excess and deficiency are among the more common hormonal disorders in women.
In women, androgens play a key role in the hormonal cascade that kick-starts puberty, stimulating hair growth in the pubic and underarm areas. Additionally, these hormones are believed to regulate the function of many organs, including the reproductive tract, bone, kidneys, liver and muscle. In adult women, androgens are necessary for estrogen synthesis and have been shown to play a key role in the prevention of bone loss, as well as sexual desire and satisfaction. They also regulate body function before, during and after menopause.

About Androgen-Related Disorders:
a) High Androgen Levels
Excess amounts of androgens can pose a problem, resulting in such &quot;virilizing effects&quot; as acne, hirsutism (excess hair growth in &quot;inappropriate&quot; places, like the chin or upper lip) and thinning hair.
Many women with high levels of a form of testosterone called &quot;free&quot; testosterone have polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), characterized by irregular or absent menstrual periods, infertility, blood sugar disorders, and, in some cases, symptoms like acne and excess hair growth. Left untreated, high levels of androgens, regardless of whether a woman has PCOS or not, are associated with serious health consequences, such as insulin resistance and diabetes, high cholesterol, high blood pressure and heart disease.
In addition to PCOS, other causes of high androgen levels (called hyperandrogenism) include congenital adrenal hyperplasia (a genetic disorder affecting the adrenal glands that afflicts about one in 14,000 women) and other adrenal abnormalities, and ovarian or adrenal tumors. Medications such as anabolic steroids can also cause hyperandrogenic symptoms.

b) About Low Androgen Levels:
Low androgen levels can be a problem as well, producing effects such as low libido (interest or desire in sex), fatigue, decreased sense of well-being and increased susceptibility to bone disease. Because symptoms like flagging desire and general malaise have a variety of causes, androgen deficiency, like hyperandrogenism, often goes undiagnosed.
Low androgen levels may affect women at any age but most commonly occur during the transition to menopause, or &quot;perimenopause,&quot; a term used to describe the time before menopause (usually two to eight years). Androgen levels begin dropping in a woman's age of 20, and by the time she reaches menopause, they have declined 50 percent or more from their peak as androgen production declines in the adrenal glands and the midcycle ovarian boost evaporates.
Further declines in the decade following menopause indicate ever-decreasing ovarian function. For many women, the effects of this further decline include hot flashes and accelerated bone loss. These effects may not become apparent until the women are in their late 50s or early 60s.

About Treatment for Low Androgen Levels:
Combination estrogen/testosterone medications are available for women in both oral and injected formulations. Small studies find they are effective in boosting libido, energy and well-being in women with androgen deficiencies, as well as providing added protection against bone loss. However, the risks from the combination of estrogen and testosterone include increased risk of breast and endometrial cancer, adverse effects on blood cholesterol and liver toxicity.
Testosterone is also an effective treatment for AIDS-related wasting and is undergoing studies for treating premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and autoimmune diseases. Women with PMS may have below-normal levels of testosterone throughout the menstrual cycle.

Estrogen: They are the sex hormones produced primarily by a female's ovaries that stimulate the growth of a girl's sex organs, as well as her breasts and pubic hair, known as secondary sex characteristics. Estrogens also regulate the female menstrual cycle.&lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot;&gt;[http://www.gender.org.uk/about/06encrn/62_hormn.htm] Androgen and Estrogen.&lt;/ref&gt;

Estrogen is the general name for a group of hormone compounds. It is the main sex hormone in women and is essential to the menstrual cycle. Although both men and women have this hormone, it is found in higher amounts in women, especially those capable of reproducing. Secondary sex characteristics, which are defining differences between men and women that don't relate to the reproductive system, are determined in part by estrogen. In women, these characteristics include breasts, a widened pelvis, and increased amounts of body fat in the buttock, thigh, and hip region. This hormone also contributes to the fact that women have less facial hair and smoother skin then men.
It is also an essential part of a woman's reproductive process. Estrogen regulates the mentrual cycle and prepares the uterus for pregnancy by enriching and thickening the endometrium. Two hormones, the luteinzing hormone (LH) and the follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), help to control how the body produces estrogen in women who ovulate. Estrogen is manufactured mostly in the ovaries, by developing egg follices. Moreover, it produced by the corpus luteum in the ovaries, as well as by the placenta. The liver, breasts and adrenal glands may also contribute to its production, although in smaller quantities. 
There are three distinct compounds that make up this hormone group: estrone, estradio and estriol. During a woman's reproductive life, which starts with the onset of menstruation and continues until menopause, the main type of estrogen produced is estradiol. Enzymatic actions produce estradiol from androgens. Testosterone contributes to the production of estradio, while the estrone is made from andostenedione. 

Estrogen is important to a woman's health beyond just how it relates to her reproductive cycle. Although it can cause women to retain fluid, and early exposure through early menses can increase a woman's risk of developing breast cancer, this hormone has significant benefits.

'''&lt;big&gt;Androgens as related to women&lt;/big&gt;'''

In women, androgens are produced in the adrenal glands, ovaries, and fat cells. Disorders involving excess or inadequate levels of androgens in women constitute many of their common hormonal disorders. For women, the key roles of androgens are to aid in the starting of puberty and to regulate the function of certain organs. For adult women, androgens are needed for estrogen synthesis and are involved in the prevention of bone loss, and in sexual desire and satisfaction

==The Three Chemical Classes of Hormones==
There are three general classes of hormones characterized by their structure, and not their function. The three categories are:

1. Steroids
Steroids are lipids which are formed from cholesterol. Examples include testosterone and cortisol. These hormones are given off by gonads, adrenal cortex, and the placenta. Steroids are natural substances with many different effects in the human body, which begin over several days. The primary use of steroids in health care is to reduce inflammation and other disease symptoms. Steroid inhalers have an important role in reducing deaths from asthma, local steroid injections are useful in treating painful joints and ligaments. Steroid creams are used extensively to treat eczema and other inflammatory skin conditions. Steroids make the whole immune system less active, which can be very useful in illnesses where there is an immune component. Steroids are the ultimate anti-inflammatory drugs.
However, steroid use in medicine is limited by very serious side effects in the body as a whole. That is why steroids tend to be used sparingly in local preparations such as sprays and creams, which ensure maximum steroid dose where it is needed, and minimum levels in the blood stream.
Steroids also affect the brain, and high doses can make people feel happy, euphoric, hyped-up, with disturbance of sleep and even serious psychiatric illness such as mania, very aggressive behavior and psychosis (delusions, pananoia, loss of touch with reality). If steroid users are also taking other drugs which affect mood or brain function, these side-effects can be far more common.
Steroids are really useful in the care of those with advanced cancer when short life expectancy from their condition means physicians are far more relaxed about long term side-effects.
Brain tumours often respond dramatically to steroids. The reason is that the brain is contained in a bony box inside the skull and pressure can build up inside the head, resulting in headaches, sickness, drowsiness and other problems. Brain scans often show that a tunour the size of a wallnut can be surrounded by a big immune reaction, with brain swelling and inflammation. Steroids reduce the additional swelling, often reversing symptoms and buying time. The underlying cancer continues to grow if the person finally begins to deteriorate death often follows rapidly as the steroid dose is reduced.
So steroids are really powerful, with wide ranges of actions, producing dramatic effects ranging from pain relief to mood elevation, and if it were not for the very serious side effects, they would be used even more often.
The body becomes dependent on steroids and when used in health care, most physicians reduce dosage gradually, even though they may start in an acute illness with a very high dose.


2. Peptides

Peptides are the most common type of hormones and contain a chain of amino acids. Examples include TRH and vasopressin. These hormones are given off by the heart, liver, stomach, kidney, pituitary gland, and parathyroid. Peptides play a crucial role in fundamental physiological and biochemical functions of life. For decades now, peptide research is a continuously growing field of science.
When the number of amino acids is less than about 50, these molecules are named peptides while larger sequences are referred to as proteins. 
The amino acids are coupled by a peptide bond, a special linkage in which the nitrogen atom of one amino acid binds to the carboxyl carbon atom of another.
Peptides (proteins) are present in every living cell and possess a variety of biochemical activities. They appear as enzymes, hormones, antibiotics, receptors, etc.
Synthetic peptides may be useful in structure-function studies of polypeptides, as peptid hormones and hormone analogues, in the preparation of cross-reacting antibodies, and in the design of novel enzymes.
Peptides are synthesized by coupling the carboxyl group or C-terminus of one amino acid to the amino group or N-terminus of another. There are two strategies for peptide synthesis: liquid-phase peptide synthesis and solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS).


3. Amines
Amine-derived hormones are derived from the amino acids tyrosine and tryptophan. Examples include catecholamines and thyroxine. These hormones are given off by the thyroid and adrenal medulla.
In amines, the hydrogen atoms in the ammonia have been replaced one at a time by hydrocarbon groups.
Amines fall into different classes depending on how many of the hydrogen atoms are replaced.
In primary amines, only one of the hydrogen atoms in the ammonia molecule has been replaced. That means that the formula of the primary amine will be RNH2 where &quot;R&quot; is an alkyl group.
In a secondary amine, two of the hydrogens in an ammonia molecule have been replaced by hydrocarbon groups. 
In a tertiary amine, all of the hydrogens in an ammonia molecule have been replaced by hydrocarbon groups.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Summary of the Digestive System ===

The digestive system deals primarily with the breakdown of food polymers into smaller molecules to provide energy for the body. 

 
'''1.)''' The entire digestive process can be simplified through the individual processes of ingestion, digestion, absorption, and elimination. Through analysis of each of these processes, an effective comprehension of the organs that make up the digestive system can be observed. During the process of ingestion, an organism utilizes mechanical digestion by chewing the particular food of interest. In this situation, the mouth, also known as the oral cavity, acts as the source of increasing the food’s surface area by creating it into a bolus, a smaller and more circular version of the food that will subsequently be swallowed down the esophagus. Besides these organs, there are also accessory glands that contribute to ingestion as well such as the tongue and the teeth. Through observing the digestion portion of the digestive system, enzymatic hydrolysis can be witnessed in which the esophagus transfers food down from the oral cavity and towards the stomach in which hydrochloric acid and pepsin allow the chemical breakdown of the food. Next, in the absorption portion of the digestive system, nutrient molecules enter body cells within the small intestine. Lastly, the elimination process of the digestive system is closely connected with the excretory system in which the undigested material of an organism becomes eliminated from the body.

'''2.)''' With the general idea and characteristics about the digestive system recently observed, the structure and function of the digestive system of three different types of organisms can be examined: a human, an invertebrate, and a non-mammal vertebrate.

*Firstly, in the human digestive system, there is an alimentary canal, also known as a complete digestive tract, which represents a digestive tube extending between two openings, a mouth and an anus. The mouth acts as the initiating factor of the digestive tract and digestion initiates with the very first bite of any particular food type in which subsequent chewing breaks the food into pieces that are more easily digested. Simultaneously, saliva mixes with food to begin the process of breakdown into a form that the body can more readily absorb. Generally, humans are considered to be omnivorous, consuming both meat and plant-like objects. 

*Secondly, the digestive system of the invertebrate octopus will be observed. An octopus also possesses a two way digestive system consisting of a mouth and an anus. In contrast the typically omnivorous human diet, the octopus is a carnivorous creature with a diet generally consisting of lobster, crab, and shrimp. Utilizing their incredibly strong beaks to kill and consume their prey, the food will be digested in the stomach and digestive sac and then released from the anus. 

*Thirdly, as for a non-mammal vertebrate, a turtle’s digestive system can be observed. The digestive system of turtles is similar to that of other vertebrates. Unlike amphibians, they do not have mucous glands, but do have salivary glands. Turtles swallow their food whole or in large chunks and as this occurs, the salivary glands empty into the mouth and moisten the food to aid in swallowing. Although omnivorous in general, most turtles are at least partly carnivorous which cause them to possess strong digestive enzymes. The turtle's tongue is broad and flat while being firmly attached to the bottom of the mouth, preventing the tongue from moving. Alligator snapping turtles have small worm-like appendages on their tongues. These appendages can be filled with blood and are allowed to wiggle. With the turtle's mouth open and appendage wiggling, the alligator snapper can attract small fish to catch more effectively. The walls of the turtle's digestive tract are made of smooth muscle tissue and the muscles contract, pushing food down the esophagus and intestines towards the stomach.&lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot;&gt;[http://health.nih.gov/category/DigestiveSystem], Digestive System &amp; Personal BILD2 Essay.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;references/&gt;

==In-depth Steps in the Digestive System==
'''Ingestion'''
The act of ingestion begins the process of the whole digestive system. Ingestion begins when an organism puts a consumable in their mouth, and mechanical digestion begins in the form of chewing and breaking down the food. Performing mechanical digestion allows for the consumed food to increase in surface area, which allows for easier digestion and absorption of nutrients. During this time, the food turns into a bolus to allow for easier swallowing. Also during mechanical digestion, saliva is secreted in order to protect the lining of the mouth from the mechanical digestion. Saliva contains several enzymes, including amylase which protects the lining of the mouth, as well as mucin, which aids in swallowing. After mechanical digestion by chewing, and chemical digestion with saliva, the bolus of food is pushed into the esophagus, and moves down the throat by peristalsis.

'''Digestion''' 
There are two important forms of digestion where molecules are broken into smaller pieces for absorption, known as mechanical and chemical digestion. Mechanical digestion occurs first in the oral cavity and begins with the chewing of food. Polysaccharides and sugars are only broken down in the oral cavity. Chemical digestion then follows as the salivary glands produce saliva and brings it through ducts to the oral cavity where it helps the breakdown of food. There is an enzyme in saliva called amylase that hydrolyzes polysaccharides and disaccharides into simple sugars in a process known as enzymatic hydrolysis. The tongue helps shape the food into a bolus and aid with swallowing. Once swallowing has occurred, the bolus of food reaches the pharynx, a region in that throat that opens to up to either the trachea (which leads to the lungs) or the esophagus (which leads to the stomach). During swallowing, there is a cartilage flap called the epiglottis that covers the glottis, an entryway that leads to the trachea so that food will not go down the wrong way and end up blocking the windpipe. Because this entryway is blocked, the larynx is able to guide the bolus of food to the esophagus entryway. There is an esophageal sphincter that regulates the movement of material in and out of the esophagus. This sphincter contracts when person is not swallowing and contrastingly, it relaxes when swallowing occurs so that the bolus of food can travel down the esophagus to the stomach. Chemical digestion is also prevalent in the stomach. The bolus of food is further broken down by the stomach’s gastric juices, which is composed of HCl and pepsin. The strongly acidic HCl helps to break down the extracellular matrix in the bolus of food, while the pepsin, being a protease, aids in breaking down peptide bonds and digesting proteins in the food. As the bolus is mixed with the gastric juices, the stomach constantly churns until the bolus turns into chime. Various other organs assist in the digestion of food, with the liver aiding in lipid breakdown, and the pancreas secreting bicarbonate to neutralize the HCl in gastric juice.

&lt;u&gt;''Chemical Digestion in the Stomach''&lt;/u&gt; The stomach utilizes strong chemicals and enzymes that would normally destroy organic matter easily. The stomach is able to protect itself from its own gastric juices by carefully synthesizing the chemicals together to efficiently digest the bolus of food and turn it into chyme. The entire inside of the stomach is lined with a layer of mucus, as well as other layers of epithelial cells that are replaced every few days. The stomach utilizes hydrochloric acid as a means to destroy harmful bacteria as well as to denature the proteins in the bolus. Because hydrochloric acid can cause high damage to the stomach, the H+ ions and Cl- ions are kept separate until it is needed for digestion. Separate parietal cells in the stomach keep the ions separate, until they use ATP to drive the H+ and Cl- ions out, where they react in the stomach lumen to form the HCl. HCl is also able to activate pepsinogen into pepsin, a useful enzyme that specializes in protein cleaving and digestion. Stomachs that do not have the proper defensive ways to utilize the HCl and pepsin within the gastric juice often get damaged stomachs, leading to gastric ulcers.

'''Absorption'''
	Absorption of nutrients begins in the small intestine. The small intestine has massive surface area lined with villi and microvilli, which help aid in absorbing the nutrients from the chyme. Afterwards, the chyme goes through the large intestine, which is divided into three parts: the colon, cecum, and appendix. The cecum aids in fermenting the ingested food, and the colon reabsorbs water and other nutrients that the body might’ve used during the digestive process. As the ingested material passes through the intestines by peristalsis, usable nutrients are absorbed, while waste is left behind in the form of feces.

'''Excretion'''
	The final stage in the digestive system is excretion, in which the ingested food is now formed as a (usually) solid waste known as feces. The feces is excreted out of the body via the anus, ending the digestive process for the particular ingested food.

==Gastric Juice Production==
There are gastric glands located on the interior surface of the stomach. The gastric glands have three different types of cells that are responsible for secreting the parts that make up the gastric juice such as mucus, pepsin and hydrochloric acid. The parietal cells in the gastric gland secrete hydrochloric acid (HCl). The chief cells secrete an inactivate form of pepsinogen that is not activated to pepsin until it comes into contact with hydrochloric acid in the lumen of the stomach. Lastly are the mucus cells that secrete mucus, a substance that protects the lining of the stomach. Gastric juice does not destroy stomach cells that make it because all these ingredients remain inactive until they are released into the lumen. Pepsinogen and HCl are first secreted into the lumen of the stomach. Hydrochloric acid converts the pepsinogen (inactive form) into pepsin. And pepsin, the activated form begins a chain reaction, activating more pepsinogen. Gastric juice begins the process of chemical digestion of proteins in the stomach.

==Digestion in the Small Intestine==
The small intestine is the longest compartment of the alimentary canal and is the major organ of digestion and absorption. This is the site where the rest of the digestion and enzymatic hydrolysis processes takes place, followed by absorption. First portion of the small intestine is the duodenum, where acid chyme combines with the gastric juices of the pancreas, liver, gall bladder.

==Hormonal Control of Digestion==
*When food arrives at the stomach, it causes the walls to stretch and this stimulates the release of the gastrin hormone from the stomach. Gastrin will travel through the bloodstream and come back to target the stomach, causing the stomach to release gastric juices.
*Once chyme passes from stomach to duodenum, it triggers the release of hormones, secretin and cystokinin (CKK) because of the fatty acids and amino acids present in the chyme. The secretin works positively on the pancreas to stimulate the release of bicarbonate, which will help break down fats into fatty acids and neutralize acid chyme. Meanwhile CCK stimulates the gallbladder to release bile, which is a detergent that breaks down fats into smaller fats. CCK also stimulates the pancreas to release more digestive enzymes that can hydrolyze fats. 
*The secretin hormone and CKK both have inhibitory responses and act negatively on the stomach to slow down digestion and the production of chyme. 

==Absorption in the Small Intestine==
The jejunum and ileum are parts of the small intestine that are strictly responsible for absorption. The large surface area of the small intestine is due to the villi and microvilli that are exposed to the intestinal lumen. This large microvillar surface increases the rate at which nutrients are absorbed. The villi and small epithelial cells make up and line the border of the small intestine. Nutrients can be transported across the epithelial cell through passive or active transport. Sugar moves through passive diffusion down the concentration gradient into the epithelial cell, it then gets collected in small blood capillaries and travels through the circulatory system. Meanwhile amino acids, peptides, vitamins and glucose are pumped actively against the concentration gradient by the epithelial cells and then circulated throughout the bloodstream by capillaries. Fats, on the other hand, need to be reassembled in the lymphatic system and transported differently. 

'''Absorption of Fats''' 
In the lumen, the fat molecules, called triglycerides undergo enzymatic hydrolysis during which the enzyme, lipase breaks down the fat molecules into fatty acids and monoglycerides. The smaller molecules made up of fatty acids and monoglycerides diffuse into the epithelial cell. In the epithelial cell, the small molecules revert back to being triglycerides which are mixed with cholesterol and coated with protein to form chylomicrons. These molecules leave the epithelial cells and are transported into the lacteals.

==Absorption in the Large Intestine==
While the primary function of the small intestine is to absorb nutrients and water, the large intestine functions to absorb mainly water. The colon is a part of the large intestine that connects to the small intestine and leads to the rectum and anus. The colon functions to recover the water that enters the alimentary canal. The cecum connects where the small and large intestine meet and helps in the fermentation of plant material. In humans, the cecum also has an extension known as the appendix. The appendix does not play a large part in immunity. Feces are any wastes from the digestive tract. As they move through the colon, they become more solid and ultimately pass through the rectum and leave out through the anus. 

==Appetite Regulating Hormones==
There are hormones secreted by tissues and organs in the body that then are transported through the bloodstream to the satiety center, a region in the brain that triggers impulses that give us feelings of hunger or aid in suppressing our appetite. Ghrelin is a hormone that is released by the stomach and targets the pituitary, signaling to the body that it needs to eat. PYY is a hormone that is released by the small intestine and counters ghrelin. It is released by the hypothalamus and signals that you have just eaten and helps to suppress our appetite. The pancreas releases the hormone insulin, which targets the hypothalamus  and also aids in suppressing our appetite after we have just eaten and there is a rise in blood glucose levels. The last hormone is leptin which also helps to suppress appetite. Leptin is produced by adipose fat tissue and targets the hypothalamus. 

==Mucin's Role in Gastrointestinal Tract Diseases==

The intestinal barrier is composed of a mucin (glycoproteins) layer and tight junctions between epithelial cells as well as by regular epithelial cell replacement which protects the intestine from mechanical stress produced by the passage of digested food through the gastro intestinal (GI) tract, molecular breakdown from digestive enzymes, and foreign invaders such as bacteria and viruses. While providing protection, the mucin layer must allow the passage of digested molecules through to be absorbed by epithelial cells. Unraveling the depth of protection by the mucin layer to all damaging vectors can develop a comprehensive understanding of mucin’s potential role in many intestinal diseases&lt;ref name=&quot;four&quot;/&gt;.
[[File:Mucin (glycoproteins) In GI Tract.JPG|thumb|Mucin (glycoproteins) In GI Tract]]

Up to 20 mucin genes have been identified and are broadly classified as either secretory or membrane-associated large glycoproteins&lt;ref name=&quot;four&quot;/&gt;. Recent studies have shown that the mucin layers in the GI tract vary in mucin protein composition, mucin layers, and mucin thickness&lt;ref name=&quot;one&quot;/&gt;. The mucin layer has been shown to prevent digestive enzymes from entering the wall of the intestines&lt;ref name=&quot;three&quot;/&gt;. The mucin layer can be compromised if there is a structural abnormality or production of the glycoprotein is altered. This results in poor protection of the intestinal wall and can lead to systemic damage to the body.


For example, shock is a physiological process that still kills many individuals through multiple organ failure. Recent studies have shed light on the role the intestine plays in this process. The intestinal mucosal barrier becomes compromised during shock and no longer performs as a barrier&lt;ref name=&quot;five&quot;/&gt;. When this occurs, the luminal contents of the intestine, including cytotoxic free fatty acids (FFAs), may enter the wall of the intestine causing damage both to it and other organs&lt;ref name=&quot;three&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;four&quot;/&gt;.

A complete comprehension of mucin’s role as a protective agent can lead to a greater understanding of many GI diseases and complications and the role mucin has in each. Diseases such as necrotizing enterocolitis, Crohn’s Disease, and Irritable Bowel Syndrome could be treated more efficiently since mucin plays a role in each. Shock victims would also benefit since many of the complications arise from the breakdown of the intestinal barrier&lt;ref name=&quot;two&quot;/&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Crohn's Disease ===

Another disease that involves the digestive system, Crohn’s disease, causes inflammation within the digestive tract. The end part of the small intestine called the ileum is the most commonly affected towards the Crohn’s disease. Normally, the movement of muscles in the GI tract and the release of hormones and enzymes allows for the digestion of food. However, in Crohn’s disease, inflammation occurs in the inner lining of the affected part of the GI tract and the subsequent effect of inflammation and swelling can cause pain and can cause emptiness within the intestines, resulting in diarrhea. A long lasting type of inflammation may produce scar tissue that builds up inside the intestine to create a stricture, a narrowed passageway that can decrease the movement of food through the intestine, causing pain or cramps. Crohn’s disease is considered an inflammatory bowel disease, the general name for diseases that cause inflammation and irritation in the intestines. Crohn’s disease can be difficult to diagnose because its symptoms are similar to other intestinal disorders, such as ulcerative colitis. For example, ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease both share the characteristics of abdominal pain and diarrhea.&lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot;&gt;[http://digestive.niddk.nih.gov/ddiseases/pubs/crohns/index.aspx], Crohn's Disease.&lt;/ref&gt;

Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory process primarily involving the intestinal tract. Although it may involve any part of the digestive tract from the mouth to the anus, it most commonly affects the last part of the small intestine (ileum) and/or the large intestine (colon and rectum). Crohn's disease is a chronic condition and may recur at various times over a lifetime. Some people have long periods of remission, sometimes for years, when they are free of symptoms. There is no way to predict when a remission may occur or when symptoms will return.

==Symptoms==
Because Crohn's disease can affect any part of the intestine, symptoms may vary greatly from patient to patient. Common symptoms include cramping, abdominal pain, diarrhea, fever, weight loss, and bloating. Not all patients experience all of these symptoms, and some may experience none of them. Other symptoms may include anal pain or drainage, skin lesions, rectal abscess, fissure, and joint pain (arthritis).

Common Crohn's symptoms: 
•Cramping - abdominal pain
•Diarrhea
•Fever
•Weight loss
•Bloating
•Anal pain or drainage
•Skin lesions
•Rectal abscess
•Fissure
•Joint pain

Who does Crohn's disease affect?
Any age group may be affected, but the majority of patients are young adults between 16 and 40 years old. Crohn's disease occurs most commonly in people living in northern climates. It affects men and women equally and appears to be common in some families. About 20 percent of people with Crohn's disease have a relative, most often a brother or sister, and sometimes a parent or child, with some form of inflammatory bowel disease. Crohn's disease and a similar condition called ulcerative colitis are often grouped together as inflammatory bowel disease. The two diseases afflict an estimated two million individuals in the U.S.

==Causes==
The exact cause is not known. However, current theories center on an immunologic (the body's defense system) and/or bacterial cause. Crohn's disease is not contagious, but it does have a slight genetic (inherited) tendency. An x-ray study of the small intestine may be used to diagnose Crohn's disease.

==Treatment==
Initial treatment is almost always with medication. There is no &quot;cure&quot; for Crohn's disease, but medical therapy with one or more drugs provides a means to treat early Crohn's disease and relieve its symptoms. The most common drugs prescribed are corticosteroids, such as prednisone and methylprednisolone, and various anti-inflammatory agents.
Other drugs occasionally used include 6-mercaptopurine and azathioprine, which are immunosuppressive. Metronidazole, an antibiotic with immune system effects, is frequently helpful in patients with anal disease.
In more advanced or complicated cases of Crohn's disease, surgery may be recommended. Emergency surgery is sometimes necessary when complications, such as a perforation of the intestine, obstruction (blockage) of the bowel, or significant bleeding occur with Crohn's disease. Other less urgent indications for surgery may include abscess formation, fistulas (abnormal communications from the intestine), severe anal disease or persistence of the disease despite appropriate drug treatment.

While it is true that medical treatment is preferred as the initial form of therapy, it is important to realize that surgery is eventually required in up to three-fourths of all patients with Crohn's. Many patients have suffered unnecessarily due to a mistaken belief that surgery for Crohn's disease is dangerous or that it inevitably leads to complications.
Surgery is not &quot;curative,&quot; although many patients never require additional operations. A conservative approach is frequently taken, with a limited resection of intestine (removal of the diseased portion of the bowel) being the most common procedure.
Surgery often provides effective long-term relief of symptoms and frequently limits or eliminates the need for ongoing use of prescribed medications. Surgical therapy is best conducted by a physician skilled and experienced in the management of Crohn's disease.

What is a colon and rectal surgeon?
Colon and rectal surgeons are experts in the surgical and non-surgical treatment of diseases of the colon, rectum and anus. They have completed advanced surgical training in the treatment of these diseases as well as full general surgical training. Board-certified colon and rectal surgeons complete residencies in general surgery and colon and rectal surgery, and pass intensive examinations conducted by the American Board of Surgery and the American Board of Colon and Rectal Surgery. They are well-versed in the treatment of both benign and malignant diseases of the colon, rectum and anus and are able to perform routine screening examinations and surgically treat conditions if indicated to do so.

==Genetic study==

Scientists have recently conducted new research into the genetics of inflammaroy bowel disease such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. These research studies have recently reveals new insights into the origin of this set of illnesses.

Researchers have presented information of linked genetic variations in 163 regions of the human genome that are at heightened risk of developing inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Of those discovered regions, 71 are newly discovered. IBD includes various automimmune digestive disorders that affect nearly 2.5 million people worldwide. Symptoms include abdominal pain and diarrhea. Patients with IBD typically have to undergo lifelong treatment with medications and other forms of drug therapy.

In recent studies, researchers analyzed data from about 34,000 people who took part in 15 previous studies of either Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. They also examined more than 41,000 DNA samples data from genome-wide scans of patients of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. These samples were collected around the world from 11 different centers.

Since 163 regions were found to develop IBD, 71 were newly found and the other 92 regions were confirmed. Both groups were confirmed to be prone to inflammatory bowel disease. The way these regions were analyzed was done by overlapping those linked with other autoimmune diseases, suggesting IBD results from overactive immune defense systems that can evolve into serious bacterial infections.

Sceintists have stated, &quot;Until this point we have been studying the two main forms of IBD -- Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis -- separately,&quot; co-lead author Judy Cho, professor of gastroenterology and genetics at Yale School of Medicine, said in a Yale news release. &quot;We created this study based on what seems to be a vast amount of genetic overlap between the two disorders.&quot; The new studies reveal &quot;a genetic balancing act between [the immune system] defending against bacterial infection and attacking the body's own cells,&quot; co-lead author Jeffrey Barrett of the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute in Cambridge, England, said in the news release. &quot;Many of the regions we found are involved in sending out signals and responses to defend against bad bacteria. If these responses are over-activated, we found it can contribute to the inflammation that leads to IBD.&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Lactose Intolerance ===

Just as any other organ system, the digestive system remains susceptible to diseases such as Lactose Intolerance. Individuals who are diagnosed with Lactose Intolerance experience the inability to effectively digest lactose, a carbohydrate often found in dairy products such as milk, cheese, ice cream, and cream cheese. The inability to digest lactose is due to the lack of an enzyme called lactase in which its production is found in cells within the small intestine. For a normal individual without Lactose Intolerance, the enzyme lactase would break down the carbohydrate lactose.  If someone diagnosed with Lactose Intolerance were to have any dairy product such as the ones stated above in their system, various problematic digestive system symptoms may soon result such as abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea, flatulence, and nausea.  However, there are actually some individuals with Lactose Intolerance who can consume an adequate amount of dairy products without experiencing harsh symptoms. Generally, the effects of these symptoms possess mild to severe extremities solely based on the amount of lactose digested as well as the individual’s particular lactose tolerance.

Lactose intolerance may be diagnosed by two common tests: Hydrogen Breath Test and Stool Acidity Test. In Hydrogen Breath test, the patient drinks a large dose of milk and their breath is analyzed regularly to check the amount of hydrogen. Usually, people have very little hydrogen in their breath. However, those with lactose intolerance will have high levels of hydrogen due to the undigested lactose. The accuracy of this test may be affected by smoking. The second method of detecting lactose intolerance, Stool Acidity Test, is primarily used for infants and young children. If lactic acid and glucose are present, it may be determined that the child has lactose intolerance. 

Many people are concerned about their calcium intake if they are lactose intolerant. Some foods with high calcium contents are rhubarb, sardines, spinach, salmon, and soy milk.&lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot;&gt;[http://digestive.niddk.nih.gov/ddiseases/pubs/lactoseintolerance], &quot;National Digestive Diseases Information Clearinghouse (NDDIC).&quot; Lactose Intolerance.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Intro ==
Contraception, or birth control, is a form of family planning. This method prevents unwanted pregnancies and sometimes also prevents sexually transmitted diseases. Some forms of birth control are meant for only males, and others are meant for women. 

Other family planning techniques include abstinence, surgical sterilization, natural family planning, and withdrawal.

== Barrier Methods ==

Barrier methods of contraception are used as a physical or chemical forms of blockading sperm from having access within the uterus to prevent any fertilization of an egg, and thus, a pregnancy. They have no considerable side effects, except for any allergies to the materials within the devices, and can be used right before sexual intercourse. 

'''Male Condoms''': This is the most common form of contraception within the modern world. A male condom is used by a male by rolling the thin tube onto an erect penis before any type of intercourse. It became a very popular contraceptive method in the 20th century and is the most effective form of birth control that prevents most sexually transmitted diseases if only used once. The earliest type of male condom were made from animal products, and are considered high-end on the American markets today. The most common type of condoms sold and purchased today is the latex rubber condom and is available in lubricated or non-lubricated varieties.

'''Female Condoms''': These type of condoms look very similar to the male condoms, but are actually inserted into the female instead of on the male. It is a single-use, pre-lubricated, polyurethane sheath that is also used before sexual intercourse. It has two rings--one that is inserted to the upper vagina and the other stays on the outside of the vagina and covers the vulva and surrounding area of the vagina. It is not as widely used due to the costliness of the materials. 

'''Spermicides''': Spermicides are chemicals that are used to kill sperm, and, therefore, not allowing them to enter the vagina and causing a pregnancy. In some cases, they can even kill some sexually transmitted diseases. They are available in the form of gels, jellies, foams, pessaries, and water-soluble films. Usually used in conjunction with other types of barriers, spermicides are safe in low amounts, as high dosages could damage the vaginal lining, sensitize the penis, and even help increase the chances of being infected with HIV. 

'''The Sponge''': Sponges can come in varying kinds and sizes. It is usually made of disposable and soft polyurethane and paired with a spermicide. It is a choice of contraception for women because it is very convenient--women just need to wet the sponge in water, insert into the vagina, and it would be effective for the next 24 hours, despite the number of sexual acts. Despite its convenience, it is still not as effective as other contraceptive techniques. 


'''Cervical Cap''': The rubber, metal, or latex cervical cap is a small, cup-like instrument that is placed on the cervix within the vagina. Spermicide can be placed within the dome to ensure that sperm is blocked physically as well as chemically. Some types of cervical caps must use suction with the vaginal walls in order to be in place during sexual intercourse. Since every cervix is different, every woman must be fitted by a medical professional properly. Few women actually use this method of barrier contraception because there are not many professionals that are trained in the fitting of the cervical cap. In the U.S., the FDA approved three types of the cervical cap--small, medium, and large. The small cervical cap is designed for women who have never gotten pregnant, the medium is for women who have had a miscarriage, abortion, or had birth by Caesarian section, and the large cap is for women who have had a live and natural birth.

'''Diaphragms''': Like the cervical cap, the diaphragm is also a contraceptive barrier that is used at the cervix. This dome-shaped device can be made from latex or silicone and is expanded over a ring. There is a spring on the rim of the ring that also creates suction onto the vagina. Just like the cervical cap, the diaphragm is also needed to be fitted depending on the size of the cervix. The drawback to this method is that the diaphragm must be placed three hours before sexual intercourse.


== Hormonal Methods ==

Hormonal methods of contraception are used to impede fertilization and ovulation of an egg through the manipulation of ovarian hormones, such as progesterone and estrogen. These methods include oral contraceptives, intrauterine devices, injectables, implants, birth control patch, and vaginal contraceptive ring. Although these forms of contraceptives do help prevent unwanted pregnancies, they do not prevent sexually transmitted diseases.

==== Oral Contraceptives: ==== 

'''Combined Oral Contraceptives:''' These contraceptives are available in the form of pills, which must be taken once everyday. The pill impedes the follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) in the pituitary, which doesn't allow for the maturation of follicles in the ovaries. By the human body's feedback loop, the luteinizing hormone (LH) increases, which then prevents ovulation of eggs within the ovary. In addition to the decrease of ovulation, the increase of progesterone in the pill increases the cervical mucus, which creates a harsh environment for sperm. The two types of birth control pills include the combination progesterone and estrogen pill and the progesterone-only pill. Usually, women must orally take 20, 21, or 22 active pills, which contain a measured amount of combined progesterone and estrogen, and then followed by inactive sugar pills. During the time that the woman is taking the inactive pills, less menstrual bleeding would take place than if the woman was not on the pill. These pills imitate a normal, yet regulated, menstrual system. Examples of combined oral contraceptives include Yaz, Yazmin, Ortho Tri-Cyclen, Desogen.      

'''Continuous-Use Oral Contraceptives:''' These pills also must be used everyday orally and contain a combination of progesterone and estrogen. The purpose of these pills is to decrease the number of menstrual periods and the duration of the periods within the year. With continuous-use oral contraceptives, women must take active pills for 12 weeks straight and then take 7 inactive pills. A drawback to this method is that women will experience breakthrough bleeding and spotting. An example of this type of contraceptive include Seasonique.    

'''Progesterone-Only Pills''': These pills only contain progesterone in order to increase the thickness of cervical mucus and decrease the infiltration of sperm. This method also utilizes once-a-day pills, just like combined oral contraceptives and continuous-use oral contraceptives. Many providers choose to prescribe this contraceptive to women who have experienced adverse side effects with the estrogen in the combined pills. Progesterone-only pills are not as effective as the combination pills. 

'''Emergency (Postcoital) Contraception''': This method of contraception is used orally and only once immediately after (approximately 24-36 hours) the woman has experienced unprotected sexual intercourse that may lead to an unwanted pregnancy. Yet, it may still be effective up to five days after  unprotected sexual intercourse. This &quot;Morning After Pill&quot; only contains a dosage of 750 mg of levonorgestrel in each pill. It is meant to be a single use, and not continuously.

==== Intrauterine Devices: ==== 

Intrauterine devices, or IUDs, are plastic devices placed within the cervix that could contain copper and/or release levonorgestrel and are used to inhibit sperm from reaching an implanted egg. Earlier versions of the IUDs had a copper-based branch to stabilize it within the vagina. With the more modern plastic variation, it was observed that as the size of the device increased, the menstruation became heavier, and women were more prone to vaginal infections if they ever had sexual contact with anyone with STDs. With this type of contraceptive, there are many risks that appear to outweigh the advantages. 

==== Injectables: ====

Injectables are a long-lasting and more efficient versions of the oral contraceptives. Injectables are available to women as 3-monthly intramuscular injection with a high dosage of medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA), or known as Depo-Provera, and as a 2-monthly intramuscular injection with a dosage of norethindrone enanthate, or NET-OEN. The only negative aspect with using injectables as a form of contraceptive is how to maintain a regular dose for a long period of time. 

It is projected that the use of injectables will be more common in the future as compared to other methods of contraception. The progestin-only injectables are most likely going to be the most commonly used and offered, such as the 3-monthly DMPA and the 2-monthly NET-EN. In terms of the combined injectable, a monthly dose would be available. A 3-monthly injectable made with levonorgestrel butanoate is being improved, which works similarly to DMPA. With a 3-monthly dose, such as DMPA, the greatest advantage is that there is a low amount of synthesized chemicals circulated within the body, as well as faster and easier for women to stop taking the contraception in order to become fertile again. Also, less hormonal chemicals would result in less ovarian limitation and less risk of amenorrhea, or the lack or miss of one or more menstrual periods. 

Depo-Provera is a type of long-acting hormonal method by injection that is very successful in its purpose of contraception, but is difficult to remove from the body and takes a longer time for the individual to become pregnant again. Norethindrone enanthate, a reduced progestogen version of Depo-Provera, provides a slight relief from the adverse side effects of Depo-Provera, but the woman would need to be injected every 2 months instead. 

Side Effects of injectables as a form of long-acting contraception include large fibroids, amenorrhea, hypertension, diabetes, delayed return of ovulation, etc. In some cases, the continued use of injectables is associated with osteoporosis. These injectable preparations last so long that if the patient were to want to cease this form of contraception, it may take weeks to months in order for fertility to return once again.   A main side effect of Depo-Provera is bone density loss over time.  It is suggested for the patient to intake calcium supplements in order to counteract this side effect.  Depo-Provera is not suggested to use for more than two years.

=== Subcutaneous Implants ===

These implants provide a consistent and long-lasting method of contraception. Implants must be surgically placed subcutaneously and also removed from the same area. In terms of its structure, implants usually have a steroid placed inside of a capsule or rod. Because this form provides a steady dose of progestogens, implants usually contains a smaller amount of hormones than injectables and oral contraceptives. Surgical insertion and removal usually requires a professional and removal takes a longer time than insertion.

This piece reminds me a bit of any of my very good bu not quite there students.  OK for day to day professional work, e.g. in a bank, but not good enough for the United Nations, Mombusho or the State Department.
 
I'm not that great on biochemistry, but I lived with it for many years: my first wife, the excellent Susie Schmidt, was one of Jim Watson's editors from about 1972 onwards.  Still, I'd be happy to give this a copy edit if the author would drop me a line.  david.lloydjones@gmail.com.

[[File:LSD-clinical-trial-bottle.jpg|thumbnail|right|Sample of Drug Candidate for a Clinical Trial]]
In the United States, the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) requires that potential drugs be demonstrated to be effective and safe before they may be used in human beings on a large scale. This requirement is particularly true for drug candidates that are to be taken by people who are relatively healthy. The trials test the effectiveness and potential side effects of a candidate drug before it is approved by the FDA for general use. 

=== Phases ===

Clincial trials proceed in at least three phases. 

&lt;u&gt;Phase 1:&lt;/u&gt; In phase 1, a small number (10-100) of healthy volunteers take the drug for an initial study of safety. These volunteers are given a range of doses and are monitored for signs of toxicity. 

&lt;u&gt;Phase 2:&lt;/u&gt; In phase 2, the efficacy of the drug candidate is tested in a small number of persons who might potentially benefit from the drug. Further data regarding the drug's safety are obtained. Such trials are often controlled and double-blinded. 

&lt;u&gt;Phase 3:&lt;/u&gt; In phase 3, similar studies are performed on a larger population (thousands). This phase firmly establishes the efficacy of the drug candidate and to detect side effects that may eventually develop in a small percentage of the subjects who receive treatment. 

Only after the conclusion of all three phases can a drug be approved for clinical use by the public. 

===Reasons===

Clinical studies are designed to add medical knowledge related to treatment, diagnosis, and prevention of diseases or conditions. Some common reasons for conducting clinical studies include:

* Evaluating one or more interventions for treating a disease, syndrome, or condition
* Finding ways to prevent the initial development/recurrence of a disease or condition
* Examining methods for identifying a condition or risk factors for that condition
* Exploring ways to improve the comfort and quality of life of people with a chronic illness through supportive care

=== Methods ===

Clinical Trials are usually led by a principal investigator, who is often a medical doctor. Clinical studies have a research team that may include doctors, nurses, social workers, and other health care professionals. Clinical studies can take place in many locations, including hospitals, universities, doctors' offices, and community clinics. The location depends on who is conducting the study. 

Controlled studies involve a group of individuals given a placebo and a second group that is given the actual drug. These studies also tend to be double-blinded, so that neither the subjects nor the researchers know which subjects are in the treatment group and which are in the control group. This approach prevents bias in the course of the trial. After the completion of the trial, the assignments of the subjects are unsealed and the results for the two groups are compared. A variety of doses are often investigated in phase 2 trials to determine which doses appear to be free of serious side effects and which does appear to be effective.

=== Cost/Time ===

Clinical trials tend to be extremely expensive. Costs can run from tens of millions to hundreds of millions of dollars. Extensive records and documentations are filed and subsequently compiled for submission to the FDA. The full cost of developing a drug is currently estimated to be from $400 - $800 million dollars. 

According to one study, it takes an estimated 15 years for a drug to go from lab to patient.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Definition==
Inhalation is a drug administration route in which a drug or inhalant is smoked. Inhalation is effectively used medically for several anesthetics. The onset of this drug administration route is quite rapid due to the fact that there are capillaries located in the lungs, making it easy for the drug to quickly enter the bloodstream. Once the drug is in the bloodstream, it takes approximately five to eight seconds for the drug to reach the brain.

==Problems with Inhalation==
Although inhalation is an effective method of drug administrations, there are three factors that must be kept into consideration with medically using this drug administration method.

1. Drugs and materials must not be irritating to the mucous membranes and lungs.&lt;/br&gt;
2. Controlling the dosage may be more difficult than other drug administration methods.&lt;/br&gt;
3. The drug must be administered until the desired effect is met. &lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
Benadryl, also known as Diphenhydramine, is an antihistamine drug. It is usually found as a crystalline, white powder and is soluble in water and alcohol. Diphenhydramine is typically used for treating allergic reactions. 

In the body, histamine is released when one suffers through an allergic reaction or even viral infections. The histamine then binds to cell receptors, triggering changes in the cell that lead to allergy symptoms such as itching and sneezing.

As an antihistamine drug, diphenhydramine competes against the histamine for the cell receptors. The antihistamine not only prevents histamines from binding and stimulating the cells but while doing so, it also binds to the receptors—they do not stimulate the cells, therefore allergy symptoms will not show.

==History== 
Benadryl was discovered by George Rieveschl, who took part in many experiments with focus on relieving muscle pain at University of Cincinnati. Benadryl is an antihistamine drug that used for treating people who suffer with allergy.  Benadryl was first available through prescription in 1946. Later in 1980s, it was approved as over-the-counter drug.

==Content==
Benadryl contains the histamine-blocker diphenhydramine.  This drug will help patients to recover from common symptoms: sneezing, watery eyes, runny nose, and sore throat. One application of Benadryl is Benadryl Chesty Cough &amp; Nasal Congestion: a drugs that is used to relieve the symptoms of chesty cough and cold.

==Side Effects==
Do not use this drugs if you are currently treating with depression, heart condition, blood pressure, and behavioral disorder.
As many other drugs, Benadryl does have some common side effects:
* sleepiness
* dizziness
* headache
* dry mouth
* difficulty urinating.

==Chemistry==
Diphenhydramine is synthesized as shown below. The molecular formula of Diphenhydramine is C&lt;small&gt;17&lt;/small&gt;H&lt;small&gt;21&lt;/small&gt;NO • HCl.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Definition=
An intravenous (IV) injection is a drug delivery method which the drug is directly injected into the bloodstream. With this method, the onset of the action is much rapid since the drug is being administered directly into the bloodstream. Delivering a drug intravenously can be beneficial when using irritating material since blood vessel walls are highly insensitive to irritants. High concentrations and dosages of drugs can be delivered intravenously much quicker than other methods, which can be beneficial, yet dangerous at the same time.

==Disadvantages with using Intravenous Injections==
Although intravenous injections can be quick, there are some disadvantages with using this method. A major disadvantage of using IV injections is that repeated injections at the same site results in the area surrounding vein injection site losing its strength and elasticity. In worst case scenarios, if a particular injection site has been punctured into several times, the wall of the vein collapses and blood will no longer move through it. Another concern of using IV injections is the transmission of infections. Contaminated needles and syringes should not be used more than once; nor should they be shared between patients.&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
The term epicutaneous refers to the route of topical drug administration by which the drug, poison, fluid, or other substance is taken into the body via direct skin application. The three major routes of administration include: topical, in which the effect is local; enteral, in which the effect is non-local; and parenteral, in which the effect is systemic. Epicutaneous medications range from lotions, creams and ointments to powders, patches, and tinctures. Other topical medications may be inhaled or applied to surfaces of tissues other than skin. Topical medications taken in excess can result in adverse skin reactions such as itching, inflammation and redness; however, if consumed properly can yield the desired outcome.

==Permeation Through Skin==
The skin acts as a barrier separating the internal body structures from the external environment, maintaining a slightly acidic pH as to prevent against pathogens and other foreign invaders. There are several layers of skin: the outer layer called the epidermis, followed with the dermis, followed with an innermost layer of fatty tissues. The two principal routes of drug administration through the skin are:

1) Transepidermal absorption:
This process outlines diffusion of substances across the stratum corneum. Diffusion can occur via the intercellular lipoidal route or through a microscopic route designed for polar compounds and ions. Because the epidermis structure is extremely compact leaving little intercellular space, permeation calls for the crossing of cell membranes. Yet the greatest struggle lies in penetration through the dermis, where diffusion occurs through the interlocking channels of the substance.

2) Transfollicular (shunt pathway) absorption:
Sebaceous and eccrine glands operate as the skin's appendages and channels of drug absorption by acting as shunts that bypass the stratum corneum. The overall mechanism progresses through partioning and diffusion through the sebrum, the driving force being a concentration gradient. An equation has been formulated to describe this process:
R = h/FDK 

R =Resistance of diffusion resistor,
F = Fractional area,
H = Thickness,
D = Diffusivity,
K = Relative capacity,

==Epicutaneous Applications==
1) Allergy Testing:
Antigen extracts are applied to the skin as puncture skin tests. This method measures the reactivity of the skin to the injected material. This can be carried out through the scratch test, prick test, or intradermal test. 

2) Local Anesthesia:
Local anesthesia provides immediate relief to the region of application by numbing the sensation and causing a loss of nociception. These drugs can be classified either as aminoamide or aminoester and are given as an injection, spray, or ointment. These are often used for dental or dermal purposes. 

3) Transdermal Patches:
Transdermal patches overlap under the parenteral category but some can fall under the epicutaneous category as well. They serve a wide array of purposes:

*Prevention of motion sickness: Scopalamine was the first transdermal patch to be approved by the FDA, in 1979.
*Birth control
*Hormone replacement therapy: To alleviate symptoms of menopause.
*Cessation of tobacco smoking
*Allergy tests

4) Arthritis Pain:
These drugs exist mainly as creams that work to immediately and temporarily mitigate the sensations of arthritis in the hand. They come in a few forms:
*Counterirritants
*Salicylates
*Capsaicin

5) Wounds/Rashes: Skin conditions can be treated with the usage of creams, lotions, gels, ointments, or in some cases steroids.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Each molecule has a set of symmetry operations that describes the molecule's overall symmetry. This set of symmetry to classify molecules is known as point group
Group theory is a powerful mathematical tool in determining the symmetry, properties, and data of complex molecules. 
Molecules are said to belong to the same point group if they have the same symmetry response under a set of operations. That is to say, two molecules can have totally different shapes but belong to the same point group as long as the respond the same to some symmetry operations.
A molecule can only belong to one point group. It cannot belong to more than one point group. 

It is important to understand that point groups is a tool for categorizing the different symmetries a molecule might have. This tries to classify molecules based on their molecular shapes and symmetries. There are various symmetry elements used to illuminate the shape of the molecule. The shape and symmetry of a molecule is highly important especially in structural biochemistry because structure determines functions of proteins and molecules. It is also important to note that many molecules are constantly going through conformational change, therefore its point group can also change. Point group is a tool for us to understand on a molecular level, symmetry. &lt;ref name=&quot;Point groups&quot;&gt;[http://www.chem.uky.edu/research/grossman/stereo/pointgroups.HTML Point groups], November 14th, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Coxeter diagram finite rank2 correspondence.png|thumbnail]]

=Types of Point Groups=
Molecules can be separated by the symmetry elements that they contain. The different Symmetry operations can be classified into:
[[File:Ammonia-2D.svg|thumb||right|Ammonia|150x150px]]
-'''Rotation operation (C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;):'''  is rotation of 360/n degrees about a rotation axis that renders the object unchanged.. For example, ammonia (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) contains a threefold rotational axis, which gives it a C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; operation. Objects or molecules can have more than one rotational axis. An example of an object with more than one rotational axis is a snowflake or octahedron. [[File:Snowflake-black.png|thumb||right|Snowflake|150x150px]]
 
-'''Reflection operation (σ):'''  is a reflection across the mirror plane where when the object remains unchanged when reflected. There are three different σ's. The first is σ&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;where the mirror plane is parallel to the primary axis of rotation and an outer atom. A σ&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; is a mirror plane that is also parallel to the primary axis of rotation but it does not pass through an outer atom, rather it is between two outer atoms. An exception to this is in T&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; and D&lt;sub&gt;nd&lt;/sub&gt;, in which all mirror planes are referred to as σ&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;. The last mirror plane is such that is a horizontal reflection σ&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; where the plane of reflection is perpendicular to the primary axis of rotation. A primary axis of rotation is the axis with the greatest number of rotational symmetry folds. Objects and molecules can also have more than one plane of reflection.[[File:Sigma v.jpg|thumb|text-bottom|σ&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;]][[File:Sigma d.jpg|thumb|text-bottom|σ&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;]][[File:Sigma h.jpg|thumb|text-bottom|σ&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;]]

-'''Inversion operation (i):''' is a combination of a C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; rotation and a σ&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; operation to invert the molecule across a point of inversion, which is usually taken to be the center of the molecule. It is a reflection (or inversion) through the mid-point (center) of the object or molecule.

-'''Improper Rotation (S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;):''' is the rotation of 360/n, followed by reflection through a plane perpendicular to the axis of rotation, σ&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;. An S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; operation is identical to an inversion (both being a 180 degree rotation, followed by a reflection across the perpendicular horizontal axis).

-'''Identity (E):''' is merely a rotation by 360 degrees around an arbitrary axis that returns an equivalent configuration. Every molecule has at least an E operation.
==Examples==
O&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; – octahedral point group – contains all symmetry elements and operation of a perfect octahedron.
[[File:Octahedron-2-3D-balls.png|thumb||center|Figure I. Octahedron. ]]

C&lt;sub&gt;∞v&lt;/sub&gt; : An infinite number of mirror plane parallel to an infinite number of rotation axis.
[[File:Carbon-monoxide-3D-vdW.png|thumb||center| ]]
 

D&lt;sub&gt;∞v&lt;/sub&gt; : not only has an infinite number of rotation axis and mirror planes but also has a two-fold rotation perpendicular to these infinite number of rotation axis. D&lt;sub&gt;∞v&lt;/sub&gt; also has an inversion center.

C&lt;sub&gt;3v&lt;/sub&gt;
There is a 3-fold primary rotation axis and 3 mirror planes parallel to that axis.

D&lt;sub&gt;3h&lt;/sub&gt;
Designates that there are 3 two-fold rotational axes perpendicular to a three-fold primary axis and a mirror plane perpendicular to that primary axis.


==How to Work a Point Group Flow Chart==
All molecules have some type of symmetry or lack thereof, and can be grouped into categories (called point groups) where all molecules with the same symmetries have the same point group. To facilitate the determination of a molecule's point group, without having to exhaustively determine every one of its symmetry properties, a point group flow chart can be used. A molecule's point group can be easily determined by finding how many rotational and mirror planes it contains in a logical manner. The less symmetrical an object is, the more difficult symmetry operations are needed to determine its point group, where as the higher symmetries are more easily determined. This allows users to answer simple questions based on the shape of the molecule. If one is able to understand the point group flowchart, there requires no memorization. Therefore point group determination is quite simple, all it requires is knowledge of types of point group and some visualization. &lt;ref name=&quot;point group&quot;&gt;[http://symmetry.otterbein.edu/tutorial/pointgroups.html pointgroup], October 28, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many other point groups such as C&lt;sub&gt;4v&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;5v&lt;/sub&gt;, D&lt;sub&gt;4h&lt;/sub&gt;, D&lt;sub&gt;5h&lt;/sub&gt;, etc. Memorizing the definition of all the point-groups is overwhelming. To simplify this, point group of a molecule can be easily found by following a flow chart. First, start with determining if the molecule is linear or not. If it is,then determine if there is an inversion center. If the molecule is not linear, check if there are two or more C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, where n is greater than two. If yes, then determine if there is an inversion center and if there is a C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; rotation axis. If there are two or more C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'s, then check if there are C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'s at all. If so, then check if the C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; with the higher n is perpendicular to nC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;sub&gt;. &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;If so, then determine if the molecule has a σ&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; or σ&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;. If there aren't two or more C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'s, then check if there is a σ&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;, nσ&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;, or S&lt;sub&gt;2n&lt;/sub&gt;. These are the cases where there is a C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, but if there aren't any C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'s then check if there is a σ&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; of inversion center. If this is done correctly, the arrival at the end of a chain will be the point group for the observed molecule.&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

=Example of how to use the flow chart=
[[File:Water molecule like Micky mouse.png|thumb||center|Water molecule]]
Above is a figure of water molecule. Following the flow chart:
1.	The molecule is not linear
2.	The molecule does not have more than 2 axis of rotation other than the primary axis
3.	The molecule has a proper C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; primary rotation
4.	But the molecule does not have 2 other proper rotation axis perpendicular to the primary rotation axis
5.	The molecule does not have a mirror plane perpendicular to the primary axis
6.	The molecule has two mirror plane parallel to the primary axis
7.	Thus, water molecule belongs to C&lt;sub&gt;2v&lt;/sub&gt; point group

[[File:BF5.png|thumb|center||BF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; molecule]]
Above is a figure of BF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; molecule. Following the point group flow chart:
1.	The molecule is not linear
2.	The molecule does not have more than 2 rotation axis other than the primary rotational axis
3.	The molecule has a 4-fold proper rotational axis
4.	The molecule does not have 4 C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; axis that is perpendicular to the primary rotational axis
5.	The molecule does not have a mirror plane that is perpendicular to the primary rotational axis
6.	The molecule has 4 mirror planes that are perpendicular to the primary rotational axis
7.	The molecule hence belongs to C&lt;sub&gt;4v&lt;/sub&gt; point group

[[File:Cyclopropane molecular orbital.png|thumb||center|Cyclopropane]]

4.	The molecule has 4 C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; proper rotational axis that is perpendicular to the primary rotational axis
5.	The molecule does not have a mirror plane that is perpendicular to the primary rotational axis
6.	The molecule has 4 mirror planes that are parallel to the primary rotational axis
7.	The molecule hence belongs to D&lt;sub&gt;4d&lt;/sub&gt; point group



==High Symmetry Point Groups==
Molecules of high symmetry are of certain geometric shapes like Linear, Octahedral (O&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;), Tetrahedral (T&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;), and Icosahedral (Ih) shapes. Although there are some variations in these symmetries, they are often rare in nature.

-'''C&lt;sub&gt;∞v&lt;/sub&gt;''' are linear molecules with an infinite number of rotations along the primary rotation axis, and an infinite number of reflection planes containing the rotation axis. They have no center of inversion, and are usually two atom molecules.

-'''D&lt;sub&gt;∞h&lt;/sub&gt;''' are also linear molecules with an infinite number of rotations along the primary axis and an infinite number of reflection planes containing the rotation axis. The three main difference from a C&lt;sub&gt;∞v&lt;/sub&gt; are that a C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; axes and a reflection plane exist perpendicular to the primary axis of rotation, and an inversion center.

-'''T&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;''' molecules have a tetrahedral geometry (but don't always have the shape of a tetrahedral). They have 4 C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; axes, 3 C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; axes, 3 S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; axes, and 6 mirror planes. However, they lack C4 axes.

-'''O&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;''' molecules are most commonly those with octahedral structure. They typically have 4 C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; rotations, 3 C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; rotations, and an inversion center

-'''I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;''' molecules are identified by their C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; axes, along with its inversion center.

==Low Symmetry Point Groups==
C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is a molecule with no symmetry other than the identity operation, E.
C&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; is a molecule with only a mirror plane and the identity operation, E.
C&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; contains only an inversion center and the identity operation, E.

[[File:Coxeter_diagram_finite_rank2_correspondence.png|thumb|Finite isomorphism and correspondences]]
The subset of pure reflectional point groups, defined by 1 or 2 mirrors, can also be given by their [[Coxeter group]] and related polygons. These include 5 crystallographic groups. The symmetry of the reflectional groups can be doubled by an [[isomorphism]], mapping both mirrors onto each other by a bisecting mirror, doubling the symmetry order.

=== Reflective subset groups ===
[[File:Coxeter_diagram_finite_rank3_correspondence.png|thumb|Finite isomorphism and correspondences]]
The subset of pure reflectional point groups, defined by 1 to 3 mirror planes, can also be given by their [[Coxeter group]] and related polyhedra. The [3,3] group can be doubled, written as &lt;nowiki&gt;[[&lt;/nowiki&gt;3,3]], mapping the first and last mirrors onto each other, doubling the symmetry to 48, and isomorphic to the [4,3] group.

==Representations==
Irreducible representation is used to create a character table for that point group. 

-A value of 1 means that the symmetry does not change its orbital position

-A value of 0 means the operation changes orbital's position

-A value of -1 means the orbital does not change its symmetry but inverts its sign.

Reducible representation is simply a combination of irreducible representations.

==Character Table==
Character tables are designated by these characters which means different operations.

-x,y,x is the transformation of the x,y,z coordinates

-R&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, R&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;, R&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; is the rotation about the x, y, z axes

-R is any symmetry operation like C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

-X is the character of operation

-i, j is the designation of different representations such as A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; or A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

-h is the total number of symmetry operations in the group (order)

An intramuscular (IM) injection is a drug administration route in which a drug is injected into a muscle. In terms of absorption, the injection methods that delivers the drug quickest to slowest is intravenous, intramuscular then subcutaneous. It is favored due to its fast-acting as well as long-lasting capabilities. These injections are inserted into the deep muscle tissue where the deposition of medication is absorbed gradually into the bloodstream. 

==Absorption==
The three main sites of intramuscular injection is in the deltoid muscle of the arm, buttocks and the thighs. Absorption is quickest when injecting into the arm and slowest in the buttocks. 

==Advantages==
When injecting into the muscle, there is less chance of irritation due to greater blood supply and faster absorption. Also, when wanting to inject larger amounts of drugs, it is best to inject into the the muscular region instead of injecting subcutaneously.

==Procedure==
Needle should not be smaller than an inch nor exceed one and a half inches in length. The maximum volume of medication recommended should be five milliliters at one site per adult.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Definition==
Eye drop is a tropical drug administration route in which a medicated solution of saline-containing liquid is administered to the surface of the eye. Though most of the eye drop usually is lost through patient reaction or resides on the surface of the eye, some of the drug enters the bloodstream through the mucous membranes that line the cornea as well as through the conjunctival mucosa and parts of the tear drainage system. A major advantage of eye drop administration is the ease of regular application of high concentrations of medication as well as its lack of need to go through intestinal digestion. Drugs that are administered through the usage of an eye drop can either be in a fully aqueous solution or in suspension (cloudy).

Eye Drop is a drug that is given to patients after eye surgery,or when having severe dry eyes. Eye drops can help with clearing eyes to make it better for sight.

==Types of Eye Drops==
1) Rinse eye drops&lt;/big&gt;''' 

Rinse eye drops are solutions that help lubricate or replace the tears of the eyes. Rinse eye drops do not necessarily contain any medication. This is the most common form of eye drop administration. 

2) Antibiotic and steroid eye drops

Antibiotic and steroid eye drops are predominantly used for treating eye infections. They also can be used to prevent infections from occurring after eye surgeries. 

3) Glaucoma eye drops

Glaucoma eye drops assist in the draining of fluid from eyes, which in turn lowers eye pressure. Glaucoma eye drops can vary vastly and are sometimes combined with many other medications that vary on a patient’s need.

4) Antihistamine eye drops

Antihistamine eye drops contain antihistamines, which inhibit a body’s response to allergens. They work by inhibiting the release of histamines into the body. They do not necessarily target the allergens, but allow the patient to cope better with its presence. Antihistamine eye drops are used to lessen the histamine response in the eye.

5) Steroid and antibiotic eye drops

These eye drops are used to treat eye infections. It must be used for the full time prescribed to avoid relapse of the infection. The medication may sting your eyes when first used.

6) Glaucoma eye drops

These eye drops decrease eye pressure by helping the eye's fluid to drain better. They are classified by their active ingredient.

==Side Effects==
As many other drugs, eye drops are considered to have some side effects: sore throat, fever, rash, itching, dizziness, swelling.
One of the most common side effects is eye redness after using the eye drop. This will lead to pain in eyes or problem with visions that one should be cautious. But in fact, eye drops are less risky than tablet medicines and sometimes, these risks can be prevented from pressing the inner corner of the eye after using. If you do not use them the correct way then you can infect not only one eye, but both eyes.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Professor Nobuhiko Katunuma (1926-November 11, 2013) was one of the world’s leading scientists specialized in proteolysis in general and cysteine proteinases and their corresponding inhibitors in particular. As a renowned scientist, Professor Katunuma’s research interest is related to the medical and biomedical field as his great uncle, Professor Seizo Katsunuma, the President of Nagoya University, had told him ‘Biochemists working at Medical Schools should contribute in the fight against diseases in man’. His scientific contribution was rewarded with the ‘1990 National Violet Ribbon Decoration for Scientists and Artists’ award. Besides being a successful researcher, Professor Katunuma is also an inspirational colleague and dedicated mentor. His passion for science and intrigued ideas always provoke his coworkers. He usually observes his students’ experiment closely and also involves himself in these experiments to enhance his scientific sense even further. Nowadays, more than 30 researchers who had been Professor Katunuma’s mentee have become Professors or Laboratory Heads or even established their own laboratory. Outside his love for structural chemistry, Professor Katunuma is also interested in photography, music and Kendo, or Japanese sword fencing. 

==Biography==
Professor Nobuhiko Katunuma was born in 1926 in Nagasaki, Japan. He graduated from the School of Medicine at Nagoya University in 1953. After earning his Doctor of Philosophy in medical sciences, he completed his Postdoctoral with Professor Hugo Theorell at the Nobel Institute in Stockholm, Sweden. After that, he moved back to Japan and became an Associate Professor at the Institute of Protein Research, Osaka University. In 1963, he moved to the Institute of Enzyme Research, School of
Medicine at Tokushima University. With his widely successful scientific career and dedication to young researchers, Professor Katunuma was promoted to be the Director of the Institute since 1971 and also served as Dean of the Medical School at Tokushima University from 1980 to 1982. In 1992, he retired from Tokushima University and continued his research at the Institute for Health Sciences, at Tokushima Bunri University. 

==Academic Career==
During the first 30 years at Tokushima University, Professor Katunuma’s main research was about the enzymes involved in vitamin B6 metabolism and their intracellular protein turnover. Together with his colleague Mitsuko Okada, he discovered mitochondrial glutamicoxalacetic transaminase and the urea cycle glutaminase isoenzymes. Later on, with his colleague Yasuhiro Kuroda, he established the enzymes’ functions in the hepatocarcinogenesis.

In 1971, he discovered the acceleration of pyridoxal enzyme turnover in animals with vitamin B6 deficiency and the enzymes participate in proteolysis of the apoproteins. These discoveries suggested that protein degradation can be initiated by the apoprotein formation in proteolysis process. This idea provoke further research into the initiation of various biochemical pathways by limited proteolysis, such as prothrombin activation by mast cell tryptase histamine release by mast cell chymase, and initiation of influenza virus entry by tryptase Clara. In his later years at Tokushima University, he also conducted a research project specialized in the role of lysosomal enzymes and their inhibitors in intracellular proteolysis. His studies on the 3D structure of protease enzyme cathepsin B in human in collaboration with Robert Huber led to his subsequent studies on chemically designed specific-inhibitors against enzyme cathepsins. With these studies, Professor Katunuma established himself as one of the pioneers in the field of structural based drug synthesis.

In 1992, after his retirement from Tokushima University, he started his second career as Professor and Director of the Institute of Health Sciences in Tokushima Bunri University. In his new position as the President of Tokushima Bunri University, Professor Katunuma actively involved in the development of new synthetic cysteine protease inhibitors, the derivatives of E-64 and the CLIK inhibitors, and studied the role of cysteine proteases in bone resorption.

Mass Spectrometry is an important tool in proteomics that works by measuring the mass to charge ratio of ionized particles. Mass Spectrometry is a very useful method because it can accurately distinguish ions that differ by a single atomic mass unit. 

'''Contribution to proteomics'''     
Mass spectrometry in conjunction with other protein purification techniques have significantly contributed to the advancement in proteomics. Mass spectrometry was used to identify plasma membrane proteins, study plasma membrane topology, protein protein interactions and the plasma membrane signaling networks. Often times MS is coupled with other specific techniques. For example, in the study of plasma membrane topology H/D MS is used. In this technique the rate of H/D exchange is measured to gain a better understanding of the protein's structure. Because the rate of H/D exchange is affected by the environment and positioning of specific parts of the protein, basic topology of the protein can be modeled using this technique. 

'''Significance of proteomics'''  
Studying proteins and their properties allows scientists to explain how a specific cell process takes place. Once the protein's role in the process is thoroughly understood, steps in a specific cell process can be modified by changing the property of the proteins involved. This is significant because it can have huge pharmaceutical applications. For example, scientists can develop a drug that targets the active site of a specific protein that regulates cell division to combat cancer.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Linear Combination of Atomic Orbitals (LCAO) is the sum of atomic wave functions that lead to the formation of molecular orbitals. 

==Parameters==
-The symmetry of the orbitals must have the same sign overlap

-The energy of the atomic orbitals must be smaller

-The distance between the atoms must be short enough to provide good overlap of the orbitals.

[[File:Dihydrogen-MO-Diagram.svg|thumbnail]]

The Linear combination of atomic orbitals are essential for molecular orbital understanding and building the molecular orbital diagram. The Linear combination of atomic orbitals or LCAO are tools that have described groups of orbitals as linear combinations of basic functions. The LCAO helps us understand symmetry of a molecule and how the ligands surround the center. &lt;ref name=&quot;Linear combination of atomic orbitals&quot;&gt;[http://www.mpcfaculty.net/mark_bishop/molecular_orbital_theory.htm Linear combinations of atomic orbitals], November 14th, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==s Orbital Bonding==
s Orbital bonding is when their two electron clouds overlap and merge into a large molecular electron cloud. This results in a linear combination of the atomic orbitals. 
Bond order is defined by 
:&lt;math&gt;\text{B.O.} = \frac{\text{number of bonding electrons} - \text{number of antibonding electrons}}{2}\ &lt;/math&gt;
This has to be positive in order for a stable bond to be created. The overall number of bonding and antibonding electrons determine the number of bonds

Bonding molecular orbital is where both atomic wave functions contribute, which has a lower energy than the original atomic orbitals
Antibonding molecular orbital is the cancellation of waves functions, at a higher energy than the original atomic orbitals.
Nonbonding molecular orbital is when the orbital of one atom has a symmetry that does not match the orbital of any other atoms 

==p Orbital Bonding==
p Orbital bonding occurs when the two orbitals overlap, the overlapping regions have the same sign. As a result, the sum of the two orbitals has an increased electron probability in the overlap region. 
The overlap of two opposite signs leads to a node of zero electron density. As a result, the orbitals of Px, Py, and Pz are to be considered separately.

==d Orbital Bonding==
The transition medals bond in a similar way as p orbitals, but results in Dyz, Dz^2, Dyz, Dxz, Dx^2-y^2, and Dxy. 
The Dxz and Dyz orbitals form pie orbitals whereas the Dx^2-y^2, and Dxy orbitals are collinear to the z axis. 

==Paramagnetic vs. Diamagnetic==
Paramagnetic compounds are attracted by an external magnetic field due to one or more unpaired elections that are attracted to the magnetic field
Diamagnetic compounds are not attracted by an external magnetic field because all the electrons are paired.
This can have profound effects on metal compounds.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=='''Overview'''==

'''Meiosis''' is the process in which a cell reduces its cell from being a diploid, having two sets of chromosomes, to being a haploid, having one set of the twenty-three chromosomes, when creating eggs and sperm. A haploid cell will combine with another haploid cell (one from an egg and one from a sperm) to form a diploid cell. This will result in the right number of chromosomes, 46. During this process, abnormalities of the number of chromosomes usually occur in humans.

=='''The Process of Meiosis'''==
This process happens in the cell nucleus, where there is a pair of chromosomes from each parent. Chromosomes replicates when the chromosomes from both parents are copied and paired to exchange portions of their own DNA. Chromosomes, that are similar, will pair up. The paired chromosomes will swap portions of their DNA, creating a mix of new genetic material in the offspring's cell. When the nucleus divides up into daughter cells, the chromosome pairs are divided. The daughter nuclei will divide again, resulting in further division of chromosomes. The daughter nuclei will end up having single chromosomes and a new mix of genetic material. 
[[File:Meiosis Overview.svg]]

=='''The Steps of Meiosis'''==
Unlike mitosis, meiosis undergoes two replications rather than one. It is because of these two divisions that allow for the resulting daughter cells to end up with only half of the number of chromosomes, or haploid, from the total amount of chromosomes, or diploid. The steps goes as follows:

&lt;u&gt;Meiosis I&lt;/u&gt;

'''Prophase I''': just like in mitosis, during the prophase step, DNA is condensed into very thick like rodes. In additon the nuclear membrane or envelope along with the nucleoli dissappear which allows for free DNA roaming. The spindle apparatuses begin to form ready for the metaphase step. One difference between mitosis prophase and meiosis prophase I is that as the DNA condenses, the chromosomes are visible as tetrads, in other words, homologous DNA pairs, which is not seen in mitosis.

'''Metaphase I''': The tetrads of chromosomes are lined up on the equator of the cell with the spindle apparatus having already been completely formed. It is during prophase I and metaphase I where genetic recombination occurs. When the homologous pairs of DNA, or tetrads, are first lined up against each other, a event called crossing over occurs at the chaismata. Crossing over events happen between neighboring tetrads which swap genetic information with each other. More genetic variation comes from metaphase I specifically in the sense that tetrads can line up completely randomly on the equator of the cell, also known as independent assortment. It is these two events that derive most of genetic variation.

'''Anaphase I''': The tetrads of chromosomes that were previously lined up on the equator are pulled apart in this phase. They are pulled apart in such a fashion that the spindles that are attached to the centromere of all the tetrads lined up on the equator and are pulled apart  to each pole on either side of the cell, towards the centrioles. The resulting chromosomes are now two chromatids.
 
'''Telophase I''': In this phase the chromosomes with two chromatids that have moved to eeither side of the cell decondense and a nuclear envelope begins to form around the genomic material. 

&lt;u&gt;Meiosis II&lt;/u&gt;

'''Prophase II''': The chromosomes that have two chromatids from the previous meiosis I cycle recondense, with their nuclear envelope and nucleoli disappear similiar to prophase I. In addition the spindle forms in this phase. 

'''Metaphase II''': The chromosomes with the two chromatids line up at the equator similiar to how they lined up in metaphase I. Although genetic variation is seen in this phase as well as it was seen in metaphase I, the degree is very much diminished. In prophase I, crossing over occurred, however in prophase II, since homologous chromosomes are non existent in this phase, the chromatids cannot react with any neighboring pieces of DNA. The only source of variation in this phase is independent assortment of genes on the equator of the cell. The possibility of chromatids either going left or right on the cell and being chosen for fertilization is the source of variation here. 

'''Anaphase II''': The chromosomes split by the same mechanics explained in Anaphase I except only one chromatid head moves towards each pole of the cell. 

'''Telophase II''': This phase has the same exact mechanics explained in Telophase I. The only difference is that instead chromatids being de-condensed with a nuclear envelop developing around it, it is solely a chromatid head. The cell is now ready to develop into sperm or eggs at this stage.

=='''Mutations and Birth Defects'''==
According to Angelika Amon, a molecular biologist from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, the leading cause of human birth defects and miscarriages are the mistakes in dividing DNA between daughter cells during meiosis. Miscarriages occur when embryos have an incorrect number of chromosomes and do not go to full term.

The likelihood that chromosomes will not be apportioned properly increases with age in women. Studies have shown that one out of every eighteen babies born to women who are over the age of forty-five has three copies of chromosomes 13, 18, or 21 instead of the normal amount of two. This can lead to birth defects or mutations. An example is that Down Syndrome is caused by three copies of chromosome 21.

=='''Studying Meiosis'''==
Amon studies yeast cells, which separate their chromosomes almost exactly the same way cells of humans do. The exception is that yeast cells' chromosomes separate much faster. A yeast cell copies its DNA and produces daughter cells in about half an hour. Humans cells, on the other hand, takes about a whole day.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Overview==
Paclitaxel (taxol) is an important anti-cancer pharmaceutical drug.  In 1967, Monreoe E. Wall and Mansukh C. Wani extracted paclitaxel from the bark of a Pacific yew tree, Taxus brevifolia.  

Paclitaxel is used to treat AIDs-related Kaposi sarcoma, breast, ovarian, and lung cancer in UK.  This medicine binds to the tubulin and inhibits the disassembly of microtubules. This stabilizes the microtubules and prevents further cell division. 

==Side Effects==

Functional Groups: aromatic(3), amine, ketone(2), esters(4), alcohol(3), and ether(5) 
It has 11 stereocenters.
==Mechanism of Actions==
[[File:Mechanism of Taxol.png|450px|thumb|Mechanism of Paclitaxel]]

Microtubules are cellular components that act as a skeleton for the cell. For cell division to occur, microtubules need to depolymerise back to tubulin. After that, tubulins repolymerise to form the spindle of cell division. The movement of the replicated chromosomes during mitosis depends on the spindle and therefore, the depolymerization of microtubules. 

Paclitaxel or Taxol enhances the polymerization of tubulin to stable microtubules and also interacts directly with microtubules, stabilizing them against depolymerization. Hence, it interferes with the spindle formation process. Chromosomes are unable to move to the opposite sides of the dividing cells. Cells division is inhibited and eventually, cell death is induced.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==
Prozac, also known as Fluoxetine, is part of class of drugs known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs, that is used to treat depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, eating disorders, and panic attacks. The medicine works by maintaining the levels of serotonin, a neurotransmitter that controls mood and mental state, in the brain. In other cases, Prozac is used to treat alcoholism, attention-deficit disorder, borderline personality disorder, sleeping disorders, heaches, mental illnesses, post-traumatic stress disorder, Tourettes' syndrome, obesity, sexual disorders, and various irrational fears
[[File:Fluoxetine-2D-skeletal.svg|thumbnail|Prozac molecule]]
[[File:S-fluoxetine-3D-vdW.png|thumbnail|3D Representation of Prozac]]

== Side Effects ==
Some common side effects of Prozac are depression, anxiety, headaches, nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, and loss of appetite. Due to how Fluoxetine effects neurotransmitters, it can sometimes block other neurotransmitters like for acetylcholine. When Acetylcholine is blocked, nausea occurs. Another dangerous side effect is the fact that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors also inhibit nitric oxide synthesis which leads to the narrowing of blood vessels. This is dangerous because it can lead to hypertension. Also, even though Prozac is an antidepressant drug it can lead to depression due to the neurological chemical imbalance in the brain.

== Administration ==
Prozac is administered orally. A capsule is taken and slowly distributed while in the digestive system.

== Precautions ==
Prozac should never be taken more than prescribed. A major imbalance to the neurotransmitters and neurological pathways would occur and lead to many side effects.  
It should not be taken while pregnant, due to the fact of hypertension, which will lead to heart defects and lung problems in the newborn. Also, Prozac should not be taken in combination of other antidepressants because of seriously dangerous chemical reactions. Lastly, people under 24 years old may have thoughts of suicide.

== Chemistry ==
The way Prozac works is by blocking the signal on the axon that tells it when enough serotonin has been produced. Therefore, an excess amount of serotonin is delivered to the nerves. The way Fluoxetine is metabolized is by CYP2D6 in the liver. Due to its slow metabolism, it has a long half-life within the system. Because of this slow accumulation, it takes awhile before the excess serotonin starts to show significant effects. Prozac acts as an agonist for 5HT2C receptors which have been known to be responsible for the defensive and aggressive behavior. It has been seen that low 5-HT levels in the brain have traditionally been associated with depression.
==Mechanism of Actions==
[[File:Chemical synapse.jpg|250px|thumb|Chemical synapse]]

Neurotransmitters are signaling molecules that are used to transmit messages between neurons in the brain. The pathways of neurotransmitters in the synapse can be prolonged or shortened by specific chemicals called neuromodulators. Some neuromodulators can aid with the release of neurotransmitters into the synapse; others inhibit the reabsorption of neurotransmitters by neurons so that the neurotransmitters remain in the synapse. Under certain mental conditions such as bipolar disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, anxiety, and depression, the regulation of secretion and removal of neurotransmitters into the synapse is not functioning properly. In particular, in depression and similar disorders, neurotransmitter seretonin is one of the mostly affected. To treat depression, the most common form of drugs is called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI). Prozac is one of the most widely used member of this class.
[[File:Mechanism of Prozac.jpg|250px|thumb|Mechanism of Prozac]]

















Prozac works on the serotonin balance in the synapses by inhibiting a neuromdulator called SERT, which pumps serotonin back into the neurons. Thus, Prozac helps to prevent the reabsorption of serotonin and increase the amount of seretonin in the synapse. The proper amount of seratonin in the synapse is believed to help with mood elevation and depression.

== History ==
Eli Lilly discovered fluoxetine in the 1970's when working with antihistamine diphenhydramines. She wanted to synthesize many derivatives of this compound and test them on mice. Eventually, she made a derivative only inhibiting serotonin reuptake, which she called Prozac. Many controversial accounts have been made against Prozac and Lilly. Violent outbreaks, suicides, and murders were all thought to be seen as behavior invoked by the drug. However, it has been said that Prozac is not addictive or habit forming. Once Prozac's patent had expired in 2001, many generic serotonin inhibitor drugs started selling.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Definition=
Parenteral drug administration is any non-oral means of having the drugs administrated into the body. Intramuscular, subcutaneous, and intravenous are the most used forms of drug administration.

=Advantages=
Some advantages with parenteral drug administration are that it can be used for drugs that are poorly absorbed by the body or ineffective when given orally.

=Disadvantages=
This method of drug administration tends to be expensive due to the amount of equipment required, as well as a more painful experience for the patient. Thus, competent practitioners are recommended. Other risks with parenteral administration are that any errors during the technique of administering the drug may lead to physical harm to the body or adverse drug absorption in the body.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Introduction=
The oral medical administration is the process of delivering the drug through the mouth so that it enters the alimentary tract. It is known to be the most frequently used route of drug administration due to the fact that it is convenient and cost effective. Drugs that enter through this route usually comes in solid dose forms in order to promote the high degree of drug stability, but they can also come in liquid forms. Different drugs can be taken orally at different time intervals, which can vary between before or after ingesting food.

==General pathway==
Most of the absorption process is accomplished between five and thirty minutes after ingestion, but absorption is not usually complete for as long as six to eight hours. Once drugs passes through the stomach, the drug needs to proceed from the small intestine into the bloodstream. The membrane separating the intestinal wall from blood capillaries is made up of two laters of fat molecules, making it necessary for substances to be lipid soluble or soluble in fats to pass through. Even after sucessful absorption into blood capillaries, however, substances must still pass through the liver for a screening process before being released into the general circulation around the body. Enzymes in the liver are capable of breaking down the molecular strucrue of certain drugs, thus reducing the amount that eventually enters the blood stream. As a result of all these natural barriers, orally administered drugs must be ingested at dliberately elevated dose levels, to allow for the fact that some proportions of the drug will not make it through to the bloodstream.

=Disadvantages=
Administering drugs orally can potentially be problematic due to the unpredictable nature of gastrointestinal absorption. &lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; Factors such as ingested food can alter the pH within the gut, gastric motility, emptying time, and the rate of drug absorption.


=Anti-asthmatic agents and Anti-Inflammatory=

[[File:Cortisol.png|thumbnail|center|Cortisol Structure]]
Cortisol or hydrocortisone is a compound of the class called corticosteroids. This compound is the anti-flammatory agent that is used in medicine. Scientists have discovered that the inflammatory of the breathing passages can contribute to the attack of asthma. As a result, it was recommended to control the oral inflammatory together by including corticosteroids in medicine and inhaling bronchodilators to treat asthma. However, corticosteroids can have negative side effects. For instance, this compound can inhibits growth in children. Hence, scientists started to use synthetic corticosteroids to be used for inhalation. 
In addition, scientists have discovered a synthetic steroid that can be used as anti-inflammatory. Fluticasone is the compound that replace its hydrogen with flourine that would help to activate the compound's ability to be used as anti-inflammatory. This steroid would bind to the protein inside the cell nuclei called the glucocorticoid receptor in order to prevent the inflammatory response in the body.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Intranasal drug administration is an attractive option for local and systemic delivery of many drugs. The nasal mucosa is – in other words, nose – easily accessible. Intranasal drug administration is noninvasive, almost painless and the most susceptible way of administrating drugs for children. Application can be performed easily by patients or by physicians in emergency settings. Intranasal drug delivery offers a rapid onset of therapeutic effects (local or systemic). Nasal application circumvents gastrointestinal degradation and hepatic first-pass metabolism of the drug. The drug, the vehicle and the application device form an undividable triad. Its selection is there- fore essential for the successful development of effec- tive nasal products. This paper discusses the feasibility and potential of intranasal administration. However, there are still many debatable topics on the following topics: 
# the intended use (therapeutic considerations)
# the drug
# the vehicle 
# the application device

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;u&gt;'''The Oparin-Haldane Hypothesis'''&lt;/u&gt;

The Oparin-Haldane hypothesis was a hypothesis independently developed by two scientists. One scientist was a Russion chemist, Aleksandr Oparin, and the second scientist was a British scientist, John Haldane. 
Both independently suggested that if the primitive atmosphere was reducing (as opposed to oxygen-rich), and if there was an appropriate supply of energy, such as lightning or ultraviolet light, then a wide range of organic compounds might be synthesised.

Oparin came up with the hypothesis in 1924 that Earth’s atmosphere was extremely reducing in its early stages of development. This means that the atmosphere had an excess of negative charge and could cause reducing reactions by adding electrons to compounds.  Oparin suggested that these organic compounds could have undergone a series of reactions leading to more and more complex molecules. Under these circumstances, Oparin hypothesized that organic molecules could have formed from simple inorganic molecules.He proposed that the molecules formed colloid aggregates, or 'coacervates', in an aqueous environment.  These coacervates were able to absorb and assimilate organic compounds from the environment in a way reminiscent of metabolism.   They would have taken part in evolutionary processes, eventually leading to the first lifeforms. 
 
Similarly, in 1929, before Haldane read about Oparin’s theory of a reducing atmosphere, Haldane also hypothesized that the early staged of Earth’s atmosphere was reducing, which could catalyze reactions that would form more complicated organic molecules from simpler molecules. Haldane hypothesized that the oceans served as a huge cooking pot where powered by the sun or lightning, chemical reactions could occur in an aqueous environment to form a huge diversity of organic compounds.  Haldane proposed that the primordial sea served as a vast chemical laboratory powered by solar energy. The atmosphere was oxygen free, and the combination of carbon dioxide, ammonia and ultraviolet radiation gave rise to a host of organic compounds. The sea became a 'hot dilute soup' containing large populations of organic monomers and polymers. Haldane envisaged that groups of monomers and polymers aquired lipid membranes, and that further developments eventually led to the first living cells. 

Haldane coined the term 'prebiotic soup' or 'prebiotic atmosphere' that consisted of an abundance of methane, ammonia, and water.  This term became a powerful symbol of the Oparin-Haldane view of the origin of life.
 

&lt;u&gt;'''Miller-Urey Experiment'''&lt;/u&gt;

In 1953, two scientists set out to test Oparin and Haldane's hypothesis.  Harold Urey and his student Stanley Miller tried to calculate the chemical constituents of the atmosphere of the early Earth.  They based their calculations on the view that the early atmosphere was reducing.  In order to do this, they simulated early earth atmospheric conditions by creating a closed system which contained water, methane gas, ammonia, and hydrogen gas.  Urey suggested that his student, Miller should attempt to synthesize organic compounds in this type of atmosphere.  

Miller carried out an experiment in which he passed a coninuous spark discharge at 60,000 Volts through a flask containing the gases identified by Urey along with water.  Furthermore, this electrical current was run through the laboratory set up to simulate the catalytic source of lightning that was present in the early atmosphere. 

Miller found that after a week, most of the ammonia and much of the methane had been consumed. The main gaseous products were carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen (N2). In addition, there was an accumulation of dark material in the water. Few of the specific constituents of this could not be identified, but it was clear that the material included a large range of organic polymers.  From the results of their experiment, they found that up to 15% of the carbon in the system was inorganic compounds that had formed in the system.  This conclusion proved that organic molecules could be formed from inorganic molecules in Earth’s early atmosphere.  In addition, out of the organic molecules produced, Miller and Urey showed that some of the organic compounds were amino acids, which are necessary for living organisms. 

Analysis of the aqueous solution showed that the following had also been synthesised:

1. 25 amino acids (the main ones being glycine, alanine and aspartic acid) 

2. Several fatty acids 

3. Hydroxy acids 

4. Amide products. 



&lt;u&gt;'''Aftermath of the Miller-Urey Experiment'''&lt;/u&gt;

The Miller-Urey experiment was immediately recognized as an important breakthrough in the study of the origin of life.  It was received as confirmation of the Oparin-Haldane hypothesis in that several of the key molecules of life could have been synthesised on the primitive Earth in the kind of conditions envisioned by Oparin and Haldane. These molecules would then have been able to take part in prebiotic chemical processes, leading to the origin of life. 

Other similar experiments have been done to mimic early Earth conditions in an attempt to find other ways organic molecules could have formed. One experiment was done to mimic deep underwater volcano conditions. At these underwater volcanoes, catalytic heat as well as many minerals was constantly supplied. This provided an ideal system for organic molecules to be formed. This system was also found to produce amino acids, which is essential for living organisms to process into proteins.

Since the Miller-Urey experiment, a great deal of effort has been spent investigating prebiotic chemistry. It has become apparent that organizing simple molecules into assemblies capable of reproducing and evolving is a far greater task than was generally realized during the excitement that followed the experiment. In addition, the view that the early atmosphere was highly reducing was challenged towards the end of the twentieth century, and is no longer the concensus view. 

Although the significance of specific details of the Miller-Urey for the origin of life may now be in question, it began the new scientific discipline of prebiotic chemistry, and has been enormously influential in the development of ideas about the origin of life.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The human rectum is a channel in the human body through which drugs can be easily administered and absorbed well. Sometimes it is the most preferable to give a drug rectally rather than orally, e.g. in cases of nausea and vomiting. Disadvantages of drug administration through rectum include the interruption of absorption by defaecation and lack of patient acceptability ( it is not comfortable for most patients to have drug administered through their rectum). The mechanism of drug absorption from the rectum is probably no different to that in the upper part of the gastrointestinal tract, despite the fact that the physiological circumstances (e.g. pH, fluid content) differ substantially, absorption from aqueous and alcoholic solutions may occur very rapidly, which has proved to be of considerable therapeutic value in the rapid suppression of acute convulsive attacks by diazepam (e.g. in children), but absorption from suppositories is generally slower and very much dependent on the nature of the suppository base, the use of surfactants or other additives, particle size of the active ingredient, etc. There is some evidence that hepatic first-pass elimination of high clearance drugs is partially avoided after rectal administration, e.g. lignocaine. This can be explained by the rectal venous blood supply: the upper part is connected with the portal system, whereas the lower part is directly connected with the systemic circulation. Plasma concentration data following rectal administration of representatives of several classes of drugs are reviewed: anticonvulsants, non-narcotic analgesics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, hypnosedatives and anaesthetics, strong analgesics, theophylline and derivatives, corticosteroids, antibacterial agents, thiazinamium, promethazine, hyoscine-N-butyl-bromide, streptokinase, progesterone, ergotamine tartrate and levodopa. Only limited number of cases has it been adequately shown that the rectal route of administration gives plasma concentrations which are comparable to the oral route. Potentially the rectal route offers the same possibilities as the oral route, but the influence of the formulation seems to be very critical. It is also likely that the future novel drug delivery systems with zero order release characteristics will be applied rectally. Interesting preliminary results have already been obtained with theophylline administered by 2ml osmotic pumps.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Sublingual medications are administered by inserting them directly under the tongue. The medications dissolve rapidly and are absorbed through the mucous membranes of the mouth, where they enter into the bloodstream. The medications are compounded in the form of small, quick-dissolving tablets, sprays, lozenges, or liquid suspensions. The most common sublingual medication is the nitroglycerin tablet, which is a form of pain reliever that is absorbed the fastest when administered sublingually to the body. The sublingual administration method is not always appropriate. Sublingual medications should not be administered if the gums or mucous membranes have open sores or areas of irritation. The patient should not eat, drink, chew, or swallow until the medication has been absorbed. Swallowing the medication must be prevented, since it will decrease the drug's effectiveness as it is digested in the digestive system. Sublingual administration method is fat acting and the body will be able to sense its effect within 5-10 minutes after administration.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Definition of Living Organisms==
Processes are carried out in an immense variety of ways between plants, animals, fungi and other types of organisms. An organism is defined to be alive when it performs, in one form or another, all of the following life processes: nutrition, movement, growth, reproduction, and respiration, as well as sensitivity and excretion, according to Functioning of Organisms by Philip Stephenson.

==Characteristics of Living Organisms==
===1. High degree of chemical complexity and microscopic organization===

Living organisms are composed of cells with highly organized systems, starting from the smallest cellular unit to the largest. Some organisms are unicellular (composed of one cell), free-living and contain organelles to help carry out their life processes. More complex organisms are multicellular (composed of more than one cell). These cells are organized into specialized roles, like tissues or muscles, where they each live co-dependently. Tissues are organized into organs. The organ system in composed of multiple organs that function together. An organism is a complex series of organ systems.

===2. Systems to extract, transform and use energy from the environment===

Living organisms that convert organic matter from the environment and convert into energy that chemical material inside our cells use in metabolism are called heterotrophs. Other organisms such as algae and plants that use photosynthesis to extract energy from the sun along with carbon dioxide and water to produce sugars are called autotrophs. Certain types of bacteria use chemosynthesis to couple the transformation of organic molecules into from their energy with inorganic molecules. 
Without this ability to extract, transform and use energy, organisms will quickly become unable to power their life functions.

===3. Self-replication and self-assembly===

Living organisms have the ability to reproduce. In plants and simple animals, reproduction is through the process of asexual reproduction. Asexual reproduction is defined as a single individual reproducing without the help of another individual. Examples of asexual reproduction include splitting or budding. More complex organisms participate in sexual reproduction, where two individual contribute genetic information to create a new individual with a unique combination of traits. 

===4. Sensing and responding to changes in environment===

Living organism have the ability to respond to stimuli in their environment. Changes may include light, heat, sound or chemical contact. In response to stimuli, an organism uses hormones to change their behavior in response to the surrounding environment.

===5. Define function for each component and regulation among them===
Living organisms possess specific conditions that they must maintain for survival. The ability to regulate conditions such as temperature, nutrients and water are essential for survival. Homeostasis, a stable balance of internal conditions against external forces is a condition that must be kept.

===6. History of evolutionary change===

Populations of living organisms adapt to changes in their environment through evolution. As changes occur in the population, the organism adapts, using their abilities to metabolize respond and reproduce. Characteristics that are more useful in survival are passed to offsprings and allows survival for the species.

===Growth of Living Organisms===
All living organisms grow. An increase in mass and increase in number 
of individuals are twin characteristics of growth. A multicellular organism 
grows by cell division. In plants, this growth by cell division occurs 
continuously throughout their life span. In animals, this growth is seen 
only up to a certain age. However, cell division occurs in certain tissues to 
replace lost cells. Unicellular organisms also grow by cell division. One 
can easily observe this in an invitro cultures by simply counting the number 
of cells under the microscope. In a majority of higher ordered animals and plants, 
growth and reproduction are mutually exclusive events. One must 
remember that increase in body mass is considered as growth. Non-living 
objects also grow if we take an increase in body mass as a criterion for growth. 
Mountains, boulders and sand mounds grow, however this kind of 
growth exhibited by non-living objects is by the accumulation of material on 
the surface. In living organisms, growth is from inside. Growth, therefore 
cannot be taken as a defining property of living organisms. Conditions 
under which growth can be observed in living organisms have to be explained 
in order to understand that it is a characteristic of living systems. Dead organism do not grow.

===Reproduction===
Reproduction is s a characteristic of living organisms.--- 
In multicellular organisms, reproduction refers to the production of 
progeny possessing features more or less similar to those of parents. 
Invariably and implicitly we refer to sexual reproduction. Organisms 
reproduce by asexual means also. Fungi multiply and spread easily due 
to the millions of asexual spores they produce. In lower organisms like 
yeast and hydra, we observe budding. In Planaria (flat worms), we observe 
true regeneration, i.e., a fragmented organism regenerates the lost part of 
its body and becomes, a new organism. The fungi, the filamentous algae, 
the protonema of mosses, all easily multiply by fragmentation. When it 
comes to unicellular organisms like bacteria, unicellular algae or Amoeba, 
reproduction is synonymous with growth, i.e., increase in number of cells. 
We have already defined growth as equivalent to increase in cell number 
or mass. Hence, we notice that in single-celled organisms, we are not very 
clear about the usage of these two terms - growth and reproduction. 
Further, there are many organisms which do not reproduce (mules, sterile 
worker bees, infertile human couples, etc). Hence, reproduction also cannot 
be an all-inclusive defining characteristic of living organisms. Of course, 
no non-living object is capable of reproducing or replicating by itself. 

===Metabolism===
Another characteristic of life is metabolism. All living organisms 
are made of chemicals. These chemicals, small and big, belonging to 
various classes, sizes, functions, etc., are constantly being made and 
changed into some other biomolecules. These conversions are chemical 
reactions or metabolic reactions. There are thousands of metabolic 
reactions occurring simultaneously inside all living organisms, be they 
unicellular or multicellular. All plants, animals, fungi and microbes exhibit 
metabolism. The sum total of all the chemical reactions occurring in our 
body is metabolism. No non-living object exhibits metabolism. Metabolic 
reactions can be demonstrated outside the body in cell-free systems. An 
isolated metabolic reaction(s) outside the body of an organism, performed 
in a test tube is neither living nor non-living. Hence, while metabolism is 
a defining feature of all living organisms without exception, isolated 
metabolic reactions in vitro are not living things but surely living reactions. 

=== Cellular Organization of the Body is the Defining Feature of Life Forms.===

=== Adaptation of Environments===
The most obvious and technically complicated feature of all 
living organisms is this ability to sense their surroundings or environment 
and respond to these environmental stimuli which could be physical, 
chemical or biological. We sense our environment through our sense 
organs. Plants respond to external factors like light, water, temperature, 
other organisms, pollutants, etc. All organisms, from the prokaryotes to 
the most complex eukaryotes can sense and respond to environmental 
cues. Photoperiod affects reproduction in seasonal breeders, both plants 
and animals. All organisms handle chemicals entering their bodies. All 
organisms therefore, are 'aware' of their surroundings. Human beings are 
the only organisms known to be self aware, i.e., have self-consciousness.

===Consciousness===
Consciousness therefore, becomes the defining property of living 
organisms. When it comes to human beings, it is all the more difficult to define 
the living state. We observe patients lying in coma in hospitals virtually 
supported by machines which replace heart and lungs. The patient is 
otherwise brain-dead. The patient has no self-consciousness. Are such 
patients who never come back to normal life, living or non-living? 
In higher classes, you will come to know that all living phenomena 
are due to underlying interactions. Properties of tissues are not present 
in the constituent cells but arise as a result of interactions among the 
constituent cells. Similarly, properties of cellular organelles are not present 
in the molecular constituents of the organelle but arise as a result of 
interactions among the molecular components comprising the organelle. 
These interactions result in emergent properties at a higher level of 
organization. This phenomenon is true in the hierarchy of organizational 
complexity at all levels.

=== Self-Replicating, and Self-Regulating===
All living organisms are self-replicating, evolving and have self-regulating interactive systems capable of responding to external stimuli. 
Biology is the story of life on earth and is the story of evolution for living organisms on earth. All living 
organisms - present, past and future, are linked to one another by the 
sharing of common genetic material, but to varying degrees of assortments.

More than one phases coexist at the same temperature and pressure.

==K-Values==
K-values is a phase-equilibrium ratio, for vapor-liquid systems,

&lt;math&gt;K_i = y_i/x_i&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;y_i&lt;/math&gt; is the mole fraction of a species in vapor phase, and

For ideal solutions,

&lt;math&gt;K_i = P_i^S/P&lt;/math&gt;

K-values can be used for calculating bubble and dew points.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==

When there are unneeded amino acids from either protein digestion or turnover, they are broken down into certain compounds. This process usually occurs in the liver. 

In amino acid degradation the amino group is removed and turned into an α-ketoacids which is then modified so that the carbon chain could enter the metabolism and eventually become glucose or intermediates of the citric acid cycle.

==Amino Acid Degradation==


The amino group is transferred to α-ketoglutarate which forms glutamate. Then the glutamate is oxidatively deanimated to form the ammonium ion NH4+

Aminotransferases catalyzes the reaction that turns the α-amino group from an α-amino acid to an α-ketoacid. These enzymes catalyze α-amino groups from a variety of amino acids to α-keto-glutarate for conversion to NH4+

Aspartate aminotransferase, catalyzes the transfer of the amino group of aspartate to α-ketoglutarate.
 
Alanine aminotransferase catalyzes the transfer of the amino group of alanine to α-ketoglutarate.
 
The nitrogen from the α-ketoglutarate in the transamination reaction is converted into an ammonium ion by oxidative deamination. This reaction is catalyzed by glutamate dehydrogenase. 
This enzyme is special in that it is able to utilize either NAD+ or NADP+. The reaction dehydrogenates the C-N bond, and then hydrolyses of the Schiff base to make a ketoglutarate

The equilibrium for this reaction favors glutamate. But the reaction can be pushed forward by the consumption of ammonia. Glutamate dehydrogenase is found in the mitochondria. This compartmentalization prevents interaction with ammonia. In vertebrates, the activity of glutamate dehydrogenase is allosterically regulated.

 NH4+ is converted into urea, which is then excreted as waste.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Flagella==

Flagella (singular=flagellum), are extensions of the cell commonly found in many Bacteria and Archaea, and even in some Eukaryotic cells. Cells that have flagella often use their flagella as their main method of motility. Most bacterial cells use their flagella to travel randomly, a process called random walk, unless there is a chemical signal present, in which the cell would travel to the attractant (or away from a repellant) through chemotaxis.

==Types of Flagella==

There are three major types of flagella found among cells

'''Peritrichous''' flagella are a series of flagella that appear around the cell in all directions. Some examples of cells that have peritrichous cells are E.coli cells and salmonella cells.

'''Lophotrichious''' flagella are a group of flagella that are bundled together on one side of the cell. 

'''Monotrichous''' flagella have only one flagellum attached to one side of the cell

==Form and Function==

'''Bacteria/Archaea cells:''' The primary function of flagella is to allow for cell motility. The flagella are comprised of protein monomers called flagellin. The flagella are able to perform this by spinning in an either clockwise or counterclockwise direction. When the flagella (or flagellum, for monotrichous cells) are spinning in the counterclockwise direction, the flagella is driving the cell forward towards the attractant or away from the deterring signal. When the flagella is rotating clockwise, the entire cell stops the forward movement in order to change direction. The flagella is able to rotate in either direction by generating torque in the basal body. Within the basal body is a specialized protein called the mot protein, which generates torque to propel the circular flagellar motion. The basal body also acts as an anchoring system for the flagella, consisting of a set of rings known as the L, P, MS, and C rings. The flagella is able to switch between the clockwise and counterclockwise directions through Fli proteins, which senses where the attractant/deterrent is, and switches the direction of rotation for the flagella in response to the chemical signal (therefore performing chemotaxis). 

'''Eukaryotic cells:''' Eukaryotic cell flagella differ from bacterial cells in terms of how the flagella move in order to propel the cell forward. Because eukaryotic cells are much bigger than bacterial cells, instead of a clockwise/counterclockwise direction, most eukaryotic cell flagella move in a “whip-like” motion which is fueled by ATP hydrolysis in the cell. Eukaryotic cells with flagella also have many more microtubules in the membrane to help aid in support during cell chemotaxis.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
Professor Ivan Berke was the founder of the clinic enzymology and medical biochemistry in Serbia and Yugoslavia who played an important role in pharmacy and medicine. Many students under his tutorship became biochemists who specialized in my different fields. His contribution will help many new generations in the medical field. He was a role model to all of his students in every aspect.

==Biography==
Professor Ivan Berke was born on November 13th 1910 in Bjelovar. In 1933, he graduated from a Pharmacy Department in Zagreb. In 1936, he graduated from the 7th group of Chemistry In Zagreb. He then served in military for one year. In 1939, he obtained a doctorate in chemistry and was elected to become an assistant at the Chemical Institute of the Faculty of Medicine. After holding several positions at the Institute of Chemical, he then became director of that Institute. He became a scientific advisor in Budapest and then worked for the Institute of Chemistry in Zagreb until 1953. During 1953 and 1960, he was an Associate Professor of Biochemistry at the Medical Faculty in Skopje. In 1960, he joined the Biochemistry Institute in Belgrade. Later in 1964, he was elected as a Senior Professor of Biochemistry and remained at this position until retirement in 1978.

==Academic Career and Contribution==
His contribution in scientific work was first influenced by Tomislav Pinter, who explained to him about how analytical and physical chemistry worked. In 1931, with the help of professor Milo Mladenovi, he then became more interested in preparative organic chemistry and Pregl’s micro-analysis. After that, he focused on determining the functional groups of polyterpene acid in a-elemi and b-elemonic acids. This work led to the first papers about the new derivatives of dihydro- and dribromineelemonic acid, and di- and tetrazonide. With the help of Dr Pinter, he focused more about inorganic analytics.
 
He was the one who created a basis for electrophoresis. This technique became a main focus on clinical biochemistry. Due to financial problems to use the large apparatus in the lab, Dr Berke introduced some methods of solutions for paper electrophoresis. Later then, he was one of the greatest investigators in this field and his works were cited in everything that dealt with this topic. 

Besides many applications of this electrophoresis, the most interesting study was of nephritic syndrome in children in 1952. Dr Berke spent several years developing “Thiol Function” in Serbia which led to his achievement in determining the activity of enzyme dimethyleethine: homocysteine methylferase.

He spent most of his time doing methodological research in biochemistry and enzymology. He became more and more interested in enzyme and finally ended up with this famous book “General and Medical Enzymology”.  He was a tutor for 18 years during the time he was in Belgrade. More than 150 students under his guidance became biochemists who specialized in my different fields. Throughout his life, he had published many books and articles all over the world.

{{BBR/Note|
'''BLENDER NOVICE PAGE: First Grasp The Concept'''

Blender has multiple modes. To edit an object you must select it and put it into edit mode. This is done either by pressing the '''TAB''' key or by going to the bottom of the 3D view panel and clicking on the pull down menu with the text &quot;'''Object Mode'''&quot;.

In edit mode you may select any face, vertex (a point at a corner usually. This is only a rough definition) or an edge (the line between to vertexes). You select these with '''RIGHT-CLICK''' and scale, move and rotate like an object in object mode.

{{BBR/Note|
'''BLENDER NOVICE PAGE: Note'''

You may go back to object mode by pressing '''TAB'''.}}

{{BBR/Note|
'''BLENDER NOVICE PAGE: Note'''

You may extrude an edge, vertex or face by pressing '''E'''.}}

}}

{{BBR/Note|
'''BLENDER NOVICE PAGE: Next Learn How To Edit'''

When you want to create an object in a certain shape you must first think of what object will be the easiest to model to make your dream object. The cube is usually the best for this job but this is not always the case.

You can experiment by adding objects and then modelling them in to something else. With this you can learn the abilities.

{{BBR/Note|
'''BLENDER NOVICE PAGE: Note'''

You may subdivide (make 1 face or edge into multiple faces or edges) a face or edge by selecting it and clicking the &quot;Subdivide&quot; button in the menu to the left of the 3D view.}}

{{BBR/tip|
'''Tips And Tricks'''

Try and keep your models LOW-POLY. This means try to have as few faces per object as possible. Don't let this constrict your modelling though. Just when one face could do instead of four try to reduce it. High-poly models can slow the game down.}}

{{BBR/tip|
'''Tips And Tricks'''

When extruding in edit mode it is best to set an axis.

{{BBR/tip|
'''Tips And Tricks'''

Do you want to move a face on two axis' at a time instead of one? Press '''SHIFT-Z''' to move on X and Y, '''SHIFT-X''' to move on Y and Z and '''SHIFT-Y''' to move on Z and X.}}

{{BBR/tip|
'''Tips And Tricks'''

'''NEVER''' press '''P''' in '''Editmode'''. It won't start the game engine but instead separate the current face, vertex or edge. If you do want it to separate go ahead.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:subcutaneous_injection.png|thumbnail|right|Subcutaneous Injection]]
==Definition==
A '''subcutaneous injection''' (SC, SQ, SubQ) is a method of drug administration in which the drug is injected into hypodermis, the fatty tissue layer directly beneath the dermis and epidermis. Because there is limited blood flow to the hypodermis, subcutaneous injection is usually used when slow absorption of medication is preferred.&lt;ref&gt;Clinical Center - National Institutes of Health. [http://www.cc.nih.gov/ccc/patient_education/pepubs/subq.pdf &quot;Patient Education: Giving a subcutaneous injection.&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; Drugs that are administered using this method must be soluble and potent in small concentrations. Common medications used with this procedure include heparin, insulin, growth hormones, and vaccines against MMR and varicella.
==Sites and Method of Injection==

With subcutaneous injection, the drug is usually administered through loose interstitial tissues of the upper arm, the anterior surface of the thigh, the lower portion of the abdomen, or the lower back. When injecting, the skin is pinched up to prevent injection into muscle. It is recommended to use the same site for routine injections. The shot is given at a straight 90 degree angle if at least 2 inches of skin can be grasped. Otherwise, it is given at a 45 degree angle.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;How To Give A Subcutaneous Injection.&quot; Drugs.com, n.d. Web. 28 Oct. 2012. http://www.drugs.com/cg/how-to-give-a-subcutaneous-injection.html.&lt;/ref&gt;
==Absorption Rate==
Factors that may increase absorption rate are heat, massaging, co-administers vasodilators, or hyaluronidase at the site of injection. Epinephrine may decrease the absorption rate due to decreased blood flow.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
Transdermal refers to the process in which the drug diffuses through the intact skin for the purpose of systematic distribution (as opposed to topical distribution). In order to achieve this route of administration, utilities such as transdermal patches, transdermal gels, and  transdermal implants can be used for medical purposes. 

==Pathways==

===Transcellular Pathway===
The transcellular pathway is the more direct path in which drugs can make its way across the skin. In this route, drugs are transported across the skin by proceeding through the membranes of dead kertinocytes (the predominatn cell type within the epidermis) that make up the top layer of skin, which is known as the stratum corneum. Even though the path distance for this method is the shortest, drugs can experience resistance due to the phospholipid membranes that they have to cross.  

===Intercellular Pathway===
The intercellular pathway is the more common pathway in which the drugs pass through the skin by navigating through small spaces that exist between the cells of the skin. 

==Disadvantages==
Even though the skin is easily accessible for the purpose of drug delivery, its main function of preventing foreign substances from entering the body can limit the types and amounts of drugs that are taken in through this route of administration. In order to reach the microcirculation of the dermis, the drug must manage to go through the Epidermis and the Dermis, which are two significant layers of the skin.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Definition=
Intradermal (ID) drug administration is the injection of a small amount of fluid into the dermal layer of the skin. The needle most commonly used for this technique is the tuberculin syringe with a 26-gauge needle, which is about one-fourth to one-half inch in length. A small amount of swelling in the skin after injection is to be expected.

      <comment>/* Introduction */ tiny change: took out a word and added &quot;so well&quot;</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==
Derived from the juice of the opium poppy Papaver Somniferum, morphine makes up about 10% of the plant's juice and has been used for thousands of years to relieve pain of all types and varying severity.  Until it was isolated in 1806, it was ingested as the dried juice called opium.  Whether in opium or by itself, injected, smoked or swallowed, morphine binds to receptors in the brain to create feeling of euphoria, which makes it popular for recreational use. In the gut, it binds to the same receptors and slows peristaltic movement so well it remains an unparalleled treatment for diarrhea.  As with any opiate, prolonged users will eventually become addicted and tolerance — increasing doses needed to achieve the same effects — can be expected both to analgesia (pain relief) and the euphoria (high) morphine produces.

Although indispensable as a weapon against pain, relief comes with &quot;side effects&quot; that may not be so welcome, especially sleepiness, blurred vision, constipation, and decrease in appetite.  Of course, morphine's potential to cause physical dependence (&quot;addiction&quot;) is its worst unwanted effect as withdraw symptoms can be pretty unpleasant should the person abruptly stop or sharply reduce their dose of morphine.

== How Morphine Works ==
Morphine can be administered several ways: IV drips, orally as a pill, injection, nasally (insufflation), or rectally; each method has its own degree of effectiveness, with the pill form being the least effective (10-30%) and IV drips being the most effective (close to 100%). It works by binding the mu-opioid, the kappa-opioid, and the nociceptin receptors in the brain and spinal cord (mostly on substantia gelatinosa, where the feeling of pain is first processed), as well as the delta-receptors in the brain. It inhibits that transmission of signals from pain neurons in the peripheral nervous system and also produces effects in the dorsal horn to excite neurons and other pathways. The result is that morphine blocks pain signals from both the central and peripheral nervous systems. Ironically, the drug doesn't stop the transmission of pain, but rather alters the user's perception of the pain; he or she is aware of the pain but finds its manageable or it can be ignored. 

As little as 5mg of morphine can produce noticeable affects as the drug binds to the same receptors that endorphins, enkephalins, and dynorphins bind to — these opiate-like substances produced naturally by the human body.

The euphoric effects morphine produces are part of another mechanism involving the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) inhibitors and their respective neurons. Under cellular conditions, GABA reduces the amount of dopamine, a neurotransmitter in the brain that is associated with pleasure, released in the brain. Morphine inhibits the amount of GABA that is released in the brain. Over time, it gradually increases the levels of dopamine the brain, which results in a &quot;high&quot; or euphoric feeling.

In addition, prolonged use of morphine inhibits the production of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). When morphine suddenly becomes unavailable, the human body produces more cAMP as a results, which leads to hyperactivity and drug craving.

==Adverse Effects==

===Addiction===
The use of morphine is well-known for causing &quot;addiction&quot; — physical dependence.  Psychological addiction is also possible but a different concern caused by factors less concrete than the far better understood phenomenon of physical addiction, especially to morphine.  

Physical dependence, when a given dose becomes a daily necessity to avoid unpleasant &quot;withdrawal syndrome&quot; symptoms, is a feature of morphine use that can be expected to occur in virtually anyone who takes it for long enough.  How long this takes varies within a fairly narrow window but it isn't very likely within the usual week or ten-day period most people will have it prescribed to them.  After that, it should be discussed with a physician to prevent needless suffering caused either by untreated withdrawal or from the unwarranted cessation of pain relief treatment for fear of &quot;addiction.&quot;

Physical dependence occurs with the other opiate drugs, too, although to different degrees in terms of the severity of withdrawal and development of tolerance to the drug.

===Constipation===
As an opioid, morphine has the tendency to act upon the myenteric plexus, which is in the intestinal tract. This results in the reduction of gut motility, which cases an overall effect of constipation. Morphine decreases the rate of intestinal transit by inhibiting the process of peristalsis of the intestine.

===Tolerance===
Tolerance to morphine occurs very readily, meaning that a higher concentration of morphine is necessary to obtain the same feelings or effects. Hypotheses of how this tolerance develops include the change in the receptor conformation of phosphorylation, the decoupling of receptors of G-proteins, the upregulation of the cAMP pathway,  and μ-opioid receptor internalization.

===Withdrawal===
Morphine withdrawal progresses as follows, roughly broken down according to symptoms, their onset and likely duration:
* '''Stage 1''': Pronounced desire for the missing drug (&quot;craving&quot;) and anxiety; starts six to twelve hours after the last dose.  

*'''Stage 2''': Along with craving and anxiety (which may become stronger) typical symptoms are sweating, runny nose, yawning, and watering eyes (&quot;lacrimation&quot;). Usually starts within about 8 to 12 hours after last dose

*'''Stage 3''': General feeling of being uncomfortable, aching all over the body and loss of appetite are typical as symptoms progress. At this point muscle spasms, especially in the legs, are the origin of the term &quot;kicking&quot; (originally to describe opium withdrawal and later to giving up any other habit) and abdominal cramping are the next symptoms to appear next, about 24 hours after the last dose.

* '''Stage 4''': This is the acute stage when symptoms are at their worst and can last two or three days before subsiding. The pain continues, especially in joints. Insomnia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, are typical symptoms although they vary quite a bit — between individuals and between attempts to &quot;kick&quot;. Men sometimes ejaculate involuntarily. Severe depression is also a very common symptom.

== Deadly Combinations/Precautions ==
Morphine is a potentially dangerous drug because, along with pain relief (analgesia) it depresses breathing.  This effect increases with dosage but is also affected by tolerance so it is only a danger in case of overdose or when combined with certain depressants, like alcohol.

 '''Words cannot be patented, but works under copyright do not belong here.'''

This is not a comprehensive list and the terms used here have not been exposed to vigorous scientific testing. These are simply some terms which emerged in the course of nursing employment, which may be helpful to students of nursing.

Several publishers have invested time and energy to quantify a propietary language. The International council of nurses has published a list of nursing classifications which has been accepted as an international scientific language by the World Health Organization. Mapping the ICN terminology to commercial languages is underway [http://www.hindawi.com/isrn/nursing/2012/676905]. Having said that, enrolled nurses need to use their powers of critical thinking to show an awareness of the underpinning principles behind informatics, regardless of source. 

There are a range of nursing diagnosis in the academic nursing literature. Various standards exist for verification and validation for informatics purposes. Students are encouraged to decide for themselves what they consider to be useful definitions of international concern to nurses. 

*Worry - an emotional state linked to all body systems.
*Maceration - having excessive fluid (specify where)
*Dessication - insufficent fluid (specify where)
*Somalgia - paroxysms of soreness or ache, variously described.
*exposure to factors causing deteriorating condition (specify)

In practise, nursing diagnosis is given cursory treatment by some individual nurses. Some institutional health care approaches omit diagnosis altogether. It may not be worth students learning a particular version, when employers may prefer acuity scoring of their own design. Nursing diagnosis may be regarded by some practising nurses as overly academic, impractical, unwieldy or uneconomial. The topic of diagnosis does not appear in all nursing curricula. Nursing diagnosis is sometimes given little emphasis in training as only one of several possible nursing care planning approaches. The whole question of informatics is considered by some nurses as detracting from more important clinical issues.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== '''DNA-Binding Proteins Distinguish Specific Sequences of DNA''' ==

The method prokaryotes use most often when responding to environmental changes is altering their gene expression. Expression is when a gene is transcribed into RNA and then translated into proteins. The two types of expression are constitutive—where genes are constantly being expressed—and regulated—where specific conditions need to be met inside the cell for a gene to be expressed. This sub-section focuses on how prokaryotes go about regulating the expression of their genes.

Transcription, when DNA is converted into RNA, is the first place for controlling gene activity. Proteins interact with DNA sequences to either promote or prevent the transcription of a gene.

Keep in mind that DNA sequences are not discernible from one another in terms of having features that a regulatory system would be able to register. Therefore, when regulating gene expression, prokaryotes rely on other sequences within their genome, called regulatory sites. These regulatory sites are most often also DNA-binding protein binding sites and are close to the DNA destined for transcription in prokaryotes.

An example of one of these regulatory sites is in E. coli: when sugar lactose is introduced into the environment of the bacterium a gene for encoding the production of an enzyme, β-galactosidase, begins to be expressed. This enzyme’s function is to process lactose so that the cell can extract energy and carbon from it.

[[File:Lac regulartory site.png thumb |frameless|lac regulatory site]]

The sequence of nucleotides of this regulatory site (pictured) displays an almost completely inverted repeat. This shows that the DNA has a nearly twofold axis of symmetry, which in most regulatory sites usually correlates to symmetry in the protein that binds to the site. When studying protein-DNA interactions, symmetry is generally present.

Furthering the investigation into the expression of the lac regulatory site and the protein-DNA interactions that take place there, scientists looked at the structure of the complex formed between the DNA-binding unit that recognizes the lac site and the site itself, which is part of a larger oligonucleotide. They found that the DNA-binding unit specific to the lac regulatory site comes from the protein lac repressor. The function of lac repressor, as the name suggests, is the repression of the lactose-processing gene’s expression. This DNA-binding unit’s twofold axis of symmetry matches the symmetry of the DNA, and the unit binds as a dimer. From each monomer of the protein an α helix is inserted into the DNA’s major groove. Here amino acid side chains interact (via very site-specific Hydrogen bonding) with the exposed base pairs in such a fashion that the lac repressor can only very tightly bind to this specific site in the genome of E. coli.

[[File:Lac repressor.jpg thumb |framed|The lac repressor and operator DNA]]

=== The helix-turn-helix motif is common to many prokaryotic DNA-binding proteins ===

After discerning the structures of many prokaryotic DNA-binding proteins, a structural pattern that was observed in many proteins was a pair of α helices separated by a tight turn. These are called helix-turn-helix motifs and are made of two distinct helices: the second α helix (called the recognition helix) lies in the major groove and interacts with base pairs while the first α helix is primarily in contact with the DNA backbone.

== '''In Prokaryotes, DNA-Binding Proteins Bind Explicitly to Regulatory Sites in Operons''' ==

Looking back at the previous example with E. coli and β-galactosidase, we can garner the common principles of how DNA-binding proteins carry out regulation. When E. coli’s environment lacks glucose—their primary source of carbon and energy—the bacteria can switch to lactose as a carbon source via the enzyme β-galactosidase. β-galactosidase hydrolyzes lactose into glucose and galactose which are then metabolized by the cell. The permease facilitates the transport of lactose across the cell membrane of the bacterium and is essential. The transacetylase is on the other hand not required for lactose metabolism but plays a role in detoxifying compounds that the permease may also be transporting. Here we can say that the expression levels of a group of enzymes that together contribute to adapting to a change in a cell’s environment change together.

[[File:Lactose.gif thumb thumbnail |thumbnail]]

An E.coli bacterium growing in an environment with a carbon source such as glucose or glycerol will have around 10 or fewer molecules of the enzyme β-galactosidase in it. This number shoots up to the thousands, however, when the bacterium is grown on lactose. The presence of lactose alone will increase the amount of β-galactosidase by a large amount by promoting the synthesis of new enzymes rather than activating a precursor.

When figuring out the mechanism of gene regulation in this particular instance, it was observed that the two other proteins galactoside permease and thiogalactoside transacetylase were synthesized alongside β-galactosidase.

=== An operon is made up of regulatory components and genes that encode proteins ===

The fact that β-galactosidase, the transacetylase, and the permease were regulated in concert indicated that a common mechanism controlled the expression of the genes encoding all three. A model called the operon model was proposed by Francois Jacob and Jacques Monod to explain this parallel regulation and other observations. The three genetic parts of the operon model are (1) a set of structural genes, (2) an operator site (a regulatory DNA sequence), and (3) a regulator gene that encodes the regulator protein.

In order to inhibit the transcription of structural genes, the regulator gene encodes a repressor protein meant for binding to the operator site. In the case of the lac operon, the repressor protein is encoded by the i gene, which binds to the o operator site in order to prevent the transcription of the z, y, and a genes (the structural genes for β-galactosidase). There is also a promoter site, p, on the operon whose function is to direct the RNA polymerase to the proper transcription initiation site. All three structural genes, when transcribed, give a single mRNA that encodes β-galactosidase, the permease, and the transacetylase. Because this mRNA encodes more than one protein, it is called a polycistronic (or polygenic) transcript.

[[File:Lactose operon.png thumb |thumbnail|The lactose operon]]

The lac repressor protein in the absence of lactose binds to the operator and blocks transcription

[[File:Lac repressor protein.jpg thumb |framed|The lac repressor protein]]

The lac repressor (pictured bound to DNA) is a tetramer with amino- and carboxyl-terminal domains. The amino-terminal domain is the one that binds to the DNA while the carboxyl-terminal forms a separate structure. The two sub-units pictured consolidate to form the DNA-binding unit. When lactose is absent from the environment of the bacterium, the lac repressor binds to the operator DNA snugly and swiftly (4x10^6 times as powerfully to the operator as opposed to random sites on the genome). The binding of the repressor precludes RNA polymerase from transcribing the z, y, and a genes which are downstream from the promoter site and code for the three enzymes. The dissociation constant for the complex formed by the lac repressor and the operator is around 0.1 pM and the association rate constant is a whopping 10^10 M-1s-1. This suggests that the repressor diffuses along a DNA molecule to find the operator rather than via an encounter from an aqueous medium.

When it comes to the DNA-binding preference of the lac repressor, the level of specificity is so high that it can be called a nearly unique site within the genome of E. coli. When the dimers of the amino-terminal domain bind to the operator site, the dimers of the carboxyl-terminal site are able to attach to one of two sites within 500 bp of the primary operator site that approximate the operator’s sequence. Each monomer interacts with the bound DNA’s major groove via a helix-turn-helix unit.


=== Ligand binding can induce structural changes in regulatory proteins ===

Now let’s look at how the presence of lactose changes the behavior of the repressor as well as the expression of the operon. All operons have inducers—triggers that facilitate the expression of the genes within the operon—and the inducer of the lac operon is allolactose, a molecule of galactose and glucose with an α-1,6 linkage.

[[File:Structure of Allolactose.png thumb |thumbnail|Allolactose]]

In the β-galactosidase reaction, allolactose is a side product and is produced at low levels when the levels of β-galactosidase are low in the bacterium. Additionally, though not a substrate of the enzyme, isopropylthiogalactoside (IPTG) is a powerful inducer of β-galactosidase expression.

In the lac operator, the way the inducer prompts gene expression is by inhibiting the lac repressor from binding to the operator. Its method of inhibition is by binding to the lac repressor itself thus immensely reducing the affinity of the repressor to bind to the operator DNA. The inducer binds to each monomer at the center of the large domain, causing conformational changes in the DNA-binding domain of the repressor. These changes drastically reduce the DNA-binding affinity of the repressor.


=== The operon is a common regulatory unit in prokaryotes ===

Numerous other gene regulation complexes within prokaryotes function analogously to the lac operon. An example of another network like this one is that which takes part in the synthesis of purine (and pyrimidine to a certain extent). These genes are repressed by the pur repressor, which is 31% identical to the lac repressor in sequence with a similar 3D structure. In this case, however, the pur repressor behaves opposite from the lac repressor: it blocks transcription by binding to a specific DNA site only when it is also bound to a small molecule called a corepressor (either guanine or hypoxanthine).


=== Transcription can be stimulated by proteins that contact RNA polymerase ===

While the previous examples of DNA-binding proteins all function by preventing the transcription of a DNA sequence until some condition in the environment is met, there are also examples of DNA-binding proteins that actually encourage transcription.

A good instance of this is the catabolite activator protein in E. coli. When the bacterium is grown in glucose it has very low amounts of catabolic enzymes whose function it is to metabolize other sugars. The genes that encode these enzymes are in fact inhibited by glucose, an effect known as catabolite repression. Glucose lowers the concentration of cAMP (cyclic AMP). When the concentration of cAMP is high, it stimulates the transcription of these catabolic enzymes made for breaking down other sugars. This is where the catabolite activator protein (CAP or CRP, cAMP receptor protein) comes into play. CAP, when bound to cAMP, will stimulate the transcription of arabinose and lactose-catabolizing genes. CAP, which binds only to a specific sequence of DNA, binds as a dimer to an inverted repeat at the position -61 relative to the start site for transcription, adjacent to where RNA polymerase binds (pictured).

[[File:CAP-cAMP complex.jpg thumb |framed|CAP-cAMP complex]]

This CAP-cAMP complex enhances transcription by about a factor of 50 by making the contact between RNA polymerase and CAP energetically favorable. There are multiple CAP binding sites within the E. coli genome, therefore increasing the concentration of cAMP in the bacterium’s environment will result in the formation of these CAP-cAMP complexes, thus resulting in the transcription of many genes coding for various catabolic enzymes.


== '''Regulatory Circuits Can Result in Switching Between Patterns of Gene Expression''' ==

In investigating gene-regulatory networks and how they function, studies of bacterial viruses—especially bacteriophage λ—have been invaluvable. Bacteriophage λ is able to develop via either a lytic or lysogenic pathway. In the lytic pathway, transcription takes place for most of the genes in the viral genome which leads to the production of numerous virus particles (~100) and the eventual lysis of the bacterium.  In the lysogenic pathway, the bacterial DNA incorporates the viral genome where most of the viral genes stay unexpressed; this allows for the viral genetic material to be carried in the replicate of the bacteria. There are two essential proteins plus a set of regulatory sequences within the viral genome that are the cause for the switch between the choice of pathways.

=== Lambda repressor regulates its own expression ===

[[File:Λ repressor fusions.jpg|thumb|λ repressor]]

λ repressor is one of these key regulatory proteins which promotes the transcription of the gene that encodes the repressor when levels of the repressor are low. When levels of the repressor are high, it blocks transcription of the gene. It is also a self-regulating protein. While the λ repressor binds to many sites in the λ phage genome, the one relevant here is the right operator, which includes 3 binding sites for the dimer of the λ repressor in addition to 2 promoters within an approximately 80 base pair region. The role the first promoter plays is driving the expression of the λ repressor gene, while the other promoter is responsible for driving the expression of a variety of other viral genes. The λ repressor binds to the first operating site with the most affinity; and when it is bound to this first operating site, the chances of a protein binding to the adjacent operating site increase 25 times. When the first and second operating sites have these complexes bound to them, the dimer of the λ repressor inhibits the transcription of the adjacent gene whose purpose is to encode the protein Cro (controller of repressor and others). The repressor dimer at the second operating site can interact with RNA polymerase so as to stimulate the transcription of the promoter which controls the transcription of the gene encoding the λ repressor. This is how the λ repressor facilitates its own production.
λ repressor fusions can be used to study protein-protein interactions in E. coli. There are two different domains in λ repressor: the N-terminal (DNA binding activity) and the C-terminal domain (dimerization). In order to have an active repressor fusion, the C-terminal domain should be replaced with a Heterodimers domain and form a dimer or higher order oligomer. However, inactive repressor fusions cannot attach to the DNA sequences and affect the expression of phage or reporter.&lt;ref&gt;Leonardo Mariño-Ramírez, Lisa Campbell, and James C. Hu. Screening Peptide/Protein Libraries Fused to the λ Repressor DNA-Binding Domain in E. coli Cells. 2003; 205: 235–250.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== A circuit based on lambda repressor and Cro form a genetic switch ===

We can see in the above picture how the λ repressor blocks production of Cro by binding to the first operating site with the most affinity. Cro meanwhile blocks the production of the λ repressor by binding to the third operating site with the most affinity. This entire circuit is the deciding factor as to whether the lytic or lysogenic pathway will be followed: if λ repressor is high and Cro is low, the lysogenic path will be chosen; if Cro is high and the λ repressor is low, the lytic path will be chosen.

=== Many prokaryotic cells release chemical signals that regulate gene expression in other cells ===

Some prokaryotes are also known to undergo a process where they release chemicals called autoinducers into their medium (quorum sensing). These autoinducers, which are most of the time acyl homoserine lactones, are taken up by the surrounding cells. When the levels of these autoinducers reach a certain point, receptor proteins bind to them and activate the expression of several genes, including those that promote the synthesis of more autoinducers. This is a way for prokaryotes to interact with one another chemically to change their gene-expression patterns depending on how many other surrounding cells there are in their medium. Communities of prokaryotes that carry these mechanisms of quorum sensing out are collectively called a biofilm.

== '''Gene Expression Can Be Controlled at Posttranscriptional Levels''' ==

Though most of gene expression regulation happens at the initiation of transcription, other steps of transcription are also possible targets for regulation.

=== Tryptophan Operon  ===

Exploring the genes of the tryptophan operon (abbreviated as trp operon) in order to study the regulation of tryptophan synthesis shows two types of mutants. One type of mutant involves structural gene mutations and the other a regulatory mutant. The mutants that involve structural gene mutations are auxotrophic for tryptophan and need tryptophan to growth. To convert the precursor molecule chorismate to tryptophan, the trpE, trpD, trpC, trpB, and trpA genes codes for a polycistronic message and the mRNA will be translated to the enzyme that carries out the conversion.

[[File:Tryptophan.jpg|thumb|Tryptophan]]

The second type of mutants is able to constitutively synthesize the enzymes necessary for the synthesis of tryptophan. The trpR gene codes for the tryptophan repressor. The gene mapped in another quadrant of the E. coll chromosome compared to the trp operon. The trpR gene cannot regulate the synthesis of tryptophan efficiently. 
Studies on the dimeric trp repressor protein show that it does not function alone. The repressor must bind the last product of that metabolic pathway in order to regulate the synthesis of tryptophan. Thus, tryptophan is a corepressor for its own biosynthesis. This process is called feedback repression at the transcriptional level. 

When the concentration of tryptophan is high enough, then the repressor binds to tryptophan to make a repressor-tryptophan complex. This complex will attach to the operator region of the trp operon and prevents RNA polymerase to bind and initiate transcription of the structural genes. Also, when the concentration of tryptophan is low in the cell, due to lack of tryptophan-complex RNA polymerase is able to bind to the gene and transcribe the structural genes. Therefore, tryptophan will be biosynthesized.&lt;ref&gt;Arkady B. Khodursky, Brian J. Peter, Nicholas R. Cozzarelli, David Botstein. DNA microarray analysis of gene expression in response to physiological and genetic changes that affect tryptophan metabolism in Escherichia coli. 2000 October 24; 97(22): 12170–12175. Published online 2000 October 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Attenuation is a prokaryotic mechanism for regulating transcription through the modulation of nascent RNA secondary structure ===

While studying the tryptophan operon, Charles Yanofsky discovered another means of transcription regulation. The trp operon encodes 5 enzymes that convert chorismate into tryptophan, and upon examining the 5’ end of the trp mRNA he found there was a leader sequence consisting of 162 nucleotides that came before the initiation codon of the first enzyme. His next observation was that only the first 130 nucleotides were produced as a transcript when the levels of tryptophan were high, but when levels were low a 7000-nucleotide trp mRNA which included the entire leader sequence was produced. This mode of regulation is called attenuation, where transcription is cut off before any mRNA coding for the enzymes is produced.

Attenuation depends on the mRNA’s 5’ end features. The first part of the sequence codes for a leader peptide of 14 amino acids. The attenuator comes after the open reading frame for this peptide—it is an RNA region capable of forming a few alternate structures. Because transcription and translation are very closely coupled in bacteria, the translation of say the trp mRNA begins very soon after the synthesizing of the ribosome-binding site.

The structure of mRNA is altered by a ribosome, which is stalled by the absence of an animoacyl-tRNA necessary for the translation of the leader mRNA. This allows RNA polymerase to transcribe the operon past the attenuator site

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Ramachandran plot original outlines.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Original hard-sphere, reduced-radius, and relaxed-tau φ,ψ regions from Ramachandran, with -180 to +180 axes]]
[[Image:Protein backbone PhiPsiOmega drawing.jpg|thumb|left|140px|Backbone dihedral angles φ and ψ (and ω)]]
A '''Ramachandran plot''', also known as a Ramachandran diagram or a [φ,ψ] plot, was originally developed by Gopalasamudram Ramachandran, an Indian physicist, in 1963. Ramachandran Plot is a way to visualize dihedral angles ψ against φ of amino acid residues in protein structure.  Ramachandran recognized that many combinations of angles in a polypeptide chain are forbidden because of steric collisions between atoms.  His two-dimensional plot shows the allowed and disfavored values of ψ and φ: three-quarters of the possible combinations are excluded simply by local steric clashes.  Steric exclusion is the fact that two atoms cannot be in the same place at the same time is the powerful organizing principle that propels the use of the Ramachandron plot forward.

==Torsion Angles==
The two torsion angles of the polypeptide chain, also called Ramachandran angles, describe the rotations of the polypeptide backbone around the bonds between N-Cα (called Phi, φ) and Cα-C (called Psi, ψ). The Ramachandran plot provides an easy way to view the distribution of torsion angles of a protein structure.  It also provides an overview of allowed and disallowed regions of torsion angle values, serving as an important factor in the assessment of the quality of protein three-dimensional structures. 

Torsion angles are among the most important local structural parameters that control protein folding - essentially, if we would have a way to predict the Ramachandran angles for a particular protein, we would be able to predict its 3D structure. The reason is that these angles provide the flexibility required for folding of the polypeptide backbone, since the third possible torsion angle within the protein backbone (called omega, ω) is essentially flat and fixed to 180 degrees.  This is due to the partial double-bond character of the peptide bond, which restricts rotation around the C-N bond, placing two successive alpha-carbons and C, O, N and H between them in one plane. Thus, rotation of the main chain (backbone) of a protein can be described as the rotation of the peptide bond planes relative to each other. 

==Regions in Ramachandran Plot==
The Ramachandran Plot helps with determination of secondary structures of proteins. 
*Quadrant I shows a region where some conformations are allowed. This is where rare left-handed alpha helices lie.
*Quadrant II shows the biggest region in the graph. This region has the most favorable conformations of atoms. It shows the sterically allowed conformations for beta strands.
*Quadrant III shows the next biggest region in the graph. This is where right-handed alpha helices lie.
*Quadrant IV has almost no outlined region. This conformation(ψ around -180 to 0 degrees, φ around 0-180 degrees) is disfavored due to steric clash.

==Exceptions==
Exception from the principle of clustering around the α-helix and β-strand regions is [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/Amino Acids#Glycine - Gly/ G|glycine]]. Glycine does not have a complex side chain, which allows high flexibility in the polypeptide chain as well as torsion angles, something normally not allowed for other amino acid residues. That is why glycine is often found in loop regions, where the polypeptide chain makes a sharp turn. This is also the reason for the high conservation of glycine residues in protein families, since the presence of turns at certain positions is a characteristic of a particular fold of a protein structure. 

Another residue with special properties in terms of its torsion angles is [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/Amino Acids#Proline - Pro/ P|proline]]. Proline, in contrast to glycine, fixes the torsion angles at values, which are very close to those of an extended conformation of the polypeptide (like in a beta-sheet). Proline is often found at the end of helices and functions as a helix disruptor.

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Synthesis =
The synthesis of amino acids is vital to life itself. They are important because they are the basis of proteins and required for the synthesis of more complicated molecules such as vitamins. Amino acid synthesis is the process of creating amino acids from other molecules. Not all animals can synthesize all the amino acids. Non essential amino acids are those that are synthesized while the essential amino acids are those that need to be obtained through diet. Non-essential amino acids are the amino acids that can be synthesized in animals. 

The amino acids synthesis pathways are grouped into six categories. They are grouped according to their similar mechanism or the use of similar enzymes to synthesize amino acids. These six categories are simple reactions, branch chain amino acids, aromatic amino acids, threonine/lysine, serine/glycine, and unique pathways.

== Synthesis of Amino Acids ==

=== Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky ===




Using Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky Bromination, the creation of racemic alanine can be formed from propanoic acid.  This can be done as Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky Bromination allows for an addition of a functional group at the carbon 2 of propanoic acid.  Through this reaction, a nucleophile can displace the bromine that is formed on carbon number two.  In using a nucleophile such as ammonia, the amino acid Alanine can therefore be formed.  Due to the low yields produced by Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky Bromination, Gabriel Synthesis is preferred in the making of primary amines.


''Mechanism of Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky Bromination:''
[[File:Hell Volhard Zelinsky Reaktion Mechanismus3.svg|938 × 212px|center]]

This reaction is followed by an addition of ammonia, which will displace bromine and form Alanine.

=== Gabriel Synthesis ===



The formed 2-substitued propanedioate can be alkylated, allowing for the preparation of a variety of substituted amino acids. 

''Mechanism of Gabriel Synthesis:''
[[File:Gabriel synthesis mechanism.png|thumb|Gabriel synthesis mechanism|center]]

A propanedioate such as diethyl 2-bromomalonate would be used to form an amino acid such as Glycine.  The difference however in the synthesis of Glycine from the Gabriel Synthesis from the regular Gabriel synthesis shown above, is that the group that is attached to the Nitrogen after the first step would be hydrolyzed to form two carboxylic acids.  One of the carboxylic acid group would be then decarboxylated and hydrolysis would occur once again to cleave the imide group, which would result in the formation of Glycine.

=== Strecker Synthesis ===
This synthesis is based on the cyanohydrin formation that can occur from aldehydes and hydrogen cyanide.  When this reaction is carried out in the presence of ammonia or ammonium cyanide with an acetaldehyde, formation of the amino acid Alanine can occur.

''Mechanism of  Strecker Synthesis of Alanine:''
[[File:Strecker synthesis.png|thumb|Strecker synthesis|center]]

==Simple Reactions:The synthesis of Glutamine, Glutamate, Aspartate, Asparagines and Alanine==

Glutamate is synthesized by the addition of ammonia to alpha-ketoglutarate.

[[File:Synthesis of Glutamate.jpg|thumb|Synthesis of Glutamate]]

Using Glutamate, the addition of another ammonia molecule made Glutamine. 

[[File:Synthesis of Glutamine.jpg|thumb|Synthesis of Glutamine]]

Aspartate is made by the combination of Oxaloacetate and Glutamate. 

[[File:Synthesis of Aspartate.jpg|thumb|Synthesis of Aspartate]]

Asparagine can be made by adding ammonia directly to Aspartate.

[[File:Synthesis of Asparagine.jpg|thumb|Synthesis of Asparagine]]
There are several methods for making Alanine. The most common way is the transferring of amine group from glutamate onto private.

[[File:Alprazolam.jpg|thumb|Add caption here]]

==Introduction==
Alprazolam (also known as Xanax) is a psychoactive drug  used to treat anxiety disorders along with panic disorders. It is in a class of medications called benzodiazepines  and how it works is it decreases abnormal excitement in the brain. Alprazolam can come in a variety of shapes and sizes. They can come as a tablet, an extended-release tablet, an orally disintegrating tablet, and it is also available in a liquid form. 
Alprazolam is used to treat anxiety disorders and panic disorders (sudden and unexpected attacks of extreme fear and uneasiness about these thoughts). Alprazolam is in a class of medication called benzodiazepines, which works by decreasing abnormal excitement in the brain.

Alprazolam is also sometimes used to treat depression, fear of open spaces (agoraphobia), and premenstrual syndrome. This medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.
[[File:Alprazolam chemical structure.png|thumb|Chemical structure]]

==History==
Alprazolam is now part of Pfizer, but it was first released by Upjohn. It was covered under U.S. Patent 3,987,052, which was filed on October of 1969 and expired in September 1993. In the year 1981, Alprazolam was released. When it came out, the first approved indication was panic disordered. 

A young psychiatrist named David Sheehan suggested using the new distinction called DSM-III. Hence, DSM-III created in the classification of anxiety disorders between generalized anxiety disorders (GAD) and panic disorder in order to market alprazolam. In other words, this was a way for Sheehan to advertise the use of alprozolam. From his studies, Sheehen knew that panic disorder was both widespread among the populace and responsive to benzodiazepines. Therefore, he had an idea and suggested to Upjohn that marketing alproxolam for panic disorder would both cover new diagnostic territory and emphasize the unique potency of this drug. He was basically finding unique ways to show how great alprozolam is. 

As his clinical study continues, Sheehen describes how the first group of patients he tested with aplprozolam say how effective this drug was. They were basically all very impressed with the action that alprozolam carries. Several months later, when the United States Food and Drug Administration approved alprozolam, alprozolam was sold out quick and they made a great profit. However, similar to many other drugs out there many published reports in the medical literature state that taking alprozolam created severe withdrawal symptoms including psychoses, seizures, and intense rebound anxiety.

==Panic/Anxiety Disorders== 
Alprazolam is effective in relieving moderate to severe anxiety and panic attacks. It is no longer the first line of defense for these attacks due to concerns of tolerance, dependence, and abuse. Doctors limited Alprazolam for a patient from 4 to 10 weeks and is only allowed  to distribute the drug to those of no history of tolerance or dependence of any drug.
 
==Alprazolam and Pregnancy==
By taking Alprazolam while being pregnant has potential  risks. It can cause fetal drug dependence and withdrawal symptoms in the post-natal period. It can also cause neonatal flaccidity and respiratory problems. Alprazolam are known to excreted in human milk and passed down to the infants. Alprazolam causes the infants to lose weight and become lethargic.

==Mechanism of Action==
Alprazolam is a Central Nervous System drug from the benzodiazepine class of no known mechanism of action. It is predicted to have its effects through binding to different stereo-specific receptors in the CNS. Alprazolam has also been tested to show antidepressant properties, which isn't usually a common characteristic of regular benzodiazepine derivatives.

[[File:Side effects.png|thumb|Add caption here]]

==Side Effects==
Alprazolam can cause several side effects. The most common side-effects are:
# drowsiness
# light-headedness
# headache
# tiredness
# dizziness
# irritability
# talkativeness
# difficulty concentrating
# dry mouth
# increased salivation
# changes in sex drive or ability
# nausea
# constipation
# changes in appetite
# weight changes
# difficulty urinating
# joint pain

Besides these common side effects, it sometimes produces more side side effects such as:
# shortness of breath
# seizures
# seeing things or hearing voices that do not exist (hallucinating)
# severe skin rash
# yellowing of the skin or eyes
# depression
# memory problems
# confusion
# problems with speech
# unusual changes in behavior or mood
# thinking about harming or killing yourself or trying to do so
# problems with coordination or balance

==Food and Drug interactions==
Alprazolam is metabolized via CYP3A4. Inhibitors such as fluoxetine, ketoconazole, cimetidine, nedfazodone, ritonavir, propoxyphene, erthromycin, and itraconazole are all examples of combining CYP3A4 inhibitors. These inhibitors basically delay the hepatic clearance of alprazolam which create an excessive accumulation of alprazolam. 

Through the concomitant administration of alprazolam tablets in doses up to 4 mg/day, Imipramine and Desipramine both have been reported to increase an average 31% and 20%. It is also known that combined oral contraceptive pills reduce the clearance of alproxolam. This leads to the increased of plasma levels of alprozolam and accumulation. 

Furthermore, herb kava and alprazolam can have a great affect between each other when combined because it can result in the development of a semi-comatose state. Hypericum is a genus of about 400 species of flowering plants in the family Hypericaceae that can lower the plasma levels of alproxolam and reduce its therapeutic effect. However, looking at the big picture, alcohol is one of the most important and common interactions. This is due to the idea of combination. Alcohol and benzodiazepines such as alproxolam taken in combination have a synergistic effect on one another. Due to this reaction, it causes severe sedation, behavioral changes, and intoxication. Therefore, it is usually seen that the more alcohol and alprozolam taken, the worse the interaction will be.

      <comment>/* Reason of Drug Targeting and its Consequences */ typos</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">=Drug Targeting=
In order to delivery drug to the desired destination, targeting is an important subject in drug delivery. Ligand is a substance that forms a complex with a biomolecule to serve for a biological purpose. There are three classes of ligands that are commonly used for drug delivery targeting. Antibodies and/or antibody fragments, peptides, and aptamers. Depending upon the situation of targeting, different type of ligand is used.

==Reason of Drug Targeting and its Consequences==
Drug targeting can be defined as the method and efficiency of delivering drugs to a target organ or system.  Although this may seem like a simple process (just eat it or inject it into the blood right?), there are actually so many obstacles that have to be solved that it takes pharmaceutical companies years to develop one drug.   These challenges include if the drug actually makes it to the target organ, and if it makes it to the organ in significant amounts that would actually be of benefit.  
Its common knowledge that if drug is eaten, it'll eventually end up in the blood and go everywhere in the body.  What is not usually knows is if the drug is too thinly spread out over the body to be of any use, and the consequences of these drugs arriving at an non-target organ. 

The fact that drug concentrations could be diluted to the point where it has no effect could be linked to a pharmaceutical's attempt in finding out the dosage of this drug.  When testing a drug, scientists must find out how much of the drug could be administered to give a significant effect, while also testing for if increasing the dosage would increase the side effects.  A balance of these two must be met in order for a drug dosage to be determined.  Some variables would include the patient's body mass, age, blood levels, health of kidney and liver, and other medications the patient is taking.  All these factors would play a role in determining how much drug to administer to the patient.  If a patient has healthy liver, there's a good chance that a lot of the drug is going to be destroyed before it reaches the bloodstream.  If the patient has low amount of blood, not a lot of drug has to be administered because it wont be as diluted.  other medications the patient is taking could have chemical reactions that could lead to serious side effects.  Another factor to take into account is the chemical weight and properties of the drug.  If the drug has high molecular weight, not as much of the drug needs to be administered.  

Mainly, pharmaceuticals are more concerned with what would happen if a drug meant for the kidney ends up near the lungs, or something similar to this.  This could be called side effects.  Often this is solved by observing the carbohydrate chains on the surface of cell membranes to discover what receptors cells of specific organs have.  Developing a drug that fits into most of these receptors (a broad and commonly structured drug) would increase the chances of side effects.  It is therefore crucial to develop a drug that binds to a cell's receptor as specifically as possible to reduce side effects.  Discovering side effects and minimizing these side effects is a big part of getting a drug pass the examination tests and get on the shelves of pharmacies.(5)

=Anti-microbial drugs targeted at different levels=
==At cell membrane level==
Two drugs that target harmful microbes at the cell membrane level include polymyxins and nystatin. Polymyxins interfere with bacterial cell membrane, and therefore bacteria cannot function as osmotic barriers. The functional distinction between polymyxins and nystatin is that nystatin interferes with cell membranes of fungi and yeast whereas polymyxins disrupt bacterial cell membrane. Nystatin will bind to ergosterol, an essential component found in fungi cell membrane, which leads to cell membrane interruption that is representative with appearances of holes in the membrane.

=Other groupings of anti-microbial drugs by their targets=
==At DNA level==
Fluoroquinolones, or Cipro, inhibits synthesis of nucleic acids, such as DNA or RNA, by preventing gyrase, an enzyme needed for DNA replication, from unzipping. As a result, there is no DNA replication. Fluoroquinolones is broad-spectrum and extremely potent and thus can be used on difficult to treat bacteria, such as ''Bacillus anthracis'', which causes anthrax, and ''Pseudomonas aeruginosa''. Another anti-microbial drug that is targeted at the DNA level is rifampin, which is used to treat TB by inhibiting prokaryotic RNA polymerase, which in turn prevents transcription and therefore, no production of mRNA. The bacteria cannot live without these essential proteins.

==At protein synthesis level==
Linezolid, or Zyvox, disrupts the initiation of protein synthesis, and thus is used to treat MRSA, methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'', and VRE, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, which are two of the most difficult pathogens to treat. Other anti-microbials that target at the protein synthesis level include streptomycin, gentamycin, tetracyclines, and erythromycin.

Different administration of drugs is to enhance the drug effects on the body, depending on the symptom of the patient. Below is an illustration showing therapeutic window. The goal and the challenge of the researchers is to minimize the drug toxicity to the body and to maximize the drug activity inside the body.
In order to keep the drug concentration inside of blood at the therapeutic window, a sustainable drug release is desired. To achieve this, many nanotechnology drug platforms are available. The most common ones are liposomes and hydrogels.



===Hydrogel===
Hydrogel can encapsulate drugs inside its core. When the environment changes, the hydrogel is able to swell, which causes the release of drug.

====Types of hydrogel====

=====Acidic or basic hydrogel=====
	change in pH causes swelling causes release of drug

=====ionic hydrogel=====
	change in ionic strength causes change in concentration of ions inside the gel causes change in swelling causes release of drug

=====hydrogel containing electron-accepting groups=====
	Electron-donating compounds causes formation of charge and transfer complex causes change in swelling causes the release of drug.

=====Hydrogel containing immobilized enzymes=====
	A substrate is present, and enzymatic conversion causes the product the change and swell, which causes the release of drug.

=====Magnetic particles disperse in alginate microshapes=====
A magnetic field is applied to change the pores in gel to change in swelling and thus release of drug.

=====Thermoresponsive hydrogel=====
	A change in temperature causes change in polymer-polymer and water-polymer interactions that changes the shape of hydrogel and causes the release of drug.

=====Polyeeletrolyte hydrogel=====
	An electric field is applied that causes the membrane the charge and causes the electrophoresis of charged drug and change the shape of hydrogel to release the drug

=====Ethylene-vinyl alcohol hydrogel=====
	Untralsound irradiation is used to increase the temperature to cause the hydrogel to swell to release the drug.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==
Most of the vitamins are known to act as coenzymes. However, Vitamin D, also known as calciferol, do not behave as coenzymes. Instead, Vitamin D are known to regulate calcium and phosphate metabolisms. Through recent research, Vitamin D are known for preventing different cancers and cardiovascular disease, protecting against diabetes, and enhancing the ability of muscle works.  &lt;ref&gt;Berg, Jeremy M., John L. Tymoczko, and Lubert Stryer. Biochemistry. 7th ed. New York: W.H. Freeman, 2012. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Naturally, the best sources for vitamin D can be found in fatty fish like salmon and tuna and in fish liver oils. Smaller amounts of vitamin D can also be found in beef liver, cheese, and egg yolks. Vitamin D can also be taken in the form of supplements, either in the form D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. Most of people are attain their vitamin D through sunlight exposure. The UV-B radiation of sunlight penetrates the skin and converts 7-dehydrocholesterol to previtamin D3 which then becomes vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.

== Health effects of supplements ==
Up until today, the effects of vitamin D supplementation on health are uncertain. A United States Institute of Medicine (IOM) report states that outcomes that are related to disease such as cancer or diabetes could not be linked reliably with calcium or vitamin D intake. However, some researchers claimed that the IOM made a mistake when calculating the blood level of vitamin D associated with bone health. In return, the IOM members said that they used a standard procedure for dietary recommendations and that the result is just based on what they had in their data. Basically, many researchers use large scale of clinical trials to do research on vitamin D supplements. 

== Bone Health ==
Osteomalacia also known as rickets (when happen to children) are caused by vitamin D deficiency. Low serum vitamin D levels have been associated with falls, and low bone mineral density. The United States Preventive Services Task Force in the year of 2012 issued a draft statement conveying that there is not enough evidence to indicate that healthy postmenopausal women should use supplemental doses of calcium or vitamin D to prevent any fractures. 

However, there are also other studies that show that any supplementation containing vitamin D and calcium may improve bone mineral density. Supplementation containing vitamin D may also decrease the risk of falls and fractures in only certain groups of people and not all. Further studies, even proved that elders in the age of 65 may take these supplements and decrease the risk of fractures. However, there is not much evidence that can prove this actually works. In the end, it appears that without a good amount of calcium, the amount of vitamin D that a person consume is not enough to benefit the bone health.

== Mortality ==
Low blood levels of vitamin D are related with increased mortality. Elderly women that are giving supplementary vitamin D3 seems to decrease the risk of death. However, there are vitamins that are not seen effective. One such vitamin is vitamin D2, and other vitamins are like alfacalcidol and calcitriol. It is important to note that consuming vitamin D is good for the health, but an excess and a deficiency in vitamin D appear to cause abnormal functioning and premature aging.

== Cancer ==
Taking supplements containing vitamin D does not appear to help people with prostate cancer. However, there some cancers that are related to low vitamin D levels and with worse outcomes in other cancers. As of today, there is not enough evidence to support supplementation in those with cancer.

== Pregnancy ==
It is actually good for pregnant women to take a good amount of vitamin D because it will give positive immune effects. However, there are many women who are pregnant that does not take the recommended dose of vitamin D and this will definitely create a negative impact on the mother and her baby in the stomach.

== Multiple Sclerosis ==
Multiple sclerosis is related to low vitamin D. Although there are uncertainties, many supplementation that contains vitamin D may have a protective effect. 

The reason why vitamin D deficiency is thought to case multiple sclerosis is due to the following reasons:

*MS often increases with increasing latitude, which is strongly inversely correlated with duration and intensity of UVB from vitamin D concentrations and the sunlight.
*At higher latitudes in populations with high consumption of vitamin D (rich fatty fish), the prevalence of MS are lower than expected.
*With migration from high to low latitudes, MS risk decreases.

Since the year 2011, Vitamin D3 is tested to be as a treatment of Multiple Sclerosis.

== Synthesis ==
Vitamin D is synthesized from 7-dehydrocholesterol to calcitriol (1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol) in three different steps. The first process in this synthesis is by utilizing ultraviolet light to photolyze 7-dehydrocholesterol to previtamin D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. The second process occurs immediately when the previtamin D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; isomerizes to create vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, also known as Cholecalciferol. The last process occurs when vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (Cholecalciferol) goes through the process of hydroxylation reaction to form calcitriol (1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol). &lt;ref&gt;Berg, Jeremy M., John L. Tymoczko, and Lubert Stryer. Biochemistry. 7th ed. New York: W.H. Freeman, 2012. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
The images shown below indicate the process of synthesizing Vitamin D in three different steps:

[[File:Reaction - cholecalciferol to calcidiol.png|thumbnail|center]]
[[File:Reaction - calcidiol to calcitriol.png|thumbnail|center]]

7-Dehydrocholesterol is formed by enzymatic oxidation of cholesterol and has a conjugated diene unit in its B ring. 7-Dehydrocholesterol is present in the tissues of the skin, where it is transformed to vitamin D3 by a sunlight-induced photochemical reaction. Vitamin D 3 is a key compound in the process by which Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is absorbed from the intestine. Low levels of vitamin D 3 lead to Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; concentrations in the body that are insuffi cient to support proper bone growth, resulting in the bone disease called rickets.

[[File:1,7-shift of lumisterol to vitamin D2.png|thumb|right|7-Dehydrocholesterol is transformed to vitamin D 3 by a sunlight-induced photochemical reaction]]

== Deficiency of Vitamin D ==
Deficiency of Vitamin D may cause severe damages to both children and adults. Children should be aware of the disease known as rickets which is mainly caused by Vitamin D deficiency. The symptoms of rickets are deformation of skeletal bones which affects in impaired growth. Adults should be aware of the disease known as osteomalacia. Symptoms for osteomalacia is bending of bones due to its weakness. A primary way to escape from Vitamin D deficiency is through fortified foods. Milk is an excellent way to consume an acceptable portion of Vitamin D for our daily lives. &lt;ref&gt;Berg, Jeremy M., John L. Tymoczko, and Lubert Stryer. Biochemistry. 7th ed. New York: W.H. Freeman, 2012. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

People at risk of not getting enough vitamin D include: 
* breastfed infants - their vitamin D intake directly corresponds to their mother's vitamin D levels
* older adults - As they age their skin decreases in its efficiency to synthesize vitamin D. Also can be caused because they are more likely to stay indoors
* people with limited sun exposure - As UV rays from the sun are the main source for vitamin D, limiting the sun exposure can drastically decrease the vitamin D intake.
* dark-skinned people - The greater amounts of melanin reduces the skin's ability to produce vitamin D from sunlight.
* obese people - Those who are obese may need higher amounts of vitamin D than those who are not obese.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Overview ==
	Researchers initially thought that enzyme ERO1, endoplasmic reticulum oxidoreductin 1, couples oxygen reduction to ''de novo'' formation of disulfides, but it was recently discovered that mammals that are deficient in this enzyme still survive and form disulfides. This suggests that there exist alternative pathways to forming disulfides. Discoveries have found that peroxiredoxin 4 is involved in peroxide removal and disulfide formation. Many other different pathways for disulfide formation in the mammalian ER include quiescin sulfhydryl oxidase, ER-localized protein disulfide isomerase peroxidases and vitamin K epoxide reductase. These various pathways for forming disulfides are regulated by glutathione.
[[File:Disulfide-bond.png|thumb|Disulfide-bond]]

== Disulfide formation in the endoplasmic reticulum ==
Many important secretory and cell-surface proteins like antibodies, plasma membrane receptors and channels, extracellular matrix proteins, and blood clotting factors contain disulfide bonds because disulfides heighten protein stability and control redox-dependent functions. Disulfides in the endoplasmic reticulum undergo a procedure catalyzed by membranes of the PDI, protein disulfide isomerase, family and then undergo co-translational translocation to the ER. As the polypeptide starts to fold, cysteine residues that come into close contact form disulfides, even if they do not form in the end product. These disulfides that do not end up folding into the final product are sources of problems for misfolded proteins but may also serve as intermediates in normal folding processes. In order to obtain the final correctly folded disulfide, incorrectly folded disulfides must be disintegrated in a reaction catalyzed by the PDI family. The PDI family thus plays a vital role in the course for the correct formation and reduction of disulfides in order for proper folding of proteins that enter the endoplasmic reticulum

The correspondence of a disulfide between the enzyme and substrate is needed to cause a catalytic reaction to form a disulfide. Since PDI family members each accommodate at least one thioredoxin domain, a CXXC motif alternates between dithiol and disulfide states at their active site. When a disulfide is transferred to the substrate protein, a reduction of the active site occurs. It is necessary that the active site be deoxidized in order for the enzyme to carry out further oxidation.  It was initially thought that GSSG, glutathione disulfide, was relevant in how the active site is reoxidized. ''In Vitro'' experiments were conducted and showed that a GSH/GSSG ratio similar to that found in the endoplasmic reticulum would efficiently oxidize active site cysteines in PDI, thus transferring disulfides onto substrate proteins. These experiments didn’t show how disulfides were introduced ''de novo''. With the revelation of ERO1p, an enzyme in yeast called endoplasmic oxidoreduction, it was found that this enzyme was necessary for the formation of disulfide. ERO1p plays an important role in oxidizing PDI instead of secreting proteins or low-molecular-weight molecules like GSH and catalyzing oxidation by coupling ''de novo'' disulfide formation to the reduction of oxygen to hydrogen peroxide. While securely regulated in order to prevent overproduction of reactive oxygen species, ERO1 showed how disulfides could be formed ''de novo'' and also identified the ultimate electron acceptor for the pathway.

== Ero 1 is essential in yeast but not in higher eukaryotes ==
Knockout of the gene encoding ERO1p in various organisms showed different conclusions of its importance. When the gene encoding ERO1p was knocked out in yeast, it demonstrated its importance as an essential protein in yeast. Knockouts in higher eukaryotes showed different results. When knocked out in D. mlanogasterI, this led to a relatively mild phenotype with a certain problem in its folding of the cell-surface receptor Notch. Two ERO1 paralogs, pair of genes ERO1α and ERO1β, exist in mice and humans. When knocked out of ERO1 β, a defect in the folding of proinsulin occurred. ERO1α is thought to drive disulfide development in other tissues. It was found that a double knockout of ERO1α and ERO1β did not result in a more severe reaction than when ERO1 β is knocked out by itself. This showed that there existed an ERO1-independent pathway for the formation of disulfides in mammalian cells and double knockout cells helped re-establish normal endoplasmic redox conditions. 

== Potential pathways to generate disulfides ''de novo''  in the ER ==

&lt;u&gt;'''PRDX4'''&lt;/u&gt;

Since H2O2 is also generated when a reaction is catalyzed by ERO1, this indicates that additional proteins might be present in the endoplasmic reticulum to remove this reactive oxygen species. Enzymes called peroxiredoxins metabolize H2O2 ensuing disulfide formation. PRDx4 is active in both H2O2 removal and disulfide formation. Studies show a new responsibility for PRDx4 in de novo disulfide formation. Since PRDX4 and several PDI family members within the ER and equivalent, this shows that the enzyme is an abundant endoplasmic resident protein. Under circumstances where PRDX4 was efficiently reduced by some PDI family members during incubation of the two proteins at equal concentrations, some PDI protein was oxidized. This showed that even though GSH was a reductant on its own, when a PDI is included, the efficiency of PRDx4 reduction is enhanced. This proposes that disulfide exchanged between PRDx4 and GSH to form GSSP depends on the presence of PDI. If PRDX4 were to be reduced by PDI family members, a rapid disulfide formation in secretory proteins could occur. These results are confirmed by in vitro evidence. Since PRDX4 enhances a temperature-sensitive mutant of ERO1, viability and disulfide formation in yeast occurs at non-permissive temperatures. However, overexpression of PDI family members can also lead to decrease or increase in the ability of PRDX4 to be reduced in the endoplasmic reticulum. In conclusion, by combining the ERO1 and PRDX4 pathways, every oxygen molecule that is reduced causes two disulfides to be introduced, therefore making the whole process more effective than using ERO1 alone.

&lt;u&gt;'''GPX7 and GPX8'''&lt;/u&gt;

GPX7 and GPX8, homologous enzymes, belong to the family of thioredoxin GPX-like peroxidases that can also reduce H2O2. They are PDI peroxidases that couple the reduction of H2O2 to oxidation of certain PDI family members. In the presence of these GPXs, certain PDI family members are easily oxidized. With the presence of both GPX and PDI, oxidative refolding of a reduced model protein mediated by H2O2 proceeds faster. Physical associations between ERO1α and both GPXs in cells are shown by bimolecular fluorescence complementation. With the addition of GPX7, the in vitro rate of oxygen consumed by ERO1α increased, indicating a more efficient process in its presence. These biochemical results show an important role for GPX7 and GPX8 in disulfide formation. 

&lt;u&gt;'''QSOX'''&lt;/u&gt;

Erx2p, a sulfhydrl oxidase, when overexpressed could suppress the ero1-1 mutation. This different pathway shows that alternative proteins could potentially fulfill the essential function of ERO1 in yeast and other organisms. QSOX, a flavoprotein known to introduce disulfides into proteins in vitro, is similar to Erv2p. QSOX plays a part in catalyzing de novo disulfide formation by coupling disulfide oxidation to the reduction of oxygen in order to form H2O2. Unlike ERO1, which specially oxidizes only PDI family members, QSOX has a much broader substrate specificity that can introduce disulfides into protein substrates. However, PDI has the ability to greatly enhance native disulfide formation since QSOX cannot isomerize non-native disulfides. QSOX has the ability to complement Δero1 yeast strain when overexpressed. This indicates that QSOX is involved in disulfide formation when in vivo. When ERO1 and QSOX are both knocked down, a more severe phenotype occurs than when ERO1 is knocked down alone indicating that QSOX might provide some function when ERO1 is absent. QSOX currently remains a candidate for de novo disulfide formation independent of ERO1 due to its promiscuous substrate specificity and location in the secretory pathway. 

&lt;u&gt;'''VKOR'''&lt;/u&gt;

The VKOR enzyme exhibits another potential ERO1-independent pathway for disulfide formation . VKOR is a four transmembrane helix protein in the endoplasmic reticulum. VKOR functions by catalyzing the two steps in the reduction of vitamin K epoxide so as to generate vitamin K hydroquinone. When vitamin K epoxide is reduced, a CXXC motif in VKOR is then oxidized to form a disulfide bond. Members in VKOR family exchange this disulfide with thiredoxin-like oxidoreductases in order to oxidize substrate proteins. Since human VKOR does not contain a thioredoxin domain, PDI family members instead serve as VKOR substrates. WHen overexpression occurs with active-site CXXA mutants, VKOR can be trapped in a mixed-disulfide complex with PDI family members, mainly the transmembrane-bound TMX and TMX4. Results of these experiments show that VKOR sustaining disulfide formation is still unclear but proves a potential pathway.

==Relative contribution and interplay between oxidative pathways==

With all these potential pathways for disulfide formation, now their relative contribution has to be figured out. ERO1 pathway is an important pathway for disulfide formation under normal physiological conditions. TRDX4 hyperoxidation in cells expresses a deregulated form of ERO1 and shows that the enzyme is active in the ER and has the ability to produce hydrogen peroxide. Even though mammals do no necessarily need this pathway, if it didn’t exist, it would compromise disulfide formation. ERO1 is important in determining the redox status of PDI in cells and also forms mixed disulfides with PDI. This shows that ERO has the ability to oxidize PDI. If animals did not have ERO1 to survive and still formed disulfide-bonded proteins, this shows that other pathways exist. Their relative contributions still have to be explored.

	PRDX4-dependent pathway doesn’t provide a significant contribution to disulfide formation. If it did, it would be predicted that the Prdx4 knockout mouse should have a severe phenotype and even though the Prdx4 knockout mouse is viable, it is sterile due to oxidative stress in the testis. PRDX4 pathway is then determined to be crucial for correct function of specific tissues though not essential for survival. If there were a higher presence of PRDX4 in higher eukaryotes, it would show mild phenotypes of ERO1 knockouts as an alternative source of hydrogen peroxide that is available in order to make the PRDX4 pathway work. More research is needed to determine which sources provide the H2O2 necessary to drive disulfide formation. The importance of the PRDX4 pathway needs to be determined, even if PRDX4 provides an alternative pathway to ERO1 for disulfide formation. 

	An endogenous level, enzymes GPx7 and GPx8 cannot substitute for PrdxIV in ERO1 knockout cells. These enzymes could have a similar function to PRDX4. Research shows that proteins of the peroxiredoxin family have a higher rate of reactivity towards H2O2than GPXs. Evidence shows that interaction between Ero1α with the GPXs in vivo might compensate for their relatively slower rates of reactivity. Further understanding of their characterization is needed of the enzymes in order to explain their roles in de novo disulfide formation. Current research shows that the cellular function of VKOR in disulfide formation remains essentially uncharacterized. In VKOR, the mixed disulfide trapped with PDI family members does suggest a role in the process though. The pathway of oxidation of PDIs by VKOR being coupled strictly to γ-carboxyglutamate formation is not important due to its low flux. This would not be the case if the hydroquinone could be reoxidized through an alternative electron acceptor. This could bring about a more important role in the pathway.
	
As shown in vitro experiments, direct oxidation by H2O2 of cysteines in PDI and substrate proteins to form disulfides could potentially occur. Although, these pathways are shown to not be important due to faster kinetics of substrate refolding when the reaction mixture contains H2O2 and PDI family members together with either of the PDI peroxidases or PRDX4. Dehydroascorbate is an addition source of oxidizing equivalents in the ER. DHa can be moved into the ER from the cytosol, generated in the ER, and like H2O2, DHA directly oxidizes PDI and unfolds reduced proteins in vitro . Due to its slow rate, the former pathway is shown to not be a main route for the reduction of DHA. A faster pathway occurs with a faster PDI-independent oxidation of protein substrates.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
Transmucosal refers to the route of administration in which the drug is diffused through the mucous membrane. This can refer to inhalation, nasal, sublingual, vaginal, rectal, or ocular routes. 

==Insufflation==
Insufflation refers to the action of inhaling a substance. It is often used as a route for respiratory drugs that can treat sinus and lung conditions. This route of administration is typically used for psychoactive drugs due to the faster diffusion rates into the bloodstream and its capabilities of enabling the drug to bypass the blood-brain barrier. For this method, bioavailability is higher than the bioavailability for the oral route. Cocaine is a common drug that utilizes the route of insufflation. 

==Sublingual Administration==
Sublingual administration refers to the process of diffusing drugs into the blood by utilizing tissues beneath the tongue. Drugs that are designed for this route include barbiturates, enzymes, steroids, and cardiovascular drugs. Like the other transmucosal routes, the sublingual administration diffuses through the mucous membrane that is under the tongue. This process is more direct than the oral tract, thus lowering the risk of degradation due to salivary enzymes before entering the bloodstream.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Overview'''
Cdc48 is a hexamer protein that belongs to a group of enzyme called ATPase.  Past research has shown that it helps to control the quality of protein activities such as: endoplasmic reticulum associated protein degradation (ERAD), transcriptional and metabolic regulation, DNA damage response, and many more.  New research shows that Cdc48 regulates the degradation of damaged proteins by helping to store them in aggresome when the cell is under stress and later to destroy the damaged proteins.

Cdc48 is a hexamer protein.  It has central core with six protomers attached to it to form a ring.  The four domains that make up a protomers an amine terminus, AAA region (D1 and D2), and a carboxyl tail.  There are twelve ATPase active sites for ATP hydrolysis reaction.  When a hydrolysis reaction occurs, Cdc48 changes its shape by maneuvering the six protomers that allows for the opening and closing of the rings.  Furthermore, different temperatures allows for different parts of the domain to be more activity than others.  For example, D1domain works at its maximum at the 60˚C while D2 domain works better at 37˚C.  In addition, the conformation change is necessary because it affects the function of the protein.  If the protein does not work, it can result in a cell death.  Furthermore, the carboxyl tail can be phosphorylated and acetylated that will affect the protein’s ATPase activity, localization, and binding ability.

'''Function'''

	The function of Cdc48 depends heavily on its cofactor.  Each cofactor programs that protein to perform a specific function.  Meanwhile, the substrate-processing factor will bind to the protein to direct the protein’s path.  One of the best known functions of the protein is in endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation.  Cdc49 forms a complex with Udf1 and Np14, which then bind to an ERAD ubiquitylated substrate.  Consequently, this action causes a chain reaction that leads to the damaged proteins to be degraded in the proteasome.  Another role that Cdc48 takes part in is mitochondrial protein degradation.  Here, Vms1 replaces Ufd1 to form a complex with Cdc48.  When cells are exposed to rapamycin or hydrogen peroxide, this activates the Cdc48 to be moved to the mitochondrial membrane to degrade selected mitochondrial proteins in a process called UPS.  New research showed that a protein called E3 ligase Parkin and Cdc48 help to prevent damaged mitochondrial proteins from fusing with healthy ones.  Cdc49 also plays a role in cytoplasmic protein degradation.  Similar to ERAD, Cdc48 form the same complex.  However, its role differs by removing the ubiquitylated enzymes from the glucose-induced degradation deficient (Gid) complex to create loose ends so that the damaged proteins can go into the proteasome to be degraded.  In the nucleas protein degradation, Cdc48 complex helps to unfold and disassemble defected proteins with of its cofactors Ubx4 and Ubx5.  Ribophagy is another process that depends on Cdc48.  Here, mature ribosomes are degraded to make sure that the cell can survive.  Cdc49 pairs up with Ubp3 and Bre5 to deubiquitylate the ribosome.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Introduction=

RAGE is a central signaling molecule found in the immune system and is involved in enduring and complicating responses toward inflammation. RAGE is also a receptor for products of glycation and acts as a pattern recognition receptor that recognizes common characteristics instead of specific ligands. New information about RAGE’s extracellular structure led to this discovery. Experimental procedures of x-ray crystallography and NMR show that ligand binding is driven by electrostatic interactions between ectodomains and ligands, which are positively charged and negatively charged, respectively.

=RAGE and Inflammation=
[[File:PDB_8fab_EBI.jpg|thumbnail|RAGE is part of the immunoglobulin superfamily of cell surface receptors. ]]
This receptor, RAGE, is part of a superfamily of cell surface receptors known as immunoglobulin (Ig). It is a major molecule in the development of severe chronic diseases including diabetes, inflammation, atherosclerosis, neurodegeneration and even cancer. Animals that are healthy have low expressions of the RAGE molecule but expression increases as the state of health or a disease worsens. Increased expression in the RAGE molecule also increases the expression of ligands attached to the RAGE molecule. Examples of RAGE ligands include AGEs, which are advanced glycation end products and members of the S100 protein family. AGEs are also part of many other groups including the high mobility group protein box-1 (HMGB1), β amyloids, and fibrous protein aggregates. Attachment of ligands to RAGE receptors activates various signaling pathways that depend either on the ligand, environment or cell type. These pathways can be: 
*RAS-extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathways
*stress-activated protein kinase pathways
*p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathways 
*cAMP response to element-binding (CREB) protein 
*activation of transcription family (STAT3)

When an inflammation response is in process, the RAGE-ligand attachment leads to an increase in the expression of the RAGE molecule. This is a type of positive feedback loop that results in prolonged activation of NF-κB, which is a nuclear transcription factor allowing for the conversion of a positive inflammatory response into a chronic physiological state. Researchers of this phenomenon realize that in order to prevent the RAGE molecule from inhibiting inflammatory responses, the positive feedback loop created by the RAGE-ligand and RAGE molecule, should be disrupted by blocking the receptor-ligand interaction site. However, this would require extensive knowledge of the mechanism of RAGE-ligand interaction. 

=Structure=
X-Ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy have allowed for studying the structure of RAGE as well as the mechanism of RAGE-ligand recognition. RAGE has a large positive surface charge allowing it to create electrostatic traps for ligands that have negative charges. The molecular organization of RAGE plays an important role initiating signals for ligand interaction. By studying fluorescence-labeled receptors, it was evident that RAGE did not exist as a single molecule in the plasma membrane of cells but collects in assemblies of receptors.

RAGE has a single transmembrane helix that connects the ectodomain with the short cytoplasmic domain and an extracellular component that is required for the ligand to recognize and bind. This extracullar component has three immunoglobulin-like (Ig) domains. The N-terminal Ig domain is assigned to the V-set of Ig-like molecules and is known as the V domain of RAGE. The other two Ig domains are part of the C1 and C2 set. The N-terminal V domain is located far away from the plasma membrane but the C2 domain lies close to the membrane. V and C1 domains can be joined together to form an elongated structure. V and C1 domains can be fixed and become the VC1 domain, which can connect to the C2 domain by several amino acids that have no secondary structure, which allows the VC1 and C2 domains to link. NMR spectroscopy studies have shown that VC1 moves as a single unit and can combine with the C2 domain. 

The V domain consists a large amount of arginine and lysine, which carry positive charges at neutral pH. RAGE V domain has more arginine and lysine than the V-set of Ig domains. Arginine and lysine residues form large positively charged patches on the surface of V and C1 domains. Meanwhile, C2 domain has mainly acidic residues on its surface and is negatively charged. Because the two domains are oppositely charged, the extracellular component of RAGE is subdivided. This subdivision is reflected in the ligand binding properties of the different domains since ligands do not bind to C2 due to charge repulsion. Most ligands tend to bind to the V domain or the VC1 domain since ligands are negatively charged. There is only one case where a ligand has bound to the C2 domain. Nonetheless, charge-charge interactions are important for the formation of the receptor-ligand complex and suggested that the positively charged ligand-binding domain of the RAGE molecule can recognize certain arrangements of negative charges of ligands and can recognize these as common features for the ligands. 

 
=Receptor-ligand Interactions=
[[File:Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR).jpg|left||thumbnail|Surface Plasmon Resonance allowed for the revelation that ligands with multiple subunits have long periods of ligand-receptor interaction. ]]
Positron emission topography (in vivo) and in vitro have allowed for the study of binding of ligands. In vitro studies are conducted by monitoring the cellular response of RAGE ligands as well as protein-protein interactions. It was concluded that RAGE-ligand binding causes cells to respond immediately. Signaling of the ligand and its RAGE molecule increase in strength when the bonding affinity between the RAGE and ligand is high. The signal strength also increases when the signaling complex is activated for longer periods of time. There are two phases of the process of ligand binding. First, the dissociation phase reveals the lifetime of the signaling-competent complex. Ligands that dissociate slowly in vitro can induce longer and more intense receptor activations. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) is a method for observing these activations since it examines the real-time interaction of the receptor, which can become immobilized and its ligand, which can bind. The thermodynamics of binding including the affinity of the RAGE-ligand attraction as well as the kinetics of the dissociations can be observed. The SPR technique has also revealed that multimeric, or consisting of multiple subunits, ligands have prolonged periods of binding to their receptors.

=RAGE Ligands=
Rage ligands are very diverse and have common features that allow for the activation of the RAGE molecule. The following are examples of RAGE ligands: 
*AGEs (Advanced glycation endproducts)
These molecules are heterogeneous and are derived from the condensation and oxidation of proteins, peptides and sugars. The first step in forming AGE is the reaction of the aldehyde group of sugars with amine groups from lysine or arginine amino acids. This is a nonspecific and non-enzymatic process and it is called glycation. When glycation is high and frequent in individuals, it leads to diabetes and other complications. Oxidation of AGEs allows for the increase in overall negative charge on the ligand by carboxymethylation of the amino group. AGEs and RAGE have high affinities for one another and initiate a high level of endurance for pro-inflammatory responses. AGE and RAGE interaction has been observed as the main cause of diabetes complications and cardiovascular disorders.
*S100 Proteins 
This family of proteins includes more than 25 members and each displays different patterns and functions. These proteins are small and acidic and have two different calcium bindings that are connected by a flexible loop. S100 proteins form homodimers and sometimes heterodimers and oligomers such as tetramers and octamers. S100 proteins can be found in vertebrates mainly and are localized in the cytoplasm, acting as calcium sensors. These proteins can display intracellular calcium signaling and binding that causes the S100 proteins to change in conformation and shape. In the extracellular space, S100 proteins are loaded with calcium since the calcium concentration is high, so they can bind to RAGE easily.
*Amyloid β and amyloid fibrils
[[File:Abeta 2lfm.jpg|thumbnail|Beta Amyloid structure]]
Alzheimer disease is caused by the extracellular deposition of amyloid β peptide, originating from proteoloytic cleavage of amyloid precursor protein. Amyloid β peptides contains between 40 and 42 amino acids. These peptides have acidic and hydrophobic regions that are prone to accumulation of amyloid fibrils that build up amyloid plaques in the brain, causing Alzheimer’s disease. Mouse models of Alzheimer’s disease have shown that RAGE binds amyloid β and moves it around the blood stream to the blood-brain barrier in the central nervous system (CNS). Analyzing this using in vitro revealed that RAGE and amyloid β have high affinity for binding the soluble amyloid β peptide. RAGE can also bind amyloid fibrils.
*High mobility group box-1 protein (HMGB1)
[[File:Protein_HMGB1_PDB_1aab.png|left||thumbnail|Structure of high mobility group box-1 protein (HMGB1)]]
This protein has an extracellular regulatory function and acts as a proinflammatory activator. HMGB1 has three domains: two N-terminus domains that are involved in DNA binding and one C-terminus domain that consists of various acidic amino acids as well as directs the binding to the RAGE molecule. HMBG1 binds to RAGE and Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9), which forms the HMGB1-RAGE-TLR9 complex that activates B cells. DNA can bind with RAGE with high affinity and form a stable complex without the HMGB1 protein, but DNA-RAGE interaction has not produced noticeable results yet. 

=Ligands and their Common Features=
RAGE can recognize common characteristics in different ligands. RAGE ligands have a net negative charge at their surfaces. They also usually have neutral pH, but S100 proteins have acidic pH.  Also, AGEs do not usually have their surfaces negatively charged until they transform during glycation and oxidation. Most ligands also oligomerize. AGE modifies proteins, which leads to covalent bonds to higher molar mass molecules. S100 proteins also form large assemblies of tetramers or octamers.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Overview'''
Cdc48 is a hexamer protein that belongs to a group of enzyme called ATPase.  Past research has shown that it helps to control the quality of protein activities such as: endoplasmic reticulum associated protein degradation (ERAD), transcriptional and metabolic regulation, DNA damage response, and many more.  New research shows that Cdc48 regulates the degradation of damaged proteins by helping to store them in aggresome when the cell is under stress and later to destroy the damaged proteins.

      <text xml:space="preserve">All the different membranous organelles perform different tasks in the cell (animal cells and plant cells). However, they also communicate with each other though ions and lipids. In addition, some of the organelles have membrane that are connected. The others are related by transfer of membrane segments. As we know, structures determine functions in a lot of ways in nature. We can categorize eukaryotic organelles into four categories according to their general functions.

=== Manufacturer ===
In this first category, nucleus, ribosomes, rough ER, smooth ER and golgi apparatus are included. They can perform this task because of they have metabolically active membranes. Some of them can also perform transportation of the products. Below is some examples of the manufacturing task these organelles do.
* Nucleus--DNA and RNA synthesis
* Ribosome--Polypeptide(protein) synthesis
* Rough ER--Membrane protein synthesis, secretory proteins synthesis and hydrolytic enzymes synthesis; formation of transport vesicles
* Smooth ER--Lipid synthesis; detoxification and carbohydrate metabolism in liver cells
* Golgi apparatus--Modificaiton, temporary storage and transportation of macromolecules such as proteins; formation of lysosomes and transport vesicles

=== Waste disposer ===
In this category, lysosomes, peroxisomes and vacuoles are included. They are all consist of single membrane sac that can be used to collect materials and/or break down unwanted/harmful materials.
* Lysosomes--Digestion of bacteria, damaged organelle
* Peroxisomes--breakdown of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by-product
* Vacuoles--Digestion of waste products; collect excess water from the cell

=== Energy provider ===
In this category, chloroplasts and mitochondria are included. They both have metabolically active membranes and intermembrane compartments that can convert energy units to provide to the cells.
* Chloroplast--Conversion of light energy to chemical energy in plant cells
* Mitochondria--Conversion of chemical energy of food to chemical energy of ATP

=== Support, Movement and Communication between cells ===
In this last category, cytoskeleton(such as cilia, flagella and centrioles in animal cells), cell walls(in plants, fungi and some protists), extracellular matrix(in animal cells) and cell junctions are included. They are all responsible for the keeping cells in shape.
* Cytoskeleton--Maintenance of cell shape; movement of organelles within cells; cell movement; mechanical transmission of signals from exterior of cell to interior
* Cell walls--Maintenance of cell shape and skeletal support; surface protection; binding of cells in tissue
*Extracellular matrix--Binding of cells in tissues; surface protection; regulation of cellular activities
* Cell junctions--Communication between cells; binding of cells in tissues

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Brief History ==
Finding a cure for cancer has always been a goal for many health care professionals.  Many have tried, but few have made as much of a stride as Dr. Antonio Grillo-López.  He, along with several colleagues, pioneered a new drug named rituximab that serves as the first FDA approved antibody to treat cancer.  Depending on the severity of the cancer, this drug could either completely treat or extend the lifetime of the patient.  This extraordinary feat had very humble beginnings.
&lt;br /&gt;
== The Man Behind the Drug ==
Dr. Grillo-López has his roots in Puerto Rico.  Growing up, he received both his Bachelor of Science and Doctor of Medicine degrees at the University of Puerto Rico, San Juan.  He served as an associate professor at the University of Michigan from 1980 to 1990.  He was also a part of DuPont-Merck Pharmaceuticals Parke Davis.  He was later offered a position at, what was then, a start-up company named IDEC.  Dr. Grillo-López acted as Chief Medical Officer from November 1992 to January 2001 at the company.  Later, he acted as Chief Medical Officer Emeritus from January 2001 to November 2003.  It was at this company where rituximab came to fruition.
&lt;br /&gt;
== About the Drug ==
Rituximab is a liquid drug that is administered into patients’ veins.  It is used in the treatment and care of patients with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, rheumatoid arthritis, Wegener’s granulomatosis, and microscopic polyangiitis.  Dosage can vary depending on the desired treatment.  For example, in rheumatoid arthritis patients, it is given as two doses two weeks apart.  But in non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, it is given once a week for four to eight weeks.  In the United States, it carries a trade name of Rituxan.  In Europe, it is offered as MabThera.  The main focus will be on non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, or NHL.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
NHL is a term that encompasses all lymphomas except for Hodgkin’s lymphoma.  Hodgkin’s lymphoma is distinguished by the presence of binucleate giant cells known as Reed-Sternberg cells.  Lymphoma is a cancer of the lymphocytes in blood.  Lymphocytes are a type of white blood cells that serve an integral part of the human immune system.  They are classified into B cells, T cells, and natural killer cells.  In NHL patients, an antigen known as CD20 is found on B cells.  The rituximab antibody binds to the CD20 antigen and destroys excess, overactive, or dysfunctional B cells as a result of the disease.
&lt;br /&gt;
== Attacking the Cell ==
Rituximab kills cancerous B cells via three main mechanisms: complement-dependent cytoxicity (CDC), antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytoxcity (ADCC), and apoptosis.  CDC occurs when a large group of plasma proteins (complement) work together to destroy invading pathogens and malignant cells.  Antibody-antigen complexes, such as the one between rituximab and CD20, activate the complement.  The complement protein C1 binds to the tail of the rituximab antibody in a “lock and key” fashion and starts a series of reactions that creates a membrane attack complex lining the B cell membrane and then creating a pore to allow the cellular contents to escape and eventually die.  ADCC is a process where the antibody-antigen complex forms and then attracts other components of the immune system, including natural killer cells.  The receptors on these cells recognize and bind to the tail of the rituximab antibody.  The natural killer cells also carry granules filled with cytotoxic molecules.  When the granules are released after the natural killer cells bind with rituximab, they penetrate the cellular membrane of the B cell and cause pores that facilitate the release of cellular content leading to the cell’s death.  The granules can also destroy the cells by attacking the nucleus.  The final mechanism is known as apoptosis, or programmed cell death.  Apoptosis is defined the death of cells that occurs as a normal and controlled part of an organism’s growth or development.  When rituximab bonds to CD20 and forms the antibody receptor complex, it signals the cell to start the process.  The cytoskeleton collapses upon itself, the nucleus condenses, and the DNA fragments into small pieces via enzymes.  Membrane-bound vesicles are also shredded.  At the end of apoptosis, the cell has effectively destroyed itself.  It is still unclear, however, whether these mechanism act independently or in concert.  Despite this, rituximab still proves to be an effective cure.
&lt;br /&gt;
== Experiments Involved ==
The rituximab antibody was created after several experiments involving mice.  Three mice were injected with cells from a lymphoma tumor.  These malignant cells carried the CD20 antigen that is found only on B cells.  Observations revealed that the mice’s immune system had produced antibodies to fight these foreign substances.  The tail of the antibody is humanized.  Mice and human gene sequences were used together to create the chimeric antibody that is rituximab.
&lt;br /&gt;
== Pathway to Success ==
Dr. Grillo-López accredits much of his success to the 1908 Nobel Prize winner Paul Ehrlich.  The late Paul Ehrlich was a German scientist who had experience in the fields of hematology, the study of the physiology of blood, and immunology.  His work in the latter field gained him the joint Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1908 with Ilya Ilyich Mechnikov.  Ehrlich popularized the concept of a drug that would act as a “magic bullet.”  This meant that a drug would be able to selectively target a disease-causing organism.  This way a toxin could be made to be delivered to only that organism.  This is the basis of Dr. Grillo-López’s work.  The rituximab works by selectively binding to the CD20 antigen and forming the antibody receptor complex that is a vital part of the mechanisms used to destroy infected B cells.  Ehrlich had said that success in research is only attainable with several big “G’s”.  In German, these are Geduld, Geschicklichkeit, Glück, Geld, and Geräte.  These translate to persistence and determination, skill, luck, money, and tools, respectively.  The story behind the approval process for this cure shows the influence Ehrlich had on Dr. Grillo-López.
&lt;br /&gt;
== Speed Bumps along the Road ==
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, is an agency that is responsible for protecting public health by passing and enforcing laws and regulations regarding products such as foods and drugs.  All drugs must go through their approval process.  Dr. Antonio Grillo-López likens them to the pace of snails and considers them to be “the single most important obstacle to the timely development and approval of anti-cancer agents.”  He cites examples such as the five-month-review to simply approve the proposed name for rituximab.  PanThera was not approved and had to be revised to Rituxan for the U.S. markets and MabThera for European markets.  During the pre-digital age, where digital books and social networking site were unavailable, everything had to be done manually.  Dr. Grillo-López and his IDEC colleagues, Chet Varns, Alice Wei, and John Leonard, had to send in boxes upon boxes to the FDA for them to review and approve the use of rituximab.  In the data set, there was one patient who the group at IDEC considered to not be evaluable due to some minor errors.  To present an obstacle to the approval process, an FDA medical reviewer asked them to consider that patient as evaluable now.  This only worked in favor of the drug creators because that particular patient had a complete response to the drug.  This increased both the overall response rate (ORR) and complete response (CR) rate.  The team sent in their biologics license application and it was finally approved after a slow nine months on November 26, 1997.  After this, Dr. Grillo-López and his colleagues still faced some obstacles such doubts that a proposed study of using rituximab as part of a combination regimen known as R+CHOP instead of the traditional method of using antibodies following chemotherapy, not in conjunction, would be effective.  Despite these doubts, the combination regimen proved to be a cure for NHL.  Dr. Grillo-López was persistent and determined according to the philosophies of Paul Ehrlich, leading to his success in finding an effective cure for cancer.
&lt;br /&gt;
== End Result ==
Several milestones were achieved during its development.  Clinical trials were completed in record time by patients who would volunteer and even dress up as a mouse, harkening back to the chimeric nature of the antibody.  Ritxuimab became the first FDA approved antibody to treat cancer.  Dr. Grillo-López even paved the way for quicker FDA approvals.  Before, the FDA would take an average of seven years to approve a drug that many patients needed sooner.  He was able to reduce that approval timeframe in half.  The 2004 Discovery Health Channel’s Medical Honors recognized some of these achievements.  Rituximab’s development did not rely on government support.  Investors and partners funded the entire project.  No federal or state grants or incentives or research funding were involved either.
&lt;br /&gt;
== Impact ==
The impact that rituximab had is unprecedented.  It provides a cure for curable lymphomas such as diffused large cell lymphoma.  The lifetime of patients with incurable lymphomas have been extended.  Recent numbers further demonstrate the success of rituximab.  It has been considered the top anticancer drug in the world since 2001.  Sales in 2010 alone totaled $6.7 billion.  Each year, around 50,000 lymphoma patients are cured.  Since its introduction in 1997 until 2010, over two million patients have been treated.  Prior to this discovery, there has been a long of stagnation in finding cures or ways to extend lifetimes.  Hopefully the success of Dr. Antonio Grillo-López will inspire others to follow in his footsteps.  He, himself, has said that he is neither a saint nor a magician.  Geduld led to his success, something that can be replicated by any ordinary person with persistence and determination.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==INTRODUCTION==
Mellitus diabetes is categorized as a group of chronic (lifelong) diseases in which high levels of sugar (glucose) exist in human blood.  It is the 9th leading cause of death in the world, killing more than 1.2 million people each year.  Diabetes is categorized in many groups: type 1, type 2, gestational, prediabetes and a few more.  However, the two main groups are type 1 and type 2, type 2 being more common.  Different symptoms correlate to different types of diabetes, but generally, diabetes exhibit similar symptoms such as the following:


&lt;br&gt;Type 1 Symptoms include:
&lt;br&gt;- Frequent urination
&lt;br&gt;-  Unusual thirst
&lt;br&gt;- Extreme hunger
&lt;br&gt;- Unusual weight loss
&lt;br&gt;- Extreme fatigue and irritability
&lt;br&gt;Type 2 Symptoms include:
&lt;br&gt;- Any of the type 1 symptoms
&lt;br&gt;- Frequent infections
&lt;br&gt;- Blurred vision
&lt;br&gt;- Cuts/bruises that are slow to heal
&lt;br&gt;- Tingling/numbness in the hands/feet
&lt;br&gt;- Recurring skin, gum, or bladder infections


Many complications arise and are caused by diabetes.  People may experience problems in their vision which potentially leads to blindness, numbness in their feet and hands, especially in the legs, hypertension (high blood pressure), their mental health, hearing loss, and others that are gender related.  Although there is no cure for type 1 diabetes, maintaining an idea body weight with an active lifestyle and a healthy diet can prevent and sustain type 2 diabetes.

==TYPE 1 DIABETES==
In type 1 diabetes, the pancreas fails to produce little or no insulin.  Insulin is a hormone that is produced by beta cells located in the pancreas.  It functions as a transporter of sugar (glucose) into cells throughout the body.  Glucose travels through the hemoglobin, an enzyme found in blood, and is stored away and later used for energy by the body’s organs.  The failure to produce insulin results with a lack of an appropriate amount needed for the human body to function at a normal pace.  Without enough insulin, sugar accumulates in the bloodstream, thus raising the blood’s sugar level – this event is called hypertension.
	
There is no exact cure for type 1 diabetes and the exact cause is still unknown.  Researchers believe it is an autoimmune disorder, a condition in which the immune system mistakenly damages healthy tissues.  In this case, the pancreas would have been attacked, preventing its function to produce insulin.  Type 1 diabetes shows hereditary correlation, meaning this disease can be passed down through families.  Also, the adolescent group is the most often diagnosed group of people.  

==TYPE 2 DIABETES==
In type 2 diabetes, fat, liver, and muscle cells become insulin resistant.  Those cells do not respond to insulin correctly and fails to obtain the sugar (glucose) that is being transported.  Because glucose is crucial for the cells’ functions, the pancreas would sustain the equilibrium.  That means, if the cells do not intake the glucose, the pancreas would automatically create more insulin to make sure the cells have enough.  The remaining sugar in the bloodstream would accumulate, resulting with hyperglycemia.  

Maintaining a healthy diet is essential in preventing type 2 diabetes.  Low activity level, poor diet, and excess body weight increases the risk of type 2 diabetes because increased fat levels slows down the ability to properly use insulin.

==Treatment==
Although there is no known cure for diabetes, it can be managed with certain precautions. 

===Type 1 &amp; 2 Diabetes Management===
Those with type 1 &amp; 2 diabetes, who want to maintain a healthy lifestyle, exercising regularly and maintaining a healthy weight, eating healthy foods, and most importantly monitoring their blood sugar levels.

Diabetics should try to maintain their blood sugar levels between these readings:
Daytime glucose levels: between 80 and 120 mg/dL (4.4 to 6.7 mmol/L)
Nighttime glucose levels: between 100 and 140 mg/dL (5.6 to 7.8 mmol/L)

People with type 1 diabetes need insulin to survive, therefore, they typically inject themselves with insulin using either a fine needle and syringe, an insulin pen,or an insulin pump.

==TESTING==
To determine if one is diagnosed with diabetes, a few tests must be done.  

- Fasting Blood Glucose	(Type 1, 2) - Blood test must be higher than 126 mg/dL twice

- Random (nonfasting) Blood Glucose (Type 1) -	Blood test is higher than 200 mg/dL -	Must be confirmed with fasting test

- Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (Type 1, 2) - Blood level is higher than 200 mg/dL after 2 hours

- Hemoglobin A1c (Type 1, 2) - Normal: &lt;5.7% - Pre-diabetes: between 5.7%-6.4% - Diabetes: &gt;6.5%

- Ketone (Type 1) - Done with urine or blood sample (If sugar level is &gt; 240 mg/dL, when ill (ex. pneumonia, stroke, etc.), when nauseated, vomiting, when pregnant) 

==STATISTICS==

Out of 25.8 million people in the United States, 8.3% of all children and adults are diagnosed with diabetes.  It is the leading cause of nontraumatic lower-limb amputations, kidney failure, and blindness in the United States and contributes greatly to heart disease and stroke.

==CLINICAL RESEARCH==
Currently, thousands of laboratories are focusing on the study of diabetes: type 1, type 2, its relationship with heart, kidney diseases, obesity, and many more.  

One specific research was done by Karolina I. Woroniecka and company in the Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva University.  Their topic mainly focuses on the relationship between diabetes and kidney failure, known as diabetic kidney disease (DKD), which is the prominent cause of kidney failures in the United States.  The research topic is called “Transcriptome Analysis of Human Diabetic Kidney,” and was published in September 2011.  Its objective was to provide a collection of gene-expression changes in human diabetic kidney biopsy samples after being treated.  Gene-expression is defined as the translation of information from a gene into a messenger RNA and then to a protein.  Transcriptome analysis is often used to obtain insight into disease pathogenesis, molecular classification, and the identification of biomarkers, indicates the presence of some sort of phenomenon, used for future studies and treatments.  This study was able to catalog gene expression regulation, identify genes and pathways that may either play a role in DKD or serve as biomarkers.

44 dissected human kidney samples were used in this experiment, portioned out according to their racial status and glomerular filtration rate (25-35 mL/min).  A glomeruli is a cluster of capillaries around the end of a kidney tubule.  Their method included a series of statistical equations to identify expressed transcripts found in both the control and the diseased samples.  Also, algorithms helped the study by defining the regulated pathways.   
  
The human kidneys were obtained from donors and leftover portions of kidney biopsies.  The samples were manually microdissected and only the samples without any degradation were further used through the amplification of the RNA.  Before any treatment, the raw samples were normalized using the RMA16 algorithm.  Its purpose is to obtain a stabilized set of data and reduce any inconsistencies in their patterns.  This is where the Benjamin-Hochberg testing was used at a p value &lt; 0.05.  After, the oPOSSUM software determines the overrepresented transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) within a catalog of coexpressed genes and is then compared to a control set.  The differentially expressed transcripts that comply with the statistical conditions undergo analysis that uses a ratio to determine the top canonical pathways – the Fischer exact test is used at p value &lt; 0.05.  Immunostaining is a major component in the visualization and final step of the procedure.  This procedure requires the use of a specific antibody to detect a specific protein in a sample.  The following primary antibodies were used: C3, CLIC5, and podocin.  The Vectastain ABC Elite kit was used for the secondary antibodies to bind to the proteins and then, 3,3”diaminobenzidine was applied for visualizations.  Immunostaining is typically scored on a scale of 0-4, correlating to the amount of activity on that specific protein.    

Results from this experiment identified 1,700 differently expressed probesets in DKD glomeruli and 1,831 probesets in diabetic tubuli (seminiferous tubules); probeset is a collection of more than two probes and is designed to measure a single molecular species.  There were 330 probesets that were commonly expressed in both compartments.  Pathway analysis emphasized the regulation of many genes that factored into the signaling in DKD glomeruli.  Some molecules included Cdc42, integrin, integrin-linked kinase, and others.  Strong enhancements for the inflammation-related pathways were shown in the tubulointerstitial compartment.  Lastly, the canonical signaling pathway was regulated in both the DKD glomeruli and tubuli, which are associated with increased glomerulosclerosis.  

With ongoing research about diabetes-linked diseases, results that are obtained contribute to the overall understanding of the biochemical processes and issues.  Dr. Karolina I. Woroniecka and company are one of the many research teams throughout the world that dedicate their jobs to saving or improving people’s well-being.  This study is one of the many that contribute to the complications of diabetic-related kidney diseases.  However there are many more studies that relate to diabetes, such as obesity and heart attack/failure.

Hiroaki Masazuki and company conducted a project relating obesity and diabetes, “Glucose Metabolism and Insulin Sensitivity in Transgenic Mice Overexpressing Leptin with Lethal Yellow Agouti Mutation.”  This article was published in August 1999 from the Department of medicine and Clinical Sciences, Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine at Kyoto, Japan.  The objective of this research project was to determine the usefulness of leptin for the treatment of obesity-related diabetes.  Leptin is an adipocyte-derived blood-borne satiety factor that increases glucose metabolism by decreasing food intake and increasing energy expenditure.  Two different types of mice were crossed and examined at weeks 6 and 12 during the experiment.  The first type was a transgenic skinny mice overexpressing leptin breed, with allele Tg/+, and the second is a lethal yellow KKAy mice, commonly used as models for obesity-diabetes syndrome, with allele Ay/+.  The F1 animals’ metabolic phenotypes were examined, noting everything from body weight to their sensitivity of insulin and concentrations of leptin.  This study was able to demonstrate the potential usefulness of leptin along with a long-term caloric restriction for the treatment of obesity-related diabetes.  It demonstrated that hyperleptinemia can delay the onset of impaired glucose metabolism and hasten the recovery from diabetes during caloric food restriction in the crossed F1 bred mice, Tg/+ and Ay/+.  Hyperleptinemia is defined as increased serum leptin level.      

Although leptin may have been found to be potentially useful in treating diabetes, the fact that a caloric food restriction is required suggests that leptin can stimulate glucose metabolism independent of body weight.  Other studies have demonstrated that leptin stimulates glucose metabolism in normal-weight nondiabetic mice and also improves impaired glucose metabolism in over-weight diabetic mice with leptin deficiency.  Masazuki and company have created transgenic mice models overexpressing leptin (allele Tg/+) that exhibit insulin sensitivity and increased glucose tolerance.  A liver-specific promoter controls the overexpression of leptin and insulin sensitivity results with the activation of signaling in the skeletal muscle and liver.  In this study, Masazuki and company genetically crossed the transgenic mice and lethal yellow obese mice.  The resulting 4 genotypes are: Tg/+: Ay/+, Tg/+, Ay/+, and wild-type +/+.  When at week 6, all the mice were at normal body weight and at week 12, the mice with the Ay/+ allele clearly developed obesity.  At 9 weeks, +/+, Ay/+, and Tg/+: Ay/+ were placed on a 3 week food restriction diet and analyzed at week 12.

The research design and methods include: measurements of body weight and cumulative food intake, plasma leptin, glucose, and insulin concentrations, glucose and insulin tolerance tests, and caloric food restriction experiments and later statistical analysis were done.  Body weights were measured daily since the mice were 4 weeks old and food intake was measured daily over a 2-week period.  Blood was sampled from retro-orbital sinus of mice at 9:00AM.  Plasma leptin concentrations were determined using radioimmunoassay (RIA) for mouse leptin.  Insulin and plasma glucose concentrations were determined by the glucose oxidase method with a reflectance glucometer.  The glucose tolerance tests (GTT) were done after an 8 hour fast and injections of 1.0 mg/g glucose.  The insulin tolerance tests (ITT) were done after a 2 hour fast and injection of 0.5 mU/g insulin.  The blood was then drawn from the mice tail veins at periodic times after injection at 15, 30, 60, and 90 minutes and blood was drawn from before the injections to measure comparable results.  The food restriction experiment was based off of the cumulative food intake at week 12.  The mice were then provided with 60% of the amount of food consumed.  The exact same tests were measured: plasma leptin, glucose, and insulin concentrations were also determined; GTT and ITT were also done.  At the end, all these data were analyzed and expressed at ±SE.  
	
The results identified a large difference in body weights with the four genotypes.  At week 4, all the mice showed no significant difference in body weight.  At week 6 of age, Tg/+ mice gained approximately 20-30% less weight than the control +/+ mice and indicated a sign of developing adiposity compared to +/+, Tg/+: Ay/+, and Ay/+ mice.  At this time, the control, Tg/+: Ay/+, and Ay/+ mice showed no drastic difference in body weights.  However, by week 12 of age, the mice with the Ay/+ allele developed obese.  As for plasma leptin concentrations, 6 week old Tg/+ mice were approximately 12 times those of the control +/+ mice, at week 12, they were 9 times higher.  The concentrations in Ay/+ and +/+ mice were roughly equivalent.  The concentrations of Tg/+:Ay/+ mice were 8 times higher than those of the +/+ mice and at week 12, they were higher than the Ay/+.  At week 12, the body weight of Tg/+ was ~23% less than the control’s.  The food intake of Tg/+ reduced significantly after 6 and 12 weeks of age compared to the control litter.  The food intake of Ay/+ mice increased by 50% compared to the control litter.  The food intake of Tg/+: Ay/+ mice, compared to the +/+ mice, were roughly the same.  The food intake of Ay/+ and Tg/+: Ay/+ were approximately the same.  At week 6, the plasma glucose concentrations among all 4 genotypes were the approximately the same.  At week 12, the glucose levels of Tg/+ and +/+ mice were the same.  However, the glucose level of Ay/+ and Tg/+: Ay/+ elevated significantly compared to the control but compared to each other, they were the same.  As for plasma insulin concentration levels, the Tg/+ mice greatly decreased compared to the control at week 6.  The plasma insulin concentrations in Tg/+: Ay/+ mice were higher than the control.  At this point, the Ay/+ mice demonstrated marked hyperinsulinemia compared to the rest of the genotypes.  GTTs and ITTs showed that the plasma glucose elevation is significant in Tg/+ compared to the control.  30 minutes after the injection, the glucose concentrations increased greatly in Ay/+ mice compared to the control.  

The genotypes’ glucose metabolisms were examined after their food restriction.  60% of their total food intake were given to these mice and after 2 weeks, the body weights of Tg/+ were 17% less and +/+ were 12% less compared to before and the Ay/+, Tg/+: Ay/+ body weights also decreased.  The plasma leptin concentrations in Tg/+ mice were higher than those in +/+ mice and Tg/+:Ay/+ were higher than those of Ay/+.  The leptin concentrations between Tg/+ compared to Tg/+:Ay/+ and those of +/+ and Ay/+ were approximately the same.  After 3 weeks of food restriction, the plasma glucose concentrations among +/+, Ay/+, and Tg/+:Ay/+ were similar.  The plasma insulin concentrations, however, in Ay/+ mice were higher than those of +/+ and Tg/+:Ay/+ mice.  

The results indicated that glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity are increased in Tg/+:Ay/+ mice and plasma leptin concentrations in Tg/+:Ay/+ are higher than regular Ay/+ mice.  These indicate that overproduction of leptin can prolong the start of impaired glucose metabolism in Tg/+: Ay/+ mice and endogenous leptin cannot in Ay/+ mice.  Leptin can apply its anti-diabetic effect in normal weight animals at week 6. At week 12, Tg/+:Ay/+ mice developed resistance to the anti-diabetic action of leptin.  In this study, glucose metabolism is somewhat improved in Ay/+ after a long term body weight reduction due to the 3 week food restriction while the metabolism is improved in Tg/+:Ay/+ compared to Ay/+ and control which suggests that hyperleptinemia enhances glucose level when body weight is stable.  Persistent hyperleptinemia delays the beginning of impaired glucose metabolism and quickens the recovery from diabetes in Ay/+ mice in combination with food restriction.

Emilie Vander Haar and her team in the University of Minnesota Minneapolis studied “Insulin signaling to mTOR mediated by the Akt/PKB substrate PRAS40.”  In this study, they were able to identify PRAS40 as a crucial regulator of insulin sensitivity of the Akt-mTOR metabolic pathway which can potentially help target the treatment of cancers, insulin resistance, and hamartona syndromes.  Insulin activates the protein kinases Akt, also known as PKB, and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) which stimulates protein synthesis and cell growth.  This study was able to identify PRAS40 as a unique mTOR binding partner and is induced under conditions that inhibit mTOR signaling.  Akt phosphorylates PRAS40, which is crucial for insulin to stimulate mTOR.  These findings contribute to the clinical studies of type 2 diabetes insulin related pathways.

mTOR is a kinase-related protein that is a key mediator of insulin.  Inhibition of mTOR in mammals proves to reduce insulin resistance and extend lifespan.  mTORC1 is a nutrient and insulin regulated complex that is formed from mTOR when it interacts with raptor and a G-protein.  This complex is involved in the cytoskeleton regulation and Akt phosphorylation; however the interactions and associated proteins in response to insulin have not been identified.  In order to do so, Haar and her team used a mass spectroscopy method.  An mTOR antibody prepared mTOR immunoprecipitates from T-cells and the proteins that were bound to the regulator were eluted from the precipitates.  The mixtures of proteins were trypsinized and the mass spectra were obtained.  The highest P scores obtained from the derived peptides illustrated that mass spectroscopy isolated mTOR-binding proteins.  Three sequences were obtained and contributed to the finding that Sin1 is crucial in the formation of the mTOR interaction.  The PRAS40 peptide sequence was also identified.  However, in order to confirm the hypothesis that mTOR binds with PRAS40, T-cells’ precipitates, which carries PRAS40, were analyzed using western blotting.  Compared to the control, PRAS40 was found to bind only with mTOR and nothing else.  It was shown that PRAS40 binds specifically in the mTOR carboxy-terminal kinase domain.  Certain conditions inhibit mTOR signaling increases affinity, binding abilities, of the PRAS40 mTOR interaction.  These conditions include depriving leucine or glucose from the media solution, treatment with the glycolytic inhibitor and mitochondrial metabolic inhibitors.  The increase in affinity leads to disrupting the raptor-mTOR interaction, which results with destabilizing the PRAS40-mTOR interactions.  This tightened bond between the proteins under nutrient deprivation conditions proposes a hypothesis that states PRAS40 has a negative role in regulating mTOR.  

In order to further understand the consequence of PRAS40 in mTOR signaling, the regulator was downregulated in 3T3-L1 and HepG2 cells.  The phosphorylation process of Akt at Ser 473 and S6K1 (a mTOR substrate) at Thr 389 was studied.  PRAS40 silencing led to a significant decrease in Akt phosphorylation in the cell lines which resulted with negative effects on the Akt components.  PRAS40 silencing also led to increased levels of S6K1 phosphorylation, and suggests that the PRAS40-knockout mTOR complex is still active in S6k1 phosphorylation.  The mechanism was studied and results indicated that PRAS40 silenced cells and resulting activated state of mTOR may contribute to Akt inactivation – a feedback inhibition.  That was the first part of PRAS40 analysis, PRAS40 silencing.  In the second part, PRAS40 was overexpressed.  Increasing the levels of PRAS40 in cells resulted with decreased S6K1 phosphorylation.  These results prove that PRAS40 inhibition of mTOR regulation is likely to require mTOR and raptor binding.  

After determining the inhibitory function of PRAS40 in mTOR signaling, Haar and her team studied the role PRAS40 plays in the regulation of mTOR.  PRAS40 knockdown in mice and human cells weakened the ability of insulin to stimulate phosphorylation.  PRAS40 silencing reduces the levels of phosphorylation in both cell types.  In order to further study the response of mTOR to insulin, sample cells were treated with insulin.  The data collected proposes that PRAS40 silencing detaches mTOR from Akt signals – PRAS40 plays a crucial role in regulating Akt signaling to mTOR.  It also demonstrates that Akt phosphorylation of PRAS40 is crucial for mTOR activation through the use of insulin.  

The next matter that Haar and her team touched upon was the study that nutrient starvation has dominant effects on PRAS40-mTOR interaction.  PRAS40 was hardly released from mTOR when the conditions are deprived of leucine. Also, the amount of 14-3-3, an interaction induced on PRAS40 phosphorylation, bound to mTOR and PRAS40 was significantly reduced under deprived leucine conditions – the interaction was prevented under non-nutrient conditions.  14-3-3 interactions with mTOR and PRAS40 were also prevented under leucine-deprived conditions.  In all, these results prove that PRAS40 is a key mediator of Akt signals to mTOR and a negative effector of mTOR signaling.  PRAS40 is a crucial regulator of in insulin sensitivity of mTOR signaling, an important role in insulin resistance. 

Some methods of this experiment included the use of antibodies in western blotting, plasmid constructions and mutagenesis, the identification of mTOR-interacting proteins, cell culture and transfection, coimmunoprecipitation, chemical crosslinking, and lentiviral preparation, viral infection, and stable cell line generation.  Human PRAS40 cDNAs were provided and mouse PRAS40 cDNA samples underwent PCR amplification and then subcloned into mammalian expression vector.  All these cloned samples were confirmed by sequencing.  PRAS40 Thr 246 was replaced by amino acids: alanine, glutamate, and aspartate.  This is done through a site-directed mutagenesis kit.  The way that mTOR immunoprecipitates is through the use of an mTOR antibody on cells cultured in 10% fetal bovine.  The cell samples were lysed in a buffer and then incubated with 20ul of protein G resin and 4ug of mTOR antibody.  The mTOR precipitates were washed with lysis buffer and the binding proteins were eluted by incubation.  The mTOR binding proteins were diluted with digestion buffer and then incubated overnight with trypsin.  These samples underwent analysis by mass spectrometry.  Data would only be considered accurate when the P score is greater or equal to 0.95.  For chemical crosslinking experiments, T cells were treated with dithiobis and then harvested and lysed in a buffer.  The precipitates were then analyzed using the SDS-PAGE method.  In order to measure the cell-size, T cells were infected with lentiviruses, and then selected in the presence of zeocin.  The cell samples were trysinized the following day and diluted 10 times.  The ViCell cell-size analyzer analyzed the size of 1.0 mL of diluted cell culture sample.

Overall, the study of PRAS40 in regulating mTOR insulin signaling can potentially lead to potential targets for the treatment of different diseases relating to type 2 diabetes, cancers, and insulin resistance.  The results indicate that the Akt/PKB substrate, PRAS40, provide negative effects on the signaling of mTOR.  The binding suppresses mTOR activation and insulin-receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1 and Akt, therefore, uncoupling the response of mTOR to Akt signals.  PRAS40’s interaction with mTOR is induced under certain environmental conditions such as nutrient, leucine and serum deprivation.  In general, this project was able to identify that PRAS40 is a crucial mTOR binding partner that intervenes Akt signaling to mTOR.

==Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress Stimuli and Beta-Cell Death In Type 2 Diabetes==

Obesity is related with insulin resistance, however Type 2 Diabetes, a complex known for increased levels of blood glucose due to insulin resistance in the muscle and liver tissue as well as impaired insulin secretion from pancreatic beta-cells, solely cultivates in genetically predisposed and insulin resistant subjects with the beginning of beta-cell dysfunction. As research progresses there is clear data that demonstrates that beta-cell failure and death are due to unresolvable endoplasmic reticulum stress, bringing chronic and strong activation of inositol-requiring protein 1.  Endoplasmic reticulum stress can start and generate the characteristics of Beta-cell failure and death observed in Type 2 Diabetes.

==Glucose Transport Deficiency in Type 2 Diabetes==
GLUT4 glucose transporters migrate to the cell surface in response to insulin signaling, thereby upgrading glucose levels in muscle and fat cells.  This is accomplished by stimulating vesicle transport of glucose to where it is needed.  Adult onset diabetes is often the result of gradual increase in insulin tolerance in individuals who overeat.  This desensitization to the effects of insulin interferes with metabolism because vesicles containing GLUT4 are not able to efficiently fuse with the cell membrane therefore glucose uptake into cells is inhibited.  By understanding this pathway, researchers may eventually find a therapeutic workaround to treat those suffering from Type 2 diabetes.  Presumably, this could be accomplished by synthesizing molecules that mimic the function of GLUT4 and its auxiliaries to resolve the trafficking problem.  Alternatively, the insulin pathway could be targeted.

==Membrane Potential==
Membrane potential is the voltage across the plasma membrane. The resting membrane potential is between -60 mV and -80 mV. There are steps in forming the resting membrane potential. First, the known concentration of K+ is 140 mM (millimolar) inside the cell and 5 mM outside of the cell and  the Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; concentration is 150 mM outside of the cell and 15 mM inside the cell. Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; concentration is 120 mM outside the neuron and 10 mM inside the cell. Such concentrations of chlorine, potassium, and sodium always remain constant because there is sodium potassium in the plasma membrane of the neurons. Also, ATP is used to transport ions against their concentration gradients to maintain the constant concentrations. For instance, ATP helps sodium to go out of the cell and potassium enter the cell. Since the exchange of ions occur at the concentration gradient, it is important to understand that the concentration of gradients of sodium and potassium across plasma membrane represent a chemical type of potential energy. In addition, ion channels in the selective permeability contribute to the electric potential of neurons. For example, there are K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels and N&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels. There are also ions that move through the membrane through these ion channels to generate a potential across the membrane. Consequently, the diffusion of K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;
through the potassium channels is very important for forming the resting potential because the outward flow of potassium results in the negative membrane potential of between -60 mV and -80mV. Excess negative charge inside the cell exerts an attractive force that stops the add’l flow of potassium ions outside of the cell. As a result, there is the creation of equilibrium potential which is the membrane voltage for a moving ion when it is at equilibrium. Nernst created an equation to calculate the resting potential of an ion:

E(ion)= 62mV(log [ion]outside/[ion]inside)

The resting potential for potassium is -90 mV. And the resting potential for sodium is 62 mV. &lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
The one compartment model with absorption, also known as the single compartment model, is a model that represents a drug that rapidly equilibrates with the extravascular tissue compartment. In another words, the one compartment model is the simplest way of describing a drug that is almost instantaneously distributed throughout the body. For a drug that does not equilibrate immediately, a two compartment model must be used. The two-compartment model generally represents a drug that slowly equilibrates with the tissue compartment. This model involves two compartments which are the central and peripheral compartments.&lt;small&gt;[http://www.rxkinetics.com/pktutorial/1_5.html 1]&lt;/small&gt;

==One-Compartment Model with Absorption==
In a one-compartment model, the body is considered to be one unit; thus there is only one volume of distribution, often denoted Vd. We assume that with the one-compartment model, the drug is distributed throughout the body immediately at the instant when the drug enters the body. The elimination of the drug is assumed to follow first order kinetics in this model. Therefore, when taking the log of the concentration of drug in the body and plotting it against time (“log of concentration vs. time”), the resulting model will be linear. An important thing to remember is that the first order kinetics is an assumption that applies to the linear model, not the one compartment model. That being said, a change in dosage of the drug will not be reflected in the pharmacokinetic parameters (kel, Vd, Cp), but rather in the proportional change in drug concentration within the body. Because elimination follows first order kinetics, the rate of elimination is only dependent on one factor and that is the amount of drug in the body. The amount of drug in the body is proportional to the rate of elimination. &lt;small&gt;[http://www.cop.ufl.edu/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/two-compartment-model.pdf 2]&lt;/small&gt;

==First Order Kinetics==
First order kinetics in a one-compartment model can be easily displayed by generating various graphs. 
Firstly, the concentration of drug in the body should be collected at various times. Then a plot of this data should generate a graph similar to this: 
 

* If the rate of change of each point on the “concentration vs. time” plot is taken, a new plot can be generated. (See figure 4.3.1)  &lt;sup&gt;[http://www.boomer.org/c/p4/c04/c0403.html 3]&lt;/sup&gt;





* Taking this rate of change and plotting it against the concentration of drug in blood (resulting in “rate of change vs. concentration” graph), a linear curve can be generated. (See figure 4.3.2)  &lt;sup&gt;[http://www.boomer.org/c/p4/c04/c0403.html 3]&lt;/sup&gt;
 

 


* Simple derivations will lead to this mathematical representation of the behavior of the one-compartment model.(See figure 4.3.3)  &lt;sup&gt;[http://www.boomer.org/c/p4/c04/c0403.html 3]&lt;/sup&gt;


 


* As shown in equation 4.3.1, the kel remains constant regardless of the change in dosage. This proves that in a one-compartment model, the pharmacokinetic parameters do not change with any given dosage. From equation 4.3.1, we can also conclude that the rate of elimination, denoted as -∆Cp/∆t, is only dependent on the concentration of drug in the body, Cp. (See equation 4.3.1) &lt;sup&gt;[http://www.boomer.org/c/p4/c04/c0403.html 3]&lt;/sup&gt;


==Uses of One-Compartment Model==
The one compartment model is a simplification for when a drug rapidly equilibrates in the body. Although the drug is said to be in equilibrium, the drug concentration in fluid or the tissue will not always be equal. Thus, when the drug is said to be in equilibrium, it is assumed that the drug concentration in tissue/fluids is always proportional to the drug concentration in the body at all times.&lt;small&gt;[http://www.boomer.org/c/p4/c04/c0403.html 3]&lt;/small&gt; 

This model is not completely accurate because only a very few drugs have proven to instantly equilibrate and disperse throughout the body. However, for the sake of simplicity, when a drug is said to have minimal distribution we can assume that the one-compartment model will serve as an adequate approximation. &lt;small&gt;[http://www.cop.ufl.edu/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/two-compartment-model.pdf 2]&lt;/small&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Minocycline''' is a tetra antibiotic that combats bacteria in the body. It is used to treat a variety of bacterial infections, such as urinary track infections, respiratory infections, skin infections, acne, gonorrhea, chlamydia, etc.

[[Image:Minocycline-150.jpg|thumb|right|Minocycline 100 mg Capsules.]]
==Overview==
Minocycline is an oral antibiotic commonly used to treat acne vulgaris (commonly known as cystic acne). Minocycline are able to kill the acne bacteria more effectively as well as reduce the redness and swelling of the acne. It is most commonly dispensed as Minocycline Hydrochloride which is a semi synthetic derivative of tetracycline. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.rxlist.com/solodyn-drug.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The medication are antibiotics sold as: Minocin, Dynacin, Vectrin, Solodyn, and generic minocycline.

It's IUPAC Name is (4S,4aS,5aR,12aS)-4,7-bis(dimethylamino)-3,10,12,12a-tetrahydroxy-1,11-dioxo-1,4,4a,5,5a,6,11,12a-octahydrotetracene-2-carboxamide &lt;ref&gt;http://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB01017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
Along with another one of its tetracycline counterparts, Doxycycline, Minocycline is the most common form of oral antibiotic prescribed to patients for acne. Refrain from taking if allergic to minocycline or other tetracycline antibiotics. 

Occasionally it is used to treat Lyme disease and other skin infections such as Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) since the twice a day dosage for minocycline is more tolerable than the four times daily required by other tetracycline compounds. Dosage of minocycline is 100-200mg daily for the adult, but if the dosage is skipped, it is possible this will affect the treatment process.

If a dose is missed, do not take extra to make up for the missed dose. If an overdose is taken, seek emergency medical attention or call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222.

==Caution==
If pregnant, do not use Minocycline. It can cause harm to the unborn child or permanent tooth discoloration. Minocycline may make birth control pills less effective. It also will pass through breast milk, effecting bone and tooth development of a nursing infant. Minocycline should not be taken by children younger than 8 years of age. Vitamin supplements should not be taken before taking Minocycine. These supplements reduce the effectiveness of it. Avoid excess sun exposure. Those taking Minocycline are easier subject to sun burn. Minocycline should be taken for the full prescribed length. Anything less will result in symptoms resurfacing. Do not take if past expiration date. Expired Minocycline may cause damage to kidneys.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Retinoblastoma:	'''

	The gene that cods for retinoblastoma (Rb gene) is an important tumor suppressor of cancer.  Retinoblastoma itself is a childhood cancer that results from the loss of function of both copies of the Rb gene (each cell has two copies of the Rb gene).  People with retinoblastoma can either develop a tumor in one eye (unilateral) or in both eyes (bilateral).

'''Hereditary vs. Sporadic Cases:'''

	Hereditary retinoblastoma occurs in patients who have a family history of the disease.  Because they inherit one non-functional copy of the Rb gene, only one mutation is needed for total loss of function.  If someone is born with one bad copy, they have an approximately 90 % chance of developing the tumor in both eyes (90 % penetrance).  In other words, being born with one non-functional copy increases the likelihood that a mutation will occur in the second copy and lead to a bilateral tumor.

	Sporadic retinoblastoma occurs in patients with no family history of the disease.  Therefore, they are born with two good, functional copies of the Rb gene.  As a result, in order for these patients to develop retinoblastoma, two mutations in the gene are needed.  This only occurs in 1 out of every 350,000 live births.  Sporadic retinoblastoma is unilateral, meaning that the tumor occurs in only one eye.

	Both sporadic and hereditary forms of the disease require two bad copies of the Rb gene.  This means that the Rb gene is still functional even if one copy is abnormal.  Loss of heterozygosity at the Rb locus on chromosome 13 is one potential mechanism for the development of bilateral retinoblastoma in patients who have a family history.

'''Retinoblastoma as a Tumor Suppressor in Normal Cells:'''

	The normal function of the Rb protein is to act as an assembly factory: it brings together other proteins and has multiple binding sites to accomplish this.  The Rb protein binds to multiple transcription factors and can either activate or repress transcription.  For example, Rb protein strongly interacts with and binds to E2F-DP, a heterodimer that includes the E2F transcription factor.  When Rb is bound to E2F-DP, the protein complex then can go to promoters that are regulated by E2F.  Once there, Rb can recruit histone deacetylase to repress or turn off the transcription of genes regulated by E2F.  This action suppresses cell division, which is why the Rb gene is a tumor suppressor.  Since cancer cells want to divide, retinoblastoma patients lack this repressive function.  In addition to histone deacetylase, Rb protein can also recruit histone and DNA methyltransferases.  These methyltransferases can modify and epigenetically silence the target DNA, leading to inactive heterochromatin (permanent silencing).  Therefore, Rb has a two-fold function.  It can either repress the transcription or epigenetically silence the DNA of genes involved in the cell cycle that promote cell division.


'''How Retinoblastoma Function is Turned Off in Normal Cells and Loss of Tumor Suppressor Ability in Cancer Cells:'''

	In order for cancer cells to grow, divide, and metastasize, they need to somehow inactivate the function of key tumor suppressors, such as the Rb gene.  Since the normal function of the Rb protein is to repress the cell cycle, this ability is an obstacle to cancer cell growth.  Since cancer cells in a retinoblastoma patient operate with non-functional Rb genes, the tumor suppressor function of Rb is non-existent and cancer cells can proliferate uncontrollably.  However, Rb function is also controlled in normal, non-cancerous cells.  We require cell division to survive, so Rb function must be regulated so that the cell cycle is not always repressed.
	As stated above, Rb works to repress the expression of genes regulated by E2F.  These genes include Cyclin A, Cyclin E, and other proteins involved in the cell cycle.  Cyclin/CDK complexes regulate the progression through the cell cycle (they oppose the function of the Rb protein).  Therefore, in order to do their job effectively, they phosphorylate Rb as multiple sites.  This phosphorylation causes Rb to lose its ability to bring proteins together.  Since it can no longer bind E2F, it cannot turn off the expression of genes that E2F regulates and the cell cycle can go on uninterrupted by Rb repression.  Then, E2F can recruit histone acetylases that activate gene expression of cell cycle cyclins.</text>

[[File:Levonorgestrel.svg|300px]][[File:Levonorgestrel3D.png|300px]]

The chemical IUPAC name is 13-ethyl-17-ethynyl-17-hydroxy- 1,2,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16, 17- tetradecahydrocyclopenta[a] phenanthren-3-one. Its chemical formula is C_21H_28O_2. Levonorgestrel is the left form (D- form) of norgestrel. Herschel Smith first synthesized the drug in the 1960s under Wyeth Pharmaceuticals. This drug is primarily used as an emergency contraceptive
	
This drug is usually taken orally, in pill form and is more commonly known as Plan B or the morning after pill. Many users mistake the drug for an abortion pill. It should be made clear that Levonorgestrel will not terminate a matured fetus. The drug is only effective in preventing pregnancy by means of postponing ovulation and hindering sperm migration. Levonorgestrel is a common ingredient in other birth control pills and acts in the same way, but the levels of hormone in Plan B and other emergency contraceptives are much higher.

==In the Body:==

	As a progestin steroid, Levonorgestrel blocks ovulation by stopping the follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone from being secreted from the pituitary gland. The drug also causes the mucus in the cervix to become more viscous which makes it difficult for sperm to travel far in the uterus, preventing implantation of the egg.

==Usage==
Oral contraception:
At low doses, levonorgestrel is used in monophasic and triphasic formulations of combined oral contraceptive pills, with available monophasic doses ranging from 100-250 µg, and triphasic doses of 50 µg/75 µg/125 µg. At very low daily dose of 30 µg, levonorgestrel is used in some progestogen only pill formulations.

Emergency contraception:
Levonorgestrel is used in emergency contraceptive pills (ECPs), both in a combined Yuzpe regimen which includes estrogen, and as a levonorgestrel-only method. The levonorgestrel-only method uses levonorgestrel 1.5 mg (as a single dose or as two .75 mg doses 12 hours apart) taken within 3 days of unprotected sex, with one study indicating that beginning as late as 120 hours (5 days) after intercourse could be effective. There are many brand names of levonorgestrel-only ECPs, including: Escapelle, Plan B, Levonelle, Glanique, NorLevo, Postinor-2, i-pill, &quot;Next Choice&quot; and 72-HOURS. The primary mechanism of action of levonorgestrel as a progestogen-only emergency contraceptive pill is to prevent fertilization by inhibition of ovulation. The International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) has issued a statement that: &quot;review of the evidence suggests that LNG [levonorgestreol] ECPs cannot prevent implantation of a fertilized egg. Language on implantation should not be included in LNG ECP product labeling.&quot;In June 2012, a New York Times editorial called on the FDA to remove from the label the unsupported suggestion that levonorgestrel emergency contraceptive pills inhibit implantation.

Intrauterine system:
Levonorgestrel is the active ingredient in the Mirena intrauterine system.

Contraceptive implants:
Levonorgestrel is the active ingredient in Norplant and Jadelle.

==When and How to take Levonogestrel:==


	Plan B should be taken no later than 72 hours after unprotected sex, but is most effective within 24 hours to prevent pregnancy. The sooner you take it, the better. Plan B can be purchased at most local drug stores and pharmacies without a prescription for women 18 years and older.  Anyone under 17 will need a prescription from a doctor.
	Plan B should not be used in place of regular birth controls, but ONLY in emergency if: 
*no condom was used during sex, or the condom broke 
*no birth control was used/or a pill was skipped 
*regular birth control fails 
*the partner didn’t pull out in time 
*sex was forced. 
Do NOT take Plan B if already pregnant.

==Side Effects and Warnings:==


Side effects vary in severity and occurrence for each person. These include:
*headaches
*dizziness
*fatigue
*nausea/vomiting
*abdominal pain
*tender breasts
*irregular menstruation
More serious side effects such as itching and skin rash should immediately be taken to the doctor.
Those with diabetes and those who are breast-feeding should take extra precaution when using Plan B.
	
Always be aware of any possible drug interactions when taking a new medication. Consult a doctor before taking Plan B and inform them of any current medications.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Molecular Geometry

==Definitions==
Molecular geometry is the 3-dimensional  shape that a molecule occupies in space. It is determined by the central atom and the surrounding atoms and electron pairs. The shape of most molecules can be predicted using the Valence Shell  Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) method. This method states a few rules to help one determine the shape of a substance without using high technology methods such as X-ray crystallography, NMR Spectroscopy, or electron microscopy. Some of the most common shapes that can be taken are linear, trigonal planar, tetrahedral, pyramidal, and angular (or bent). 

==VSEPR Theory==
Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) theory
Electron pairs around a central atom arrange themselves so that they can be as far apart as possible from each other. The valence shell is the outermost electron-occupied shell of an atom that holds the electrons involved in bonding. In a covalent bond, a pair of electrons is shared between two atoms. In a polyatomic molecule, several atoms are bonded to a central atom using two or more electron pairs. The repulsion between negatively charged electron pairs in bonds or as lone pairs causes them to spread apart as much as possible.
The idea of &quot;electron pair repulsion can be demonstrated by tying several inflated balloons together at their necks. Each balloon represents an electron pair. The balloons will try to minimize the crowding and will spread as far apart as possible. According to VSEPR theory, molecular geometry can be predicted by starting with the electron pair geometry about the central atom and adding atoms to some or all of the electron pairs. This model produces good agreement with experimental determinations for simple molecules. With this model in mind, the molecular geometry can be determined in a systematic way.
Molecules can then be divided into two groups:
Group 1: Molecules with NO lone electron pairs. In this case the molecular geometry is identical to the electron pair geometry.
Group 2: Molecules with one or more lone electron pairs. In this case an extra step is needed to to translate from electron pair geometry to the final molecular geometry, since only the positions of bonded atoms are considered in molecular geometry.

The VSEPR theory says that:

1) The electron pairs and atoms around a central atom will give a molecule its shape.

2) Electron pairs around a central atom in a molecule will attempt to be as far away from each other as possible.

3) Lone pairs around the central atom will have an effect on the shape of the entire molecule, just like an atom would.  

4) Lone pairs of electrons repel each other more strongly than a lone pair and a shared pair, which in turn repel each other more than two shared pairs (or bonds between the central atom and another atom).
 
These are just a few of the basic postulates of the VSEPR theory that, along with the lewis dot structure of a molecule, allow us to determine the shape it will have.

==Ring Molecular Geometry==
Many organic compounds contain rings of carbon atoms or other atoms such as oxygen or nitrogen. The simplest ring compound contains 3 carbons as in cyclopropane. The most common ring compounds contain either 5 or 6 carbons. These compounds are also called cyclic.

==Bent Molecular Geometry==
The molecule that is made up of 4 equally spaced sp3 hybrid orbitals forming bond angles of approximately 109.5o. The shape of the orbitals is tetrahedral. Two of the orbitals contain lone pairs of electrons. The two atoms connected to the central atom form a molecule with a bent shape.

==Hybridization and Geometry==
There is a simple relationship between the hybridization of an atom and its geometry, i.e., the way or ways in which other atoms can be disposed about it in space. This module examines the allowed bonding patterns for the representative elements B, C, N, O, and F, as well as their geometries as a function of their hybridization and formal charge.

'''Finding Hybridization'''
For Hybridization of molecules:
1. Count total number of valence Electrons
2.Divide by 8, if no of e- &gt; 8.
Divide by 2, if no of e- ≤ 8.

==Polarity and Geometry==
The geometry of a molecule determines many properties such as polarity, reactivity, state, and much more. The polarity is directly related to the shape because many molecules with polar bonds can be non polar as a whole due to symmetry of the molecule that has equal electron pull outwards or inward. One such example is carbon dioxide. The electronegative oxygens on either side of the carbon pull atoms toward them selves, cause a partial negative charge on each end, while the less electronegative carbon is left with a partial positive charge. The oxygens are both double bonded to the carbon leaving no lone pairs to bend the molecule, which is linear and has 180 degree bond angles. The equal pull of both partial negative charges balance each other out because the are of equal magnitude and exact opposite directions and the whole molecule is non polar.

On the other hand, a molecule can have polar bonds and a different shape that does not balance out the electronegative pull. For example, the hydrogen dioxide molecule, which also contains three atoms but has a different shape. Water is tetrahedral and bent because it has two extra electron pairs which push the hydrogen atoms into a 109.5 degree angle. As a result, the partial negative charge on oxygen is balanced on each side, but is pointed up and inwards, giving the whole molecule polar properties.

The polarity in turn then affects many properties itself, such as melting point, boiling point, vapor pressure, solubility and the types of bonds that can be formed, just to name a few. Polar molecules will have higher melting and boiling points and lower vapor pressure due to the attraction between the molecules. Polar molecules also tend to dissolve other polar molecules while non polar molecules also dissolve other non polar substances. This is often referred to as &quot;like dissolves like&quot; as a quick way to remember this property. 

==Reactivity and Geometry==
Another property determined by molecular geometry is  reactivity. The reactivity is affected in many ways. One example is the type of bonds the molecule makes based on polarity. For example, some polar molecule can react in hydrogen bonds while non polar molecules react in london dispersion forces. But there are other ways that the geometry directly effects sections that a molecule partakes in. Large bulky molecules often react using the unhindered side, even if it is not as favorable of a product, because of the easier reaction. Another example is enzymes and the way the &quot;fit&quot; certain substrates based on their own sake and the shape of the substrates. These are just a couple examples of the many ways that molecular shape can help determine reactivity.

==Determination of Geometry==
Although VSEPR and a few similar methods can be used to determine the geometry of a molecule, there are high tech methods that can show us the shape of much larger molecules, usually proteins, without a doubt. These methods include X-ray crystallography, NMR Spectroscopy, and electron microscopy. X-ray crystallography is one of the best methods because of the very high resolution that is a result of te wavelength, which s very close to that of the bonds between the atoms. 

===1. X-ray Crystallography=== 
The first step in this method is to turn the protein into a crystal, which is done by adding certain salts that crystalize the macromolecule. Once it is in its crystal form, an X-ray beam is aimed at the protein and what happens to the light is observed. Some light will be absorbed, some will be scattered, and some will be diffracted. All of the rays are studied closely and their information, such as amplitude for example, give biochemists information about the atom in the molecule. 

[[File:X-ray crystallography.svg|center|whole|400px|X-ray crystallography]]

===2. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy===
 Another technique, called Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, allows protein structure to be studied without being first converted into a crystal. It is one of the very few methods that allows the substance to be studied in solution, which is usually CDCl3. The two types of NMRs commonly used are proton NMR and carbon NMR, due to the magnetic resonance of the elements. For H-NMR, when a molecule is exposed to a magnetic and proton get excited and line up, four things can be observed that tell us about the environment of each identical group of protons. The chemical shift (how far downfield the signal is) tells what functional groups are surrounding the proton(s). The signal integration gives us a ratio that compares the amount of protons in each family. The splitting(amount of peaks in one signal, such as a doublet,triplet, etc) tells us how many neighboring hydrogens there are. And finally, the number of signals itself tells us how many different families of protons there are. C-NMR works the same way except for  integration, which is not always clear as it is in H-NMR. So all this information is gathered for a molecule and its exact connectivity can usually be determined, even if it was an unknown molecule. 

[[File:Espectro NMR C-13.jpg|center|whole|400px|Espectro NMR C-13]]

===3.Electron Microscopy===
 The third method is electron microscopy, which uses uses an electron microscope that conducts an electron ray. The electron beams are aimed at the macromolecules and then impose an image of the molecule and its structure upon fluorescent or photographic film for us to see. Sometimes they are even sent directly to a screen, such as a computer screen. This image is a black a white picture but is still very useful in determining structure.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Neural Induction==
Neural Induction refers to the process that induces a region of embryonic ectoderm to form the neural plate on the dorsal surface of the embryo. Neural induction goes through several stages such as neurulation and neural patterning.

During the early stages of the embryonic development, newly formed neural plate forms the neural groove, which then forms the neural tube that eventually develops in to the central nervous system. There are numerous enzymes, hormones and proteins that initiates this formation of neural tissue. But the main protein that contributes the most is the Spemmann's organizer. The ectoderm cells are naturally predisposed to become neural tissues. But the ectoderm cells produces BMPS (TGF-β family protein), which causes it to become epidermal (nonneural). However once the Spemann's Organizer molecules produces neural inducers such as follistatin,noggin, and chordin to block the effects of BMPs, ectoderm can be induced to become the neural tissue. Missing such indcucers cause many birth defects during the early pregnancy such as spinal bifida and anencephaly. *BMPs are bone morphogenic protens that are members of polypeptide growth factor and transforming growth factor familes.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Phases of Brain Development==

Phases of early embryonic brain development mainly include seven stages such as neural induction, proliferation, migration, differentiation, synaptogenesis, cell death/stabilization and synaptic rearrangement. Neural induction stage takes from the day 18 to 24 since the fertilization. Proliferation stages takes from the day 24 to day 125. Migration stage takes from the day 40 to day 160. And the differentiation stage takes from the day 125 to the postnatal periods. from the differentiation period to the postnatal period, the brain development becomes very sensitive to the  environmental factors play a role in addition to the genetic factors.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Diabetes mellitus is the medical term given to the chronic condition in which the body is unable to transport the glucose (sugar) in our bloodstream to the rest of the cells in our body.  This has two main consequences: elevated levels of glucose in our blood, and an energy deficiency in our cells.  The first consequence is the result of not being able to remove the glucose from the blood, whereas the second flows from the fact that glucose serves as the primary source of energy for our cells.  Diabetes can be the result of a variety of factors ranging from diet to genetics.  This article will discuss a specific type of diabetes (T1DM) that results from a hyperactive immune system, which means that it belongs under a class of diseases known as autoimmune diseases.

==Autoimmune Diseases and Type 1 Diabetes==
The immune system is an intricate and advanced network that utilizes cell machinery to serve the primary purpose of protecting the body from foreign invaders such as bacteria, viruses, pathogens, or anything that attempts to disrupt the delicate equilibrium of a multi-cellular organism.  In the case of an autoimmune disease, the immune system mistakenly attacks normal, non-threatening body cells or tissues.  In short, the body begins to attack itself.  A hyperactive immune system has the potential to be extremely dangerous, depending on what type or class of cell is targeted by the immune system.  

After a meal, the complex carbohydrates in the ingested food are broken down to simple sugars, and shortly afterward they enter the bloodstream.  Upon secretion from the pancreas, a hormone called insulin regulates the level of sugar in the blood by binding to glucose-transport proteins and signaling them to move the sugar molecules into the cells, where they are either converted into energy, or stored as the polysaccharide gylcogen.  In the case of Type 1 Diabetes, the immune system attacks the insulin-producing beta cells of the pancreas.  Without any beta cells the body cannot produce insulin, and as a result it cannot properly remove sugar from the blood or provide ample energy for the cells. 

==Treatment== 
In order to solve the problem of not having insulin in the bloodstream, treatment for Type 1 Diabetes involves an intravenous dosage of insulin every time carbohydrates are consumed.  The amount of insulin that is delivered is proportional to the grams of carbohydrates that are eaten, and it is also dependent on the glucose level before the meal.  That said, people with T1DM must carefully monitor what they are eating and what their blood sugar level is, because that will determine how much insulin they inject.  Although traditionally delivered with a syringe, insulin can also be delivered through an insulin pump, which attaches to the stomach and can be remotely controlled to deliver a specified amount of insulin.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Migration==

During the migration stage cells that are yet to become neurons begin to move up along the radial glia cells that provide scaffolding system for the cell migration. Cells along the radial glia cells generally move up vertically forming layered stuctures with predominantly radial migration patterns, including the cerebral cortex, the hippocampal formation, colliculi, and the cerebellar cortex. There are three groups of molecules that are crucial for migration:

1. Adhesion molecules
: adhesion molecules such as Reln, Astrotactin, Neuregulin, Integrins alpha 3,6, play a role in attaching the cells to the radial glia cell.

2. Microtubule binding proteins
: regulate stability of microtubles 

3.Actin binding Molecules
: regulate protein to protein interactions. Examples are filamin1, Cdk5/p35

      <text xml:space="preserve">The signal recognition particle (SRP) system, which contains the SRP and its receptor, plays a major role in targeting of ribosomes and IMP-encoding transcripts to the endoplasmic reticulum of eukaryotes and the cytoplasmic membrane of bacteria.

There are 3 essential components of the SRP system in E. coli:
* The SRP protein – Ffh
* The SRP receptor – FtsY
* A small stable 4.5S RNA

The roles of SRP system in E. coli is related to the biosynthesis of IMPs:
* SPR-mediated ribosome targeting (S-MRT)
* SRP receptor-mediated ribosome targeting (SR-MRT)



1. S-MRT is based mainly on in vitro studies with purified components, has 2 stages:
 
  SRP binds to cytosolic mRNA-ribosome nascent chain complexes.
  The SRP-RNC complexes targeted to the membrane-bound FtsY.

2. SR-MRT is based mainly on in vivo studies, has 3 stages:

  During FtsY translation, FtsY and ribosomes are targeted to the membrane in an SRP-independent manner.
  IMP-encoding mRNAs are targeted to the membrane-bound ribosomes.
  SRP interacts with a hydrophobic nascent polypeptide, the ribosomes, and the SRP receptor.
:
&lt;br /&gt;
Both of the models require RNCs, SRP, and SRP receptor to form a complex on the membrane, transfer RNC to the translocon. However, SR-MRT differs from S-MRT by the additional targeting stages:

'''&lt;u&gt;Ribosome targeting:&lt;/u&gt;''' 
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! In vitro !! In vivo
|-
| 
* The E. coli SRP can interact with ribosomes and RNCs in aqueous solution and in the cytoplasm.
* The ribosome-SRP interaction does not rule out the possibility that the same interaction may occur between membrane-associated SRP and membrane-bound ribosomes translating IMPs.
* Preformed soluble RNC-SRP complexes can target the membrane-bound SRP receptor. 
|| 
* The E. coli SRP can interact with ribosomes and RNCs in aqueous solution and in the cytoplasm.
* The interactions between the SRP and cytosolic ribosome play role as a quality control mechanism to prevent premature synthesis of IMPs in the E. coli cytosol.
* SRP may not be required for ribosome targeting.

'''&lt;u&gt;mRNA targeting:&lt;/u&gt;'''&lt;br /&gt;

IMP-encoding transcripts in E. coli are targeted to the membrane in a translation-independent manner.

The uracil-bias is an evolutionarily ancient feature of IMP-encoding mRNAs. 

Uracil-richness is required for mRNA targeting to the membrane.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Differentiation==
:During the differentiation stage the cells acquire an identity (phenotype). Each cell's axon thus begins to grow toward the target and acquires/expresses specific enzymes to produce neurotransmitters and receptors. And the most importantly, myelination of the neurons begin during this stage. There are numerous ways that axons find its target: 1. pathway selection 2. target selection, address selection 3.direct cell to cell communication 4. detection of extracellular signals from other cells 5.communication via diffusable chemical signals from cells at a distance.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Holliday Junction==

A Holliday Junction is the combination of four moving DNA strands that bridge together to form four double-helical arms. This model was proposed by Robin Holliday in 1964 to explain the transfer of genetic information in yeast, now known as homologous recombination. (1) 

[[File:472px-Holliday_Junction.png|2-D View of the Holliday Junction]]

However, this structure is unstable because they contain homologous sequence symmetry, which allows itself to isomerize. These junctions can slide up and down the DNA since they are between homologous sequences. When there are a few single strands with the same length, the free ends of each strand can match up to another DNA helix with free ends. The strands are now crossed over, which creates the Holliday junction. (2)

      <comment>/* Fertilizer methods */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Fertilizer methods==
Dilute the nutrient solutions in a gallon of water before adding to the system. The water should always be clear after application. Initial nutrient solutions reference points:
* [[w:hoagland solution]]
* non-hydroponic fertilizers - use 1/10 of the label dosing, with the amount of water in the container in mind
* hydroponic fertilizers - labeled directions
* sterilized soil - sterilize fertile soil, then run it through a cheese cloth
* pH meter readability and EC by a multimeter
* aquaponic

==Natural fertilizer==
Potting soil may be sterilized by heating in a covered container. This same soil can be run through a cloth to fertilize the nutrient solution. Only a little bit is needed, and making the water murky is disadvantageous to the nutrient solution.&lt;!--biofertilizer, promoting aerobic bacteria--&gt;

==Aquaponic nutrition==
Initially, nutrient solutions or fish establishment of the water is necessary for aquaponic gardening. New propagation tissue, like seeds and stem cuttings, can tolerate the lack of nutrients, until the levels build up from fish wastes. Aquatic animals do the work of maintaining proper plant nutrition and maintaining salt levels. Once fish are established, nutrient solutions are no longer necessary for maintaining aquaponic gardens, since fish waste provides all of the nutrients necessary. Adding nutrient solutions after this point can be detrimental to the plants, while this may not readily affect fish.
In an aquaponic system, adding less fertilizer is safer than adding too much, especially since aquatic animals immediately make up for the difference.

If the water is changed, the correct nutrient solution has to be compensated. Rooted or established plants may quickly die of nutrient deficiencies.

==Supplements for plants==
Aspirin,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plantea.com/plant-aspirin.htm|title=Plants feeling under the weather?:
Give them aspirin water!}}&lt;/ref&gt; melatonin and rooting hormones may be beneficial to the plant.

      <comment>/* Netpot biofilter */  grammar</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">For a passive [[w:biofilter|biofilter]] to work, aerobic conditions must be met for beneficial bacteria. The concept is to provide a medium for beneficial bacteria to grow in aerobic conditions. Here are numerous nonmechanical subsystem and passive biofilter projects:

==Netpot biofilter==
Put a synthetic screen or scrub pad over a net pot, and this cannot be a material that holds much water or that is easily decomposable. Fill it with sand, gravel, ceramic material, charcoal or any porous substrate of choice, while pushing it inside the net pot. Sand helps remove small particles. This works to remove small particles if water passes from the top.

==Ground layer biofilter==
Gravel in the bottom of the tank will assist with biofiltration. It will help clear up the water.

==Aquaponic symbiosis==
Plants and microorganisms remove fish byproduct waste that is dangerous to aquatic animals. Fish provide properly balanced nutrients necessary for plant growth. Different types of aerobic bacteria complete the symbiotic cycle by providing the proper nutrient fixations and reduction of toxins.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==5th century BC==
[[File:Map athenian empire 431 BC-en.svg|thumb|Map of the Delian League (&quot;Athenian Empire&quot;) in 431 BCE.]]

From the perspective of Athenian culture in Classical Greece, the period generally referred to as the 5th century BC encroaches slightly on the 4th century BC. This century is essentially studied from the Athenian outlook because Athens has left us more narratives, plays, and other written works than the other ancient Greek states. In this context, one might consider that the first significant event of this century occurs in 510 BC, with the fall of the Athenian tyrant and Cleisthenes' reforms. However, a broader view of the whole Greek world might place its beginning at the Ionian revolt of 500 BC, the event that provoked the Persian invasion of 492 BC. The Persians (called &quot;Medes&quot;) were finally defeated in 490 BC. A second Persian attempt failed in 481-479 BC. The Delian League then formed, under Athenian hegemony and as Athens' instrument. Athens' excesses caused several revolts among the allied cities, all of which were put down by force, but Athenian dynamism finally awoke Sparta and brought about the Peloponnesian War in 431 BC. After both forces were spent, a brief peace came about; then the war resumed to Sparta's advantage. Athens was definitively defeated in 404 BC, and internal Athenian agitations mark the end of the 5th century BC in Greece.

Since the beginning, Sparta had been ruled by a &quot;diarchy.&quot; This meant that Sparta had two kings serving concurrently throughout its entire history. The two kingships were both hereditary and were either from the Agiad dynasty or the Eurypontid dynasty. Allegedly, the hereditary lines of these two dynasties spring, respectively, from Eurysthenes and Procles, twin descendants of Hercules. Eurysthenes and Procles were said to have conquered Sparta two generations after the Trojan War.

===Cleisthenes===
[[File:Cleisthenes.jpg|thumb|Cleisthenes, the father of Greek democracy, reformed traditional Athenian government controlled by ruling tribes into the first government &quot;of the people&quot; (the ''Demos'') democracy.]]

In 510 BC, Spartan troops helped the Athenians overthrow their king, the tyrant Hippias. Cleomenes I, king of Sparta, put in place a pro-Spartan oligarchy headed by Isagoras. But his rival Cleisthenes, with the support of the middle class and aided by democrats, managed to take over. Cleomenes intervened in 508 and 506 BC, but could not stop Cleisthenes, now supported by the Athenians. Through his reforms, the people endowed their city with isonomic institutions—i.e., ones that all have the same rights—and established ostracism.

The isonomic and isegoric democracy was first organized into about 130 ''demes'', which became the foundational civic element. The 10,000 citizens exercised their power via the assembly (the ''ekklesia'', in Greek) of which they all were part, headed by a council of 500 citizens chosen at random.

The city's administrative geography was reworked, the goal being to have mixed political groups — not federated by local interests linked to the sea, to the city, or to farming — whose decisions (declaration of war, etc.) would depend on their geographical situation. Also, the territory of the city was divided into thirty trittyes as follows:

* ten ''trittyes'' in the coastal &quot;Paralie&quot;
* ten trittyes in &quot;Asty&quot;, the urban center
* ten ''trittyes'' in rural &quot;Mesogia&quot;.

A tribe consisted of three ''trittyes'', taken at random, one from each of the three groups. Each tribe therefore always acted in the interest of all three sectors.

This is this corpus of reforms that would in the end allow the emergence of a wider democracy in the 460s and 450s BC.

===The Persian Wars===
[[File:Map Greco-Persian Wars-en.svg|thumb|Map showing the Greek world during the Greco-Persian Wars (ca. 500–479 BC).]]

In Ionia (the modern Aegean coast of Turkey), the Greek cities, which included great centers such as Miletus and Halicarnassus, were unable to maintain their independence and came under the rule of the Persian Empire in the mid 6th century BC. In 499 BC, these ''poleis'' rose against Persian rule in what it has come to be known as the Ionian Revolt(499 BC-493 BC), and Athens and some other Greek cities sent aid, but were quickly forced to back down after defeat in 494 BC at the battle of Lade. Asia Minor returned to Persian control.

In 492 BC, the Persian general, Mardonius led a campaign through Thrace and Macedonia and, while victorious, he was wounded and forced to retreat back into Asia Minor. In addition, the naval fleet of around 1,200 ships that accompanied Mardonius on the expedition was wrecked by a storm off the coast of Mount Athos. Later, the generals Artaphernes and Datis submitted the Aegean islands through a naval expedition.

In 490 BC, Darius the Great of Persian, having suppressed the Ionian cities, sent a fleet to punish the Greeks. 100,000 Persians (historians are uncertain about the number; it varies from 18,000 to 100,000) landed in Attica intending to take Athens, but were defeated at the Battle of Marathon by a Greek army of 9,000 Athenian hoplites and 1,000 Plateans led by the Athenian general Miltiades. The Persian fleet continued to Athens but, seeing it garrisoned, decided not to attempt an assault.
[[File:Leonidas statue1b.jpg|left|thumb|Statue of King Leonidas of Sparta.]]

Ten years later, in 480 BC, Darius' successor Xerxes I sent a much more powerful force of 300,000 by land, with 1,207 ships in support, across a double pontoon bridge over the Hellespont. This army took Thrace, before descending on Thessaly and Boetia, whilst the Persian navy skirted the coast and resupplied the ground troops. The Greek fleet, meanwhile, dashed to block Cape Artemision. After being delayed by Leonidas I, the Spartan king of the Agiad Dynasty, at the Battle of Thermopylae (a battle made famous by the 300 Spartans who faced the entire Persian Army), Xerxes advanced into Attica, where he captured and burned Athens. But the Athenians had evacuated the city by sea, and under the command of Themistocles defeated the Persian fleet at the Battle of Salamis.

In 483 BC, during the time of peace between the two Persian invasions, a vein of silver ore had been discovered in the Laurion (a small mountain range near Athens), and the hundreds of talents mined there had paid for the construction of 200 warships to combat Aeginetan piracy. A year later, the Greeks, under the Spartan Pausanias, defeated the Persian army at Plataea. Following the Battle of Plataea, the Persians began withdrawing from Greece and never attempted an invasion again.

The Athenian fleet then turned to chasing the Persians from the Aegean Sea, defeating their fleet decisively in the Battle of Mycale; then in 478 BC the fleet captured Byzantium. In the course of doing so Athens enrolled all the island states and some mainland ones into an alliance called the Delian League, so named because its treasury was kept on the sacred island of Delos. The Spartans, although they had taken part in the war, withdrew into isolation afterwards, allowing Athens to establish unchallenged naval and commercial power.

===The Peloponnesian War===
[[File:Map Peloponnesian War 431 BC-en.svg|thumb|Map of the nations during the start of the Peloponnesian War around 431 BC.]]

In 431 BC war broke out between Athens and Sparta and its allies. The war was not really a struggle between two city-states as it was a struggle between two coalitions, or leagues of city-states. These two leagues were the Delian League in which Athens was the leading member, and the Peloponnesian League, which was led by Sparta.

The Delian League grew out of the necessity of presenting a unified front of all Greek city-states against Persian aggression. In 481 BC, Greek city-states, including Sparta, met in the first of a series of &quot;congresses&quot; that strove to unify all the Greek city-states against the danger of another Persian invasion. This coalition of city-states formed in 481 BC became known as the &quot;Hellenic League&quot; and included Sparta. As noted above, the expected Persian invasion of Greece under King Xerxes occurred in September 481 BC when the Athenian navy defeated the Persian navy. The Persian land forces were delayed in 480 BC, by a much smaller force of 300 Spartans, 400 Thebans and 700 men from Boeotian Thespiae at the Battle of Thermopylae. The Persians finally left Greece in 479 BC following their defeat at Plataea.

The Battle of Plataea in 479 BC was the final battle of Xerxes' invasion of Greece. After the Battle of Plataea, the Persians never again tried to invade Greece. With the disappearance of this external threat, cracks appeared in the united front of the Hellenic League. In 477 BC, Athens became the recognised leader of a coalition of city-states that did not include Sparta. This coalition met and formalized their relationship at the holy city of Delos. Thus, the League took the name &quot;Delian League.&quot; The official purpose of this new League was to liberate Greek cities still under Persian control. However, it became increasingly apparent that the Delian League was really a front for Athenian imperialism throughout the Aegean.

A competing coalition of Greek city-states centered around Sparta arose and became more important as the external Persian threat subsided. This coalition became known as the Peloponnesian League. However, unlike the Hellenic League and the Delian League, the Spartan League was not a response to any external threat — Persian or otherwise. The Spartan League was unabashedly an instrument of Spartan policy aimed at the security of Lacedaemon (the prefecture on the Peloponnese Peninsula in which Sparta was located) and Spartan dominance over the Peloponnese Peninsula. Sometimes the Spartan League is called the &quot;Peloponnesian League.&quot; This term is ambiguous on two scores. The &quot;Peloponnesian League&quot; was not really a &quot;league&quot; at all. Nor was it really &quot;Peloponnesian.&quot; There was no equality at all between the members as might be implied by the term &quot;league.&quot; Furthermore, most of its members were not from the Peloponnese, but rather were located outside the Peloponnese Peninsula. Indeed, the terms &quot;Spartan League&quot; or &quot;Peloponnesian League&quot; are actually modern terms. Contemporaries actually used the term the &quot;Lacedaemonians and their Allies&quot; to describe the so-called league.

The Spartan League had its origins in Sparta's conflict with another city on the Peloponnese Peninsula--Argos. In the 7th century BC, Argos dominated the Peloponnese Peninsula. Even in the period of time after 600 BC, the Argives attempted to control the northeastern part of the Peloponnese Peninsula. The rise of Sparta in the 6th century, naturally, brought Sparta in conflict with Argos. However, with the conquest of the Peloponnesian city-state of Tegea in 550 BC and the defeat of the Argives 546 BC, the Spartan's control began to reach well beyond the borders of Lacedaemon.

As these two coalitions grew, their separate interests kept coming into conflict. Under the influence of King Archidamus II (who ruled Sparta from 476 BC through 427 BC), Sparta, in the late summer or early autumn of 446 BC, concluded the Thirty Years Peace with Athens. This treaty took effect the next winter in 445 BC Under the terms of this treaty, Greece was formally divided into two large power zones. Sparta and Athens agreed to stay within their own power zone and not to interfere in the other's power zone. Despite the Thirty Years Peace, it was clear that eventual war was inevitable. As noted above, at all times during its history down to 221 BC, Sparta was a &quot;diarchy&quot; with two kings ruling the city-state concurrently. One line of hereditary kings were from the Eurypontid Dynasty while the other king was from the Agiad Dynansty. With the conclusion of the Thirty Years Peace treaty Archidamus II, the Eurypontid King at the time, felt he had successfully prevented Sparta from entering into a war with its neighbors. However, the strong war party in Sparta soon won out and in 431 BC Archidamus was forced into going to war with the Delian League. However, in 427 BC, Archidamus II died and his son, Agis II succeeded to the Eurypontid throne of Sparta.

The immediate causes of the Peloponnesian War vary from account to account. However three causes are fairly consistent among the ancient historians, namely Thucydides and Plutarch. Prior to the war, Corinth and one of its colonies, Corcyra (modern-day Corfu), got into a dispute, in 435 BC, over the new Corcyran colony of Epidamnus. War broke out between Corinth and Corcyra. Sparta refused to become involved in the conflict and urged an arbitrated settlement of the struggle. In 433 BC, Corcyra, sought the assistance of Athens in the war on Corinth. Corinth was known to be a traditional enemy of Athens. However, to further encourage Athens to enter the conflict, Corcyra pointed out, to Athens, how useful a friendly relationship with Corcyra would be, given the strategic locations of Corcyra itself and the colony of Epidamnus on the east shore of the Adriatic Sea. Furthermore, Corcyra promised that Athens would have the use of their (Corcyra's) navy, which was the third largest navy in Greece. This was too good of an offer for Athens to refuse. Accordingly, Athens signed a defensive alliance with Corcyra.

The next year, in 432 BC, Corinth and Athens argued over control of Potidaea (near modern-day Nea Potidaia), eventually leading to an Athenian siege of Potidaea. In 434-433 BC Athens issued the &quot;Megarian Decrees&quot;, a series of economic decrees that placed economic sanctions on the Megarian people. Athens was accused by the Peloponnesian allies of violating the Thirty Years Peace through all of the aforementioned actions, and, accordingly, Sparta formally declared war on Athens.

Many historians consider these to be merely the immediate causes of the war. They would argue that the underlying cause was the growing resentment on the part of Sparta and its allies at the dominance of Athens over Greek affairs. The war lasted 27 years, partly because Athens (a naval power) and Sparta (a land-based military power) found it difficult to come to grips with each other.

Sparta's initial strategy was to invade Attica, but the Athenians were able to retreat behind their walls. An outbreak of plague in the city during the siege caused heavy losses, including that of Pericles. At the same time the Athenian fleet landed troops in the Peloponnese, winning battles at Naupactus (429 BC) and Pylos (425 BC). But these tactics could bring neither side a decisive victory. After several years of inconclusive campaigning, the moderate Athenian leader Nicias concluded the Peace of Nicias (421 BC).

In 418 BC, however, hostility between Sparta and the Athenian ally Argos led to a resumption of hostilities. Alcibiades was one of the most influential voices in persuading the Athenians to ally with Argos against the Spartans. At the Mantinea Sparta defeated the combined armies of Athens and her allies. Accordingly, Argos and the rest of the Peloponnesus was brought back under the control of Sparta. The return of peace allowed Athens to be diverted from meddling in the affairs of the Peloponnesus and to concentrate on building up the empire and putting their finances in order. Soon trade recovered and tribute began, once again, rolling into Athens. A strong &quot;peace party&quot; arose, which promoted avoidance of war and continued concentration on the economic growth of the Athenian Empire. Concentration on the Athenian Empire, however, brought Athens into conflict with another Greek state.

Ever since the formation of the Delian League in 477 BC, the island of Melos had refused to join. By refusing to join the League, however, Melos reaped the benefits of the League without bearing any of the burdens. In 425 BC, an Athenian army under Cleon attacked Melos to force the island to join the Delian League. However, Melos fought off the attack and was able to maintain its neutrality. Further conflict was inevitable and in the spring of 416 BC the mood of the people in Athens was inclined toward military adventure. The island of Melos provided an outlet for this energy and frustration for the military party. Furthermore there appeared to be no real opposition to this military expedition from the peace party. Enforcement of the economic obligations of the Delian League upon rebellious city-states and island was a means by which continuing trade and prosperity of Athens could be assured. Melos was alone among all the Cycladic Islands located in the southwest Aegean Sea had resisted joining the Delian League. This continued rebellion provided a bad example to the rest of the members of the Delian League.

The debate between Athens and Melos over the issue of joining the Delian League is presented by Thucydides in his Melian Dialogue. The debate did not in the end resolve any of the differences between Melos and Athens and Melos was invaded in 416 BC, and soon occupied by Athens. This success on the part of Athens whetted the appetite of the people of Athens for further expansion of the Athenian Empire. Accordingly, the people of Athens were ready for military action and tended to support the military party, led by Alcibiades.

Thus, in 415 BC, Alcibiades found support within the Athenian Assembly for his position when he urged that Athens launch a major expedition against Syracuse, a Peloponnesian ally in Sicily. Segesta, a town in Sicily, had requested Athenian assistance in their war with the another Sicilian town — the town of Selinus. Although Nicias was a skeptic about the Sicilian Expedition, he was appointed along with Alcibiades to lead the expedition.

However, unlike the expedition against Melos, the citizens of Athens were deeply divided over the Alcibiades' proposal for an expedition to far off Sicily. The peace party was desperate to foil Alcibiades. Thus, in June 415 BC, on the very eve of the departure of the Athenian fleet for Sicily, a band of vandals in Athens defaced the many statues of the god Hermes, that were scattered throughout the city of Athens. This action was blamed on Alcibiades and was seen as a bad omen for the coming campaign. In all likelihood, the coordinated action against the statues of Hermes was the action of the peace party. Having lost the debate on the issue, the peace party was desperate to weaken Alcibiades' hold on the people of Athens. Successfully blaming Alcibiades for the action of the vandals would have weakened Alcibiades and the war party in Athens. Furthermore, it is unlikely that Alcibiades would have deliberately defaced the statues of Hermes on the very eve of his departure with the fleet. Such defacement could only have been interpreted as a bad omen for the expedition that he had long advocated.

Even before the fleet reached Sicily, word arrived to the fleet that Alcibiades was to be arrested and charged with sacrilege of the statues of Hermes. Due to these accusations against him, Alcibiades fled to Sparta before the expedition actually landed in Sicily. When the fleet landed in Sicily and the battle was joined, the expedition was a complete disaster. The entire expeditionary force was lost and Nicias was captured and executed. This was one of the most crushing defeats in the history of Athens.

Meanwhile, Alcibiades betrayed Athens and became a chief advisor to the Spartans and began to counsel them on the best way to defeat his native land. Alcibiades persuaded the Spartans to begin building a real navy for the first time — large enough to challenge the Athenian superiority at sea. Additionally, Alcibiades persuaded the Spartans to ally themselves with their traditional foes — the Persians. As noted below, Alcibiades soon found himself in controversy in Sparta when he was accused of having seduced Timaea, the wife of Agis II, the Eurypontid king of Sparta. Accordingly, Alcibiades was required to flee from Sparta and seek the protection of the Persian Court.

Sparta had now built a fleet (with the financial help of the Persians) to challenge Athenian naval supremacy, and had found a new military leader in Lysander, who attacked Abydos and seized the strategic initiative by occupying the Hellespont, the source of Athens' grain imports. Threatened with starvation, Athens sent its last remaining fleet to confront Lysander, who decisively defeated them at Aegospotami (405 BC). The loss of her fleet threatened Athens with bankruptcy. In 404 BC Athens sued for peace, and Sparta dictated a predictably stern settlement: Athens lost her city walls, her fleet, and all of her overseas possessions. Lysander abolished the democracy and appointed in its place an oligarchy called the &quot;Thirty Tyrants&quot; to govern Athens.

Meanwhile, in Sparta, Timaea gave birth to a child. The child was given the name Leotychidas, son of Agis II, after the great grandfather of Agis II — King Leotychidas of Sparta. However, because of her alleged dalliance with Alcibiades, it was widely rumoured that the young Leotychidas was actually fathered by Alcibiades. Indeed, Agis II, himself, refused to acknowledge Leotychidas as his son until he relented in front of witnesses, on his death bed in 400 BC.

Upon the death of Agis II, Leotychidas attempted to claim the Eurypontid throne for himself. However, there was an outcry against this attempted succession. The outcry was led by the victorious navarch (admiral) Lysander, who was at the height of his influence in Sparta. Lysander argued that Leotychidas was a bastard and could not inherit the Eurypontid throne. Accordingly, Lysander backed the hereditory claim of Agesilaus, son of Agis by another wife, other than Timaea. Based on the support of Lysander, Agesilaus became the Eurypontid king as Agesilaus II, expelled Leotychidas from the country, and took over all of Agis' estates and property.

==4th century BC==

The end of the Peloponnesian War left Sparta the master of Greece, but the narrow outlook of the Spartan warrior elite did not suit them to this role. Within a few years the democratic party regained power in Athens and in other cities. In 395 BC, the Spartan rulers removed Lysander from office, and Sparta lost her naval supremacy. Athens, Argos, Thebes, and Corinth, the latter two former Spartan allies, challenged Sparta's dominance in the Corinthian War, which ended inconclusively in 387 BC. That same year Sparta shocked the Greeks by concluding the Treaty of Antalcidas with Persia. The agreement turned over the Greek cities of Ionia and Cyprus, reversing a hundred years of Greek victories against Persia. Sparta then tried to further weaken the power of Thebes, which led to a war in which Thebes allied with its old enemy Athens.

Then the Theban generals Epaminondas and Pelopidas won a decisive victory at Leuctra (371 BC). The result of this battle was the end of Spartan supremacy and the establishment of Theban dominance, but Athens herself recovered much of her former power because the supremacy of Thebes was short-lived. With the death of Epaminondas at Mantinea (362 BC) the city lost its greatest leader and his successors blundered into an ineffectual ten-year war with Phocis. In 346 BC, the Thebans appealed to Philip II of Macedon to help them against the Phocians, thus drawing Macedon into Greek affairs for the first time.

The Peloponnesian War was a radical turning point for the Greek world. Before 403 BC, the situation was more defined, with Athens and its allies (a zone of domination and stability, with a number of island cities benefiting from Athens' maritime protection), and other states outside this Athenian Empire. The sources denounce this Athenian supremacy (or hegemony) as smothering and disadvantageous.

After 403 BC, things became more complicated, with a number of cities trying to create similar empires over others, all of which proved short-lived. The first of these turnarounds was managed by Athens as early as 390 BC, allowing it to re-establish itself as a major power without regaining its former glory.

===The Fall of Sparta===

This empire was powerful but short-lived. In 405 BC, the Spartans were masters of all - of Athens' allies and of Athens itself - and their power was undivided. By the end of the century, they could not even defend their own city. As noted above, in 400 BC, Agesilaus became king of Sparta.

====Foundation of a Spartan empire====

The subject of how to reorganize the Athenian Empire as part of the Spartan Empire provoked much heated debate among Sparta's full citizens. The admiral Lysander felt that the Spartans should rebuild the Athenian empire in such a way that Sparta profited from it. Lysander tended to be too proud to take advice from others. Prior to this, Spartan law forbade the use of all precious metals by private citizens, with transactions being carried out with cumbersome iron ingots (which generally discouraged their accumulation) and all precious metals obtained by the city becoming state property. Without the Spartans' support, Lysander's innovations came into effect and brought a great deal of profit for him - on Samos, for example, festivals known as Lysandreia were organized in his honor. He was recalled to Sparta, and once there did not attend to any important matters.

Sparta refused to see Lysander or his successors dominate. Not wanting to establish a hegemony, they decided after 403 BC not to support the directives that he had made.

Agesilaus came to power by accident at the start of the 4th century BC. This accidental accession meant that, unlike the other Spartan kings, he had the advantage of a Spartan education. The Spartans at this date discovered a conspiracy against the laws of the city conducted by Cinadon and as a result concluded there were too many dangerous worldly elements at work in the Spartan state.

In the Persian Court, Alcibiades now betrayed both: helping Sparta build a navy commensurate with the Athenian navy. Alcibiades advised that a victory of Sparta over Athens was not in the best interest of the Persian Empire. Rather, long and continuous warfare between Sparta and Athens would weaken both city-states and allow the Persians to easily dominate the Helles (Greek) peninsula.

Among the war party in Athens, a belief arose that the catastrophic defeat of the military expedition to Sicily in 415 BC through 413 BC could have been avoided if Alcibiades had been allowed to lead the expedition. Thus, despite his treacherous flight to Sparta and collaboration with Sparta and, later, with the Persian Court, there arose a demand among the war party that Alcibiades be allowed to return to Athens without being arrested. Alcibiades negotiated with his supporters on the Athenian controlled island of Samos. Alcibiades felt that &quot;radical democracy&quot; was his worst enemy. Accordingly, he asked his supporters to initiate a coup to establish an oligarchy in Athens. If the coup were successful Alcibiades promised to return to Athens. In 411 BC, a successful oligarchic coup was mounted in Athens, which became known as &quot;the 400.&quot; However, a parallel attempt by the 400 to overthrow democracy in Samos failed. Alcibiades was immediately made an admiral (navarch) in the Athenian navy. Later, due to democratic pressures, the 400 was replaced by a broader oligarchy called &quot;the 5000.&quot; Alcibiades did not immediately return to Athens. In early 410 BC, Alcibiades led an Atheneian fleet of eighteen triremes (ships) against the Persian-financed Spartan fleet at Abydos near the Hellespont. The Battle of Abydos had actually begun before the arrival of Alcibiades and had been inclining slightly toward the Athenians. However, with the arrival of Alcibiades, the Athenian victory over the Spartans became a rout. Only the approach of nightfall and the movement of Persian troops to the coast where the Spartans had beached their ships, saved the Spartan navy from total destruction.

Following the advice that Alcibiades had provided the Persian Court, the Persian Empire had been playing Sparta and Athens off against each other. However, as weak as the Spartan navy was after the Battle of Abydos, the Persian navy sought to prove direct assistance to the Spartans. Thus following the Battle of Abydos, Alcibiades pursued and met the combined Spartan and Persian fleets at the Battle of Cyzicus later in the spring of 410 BC. Alcibiades and the Athenian navy won a significant victory against the combined navies.

Agesilaus, the Eurypontid King of Sparta, employed a political dynamic that played on a feeling of pan-Hellenic sentiment and launched a successful campaign against the Persian empire. Once again, the Persian empire played both sides against each other. With access to Persian gold, the Persian Court supported Sparta in the rebuilding of their navy and supported the Athenians, who used Persian subsidies to rebuild their long walls (destroyed in 404 BC) as well as to reconstruct their fleet and win a number of victories.

For most of the first years of his reign, Agesilaus had been engaged in a war against Persia in the Aegean Sea and in Asia Minor. In 394 BC, the Spartan authorities decided to force Agesilaus to return to mainland Greece. Sparta had been attacked by Thebes and other allied Greek city-states. While Agesilaus had a large part of the Spartan Army was in Asia Minor, the Spartan forces protecting the homeland had been attacked by a coalition of forces from Thebes, Corinth, Athens and Argos. At the Battle of Haliartus the Spartans had been defeated by the Thebean forces. Worse yet, Lysander, Sparta's chief military leader had been killed at Haliartus. This was the start of what became known as the &quot;Corinthian War.&quot; Upon hearing of the Spartan loss at Haliartus and of the death of Lysander, Agesilaus headed out of Asia Minor, back across the Hellspont, across Thrace and back towards Greece. At the Battle of Coronea, Agesilaus and his Spartan Army defeated a Theban force. For six more years, Sparta fought the allied city-states of Thebes, Corinth, Athens and Argos in the Corinthian War (395 BC to 387 BC). During the war, Corinth drew support from a coalition of traditional Spartan enemies — Argos, Athens and Thebes. However, the war descended into guerrilla tactics and Sparta decided that it could not fight on two fronts and so chose to ally with Persia. The long Corinthian War finally ended with the Peace of Antalcidas or the King's Peace, in which the &quot;Great King&quot; of Persia, Artaxerxes II, pronounced a &quot;treaty&quot; of peace between the various city-states of Greece which broke up all &quot;leagues&quot; of city-states on Greek mainland and in the islands of the Aegean Sea. Although this was looked upon as &quot;independence&quot; for some city-states, the effect of the unilateral &quot;treaty&quot; was highly favorable to the interests of the Persian Empire.

The Corinthian War revealed a significant dynamic that was occurring in Greece. While Athens and Sparta fought each other to exhaustion, Thebes was rising to a position of dominance among the various Greek city-states.

====The peace of Antalcidas====
[[File:Artaxerxes I.jpg|thumb|Artaxerxes I was king of the Persian Empire from 464 BC to 424 BC.]]

In 387 BC, an edict was promulgated by the Persian king, preserving the Greek cities of Asia Minor and Cyprus as well as the independence of the Greek Aegean cities, except for Lymnos, Imbros and Skyros, which were given over to Athens. It dissolved existing alliances and federations and forbade the formation of new ones. This is an ultimatum that benefited Athens only to the extent that Athens held onto three islands. While the &quot;Great King,&quot; Artaxerxes, was the guarantor of the peace, Sparta was to act as Persia's agent in enforcing the Peace. To the Persians this document is known as the &quot;King's Peace.&quot; To the Greeks, this document is known as the Peace of Antalcidas, after the Spartan diplomat, Antalcidas, who was sent to Persia to negotiate a treaty for Sparta. Sparta had been worried about the developing closer ties between Athens and Persia. Accordingly, Altalcidas was sent to Persia to get whatever agreement he could from the &quot;Great King&quot;. Accordingly, the &quot;Peace of Antalcidas is not a negotiated peace at all. Rather it is a surrender to the interests of Persia, drafted entirely along its interests.

====Spartan interventionism====

On the other hand, this peace had unexpected consequences. In accordance with it, the Boeotian League or Boeotian confederacy was dissolved in 386 BC. This confederacy was dominated by Thebes, a city hostile to the Spartan hegemony. Sparta carried out large-scale operations and peripheral interventions in Epirus and in the north of Greece, resulting in the capture of the fortress of Thebes, the Cadmea, after an expedition in the Chalcidice and the capture of Olynthos. It was a Theban politician who suggested to the Spartan general Phoibidas that Sparta should seize Thebes itself. This act was sharply condemned, though Sparta eagerly ratified this unilateral move by Phoibidas. The Spartan attack was successful and Thebes was placed under Spartan control.

====Clash with Thebes====

In 378 BC, the reaction to Spartan control over Thebes was broken by a popular uprising within Thebes. Elsewhere in Greece, the reaction against Spartan hegemony began when, Sphodrias, another Spartan general, tried to carry out a surprise attack on the Piraeus. Although the gates of Piraeus were no longer fortified, Sphodrias was driven off before the Piraeus. Back in Sparta, Sphodrias was put on trial for the failed attack, but was acquitted by the Spartan court. Nonetheless, the attempted attack triggered an alliance between Athens and Thebes. Sparta would now have to fight them both together. Athens was trying to recover from their defeat in the Peloponnesian War at the hands of Sparta's &quot;navarch&quot; (admiral), Lysander in the disaster of 404 BC. The rising spirit of rebellion against Sparta also fueled Thebes' attempt to restore the former Boeotian confederacy. In Boeotia, Thebian leaders, Pelopidas and Epaminondas, reorganized the Thebian army and began to free the towns of Boeotia from their Spartan garrisons, one by one, and incorporated these towns into the revived Boeotian League. Pelopidas won a great victory for Thebes over a much larger Spartan force in the Battle of Tegyra in 375 BC.

Thebian authority grew so spectacularly in such a short time that Athens came to mistrust the growing Theban power. Athens began to consolidate its position again through the formation of a second Athenian League. Attention was drawn to growing power of Thebes, when it began interfering in the political affairs of its neighbor, Phocis and, particularly, after Thebes razed the city of Platea in 375 BC Platea had been a long-term ally of Athens. The destruction of Platea caused Athens to negotiate an alliance with Sparta against Thebes, in that same year of 375 BC. In 371, the Thebian army, led by Epaminondas, inflicted a bloody defeat on Spartan forces at Battle of Leuctra. Sparta lost a large part of its army and 400 of its 2,000 citizen-troops. The Battle of Leuctra was a watershed in Greek history. Epaminondas' victory over the Sparta forces at Leuctra ended a long history of Spartan military prestige and dominance over Greece and the period of Spartan hegemony was over. However, Spartan hegemony was not replaced by Thebian, but rather Athenian hegemony.

====The rise of Athens====
=====Return to the 5th century BC=====

The Athenians forbade themselves any return to the situation in the 5th century. In Aristotle's decree, Athens claimed its goal was to prevent Spartan hegemony, with the Spartans clearly denounced as &quot;warmongers&quot;. Athens' hegemony was no longer a centralized system but an alliance in which the allies had a voice. The Athenians did not sit on the council of the allies, nor was this council headed by an Athenian. It met regularly and served as a political and military counterweight to Athens. This new league was a quite moderate and much looser organization.

=====Financing the league=====

It was important to erase the bad memories of the former league. Its financial system was not adopted, with no tribute being paid. Instead, ''syntaxeis'' were used, irregular contributions as and when Athens and its allies needed troops, collected for a precise reason and spent as quickly as possible. These contributions were not taken to Athens — unlike the 5th century BC system, there was no central exchequer for the league — but to the Athenian generals themselves.

The Athenians had to make their own contribution to the alliance, the ''eisphora''. They reformed how this tax was paid, creating a system in advance, the ''Proseiphora'', in which the richest individuals had to pay the whole sum of the tax then be reimbursed by other contributors. This system was quickly assimilated into a liturgy.

=====Athenian hegemony halted=====

This league responded to a real and present need. On the ground, however, the situation within the league proved to have changed little from that of the 5th century BC, with Athenian generals doing what they wanted and able to extort funds from the league. Alliance with Athens again looked unattractive and the allies complained.

The main reasons for the eventual failure were structural. This alliance was only valued out of fear of Sparta, which evaporated after Sparta's fall in 371 BC, losing the alliance its ''sole raison d'etre''. The Athenians no longer had the means to fullfil their ambitions, and found it difficult merely to finance their own navy, let alone that of an entire alliance, and so could not properly defend their allies. Thus, the tyrant of Pherae was able to destroy a number of cities with impunity. From 360, Athens lost its reputation for invincibility and a number of allies (such as Byzantium and Naxos in 364) decided to secede.

In 357 BC, the revolt against the league spread, and between 357 and 355, Athens had to face war against its allies, a war whose issue was marked by a decisive intervention by the king of Persia in the form of an ultimatum to Athens, demanding that Athens recognise its allies' independence under penalty of Persia's sending 200 triremes against Athens. Athens had to renounce the war and leave the confederacy to weaken itself more and more. The Athenians had failed in all their plans and were unable to propose a durable alliance.

====Theban hegemony - tentative and with no future====
=====5th century BC Boeotian confederacy (447–386 BC)=====

This was not Thebes' first attempt at hegemony. It had been the most important city of Boeotia and the center of the previous Boeotian confederacy of 447, resurrected since 386.

That confederacy is well known to us from a papyrus found at Oxyrhyncus and known as &quot;The Anonyme of Thebes&quot;. Thebes headed it and set up a system under which charges were divided up between the different cities of the confederacy. Citizenship was defined according to wealth, and Thebes counted 11,000 active citizens.

It was divided up into 11 districts, each providing a federal magistrate called a ''Boeotarch'', a certain number of council members, 1,000 ''hoplites'' and 100 horsemen. From the 5th century BC the alliance could field an infantry force of 11,000 men, in addition to an elite corps and a light infantry numbering 10,000; but its real power derived from its cavalry force of 1,100, commanded by a federal magistrate independent of local commanders. It also had a small fleet that played a part in the Peloponnesian War by providing 25 triremes for the Spartans. At the end of the conflict, the fleet consisted of 50 triremes and was commanded by a ''navarch''.

All this constituted a significant enough force that the Spartans were happy to see the Boeotian confederacy dissolved by the king's peace. This dissolution, however, did not last, and in the 370s there was nothing to stop the Thebans (who had lost the Cadmea to Sparta in 382 BC) from reforming this confederacy.
[[File:362BCThebanHegemony.png|thumb|The Theban Hegemony, 371-362 BC.]]

=====Theban reconstruction=====

Pelopidas and Epaminondas endowed Thebes with democratic institutions similar to those of Athens, the Thebans revived the title of &quot;Boetarch&quot; lost in the Persian king's peace and - with victory at Leuctra and the destruction of Spartan power - the pair achieved their stated objective of renewing the confederacy. Epaminondas rid the Peloponnesus of pro-Spartan oligarchies, replacing them with pro-Theban democracies, constructed cities, and rebuilt a number of those destroyed by Sparta. He equally supported the reconstruction of the city of Messene thanks to an invasion of Laconia that also allowed him to liberate the helots and give them Messene as a capital.

He decided in the end to constitute small confederacies all round the Peloponnessus, forming an Arcadian confederacy (The king's peace had destroyed a previous Arcadian confederacy and put Messene under Spartan control.)

=====Confrontation between Athens and Thebes=====

The strength of the Boeotian League explains Athens' problems with her allies in the second Athenian League. Epaminondas succeeded in convincing his countrymen to build a fleet of 100 triremes to pressure cities into leaving the Athenian league and joining a Boeotian maritime league. Epaminondas and Pelopidas also reformed the army of Thebes to introduce new and more effective means of fighting. Thus, the Thebian army was able to carry the day against the coalition of other Greek states at the battle of Leuctra in 371 BC and the battle of Mantinea in 362 BC.
[[File:Ivanov, Andrey - Pelopidas's death - 1805-1806.jpg|thumb|&quot;Pelopida's death&quot; by Andrewy Ivanov, 1805-1806.]]

Sparta also remained an important power in the face of Thebian strength. However, some of the cities allied with Sparta turned against her, because of Thebes. In 367 BC, both Sparta and Athens sent delegates to Artaxerxes II, the Great King of Persia. These delegates sought to have the Artaxerxes, once again, declare Greek independence and a unilateral common peace, just as he had done in twenty years earlier in 387 BC. That unilateral peace treaty, commonly called the &quot;King's Peace&quot;, or the &quot;Peace of Antalcidas&quot;, breaking all bonds between the various city-states of Greece. As noted above, this had meant the destruction of the Boeotian League in 387 BC. Sparta and Athens now hoped the same thing would happen with a new declaration of a similar &quot;Kings Peace&quot; by the Great King of the Persian Empire. Thebes sent Pelopidas to argue against this attempt at a new unilateral &quot;peace treaty&quot; guaranteed by the Persian Empire. Now however, twenty years later in 367 BC, the Great King was convinced by Pelopidas and the Thebian diplomats that Thebes, and the Boeotian League, would be the best agent of Persian interests in Greece. Accordingly, the Great King did not issue a new &quot;King's Peace.&quot; Thus, to deal with Thebes, Athens and Sparta were thrown back on their own resources. Thebes, meanwhile, expanded their influence beyond the bounds of Boeotia. In 364 BC, the Thebeans defeated the army of Alexander of Pherae in the Battle of Cynoscephalae, located in southeastern Thessaly in northern Greece. Pelopidas led this Thebian Army to Cynoscephalae. However, during the battle, Pelopides was killed.

The confederal framework of Sparta's relationship with her allies was really an artificial one, since it attempted to bring together cities that had never been able to agree on much at all in the past. Such was the case with the cities of Tegea and Mantinea, which re-allied in the Arcardian confederacy. The Mantineans received the support of the Athenians and the Tegeans that of the Thebans. In 362 BC Thebian general, Epaminondas, led a Thebian army against a coalition of Athenian, Spartan, Elisian, Mantinean and Achean forces. Battle was joined at Mantinea. The Thebans prevailed, but this triumph was short-lived, for Epaminondas died in the battle, stating that &quot;I bequeath to Thebes two daughters, the victory of Leuctra and the victory at Mantinea&quot;.

Despite the victory at Mantinea, in the end, the Thebans abandoned their policy of intervention in the Peloponnesus. This event is looked upon as a watershed in Greek history. Thus, Xenophon concludes his history of the Greek world at this point, in 362 BC. The end of this period was even more confused than its beginning. Greece had failed and, according to Xenophon, the history of the Greek world was no longer intelligible.

The idea of hegemony disappeared. From 362 BC onward, there was no longer a single city that could exert hegemonic power in Greece. The Spartans were greatly weakened; the Athenians were in no condition to operate their navy, and after 365 no longer had any allies; Thebes could only exert an ephemeral dominance, and had the means to defeat Sparta and Athens but not to be a major power in Asia Minor.

Other forces also intervened, such as the Persian king, who was appointed himself as arbitrator between the Greek cities, with the tacit agreement of the cities themselves. This situation reinforced the conflicts and there was a proliferation of civil wars, with the confederal framework a repeated trigger for wars. One war led to another, each longer and more bloody, and the cycle could not be broken. Hostilities even took place during winter for the first time, with the 370 invasion of Laconia.

===Rise of Macedon===

Thebes sought to maintain its position until finally eclipsed by the rising power of Macedon in 346 BC. The energetic leadership within Macedon began in 359 BC when Phillip of Macedonia was made regent for his nephew, Amyntas. Within a short time, Phillip was acclaimed king as, Phillip II of Macedonia, in his own right with succession of the throne established on his own heirs (Alexander the Great).

----

As we head into the modern period, it is useful to divide this juncture of time into 4 main periods:

==1699-1798==

The first period, 1699-1798, was both a century of decline and of reform. The three great Muslim empires in this period, the Ottoman, the Safavid, and the Mughal, began to suffer economic and political setbacks.   In 1699 (because of the signing of the Treaty of Karlowitz), the Ottoman empire lost extensive territories for the first time: they had to surrender Hungary and Transylvania to Austria, and the Ukraine to Poland. 

==1798-1922==

The second period, 1798-1922, was characterized by European domination which began with Napoleon’s expedition to Egypt in 1798, followed shortly thereafter by British occupation of Egypt after the French were driven out. The French, however, would go on to occupy most of North Africa and Syria. The notorious Sykes-Picot Treaty which was concluded between Britain and France in 1916 gave France control of, or in the terminology of the day, designated France the protector of Arab Syria and Kurdish Mosul province, while Britain was designated the protector of Baghdad and Basra provinces.  Up to the time of signing this treaty, the  European powers, particularly the British, had been promising the Arabs that they would be allowed to form independent nations in return for helping the British to oust the Ottoman Turks, and as a consequence defeat Germany and her allies during the First World War.  This treachery on the part of the British and the French was not easily forgotten or forgiven, as one might expect.  In 1920, the League of Nations (the forerunner of the United Nations) gave its seal of approval to the terms of this treaty and awarded France and Britain mandates to rule the newly-created Arab states in 1920.

Before the period of colonialism, there was no concept of a territorial state in the Muslim world.   Muslims were conscious of ethnic, linguistic, and regional differences among themselves, but they saw themselves as politically united first under the caliphate and then the later empires and sultanates.  The nation-state, and thus nationalism, arose in the Muslim world only as a consequence of colonialism.  In a number of cases, some of these nation-states were created in an ad hoc and arbitrary manner to serve the interests of the colonizers: For example, British interests in Persian Gulf oil led to the creation of Kuwait; France carved Lebanon out of Syria to create a friendly Arab Christian state; and Britain created Jordan to reward King Abdullah, who had fought with the British during World War I.  In many cases, this gratuitous recarving of territory aggravated already existing ethnic, linguistic, and religious tensions as in the case of Lebanon, Pakistan, Palestine, and Malaysia, for example.  In some cases, secular nationalism focused on territorial boundaries arose as a consequence of the creation of nation-states, it always remained in competition with a broader religious identity, grounded in Islamic culture.

Specific actions that the colonial powers took against religious institutions had disastrous consequences afterwards and helped create an Islamic backlash.  For example, SHARI‘A COURTS WERE ABOLISHED in many countries by the European colonizers.  This in fact planted the seeds for future fundamentalist reaction against governments in a number of Islamic countries which, due to the abolition of the Shari‘a courts and the adoption of European legal codes, were now no longer seen as following and implementing Islamic law.  The system of charitable endowments (waqf) which financially supported the madrasas and had allowed the madrasas and their professors to maintain independence from the various ruling authorities was dismantled by the British, for example, in Egypt.  As a result, al-Azhar became a governmental institution.  These policies were continued by the post-colonial governments which came to power after the departure of the British, which wanted to restrict the freedom of the ulama and the intelligentsia in general.  The rector (our university president) of al-Azhar is now on the government payroll and widely regarded as a spokesperson for the government.

==1922-1962==

The third period, 1922-1962, was one of decolonization and the origins of nationalism and of political Islam.  In 1922, Egypt gained limited independence from the British.  In 1923, The Republic of Turkey was formed when the Ottoman sultan was sent into exile and the empire dismembered.  In 1924, the caliphate based in Istanbul was abolished by the newly formed secular Republic of Turkey under Kemal Ataturk which ended the Ottoman Empire.  Kemal Ataturk was a zealous secularist and he took a number of drastic steps to initiate modernization of the country, which he equated with adoption of Western ideas and customs and the abandonment of traditional Islamic practices and habits.  Thus, he switched from the use of the Arabic script to write Turkish to Latin.  He banned traditional Islamic forms of clothing, such as the Fez for men and the veil for women, and secularized the school system.  Kemalism, as this deliberate adoption of secularism was called, is still the reigning ideology in Turkey today.

Most Muslim countries under European colonialism gained their independence between 1945-1960.  Another crucial event that occurred in this period was the creation of the Jewish state of Israel on Palestinian soil in 1948 by the League of Nations, which led to the homelessness of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians.  This was an event that further embittered the attitudes of Arabs and Muslims toward the West.

==1962 to the present==

And finally the fourth period, 1962 to the present: Nasser’s revolution. This is a period of continuing nationalism and the consolidation of political Islamic movements.  The secular nationalists believed in pan-Arabism; that is the overall unity of the Arab world despite their separation into independent nation-states. However, nationalism began to give way to religiously resurgent movements.  The most dramatic of these revolutions was that of the Ayatollah Khomeini in Iran in 1978-79.

These cataclysmic events fostered the rise of political Islam in this period, the early 20th century.  Some have referred to these highly politicized religious groups as neo-revivalists; the more usual term today is Islamist.

==JUST A FEW COMMENTS ON TERMINOLOGY:==

Scholars in the field refer to Islamic revivalism, Islamic resurgence, political Islam, and Islamism.  Another term that is used is Islamic fundamentalism.  We must remember that fundamentalism was a term coined in the 19th century to refer to particularly Protestant Christian movements which insisted on the acceptance of the Bible as the literal word of God.  In Islam, scriptural inerrancy is simply not an issue.  A Muslim by definition is someone who accepts the Qur'an as the literal word of God; whether one is a conservative or liberal Muslim, there is a consensus on this issue; one cannot be a believing Muslim without accepting that the Qur'an is a divine, revealed text.  From this point of view, it doesn't make sense to talk of Muslim fundamentalists as a separate group within Islam.  With this caveat, this warning, in mind, it is better to speak of Islamic revivalist or resurgent movements in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and, particularly in the 20th century, to talk about political Islam or Islamism.

Political Islam can have many faces; some Islamists take the more militant and radical route, and these are the ones who regularly get into the media today.  The earliest such groups are the Muslim brotherhood, established by Hasan al-Banna (1906-49) in Egypt and the Jamaat-i Islami (“the Islamic society”) established by Mawlana Abul ‘Ala Mawdudi (1903-79) of India.  Both men were personally pious, highly educated men both in the traditional Islamic sciences and in Western learning.  Both came to react strongly against British imperialism, under whose shadow they lived a part of their lives.

Also importantly, they were reacting against a local elite that under European colonial influence had become Westernized to the extent that members of this elite spoke the language of the colonizers, imitated their dress and customs, and considered themselves secular.  Thus they were fighting the influence of both external and internal forces.  Islamists are both religious and social activists; both al-Banna and Mawdudi were very effective at organizing supporters at the grass-roots level.  They set up health clinics and social welfare projects that helped in gaining the loyalty of a cross-section of the middle and working class people.  The activities of these Islamists may be described as being part of a religious, socio-political protest movement that was committed to fighting political corruption and religious laxity, through violence if necessary.

After the departure of the foreign colonial rulers, they continued their opposition to the local governments that were set up, often by the departing colonizers; these local ruling elites were thus perceived as representing Western interests at the expense of national interests.  If you have studied anything about modern Middle Eastern politics and history,  you will know that Arab governments that have ruled after the Second World War have off and on been primarily monarchies and military regimes.  As far as the Islamists were concerned, these governments, often corrupt and despotic, had no legitimacy and therefore they had a sacred mission to set up a just and righteous government that would govern according to Islamic principles.  If they had to resort to violence and lay down their lives for it; they were quite prepared to do so.  For them, jihad primarily came to mean the equivalent of just war or holy war to fight those whom they regarded as compromising Islamic principles.   Many Islamists believe in what Mawdudi called theo-democracy; in other words, a democracy that called for power-sharing through consultation, according to the Qur’anic concept of shura.  They also believed in elections, because the Islamic principle of  bay‘a which is a pledge an individual gives to his or her ruler, gives the right to the people to express their approval or disapproval of the government.  But it would have to be an Islamic democracy, subject to the tenets of the religious law, the Shari‘a, which, as interpreted by them, was practically an unchanging body of law which mandated a specific form of government.  This government, as Mawdudi pronounced, was founded on the notion of God’s sovereignty, in Arabic al-hakimiyyah.</text>

== How Do I Upload A PDF? ==



I have created a PDF of Beyond Blender Render. However when attempting to upload it appeared that it would only allow images on the proper form. Could it be licensed as my own work? Is there a different form I should be using?

:Consider uploading it to http://wikisource.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&amp;bookcmd=book_creator&amp;referer=Main+Page

:[[User:Anna Frodesiak|Anna Frodesiak]] ([[User talk:Anna Frodesiak|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Anna Frodesiak|contribs]]) 22:47, 31 October 2012 (UTC)
*On http://www.blender.org/ it says right at the top: &quot;Blender is the free open source 3D content creation suite, available for all major operating systems under the GNU General Public License.&quot;  This means that any screenshots of this software must also be published on that license.  So you cannot claim that part as your own work.  Consider making the whole of your book be licensed the same way, under GNU General Public License, that would be the simplest. --[[User:Mareklug|Mareklug]] ([[User talk:Mareklug|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Mareklug|contribs]]) 23:04, 31 October 2012 (UTC)

== Hapangry template ==

Hi Downdate,
Could you check your template please?
The bulletin board posting of it might need a look to.
It looks as though the image has been removed from part of it.
I'm not an experienced editor and there's the possiblity I could be the person who deleted it.
I don't think it was me..I'm pretty sure you have to save changes elsewhere than the sandbox to make them stick.
but I was Examining and experimenting with the code in my sandbox earlier, and now I see that the image is gone.
I'm a bit nervous about trying to fix it. So sorry if this turns out to be my doing.
oh, and by the way...How can I view the history of a page I didnt make?

Does hitting the cancel button not cancel an edit?

      <comment>Editing my to-do list.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">I'm CharmlessCoin. I use Wikibooks quite regularly to learn programming languages. In particular, C. I've noticed some gaps in the books I use, and hope to fill them a little bit when I have free time.

Current Ideas/Projects/Notes to remind myself:

* The C programming book is currently lacking exercises. Either find links to good exercises (Project Euler, r/dailyprogrammer, etc.), or come up with some.

* In short, I think the C book needs major work done. I'm not sure how exactly to go about doing this without a group consensus on how to standardize the book.

I suppose I could copy over most of the book and do some standardizing work on it myself, but that seems a little counter-intuitive in a wiki.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">digital circuit:
A digital circuit is a circuit where the signal must be one of two discrete levels. Each level is interpreted as one of two different states (for example, on/off, 0/1, true/false). Digital circuits use transistors to create logic gates in order to perform Boolean logic. This logic is the foundation of digital electronics and computer processing. Digital circuits are less susceptible to noise or degradation in quality than analog circuits. It is also easier to perform error detection and correction with digital signals. To automate the process of designing digital circuits, engineers use electronic design automation (EDA) tools, a type of software that optimizes the logic in a digital circuit.

The goal of this text is to review the design techniques for digital circuits starting from NAND gates and Boolean Algebra. The end result is a student should be able to design these types of circuits:

*[[:w:Combinational_logic|Combinatory Logic Circuits]] directly respond to input change
*[[:w:Sequential_logic|Sequential Networks]] remember the present state and combine with input changes to create a new state
*[[:w:Sequential_logic#Synchronous_sequential_logic|Synchronous Sequential Network Design]] (Mealy and Moore) is a method of designing complex sequential logic circuits that only look at inputs at times determined by a clock. This results in circuits with fewer glitches, more predictability but are slower and use more hardware. 
*[[:w:Sequential_logic#Asynchronous_sequential_logic|Aynchronous Sequential Network Design]] is a method of designing complex sequential logic circuits that are very fast, simple and respond to inputs at speeds determined by the devices themselves rather than a clock. They are [[w:Asynchronous_circuit#Asynchronous_CPU|harder to design]] but are closer to nature (including to brain operation)

Throughout this book a '''graph''' ''G(V,E)'' is a pair of sets, where ''E'' is a subset of pairs of elements of the set ''V''. The elements of ''V'' are called '''vertices''', and the elements of ''E'' '''edges'''. For every edge ''(a,b)'' in ''E'' we call ''b'' a neighbor of ''a''. A '''graph w/boundary''' is a graph w/chosen subset ''∂G'' of boundary nodes.

A '''surface''' ''S'' is a topological space, such that around its every point ''p'' there is an open set ''U'' homeomorphic to the open unit disc ''D'':

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases}
p\in U, \\
\phi_U(p) = 0, \\
\phi_U(U) = \mathbf{D}.
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

or neighborhood homeomorphic to the half of the unit disc for the boundary nodes: 

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases}
p\in U, \\
\phi_U(p) = 0, \\
\phi_U(U) = \mathbf{D}\cap\{z: \Im z \ge 0 \}, \\
\phi_U(U\cap\partial S) = (-1,1).
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

A '''simple arc''' in a surface ''S'' is an image of a homeomorphism of the interval ''[0,1]'' to the surface. An '''embedding''' of a graph ''G(V,E)'' to a surface ''S'' is a representation of the vertices ''V'' of the graph by distinct points of ''S'', w/the boundary of the graph on the boundary of the surface and the edges ''E'' by the simple non-intersecting and non-touching simple arcs connecting corresponding endpoints.

For a graph ''G'' embedded in a surface ''S'' the connected components of ''S\E'' are called faces. The embedding is '''proper''' if the faces are simply connected, except possibly the unbounded infinite one. The embedded graph ''G&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;'' is called dual to graph ''G'' if its vertices are located in distinct (and all) faces of graph ''G'' and vice versa, and its edges connect vertices w/corresponding adjacent faces. The edges of the graph ''G'' and its dual ''G*'' are in the ''1-to-1'' correspondence. The embedded graph and its dual can be unified in a single construction of the '''medial graph''' ''M(G)'' defined later in the book. It will be clear from the context how to slightly modify the definitions for graphs w/boundary.

A graph that can be embedded in the plane or the sphere is called '''planar graph'''.</text>

In this section the endpoints of edges of a considered graph can have an order, making it a '''directed graph'''. A graph with positive function/vector defined on its edges is called  '''weighted graph'''. 

'''[[../Random walk|Random walk]]''' of a particle on a graph G with discrete time is the following process:

* At moment ''t = 0'' the particle occupies a vertex ''v'' of ''G''. 
* At moment ''t = n+1'' the particle moves to a neighbor of its position at the moment ''t = n'' w/probability proportional to the weight of the edge connecting/pointing to the neighbor.

Choosing a subset of vertices of a graph as '''boundary''', the '''[[../harmonic measure|harmonic measure]]''' of a subset ''S'' of the boundary is the function/vector on vertices of ''G'' that equals the probability that a particle, starting its random walk at a vertex ''p'', occupies a boundary vertex in the set ''S'' before a boundary vertex not in ''S''.

It follows from the definition that the harmonic measure at ''p'' of a single boundary node ''b'' equals to the sum over the finite paths through interior from ''p'' to ''b'':

: &lt;math&gt;
u_b(p) = \sum_{p\xrightarrow[]{path} b}(\prod_{e\in path}w(e)/\prod_{q\in (path-\{b\})}\sum_{q\rightarrow r}w(qr)),
&lt;/math&gt; 

or

: &lt;math&gt;
u_b(p) = \sum_{p\xrightarrow[]{path} b}\prod_{e=(qr)\in path}\frac{w(e)}{\sum_{q\rightarrow r}w(qr)}.
&lt;/math&gt; 

Note, that an edge or a vertex may appear multiple times in a path.

The '''[[../Brownian motion|Brownian motion]]''' is a continuous/limiting analog of the random walk. It follows from the averaging property of the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace_operator|Laplace operator] that the hitting probabilities of a particle under Brownian motion are described by harmonic functions, defined in the previous section. The harmonic functions are [[../conformaly invariant|conformaly invariant]].</text>

Harmonic functions can be defined as solutions of differential and difference [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace%27s_equation| Laplace equation] as follows.

A function/vector ''u'' defined on the vertices of a graph w/boundary is harmonic if its value at every interior vertex ''p'' is the average of its values at neighboring vertices. That is,

: &lt;math&gt;
u(p) = \sum_{p\rightarrow q} \gamma(pq)u(q)/\sum_{p\rightarrow q} \gamma(pq).
&lt;/math&gt;

Or, alternatively, ''u'' satisfies [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirchhoff%27s_circuit_laws| Kirchhoff's law] for potential at every interior vertex ''p'':

: &lt;math&gt;
\sum_{p\rightarrow q} \gamma(pq)(u(p) - u (q)) = 0.
&lt;/math&gt;

A harmonic function on a manifold ''M'' is a twice continuously differentiable function u : M → R, where ''u'' satisfies Laplace equation:

: &lt;math&gt;
\Delta_\gamma u = \nabla\cdot(\gamma\nabla u) = 0.
&lt;/math&gt;

A harmonic function defined on open subset of the plane satisfies the following differential equation:

: &lt;math&gt;
(\gamma u_x)_x+(\gamma u_y)_y = 0.
&lt;/math&gt;

The harmonic functions satisfy the following properties:

* mean-value property 
The value of a harmonic function is a weighted average of its values at the neighbor vertices,

* maximum principle 
Corollary: the maximum (and the minimum) of a harmonic functions occurs on the boundary of the graph or the manifold,

* harmonic conjugate
One can use the system of '''Cauchy-Riemann equations''' 

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases}
\gamma u_x = v_y, \\
\gamma u_y = - v_x
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

to define the harmonic conjugate.

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_continuation| Analytic/harmonic continuation] is an extension of the domain of a given harmonic function.

[[File:Harmonic continuation.jpg|thumbnail| Harmonic/analytic continuation on a square grid]]

=== Dirichlet problem ===
Harmonic functions minimize the energy integral or the sum 

: &lt;math&gt;
\int_{\Omega}\gamma|\nabla u|^2 \mbox{ and } \sum_{e=(p,q)\in E} \gamma(e)(u(p) - u (q))^2
&lt;/math&gt; 

if the values of the functions are fixed at the boundary of the domain or the network in the continuous and discrete models respectively. The minimizing function/vector is the solution of the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirichlet_problem Dirichlet problem] with the prescribed boundary data.</text>

Same place, different day. Knut is sitting at his desk again, staring at a blank paper in front of him, while nervously playing with a pen in his right hand. Just a few hours left to hand in his essay and he has not written a word. All of a sudden he smashes his fist on the table and cries out: &quot;I need a plan!&quot;
같은 장소, 다른 날짜. 크누트씨는 또 책상에 앉아 있고, 앞의 빈 종이를 쳐다보면서 신경질적으로 오른손의 펜을 놀리고 있다. 리포트를 제출해야하는 시간이 고작 몇 시간 밖에 안 남았는데 한 글자도 쓰지 못한 것이다. 그러다 갑다기 상에 주먹을 내리치며 이렇게 외친다. &quot;계획을 세워야겠어!&quot;

That thing Knut is confronted with is something everyone of us encounters in his daily life. He has got a problem - and he does not really know how to solve it. But [[Cognitive_Psychology_and_Cognitive_Neuroscience/Problem_Solving_from_an_Evolutionary_Perspective#What_is_a_problem|what exactly is a problem?]] Are there strategies to solve problems? These are just a few of the questions we want to answer in this chapter.
크누트씨가 직면한 상황은 모두가 일상생활에서 마주치게 되는 종류의 상황이다. 그는 해결해야할 문제가 있고, 그 문제를 어떻게 해결해야하는지 잘 모른다. 하지만 [[Cognitive_Psychology_and_Cognitive_Neuroscience/Problem_Solving_from_an_Evolutionary_Perspective#What_is_a_problem|문제라는게 정확히 뭔가?]] 문제를 해결할 전략들이 있는가? 이런 것들이 우리가 이 장에서 답하고자 하는 질문이다.

We begin our chapter by giving a short description of what psychologists regard as a problem. Afterwards we are going to present different approaches towards problem solving, starting with [[Cognitive_Psychology_and_Cognitive_Neuroscience/Problem_Solving_from_an_Evolutionary_Perspective#Restructuring_-_The_Gestalt_Approach|gestalt psychologists]] and ending with modern [[Cognitive_Psychology_and_Cognitive_Neuroscience/Problem_Solving_from_an_Evolutionary_Perspective#Problem_Solving_as_a_Search_Problem|search strategies]] connected to artificial intelligence. In addition we will also consider [[Cognitive_Psychology_and_Cognitive_Neuroscience/Problem_Solving_from_an_Evolutionary_Perspective#How_do_Experts_Solve_Problems|how experts do solve problems]] and finally we will have a closer look at two topics: The [[Cognitive_Psychology_and_Cognitive_Neuroscience/Problem_Solving_from_an_Evolutionary_Perspective#Neurophysiological_Background|neurophysiological background]] on the one hand and the question what kind of role can be assigned to [[Cognitive_Psychology_and_Cognitive_Neuroscience/Problem_Solving_from_an_Evolutionary_Perspective#The_Evolutionary_Perspective|evolution]] regarding problem solving on the other.
이 장의 앞부분에서 심리학자들이 무엇을 문제로 여기는지 짧게 설명할 것이다. 다음에는 [[Cognitive_Psychology_and_Cognitive_Neuroscience/Problem_Solving_from_an_Evolutionary_Perspective#Restructuring_-_The_Gestalt_Approach|게슈탈트 심리학자]]로 시작해서 인공지능과 연결되는 현대의 [[Cognitive_Psychology_and_Cognitive_Neuroscience/Problem_Solving_from_an_Evolutionary_Perspective#Problem_Solving_as_a_Search_Problem|탐색 전략]]까지, 문제해결을 향한 여러가지 접근들을 살펴볼 것이다. 그 외에도 [[Cognitive_Psychology_and_Cognitive_Neuroscience/Problem_Solving_from_an_Evolutionary_Perspective#How_do_Experts_Solve_Problems|전문가들은 어떻게 문제를 해결하는지]] 생각해볼 것이고, 최종적으로는 2가지 주제에 대해 자세히 살펴볼 것인데, 하나는 [[Cognitive_Psychology_and_Cognitive_Neuroscience/Problem_Solving_from_an_Evolutionary_Perspective#Neurophysiological_Background|신경생리학적 배경]]이고, 다른 하나는 문제해결의 관점에서 [[Cognitive_Psychology_and_Cognitive_Neuroscience/Problem_Solving_from_an_Evolutionary_Perspective#The_Evolutionary_Perspective|진화]]에 무슨 역할이 부여될 수 있는지에 대한 질문이다.

The most basic definition is “A problem is any given situation that differs from a desired goal”. This definition is very useful for discussing problem solving in terms of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution evolutionary] adaptation, as it allows to understand every aspect of (human or animal) life as a problem. This includes issues like finding food in harsh winters, remembering where you left your provisions, making decisions about which way to go, learning, repeating and varying all kinds of complex movements, and so on. Though all these problems were of crucial importance during the evolutionary process that created us the way we are, they are by no means solved exclusively by humans. We find a most amazing variety of different solutions for these problems in nature (just consider, e.g., by which means a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bat#Anatomy bat] hunts its prey, compared to a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider#Predatory_techniques spider]). For this essay we will mainly focus on those problems that are not solved by animals or evolution, that is, all kinds of abstract problems (e.g. playing chess). Furthermore, we will not consider those situations as problems that have an obvious solution: Imagine Knut decides to take a sip of coffee from the mug next to his right hand. He does not even have to think about how to do this. This is not because the situation itself is trivial (a robot capable of recognising the mug, deciding whether it is full, then grabbing it and moving it to Knut’s mouth would be a highly complex machine) but because in the context of all possible situations it is so trivial that it no longer is a problem our consciousness needs to be bothered with. The problems we will discuss in the following all need some conscious effort, though some seem to be solved without us being able to say how exactly we got to the solution. Still we will find that often the strategies we use to solve these problems are applicable to more basic problems, too.
문제에 대한 가장 기본적인 정의는 &quot;원하는 목표와는 다른 현재 상황&quot;이다. 이 정의는 사람이나 동물의 삶의 모든 측면을 문제로 이해할 수 있게 해주기 때문에, 문제해결을 [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution 진화적] 적응의 면에서 논의하기에 아주 유용하다. 여기에는 추운 겨울에 음식을 찾거나, 어디에 식량을 두었는지 기억하거나, 어떤 길로 갈지 결정하고, 모든 종류의 복잡한 운동을 배우고, 반복하고, 바꾸는 등의 일들이 포함된다. 이런 모든 문제들은 인간의 모습을 만든 진화적 과정 동안 결정적인 중요성을 갖고 있었지만, 결코 인간만이 이런 문제들을 해결한다고 볼 수는 없다. 자연에서는 문제를 해결하는 방법들에 대한 가장 놀라운 다양성을 볼 수 있다([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bat#Anatomy 박쥐]와, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider#Predatory_techniques 거미]의 사냥법의 차이에 대해서 생각해보라). 이 글에서는 동물이나 진화는 잘 해결하려고 하지 않는 문제, 즉 체스를 두는 등의 추상적 문제에 주로 초점을 맞출 것이다. 더 나아가 우리는 이런 상황을 명확한 해법이 있는 문제로 보지 않을 것이다.(?) 크누트씨가 오른손으로 머그잔을 잡아 커피 한 모금을 마시려고 했다고 하자.(?) 그는 어떻게 하는지 생각할 필요조차 없다. 이것은 상황 그 자체가 시시하기 때문이 아니라(머그잔을 인식하고, 가득차있는지 확인하고, 크누트씨의 입으로 옮기는 로봇은 매우 복잡한 기계가 될 것이다), 가능한 모든 상황의 맥락에서 시시해지기 때문에 더 이상 의식이 신경써야할 문제가 아니기 때문이다. 다음에서 논의할 문제들은 모두 의식적인 노력을 필요로 하는 것이다. 어떤 것은 어떻게 풀었는지 설명을 못하면서 풀리긴 하지만 말이다. 또 우리가 이런 문제를 풀 때 쓰이는 전략들이 더 기본적인 문제들에 적용될 수 있는 경우가 많다는 것도 볼 수 있을 것이다.

Non-trivial, abstract problems can be divided into two groups:
시시하지 않고, 추상적인 문제는 두 가지로 분류할 수 있다.

===잘 정의된 문제===
For many abstract problems it is possible to find an [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm algorithmic] solution. We call all those problems well-defined that can be properly formalised, which comes along with the following properties:
많은 추상적 문제는 [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm 알고리즘적] 해법을 찾아서 푸는 것이 가능하다. 이런 문제를 제대로 형식화될 수 있도록 잘 정의된 문제라고 부르는데, 다음과 같은 특성과 함께 나타난다.

*        The problem has a clearly defined given state. This might be the line-up of a chess game, a given formula you have to solve, or the set-up of the towers of Hanoi game (which we will [[Cognitive_Psychology_and_Cognitive_Neuroscience/Problem_Solving_from_an_Evolutionary_Perspective#Means-End_Analysis|discuss later]]).
명확하게 정의된 현재 상태가 주어져 있다. 이것은 체스 말의 정렬일 수도 있고, 풀어야하는 공식일 수도 있고, 하노이의 탑([[Cognitive_Psychology_and_Cognitive_Neuroscience/Problem_Solving_from_an_Evolutionary_Perspective#Means-End_Analysis|나중에]] 논의하게 되겠지만)의 판 배열일 수도 있다.

*        There is a finite set of operators, that is, of rules you may apply to the given state. For the chess game, e.g.,  these would be the rules that tell you which piece you may move to which position.
유한한 연산자의 집합, 즉 주어진 상태에 적용할 수 있는 규칙의 집합이 있다. 체스를 예로 들자면, 어느 말을 어느 위치로 옮길 수 있는지 같은 규칙이 될 것이다.

*        Finally, the problem has a clear goal state: The equations is resolved to x, all discs are moved to the right stack, or the other player is in checkmate.
마지막으로, 명확한 목표 상태가 있다. 방정식의 x가 풀렸거나, 모든 판이 오른쪽 기둥에 옮겨졌거나, 상대방을 체크메이트시킨 상태가 될 것이다.

Not surprisingly, a problem that fulfils these requirements can be implemented algorithmically (also see [[Cognitive_Psychology_and_Cognitive_Neuroscience/Problem_Solving_from_an_Evolutionary_Perspective#Convergent_Thinking|convergent thinking]]). Therefore many well-defined problems can be very effectively solved by computers, like playing chess.
놀랄 것도 없이, 이러한 조건을 충족하는 문제들은 알고리즘으로 실행될 수 있다([[Cognitive_Psychology_and_Cognitive_Neuroscience/Problem_Solving_from_an_Evolutionary_Perspective#Convergent_Thinking|수렴적 사고]]를 참고). 따라서 많은 잘 정의된 문제는 체스를 두는 것처럼 컴퓨터에 의해 아주 효과적으로 해결될 수 있다.

===잘 정의되지 않은 문제===
Though many problems can be properly formalised (sometimes only if we accept an enormous complexity) there are still others where this is not the case. Good examples for this are all kinds of tasks that involve [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity creativity], and, generally speaking, all problems for which it is not possible to clearly define a given state and a goal state: Formalising a problem of the kind “Please paint a beautiful picture” may be impossible. Still this is a problem most people would be able to access in one way or the other, even if the result may be totally different from person to person. And while Knut might judge that picture X is gorgeous, you might completely disagree.
많은 문제가 제대로 형식화 될 수 있지만(어떤 때는 엄청난 복잡성을 수용할 때만 그렇지만), 그렇지 않은 문제도 있다. 이것의 좋은 예는 [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity 창의성]이 필요한 종류의 작업들이고, 일반적으로 말하면, 현재 상태와 목표 상태를 명확하게 정의하는게 불가능한 모든 문제를 가리킨다. 예를 들어 &quot;아름다운 그림을 그려주세요&quot;와 같은 문제를 형식화하는 것은 아마도 불가능할 것이다. 하지만 사람에 따라 완전히 다른 결과가 나올 수 있긴 해도 이것은 대부분의 사람이 한 가지 혹은 다른 방식으로 접근할 수 있는 문제다. 그리고 크누트씨가 X라는 그림이 아주 멋지다고 판단할 때, 당신은 완전히 반대로 느낄 수도 있다.

Nevertheless ill-defined problems often involve sub-problems that can be totally well-defined. On the other hand, many every-day problems that seem to be completely well-defined involve- when examined in detail- a big deal of creativity and ambiguities.
그럼에도 불구하고 잘 정의되지 않은 문제는 완전히 잘 정의된 하위문제를 포함하고 있을 때가 많다. 한편으로는, 완전히 잘 정의된 일상생활의 문제들이 고도의 창의성과 모호함을 포함하고 있는 경우도 많다.

If we think of Knut's fairly ill-defined task of writing an essay, he will not be able to complete this task without first understanding the text he has to write about. This step is the first subgoal Knut has to solve. Interestingly, ill-defined problems often involve subproblems that are well-defined.
리포트를 쓰는, 크누트씨의 별로 잘 정의되지 않은 작업에 대해서 생각한다면, 먼저 그가 써야하는 주제의 글을 이해하지 않고서는 과제를 끝낼 수 없을 것라고 할 수 있다. 이 단계는 크누트씨가 해결해야할 첫번째 하위목표다. 흥미롭게도, 잘 정의되지 않은 문제는 잘 정의된 하위문제를 포함하는 경우가 많다.

==재구조화 - 형태주의적 접근==

One dominant approach to Problem Solving originated from [[wikipedia:Gestalt psychology|Gestalt psychologists]] in the 1920s. Their understanding of problem solving emphasises behaviour in situations requiring relatively novel means of attaining goals and suggests that problem solving involves a process called restructuring. Since this indicates a perceptual approach, two main questions have to be considered:
*How is a problem represented in a person's mind?
*How does solving this problem involve a reorganisation or restructuring of this representation?
This is what we are going to do in the following part of this section.
문제 해결에 대한 한 가지 지배적인 접근은 1920년대의 [[wikipedia:Gestalt psychology|게슈탈트 심리학자]]들로부터 유래했다. 문제 해결에 대한 그들의 이해방식은 목표달성을 위해 상대적으로 참신한 수단을 요구하는 상황에서의 행동을 강조하며, 문제 해결이 재구조화라고 하는 과정을 포함한다고 제안한다. 이것이 지각적인 접근을 가리키기 떄문에, 두 가지 주요 질문이 제기된다.
*문제가 사람의 마음에 어떻게 표상되는가?
*그 문제를 해결하는 것이 이 표상의 재조직화나 재구조화를 어떤 식으로 포함하는가?

===문제는 마음에 어떻게 표상되는가?===

In current research internal and external representations are distinguished: The first kind is regarded as the [[Cognitive Psychology and Cognitive Neuroscience/Knowledge|knowledge]] and structure of [[Cognitive Psychology and Cognitive Neuroscience/Memory|memory]], while the latter type is defined as the knowledge and structure of the environment, such like physical objects or symbols whose information can be picked up and processed by the perceptual system autonomously. On the contrary the information in internal representations has to be retrieved by cognitive processes. 
현재 이뤄지고 있는 연구에서는 내적인 표상과 외적인 표상을 구분하고 있다. 전자는 [[Cognitive Psychology and Cognitive Neuroscience/Knowledge|지식]] 그리고 [[Cognitive Psychology and Cognitive Neuroscience/Memory|기억]]의 구조로 간주되는 반면에, 후자는 환경에 대한 지식과 구조로 정의된다.

Generally speaking, problem representations are [[wikipedia:Mental model|models]] of the situation as experienced by the agent. Representing a problem means to analyse it and split it into separate components:
*objects, predicates
*state space
*operators
*selection criteria
Therefore the efficiency of Problem Solving depends on the underlying representations in a person’s mind, which usually also involves personal aspects.
Analysing the problem domain according to different dimensions, i.e., changing from one representation to another, results in arriving at a new understanding of a problem. This is basically what is described as restructuring.
The following example illustrates this:

:Two boys of different age are playing badminton. The older one is a more skilled player, and therefore it is predictable for the outcome of usual matches who will be the winner. After some time and several defeats the younger boy finally loses interest in playing, and the older boy faces a problem, namely that he has no one to play with anymore.
:The usual options, according to M. Wertheimer (1945/82), at this point of the story range from 'offering candy' and 'playing another game' to 'not playing to full ability' and 'shaming the younger boy into playing'. All those strategies aim at making the younger stay.
:And this is what the older boy comes up with: He proposes that they should try to keep the bird in play as long as possible. Thus they change from a game of competition to one of cooperation. They'd start with easy shots and make them harder as their success increases, counting the number of consecutive hits. The proposal is happily accepted and the game is on again.

The key in this story is that the older boy ''restructured'' the problem and found out that he used an attitude towards the younger which made it difficult to keep him playing. With the new type of game the problem is solved: the older is not bored, the younger not frustrated. 

Possibly, new representations can make a problem more difficult or much easier to solve. To the latter case [[Cognitive_Psychology_and_Cognitive_Neuroscience/Problem_Solving_from_an_Evolutionary_Perspective#Insight|insight]]– the sudden realisation of a problem’s solution – seems to be related.

===통찰===

There are two very different ways of approaching a ''goal-oriented situation''. In one case an organism readily ''reproduces'' the response to the given problem from past experience. This is called '''reproductive thinking'''.

The second way requires ''something new and different'' to achieve the goal, prior learning is of little help here. Such '''productive thinking''' is (sometimes) argued to involve '''insight'''. Gestalt psychologists even state that insight problems are a separate category of problems in their own right.

Tasks that might involve insight usually have certain features - they require something new and non-obvious to be done and in most cases they are difficult enough to predict that the initial solution attempt will be unsuccessful. When you solve a problem of this kind you often have a so called '''&quot;AHA-experience&quot;''' - the solution pops up all of a sudden. At one time you do not have any ideas of  the answer to the problem, you do not even feel to make any progress trying out different ideas, but in the next second the problem is solved.

For all those readers who would like to experience such an effect, here is an example for an Insight Problem: Knut is given four pieces of a chain; each made up of three links. The task is to link it all up to a closed loop and he has only 15 cents. To open a link costs 2, to close a link costs 3 cents. What should Knut do? 

[[Image:chain solved.svg|thumbnail=chain_task.svg|center|If you want to know the correct solution, click to enlarge the image.]]

To show that solving insight problems involves ''restructuring'', psychologists created a number of problems that were more difficult to solve for participants provided with previous experiences, since it was harder for them to change the representation of the given situation (see [[Cognitive_Psychology_and_Cognitive_Neuroscience/Problem_Solving_from_an_Evolutionary_Perspective#Fixation|Fixation]]). Sometimes  given hints may lead to the insight required to solve the problem. And this is also true for involuntarily given ones. For instance it might help you to solve a memory game if someone accidentally drops a card on the floor and you look at the other side. Although such help is not obviously a hint, the effect does not differ from that of intended help. 

For ''non-insight'' problems the opposite is the case. Solving arithmetical problems, for instance, requires [[Cognitive_Psychology_and_Cognitive_Neuroscience/Problem_Solving_from_an_Evolutionary_Perspective#Schema|schemas]], through which one can get to the solution step by step.

===고착화===

Sometimes, previous experience or familiarity can even make problem solving more difficult. This is the case whenever habitual directions get in the way of finding new directions – an effect called '''fixation'''.

====기능적 고착====

Functional fixedness concerns the solution of ''object-use problems''. The basic idea is that when the usual way of using an object is emphasised, it will be far more difficult for a person to use that object in a novel manner. An example for this effect is the '''candle problem''': Imagine you are given a box of matches, some candles and tacks. On the wall of the room there is a cork-board. Your task is to fix the candle to the cork-board in such a way that no wax will drop on the floor when the candle is lit. – Got an idea?

[[image:Candle solved.svg|thumbnail=Candle_task.svg|center|The candle task]]

:Explanation: The clue is just the following: when people are confronted with a problem and given certain objects to solve it, it is difficult for them to figure out that they could use them in a different (not so familiar or obvious) way. In this example the box has to be recognised as a support rather than as a container.

A further example is the '''two-string problem''': Knut is left in a room with a chair and a pair of pliers given the task to bind two strings together that are hanging from the ceiling. The problem he faces is that he can never reach both strings at a time because they are just too far away from each other. What can Knut do?

[[image:Two string.png|400px|center]]

:Solution: Knut has to recognise he can use the pliers in a novel function – as weight for a pendulum. He can bind them to one of the :strings, push it away, hold the other string and just wait for the first one moving towards him. If necessary, Knut can even climb on the chair, but he is not that small, we suppose . . .

====정신적 고착====

Functional fixedness as involved in the examples above illustrates a '''mental set''' - a person’s tendency to respond to a given task in a manner based on past experience. Because Knut maps an object to a particular function he has difficulties to ''vary the way of use'' (pliers as pendulum's weight).

One approach to studying fixation was to study ''wrong-answer verbal insight problems''. It was shown that people tend to give rather an incorrect answer when failing to solve a problem than to give no answer at all.
:A typical example: People are told that on a lake the area covered by water lilies doubles every 24 hours and that it takes 60 days to cover the whole lake. Then they are asked how many days it takes to cover half the lake. The typical response is '30 days' (whereas 59 days is correct).

These wrong solutions are due to an ''inaccurate interpretation'', hence ''representation'', of the problem. This can happen because of ''sloppiness'' (a quick shallow reading of the problem and/or weak monitoring of their efforts made to come to a solution). In this case error feedback should help people to reconsider the problem features, note the inadequacy of their first answer, and find the correct solution. If, however, people are truly fixated on their incorrect representation, being told the answer is wrong does not help. In a study made by P.I. Dallop and R.L. Dominowski in 1992 these two possibilities were contrasted. In approximately one third of the cases ''error feedback'' led to right answers, so only approximately one third of the wrong answers were due to ''inadequate monitoring''.&lt;ref&gt;R.L. Dominowski and P. Dallob, Insight and Problem Solving. In The Nature of Insight, R.J. Sternberg &amp; J.E. Davidson (Eds). MIT Press: USA, pp.33-62 (1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

Another approach is the study of examples with and without a preceding [[Cognitive_Psychology_and_Cognitive_Neuroscience/Problem_Solving_from_an_Evolutionary_Perspective#Analogies|analogous]] task. In cases such like the '''water-jug task''' analogous thinking indeed leads to a correct solution, but to take a different way might make the case much simpler:
:Imagine Knut again, this time he is given three jugs with different capacities and is asked to measure the required amount of water. :Of course he is not allowed to use anything despite the jugs and as much water as he likes. In the first case the sizes are: 127 litres, 21 litres and 3 litres while 100 litres are desired.

:In the second case Knut is asked to measure 18 litres from jugs of 39, 15 and three litres size.
In fact participants faced with the 100 litre task first choose a complicate way in order to solve the second one. Others on the contrary who did not know about that complex task solved the 18 litre case by just adding three litres to 15.

==탐색으로서의 문제해결==
The idea of regarding problem solving as a search problem originated from Alan Newell and Herbert Simon while trying to design computer programs which could solve certain problems. This led them to develop a program called [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Problem_Solver General Problem Solver] which was able to solve any well-defined problem by creating heuristics on the basis of the user's input. This input consisted of objects and operations that could be done on them.

As we already know, every problem is composed of an initial state, intermediate states and a goal state (also: desired or final state), while the initial and goal states characterise the situations before and after solving the problem. The intermediate states describe any possible situation between initial and goal state. The set of operators builds up the transitions between the states. A solution is defined as the sequence of operators which leads from the initial state across intermediate states to the goal state.

The simplest method to solve a problem, defined in these terms, is to search for a solution by just trying one possibility after another (also called [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_and_error trial and error]).

As already mentioned above, an organised search, following a specific strategy, might not be helpful for finding a solution to some ill-defined problem, since it is impossible to formalise such problems in a way that a search algorithm can find a solution.

As an example we could just take Knut and his essay: he has to find out about his own opinion and formulate it and he has to make sure he understands the sources texts. But there are no predefined operators he can use, there is no panacea how to get to an opinion and even not how to write it down.

===수단-목표 분석===

In Means-End Analysis you try to reduce the difference between initial state and goal state by creating subgoals until a subgoal can be reached directly (probably you know several examples of recursion which works on the basis of this).
 

An example for a problem that can be solved by Means-End Analysis are the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Towers_of_hanoi „Towers of Hanoi“]:

Towers of Hanoi - A well defined problem

 

The initial state of this problem is described by the different sized discs being stacked in order of size on the first of three pegs (the “start-peg“). The goal state is described by these discs being stacked on the third pegs (the “end-peg“) in exactly the same order.

[[Image:Tower of Hanoi 4.gif|center]]

There are three operators:
* You are allowed to move one single disc from one peg to another one
* You are only able to move a disc if it is on top of one stack
* A disc cannot be put onto a smaller one.

[[Image:ToH.PNG|center]]

In order to use Means-End Analysis we have to create subgoals. One possible way of doing this is described in the picture:

1.   Moving the discs lying on the biggest one onto the second peg.  

2.   Shifting the biggest disc to the third peg.  

3.   Moving the other ones onto the third peg, too  

You can apply this strategy again and again in order to reduce the problem to the case where you only have to move a single disc – which is then something you are allowed to do. 

Strategies of this kind can easily be formulated for a computer; the respective algorithm for the Towers of Hanoi would look like this:

1.   move n-1 discs from A to B

2.   move disc #n from A to C

3.   move n-1 discs from B to C

where n is the total number of discs, A is the first peg, B the second, C the third one.
Now the problem is reduced by one with each recursive loop.
 
Means-end analysis is important to solve everyday-problems - like getting the right train connection:
You have to figure out where you catch the first train and where you want to arrive, first of all. Then you have to look for possible changes just in case you do not get a direct connection. Third, you have to figure out what are the best times of departure and arrival, on which platforms you leave and arrive and make it all fit together.

===유추===

Analogies describe similar structures and interconnect them to clarify and explain certain relations. In a recent study, for example, a song that got stuck in your head is compared to an itching of the brain that can only be scratched by repeating the song over and over again.

===유추를 이용한 재구조화===

One special kind of restructuring, the way already mentioned during the discussion of the Gestalt approach, is analogical problem solving. Here, to find a solution to one problem - the so called target problem, an analogous solution to another problem - the source problem, is presented.

An example for this kind of strategy is the radiation problem posed by K. Duncker in 1945:

As a doctor you have to treat a patient with a malignant, inoperable tumour, buried deep inside the body. There exists a special kind of ray, which is perfectly harmless at a low intensity, but at the sufficient high intensity is able to destroy the tumour - as well as the healthy tissue on his way to it. What can be done to avoid the latter?

When this question was asked to participants in an experiment, most of them couldn't come up with the appropriate answer to the problem. Then they were told a story that went something like this:

A General wanted to capture his enemy's fortress. He gathered a large army to launch a full-scale direct attack, but then learned, that all the roads leading directly towards the fortress were blocked by mines. These roadblocks were designed in such a way, that it was possible for small groups of the fortress-owner's men to pass them safely, but every large group of men would initially set them off. Now the General figured out the following plan: He divided his troops into several smaller groups and made each of them march down a different road, timed in such a way, that the entire army would reunite exactly when reaching the fortress and could hit with full strength.

Here, the story about the General is the source problem, and the radiation problem is the target problem. The fortress is analogous to the tumour and the big army corresponds to the highly intensive ray. Consequently a small group of soldiers represents a ray at low intensity. The solution to the problem is to split the ray up, as the general did with his army, and send the now harmless rays towards the tumour from different angles in such a way that they all meet when reaching it. No healthy tissue is damaged but the tumour itself gets destroyed by the ray at its full intensity.

M. Gick and K. Holyoak presented Duncker's radiation problem to a group of participants in 1980 and 1983. Only 10 percent of them were able to solve the problem right away, 30 percent could solve it when they read the story of the general before. After given an additional hint - to use the story as help - 75 percent of them solved the problem.

With this results, Gick and Holyoak concluded, that analogical problem solving depends on three steps:

1. '''Noticing''' that an analogical connection exists between the source and the target problem.&lt;br&gt;
2. '''Mapping''' corresponding parts of the two problems onto each other (fortress → tumour, army → ray, etc.)&lt;br&gt;
3. '''Applying''' the mapping to generate a parallel solution to the target problem (using little groups of soldiers approaching from different directions → sending several weaker rays from different directions)

Next, Gick and Holyoak started looking for factors that could be helpful for the noticing and the mapping parts, for example:

Discovering the basic linking concept behind the source and the target problem.

'''--&gt;picture coming soon&lt;--'''

====스키마====

The concept that links the target problem with the analogy (the “source problem“) is called problem schema. Gick and Holyoak obtained the activation of a schema on their participants by giving them two stories and asking them to compare and summarise them. This activation of problem schemata is called “schema induction“.

The two presented texts were picked out of six stories which describe analogical problems and their solution. One of these stories was &quot;The General&quot; (remember example in [[Cognitive_Psychology_and_Cognitive_Neuroscience/Problem_Solving_from_an_Evolutionary_Perspective#Analogies|Chapter 4.1]]).

After solving the task the participants were asked to solve the radiation problem (see chapter 4.2). The experiment showed that in order to solve the target problem reading of two stories with analogical problems is more helpful than reading only one story:
After reading two stories 52% of the participants were able to solve the radiation problem (As told in chapter 4.2 only 30% were able to solve it after reading only one story, namely: “The General“).

Gick and Holyoak found out that the quality of the schema a participant developed differs. They classified them into three groups:
*Good schemata: In good schemata it was recognised that the same concept was used in order to solve the problem (21% of the participants created a good schema and 91% of them were able to solve the radiation problem).
*Intermediate schemata: The creator of an intermediate schema has figured out that the root of the matter equals (here: many small forces solved the problem). (20% created one, 40% of them had the right solution).
*Poor schemata: The poor schemata were hardly related to the target problem. In many poor schemata the participant only detected that the hero of the story was rewarded for his efforts (59% created one, 30% of them had the right solution).

The process of using a schema or analogy, i.e. applying it to a novel situation is called transduction. One can use a common strategy to solve problems of a new kind.

To create a good schema and finally get to a solution is a problem-solving skill that requires practise and some background knowledge.

With the term expert we describe someone who devotes large amounts of his or her time and energy to one specific field of interest in which he, subsequently, reaches a certain level of mastery. It should not be of surprise that experts tend to be better in solving problems in their field than novices (people who are beginners or not as well trained in a field as experts) are. They are faster in coming up with solutions and have a higher success rate of right solutions. But what is the difference between the way experts and non-experts solve problems? Research on the nature of expertise has come up with the following conclusions:

:Experts know more about their field,
:their knowledge is organised differently, and
:they spend more time analysing the problem.

When it comes to problems that are situated outside the experts' field, their performance often does not differ from that of novices.
 
'''Knowledge:'''
An experiment by Chase and Simon (1973a, b) dealt with the question how well experts and novices are able to reproduce positions of chess pieces on chessboards when these are presented to them only briefly. The results showed that experts were far better in reproducing actual game positions, but that their performance was comparable with that of novices when the chess pieces were arranged randomly on the board. Chase and Simon concluded that the superior performance on actual game positions was due to the ability to recognise familiar patterns: A chess expert has up to 50,000 patterns stored in his memory. In comparison, a good player might know about 1,000 patterns by heart and a novice only few to none at all.
This very detailed knowledge is of crucial help when an expert is confronted with a new problem in his field. Still, it is not pure size of knowledge that makes an expert more successful. Experts also organise their knowledge quite differently from novices.

'''Organisation:'''
In 1982 M. Chi and her co-workers took a set of 24 physics problems and presented them to a group of physics professors as well as to a group of students with only one semester of physics. The task was to group the problems based on their similarities.
As it turned out the students tended to group the problems based on their surface structure (similarities of objects used in the problem, e.g. on sketches illustrating the problem), whereas the professors used their deep structure (the general physical principles that underlay the problems) as criteria.
By recognising the actual structure of a problem experts are able to connect the given task to the relevant knowledge they already have (e.g. another problem they solved earlier which required the same strategy).

'''Analysis:'''
Experts often spend more time analysing a problem before actually trying to solve it. This way of approaching a problem may often result in what appears to be a slow start, but in the long run this strategy is much more effective. A novice, on the other hand, might start working on the problem right away, but often has to realise that he reaches dead ends as he chose a wrong path in the very beginning.

==창의적 인지==
We already introduced a lot of ways to solve a problem, mainly strategies that can be used to find the “correct” answer. But there are also problems which do not require a “right answer” to be given - It is time for creative productiveness!

Imagine you are given three objects – your task is to invent a completely new object that is related to nothing you know. Then try to describe its function and how it could additionally be used. Difficult? Well, you are free to think creatively and will not be at risk to give an incorrect answer. For example think of what can be constructed from a half-sphere, wire and a handle. The result is amazing: a lawn lounger, global earrings, a sled, a water weigher, a portable agitator, ...

===발산적 사고===
The term divergent thinking describes a way of thinking that does not lead to one goal, but is open-ended. Problems that are solved this way can have a large number of potential 'solutions' of which none is exactly 'right' or 'wrong', though some might be more suitable than others.  

Solving a problem like this involves indirect and productive thinking and is mostly very helpful when somebody faces an [[Cognitive_Psychology_and_Cognitive_Neuroscience/Problem_Solving_from_an_Evolutionary_Perspective#Ill-defined_Problems|ill-defined]]problem, i.e. when either initial state or goal state cannot be stated clearly and operators or either insufficient or not given at all. 

The process of divergent thinking is often associated with creativity, and it undoubtedly leads to many creative ideas. Nevertheless, researches have shown that there is only modest correlation between performance on divergent thinking tasks and other measures of creativity.
Additionally it was found that in processes resulting in original and practical inventions things like searching for solutions, being aware of structures and looking for analogies are heavily involved, too.

Thus, divergent thinking alone is not an appropriate tool for making an invention. You also need to analyse the problem in order to make the suggested, i.e. invention, solution appropriate.

===수렴적 사고===
Divergent can be contrasted by convergent thinking - thinking that seeks to find the correct answer to a specific problem. This is an adequate strategy for solving most of the [[Cognitive_Psychology_and_Cognitive_Neuroscience/Problem_Solving_from_an_Evolutionary_Perspective#Well-defined_Problems|well-defined]] problems (problems with given initial state, operators and goal state) we presented so far. To solve the given tasks it was necessary to think directly or reproductively.

It is always helpful to use a strategy to think of a way to come closer to the solution, perhaps using knowledge from previous tasks or sudden insight.

==신경생리학적 배경==
Presenting Neurophysiology in its entirety would be enough to fill several books. Fortunately we do not have to concern ourselves with most of these facts. Instead, let's just focus on the aspects that are really relevant to problem solving. Nevertheless this topic is quite complex and problem solving cannot be attributed to one single brain area. Rather there are systems of several brain areas working together to perform a specific task. This is best shown by an example:

:In 1994 Paolo Nichelli and coworkers used the method of PET (Positron Emission Tomography), to localise certain brain areas, which are involved in solving various chess problems. In the following table you can see which brain area was active during a specific task:

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;
! Task 
! Location of Brain activity
|- 
|
* Identifying chess pieces

* determining location of pieces
     
 
* Thinking about making a move
     
* Remembering a pieces move
  
      
* Planning and executing strategies
|
* Pathway from Occipital to Temporal Lobe
(also called the &quot;what&quot;-pathway of visual processing)
* Pathway from Occipital to parietal Lobe
(also called the &quot;where&quot;-pathway of visual processing)
* Premotor area

* Hippocampus
(forming new memories)
* Prefrontal cortex
|}

[[Image:Lobes of the brain.svg‎|framed|center|Lobes of the Brain]]

One of the key tasks, namely '''planning and executing strategies''', is performed by a brain area which also plays an important role for several other tasks correlated with problem solving - [[wikipedia:Prefrontal cortex|the prefrontal cortex (PFC)]]. This can be made clear if you take a look at several examples of damages to the PFC and their effects on the ability to solve problems.&lt;br&gt;
Patients with a '''lesion''' in this brain area have difficulty switching from one behaviouristic pattern to another. A well known example is the [[wikipedia:Wisconsin card sort|wisconsin card-sorting task]]. A patient with a PFC lesion who is told to separate all blue cards from a deck, would continue sorting out the blue ones, even if the experimenter told him to sort out all brown cards. Transferred to a more complex problem, this person would most likely fail, because he is not flexible enough to change his strategy after running into a '''dead end'''.&lt;br&gt;
Another example is the one of a young homemaker, who had a tumour in the frontal lobe. Even though she was able to cook individual dishes, preparing a whole family meal was an infeasible task for her.

As the examples above illustrate, the structure of our brain seems to be of great importance regarding problem solving, i.e. cognitive life. But how was our cognitive apparatus designed? How did perception-action integration as a central species specific property come about?

==진화적 관점==
[[wikipedia:Charles Darwin|Charles Darwin]] developed the [[wikipedia:Evolutionary theory|evolutionary theory]] which was primarily meant to explain why there are so many different kinds of species. This theory is also important for psychology because it explains how species were ''designed'' by evolutionary forces and what their goals are. By knowing the goals of species it is possible to explain and predict their behaviour.

The process of evolution involves several components, for instance ''[[wikipedia:Natural selection|natural selection]]'' - which is a feedback process that 'chooses' among 'alternative designs' on the basis of deciding how good the respective modulation is. As a result of this natural selection we find [[wikipedia:Adaption|adaption]]. This is a process that constantly tests the variations among individuals in relation to the environment. If adaptions are useful they get passed on; if not they’ll just be an unimportant variation.

Another component of the evolutionary process is sexual selection, i.e. increasing of certain sex characteristics, which give individuals the ability to rival with other individuals of the same sex or an increased ability to attract individuals of the opposite sex.

[[wikipedia:Altruism|Altruism]] is a further component of the evolutionary process, which will be explained in more detail in the following chapter [[Cognitive Psychology and Cognitive Neuroscience/Evolutionary Perspective on Social Cognitions|Evolutionary Perspective on Social Cognitions]].

==요약 및 결론==

After Knut read this WikiChapter he was relieved that he did not waste his time for the essay – quite the opposite! He now has a new view on problem solving - and recognises his problem as a well-defined one:          

His initial state was the clear blank paper without any philosophical sentences on it. The goal state was just in front of his mind's eye: Him – grinning broadly – handing in the essay with some carefully developed arguments.
 

He decides to use the technique of Means-End Analysis and creates several subgoals:

:1. Read important passages again
:2. Summarise parts of the text
:3. Develop an argumentative structure
:4. Write the essay
:5. Look for typos

Right after he hands in his essay Knut will go on reading this WikiBook.
He now looks forward to turning the page over and to discovering the [[Cognitive Psychology and Cognitive Neuroscience/Evolutionary Perspective on Social Cognitions|next chapter...]]

=The Vrinda project Documentary =
[[Development Cooperation Handbook/The video resources linked to this handbook|The video resources]]   linked to the  [[Development Cooperation Handbook|Development Cooperation Handbook]] have also been edited to produce an 8-episode documentary meant for television and  for video on demand platforms like [https://vimeo.com/ondemand/tvp Vimeo] and [https://www.reelhouse.org/thevrindaproject Reelhouse].

The dialogic structure of the documentary enables an easier understanding of global cooperation issues.  The story jumps (with flash-forwards and flash-backs) from  the &quot;[[Development Cooperation Handbook/Stories|front-stage scenes]]&quot;, that cover development projects, to the &quot;[[Development Cooperation Handbook/The Vrinda project Documentary/Backstage scenes|back-stage scenes]]&quot;, that disclose the purpose of the [[Development_Cooperation_Handbook/Introduction|the Vrinda project]] and the challenges faced by the executing team.

By putting the team inside the story, the documentary does without the pretentiousness of being &quot;objective&quot;. Since the team members belong to different cultural contexts, their dialogue enables the articulation of different cultural viewpoints. 
This makes the documentary a media product that moves beyond the usual political boundaries, so that it can represent all the different countries that are partners in the global effort to achieve the [[Development Cooperation Handbook/Introduction to the Millennium Development Goals|MDGs]].

'''The Vrinda project Documentary'''&lt;br /&gt;

It's the story of a travel. From Europe, we went to Africa, South Asia, the Middle East and South America, to cover projects of international cooperation.&lt;br /&gt;

From the original topic assigned to us, the MDG programme, we went on to search why mainstream media finds it so difficult to cover activities of peacebuilding.&lt;br /&gt;

We collected stories on the work in progress for reducing extreme poverty, promoting basic education, empowering women, reducing the child mortality, improving maternal health, fighting against epidemics, protecting the environment, and promoting fair relationship amongst nations.&lt;br /&gt;

We shared these stories on the Internet but we wanted them to be broadcast on television. So, we interviewed policy makers and we shared with them  the story of our effort to narrate how different people are rediscovering their own values by learning to appreciate the values of others.&lt;br /&gt;

It was a difficult journey. We had to overcome media stereotypes of “bad news is news that sells”. We had to bring on board editors that are usually keen on aligning with established prejudices among public, because they sell audiences to advertisers, not awareness to audiences.&lt;br /&gt;
We had to redefine communication as something that isn’t an exchange of preconceived notions but is a new creation that breaks the isolation of people, enables &quot;participation&quot; and builds a sense of &quot;community&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;

In this journey, what we really learned was that development cannot be &quot;given&quot; in the same way that education cannot be “delivered” and participation cannot be “bought”. We learned that development is a process that requires communication and cooperation; that this is possible only as far as counterparts act in a reciprocally empowering manner, because they recognize that, in order to fully realize themselves, they need the self-realization of the others.&lt;br /&gt;

Now, we would like to share this journey with you; because this is where we wanted to arrive when we started it.

The stories narrated in the episodes had been first uploaded on [http://www.youtube.com/user/eugadproject Youtube] and used by the development actors for communicating with the stakeholders of their projects. The feedback from the viewers of these video stories has been vital for the final editing work of the documentary.

Finally the documentary structure has been woven along three  different editorial treads:
* The main editorial line has been moving along the [[Development Cooperation Handbook/Introduction to the Millennium Development Goals|8 MDGs]]. In each episodes there are 3-5 complete [[Development Cooperation Handbook/Stories|stories of projects]] working towards the achievement of a specific Millennium Goal. [[File:Film-Camera.png|17px]]  ⇒  [https://www.youtube.com/user/eugadproject/playlists?view=50&amp;sort=dd&amp;shelf_id=13 The stories related  to the specific  MDGs]&lt;br /&gt;
* The second narration thread follows the debate amongst experts  on the methodology and effectiveness of international cooperation actions. In each episode the [[Development Cooperation Handbook/Testimonials|testimonials]] discuss one of the [[Development Cooperation Handbook/Issues|development issues]]. [[File:Film-Camera.png|17px]]  ⇒  [https://www.youtube.com/user/eugadproject/playlists?shelf_id=9&amp;sort=dd&amp;view=50 The development Cooperation Issues]. This in order to create a dynamic interaction between the specific projects, that are implemented &quot;at the grass-roots level&quot;, and the general debate, taking place among international institutions and the global media.&lt;br /&gt;
* The third  editorial line  proceeds along ⇒  [[Development Cooperation Handbook/The video resources linked to this handbook/The Documentary Story|the story of our project]] as it unfolds and as team faces the challenges of bringing on the mainstream media the unglamorous topic of international cooperation and dialogue.  &lt;br /&gt;

== Why the television? Wasn't Internet the best distributor of the project media?  ==

The interactivity of Internet enables a personalized way of moving through the video resources and the viewer can chose her/his own itinerary through the video playlists and decide what to see first.  On the other side the interactivity of Internet,  left  to itself without a unifying thread, let the viewer to be as alone as a client in a supermarket, who has to choose between the different items, but is not in a process of &quot;dialogue&quot; with the producers, nor in a process of community with the other &quot;clients&quot;.  Rather then a &quot;clearing house&quot; we wanted a &quot;village feast&quot;, where  one can  find a sense of unity of purpose and a shared identity.   So before and after the interactivity we felt the need to create a unitary &quot;story&quot; of the whole event.  That story has been threaded in a [[Development Cooperation Handbook/The video resources linked to this handbook/The Documentary Story|narration]] and had been articulated in the &quot;episodes of the documentary&quot;.  But it could also take the form of a &quot;book&quot;  or a &quot;film&quot;.  In any case something that has a thread that leads the story and gives unity to the various experiences.  Including the experience of exploiting the interactivity and the ubiquity of the Internet.

The other reason why television was conceived as a strategic media in spite of its being already, in many senses,  an &quot;old medium&quot;, is that bringing the product on to the TV screens was the challenge  of exposing to the general public what our group of author wanted to communicate.  It is  like bringing to the public theater of an innovative  cultural and political message,  that was initially framed in alternative circles, but that would have made not much an impact if confined only within a closed group of alternative thinkers unable - or unwilling - to give testimony of themselves to the wider community.

After we assembled a draft version [[File:Film-Camera.png|17px]]   ⇒  [http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTzY9kTw5ufls2Y-VTAV6D30uD_DXrzBZ Episodes edited for a television distribution] we created on  a  [[File:Google plus 32.png|17px]]  [https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/105351488204270692301/communities/105969776192653058150 Google+ community]  specifically dedicated to distribution, and we started building the partnerships for distribution and broadcast of the edited episodes.  Which we continued to edit as the story of the documentary moved on in  overcoming the distribution challenges .  And because the feedback from distributors gave us, along with the feedback of the users of [[Development Cooperation Handbook|this Wikibook]], new ideas for improving the editions or for customize them for specific target audiences. &lt;br /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''A Modern Model for the Cosmos'''
 
Next to the mystery of the existence of the soul and the afterlife, the mystery of the shape of the universe may be considered as the mystery of all mysteries, and most difficult to solve by scientists. Ebrahim Victory – Cosmologist 
 
He is right, but why this mystery, the most difficult to solve by scientists?
 
To help answer this question is that we are living inside the universe. A child as long as lives at a home can only knows the internal shape of the home. As compared with the universe, that child we are, and only the Almighty God has authority and superiority over the universe and knows its external shape. The intuitions granted by God:
 
Expanding shape of the cosmos
We all have seen a rolled up sheet. If we look at inside of such a sheet, which has as tightly as possible rolled up and then released, which kind of a shape we can see? 
The answer is spiral. (Snail shell shape)
If we wish to roll up this sheet once again, what can we do?
The answer: we start rolling the central layer up, with the upper layers following the central layer, and all the layers roll upon each other. 
 
The mystery of the creation (Big Bang), also to put an end to it (Big Crunch), is as simple as this example.

The particulars of a snail shell
To imagine the universe shape, we can select a snail shell as ‘reference body’ with seven layers and then consider the particulars of the universe shape as following:
1. The major mass and gravity force of this body exist in its core.
2.        Every snail shell grows up and expands from the core. 
3.        The core of this body has not spontaneously created, because it needs an initial motive power.
4.        The further the layers of a snail shell away from the core, the further they expand; and get centrifugal force.
5.        The expansion process of a snail shell follows special rules; hence, it is in order perfectly. 
6.        Every layer has separated from another by a rigid septum.
7.        One of the important particulars of the body with spiral shape is that it can better carry different waves including sound waves. 
This explains:
•                     Why all instruments transmitting sound waves, such as cochlea in the ears, horn, and trumpet, is spiral - shaped. 
•            Why in our modern world, various receivers and transmitters of audio - visual waves are horny shaped; or “spiral” so far as possible. 
 
The cosmic model as a spiral system
Maybe the Almighty God created the lovely snail dragging its cavernous and calcareous shell as a ‘small and temporary home’ on its soft back, to show us the shape of the cosmos, as a ‘Huge and permanent home’ dragging on humanity shoulders, to creep inside, on the Big Crunch.
    
To imagine spiral shape of the cosmos, we can assume our spiral galaxy of Milky Way with a great black hole in its core, as the core of cosmic snail, then consider the galaxy with the seven layers, as the seven layers of the cosmic snail.
 
  
 
Better to imagine mentioned cosmic system with its structure and circumference, we can assume a huge transparent vitreous snail shell, looks dark inside, with some bright spots scattered amongst darkness. So the further the layers of cosmic snail away from the core, the further the bright spots, and in the last layer, everything is bright. Meanwhile we can distinguish the septum of the layers and a blackout core in the center. 
Illumination: every galaxy has two or three layers and snail shells, tree or four layers. Then it is difficult to show a scheme of spiral shape with seven layers, because we need at least twenty meters wide space or area.
 
Explanation of such a system: 
1.        The seven layers with rigid septum form the “cosmic snail”.
2.        The bright spots form visible universe. (4% heaviness of the cosmos)
3.        The rest of the seven layers is Dark matter. (22%)
4. The blackout core, called Dark energy, is “cosmic snail core”. (74%)
5.       “Cosmic snail core” is the main feeding source for the cosmic snail, as the expansive “space time”, so the further the layers of the cosmic snail is near the core, the further the mass and density and slower the time. The time becomes slower because movement becomes slower by gravity, such as no time in the core and the gravity is at the most.
 
 
Super gravitation
In attention to discoveries of the COBE and WMAP (only, until 380000 years after Big Bang is visible) and to assume the cosmic snail shape, the gravitational relationship among the Beings parts is, as following: 
 
1.       The Visible universe: the gravitation of the moons are attached to the planets, the planets to the stars, the stars to the galaxies, the galaxies to the galactic cluster, and them to the galactic super clusters, etc.
 
2.       The Dark matter: the gravitation of the visible universe (4%) attached to the Dark matter (22%) which spread all over the cosmic snail.

 

This artist's representation shows how galaxies' disks tend to be oriented perpendicular to the huge filaments of galaxies forming the large-scale cosmic web. In reality, galaxies are much smaller and farther apart, compared to the size of filaments, than shown here. Gabriel Pérez 



3.       The Dark energy: the Dark matter gravitation attached to the Dark energy (74%). 
 
Super gravitation: the gravitation of the Dark energy attached to the Supreme Being. Then super gravitation is the Almighty God.

Trinity cosmos (3M universes)
In attention to above achievements, we can announce and proclaim that our interpretation of beings is that we can recognize three forms of the universes, which form the ‘cosmos’ as following:
 
Main universe (cosmic snail core) called Dark energy (singularity universe) with these substantive particulars: 
•         It is the main feeding source for the ‘cosmic snail’ as the expansive “space time” with any “space time” and expansion itself. It is the “constants universe” meanwhile is not a “constant universe”.
•         Its essence is of quantum, and its quality is of absolute light.
•         Because of having the most mass and density, seems blackout and invisible; like as a huge and singular powerful black hole. 
•         Like as every other source loses some of its energy, but the changes are very insignificant.
 
Middle universe called Dark matter (light and power universe) with these functions:
•         It is the coordinator and preserver between main and visible universes.
•         It plays the role of an active regulator with safety regulations to control the cosmic system affairs. 
•         It is the factory of galaxy making. It takes energy over ‘main universe’ (input) and after a process of actions and reactions, sends them probably through wormholes to the visible universe (output). Dark energy is so much powerful, that it is actually impossible to produce directly something visible. 
•         Reconstruction: dead stars like as black dwarf, comeback to this factory through black holes for reconstruction; because nothing spoiled in the system and all the changes are merely displacement and rearrangement of the energy, the matters, and the waves. 
 
Mini universe called visible universe (multiplicity universe) we know relatively its specifications. 
 
Scientific justification of the model:
1. ISOTROPIC VIEW FOR THE UNIVERSE
1.        Some years before Edwin Hubble discovery of the universe expansion, Alexander Friedman had got two simple hypothesizes in 1922:
•         The universe looks generally the same from any point of vantage. 
•         No part of it is exactly is identical to any other part, still its overall makeup is the same everywhere. 
2.        In 1965, a couple of American physicists: Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson declared that the sounds come from outer space, before reach us, they have passed through great parts of the universe; furthermore, these waves are monotonous and homogeneous in various directions. Then they came to a good conclusion: The Universe is “Isotropic” in greater scales.
3. No better isotropic shape than spiral (snail shell) shape, among the geometrical shapes can be found. Then THE UNIVERSE SHAPE IS SPIRAL. 
 
2. EINSTEIN’S GRAVITATIONAL VIEW 
1.        According to General Relativity Theory, the matter changes and twists the surrounding space, and contorts it out of the usual shape, then the further the mass and density of the matter in a certain field, the further its curvature.
2.        The center of a snail shell has the most mass, density and curvature. 
3.        According to the Doppler Effect and the achievements of the Big Bang, the center of universe should have the most density and plaits. 
      Then THE UNIVERSE SHAPE IS SPIRAL.
 
3. WAVES RETAINING VIEW FOR THE UNIVERSE
1.       Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson discovered microwave background radiation, using a very large horny shaped receiver, and they declared that the universe entirely filled with this radiation; and this discovery won them the Noble Prize.
 
  
 
2.       Had the receiver not been horny shaped, this discovery would not have been possible (since horn has a partial snail’s shell shape).
3.       Had the universe not been spiral - shaped, it could not have retained this radiation since the Big Bang. 
Then THE UNIVERSE SHAPE IS SPIRAL.
 
Efficiencies of the model:
1. Proving the existence of enough energy in the main universe, to justify the Big Crunch and to believe the universe has purposefully created. Deliver a valuable idea in this case by NASA / WMAP Science Team: 
The cosmic microwave background (CMB) is leftover radiation from the Big Bang stretched by the universe's expansion into the microwave region of the spectrum. In this image, NASA's Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) records minuscule temperature fluctuations in the CMB as different colors. 
In principle, an advanced civilization could create a universe and encode information in the CMB that would let civilizations in the offspring universe, know that their universe has purposefully created. 
 
 
 
2. Substantiation the Einstein view about cosmic curvature and refuting the devious ideas has expressed by some cosmologists in this field.
 
3. Correction of the Hubble Law
Hubble said:
The further a galaxy away from the earth, the greater its velocity of escape. 
He declared this view, because he had not known the shape of the universe; otherwise, he would have said: The further a galaxy away from the main universe, the greater its velocity of escape.
 
4. Correction of the Hawking view about the universe shape
Prof. Hawking has written a book and titled The Universe in a Nut’s shell. He chose such a title, because he had not known the shape of the cosmos; otherwise, he would have titled his book: The Universe in a Snail’s shell; but his idea about hardness of the universe’s shell as a nut’s shell or snail’s shell, is admirable.
 
5.        Resolving many problems in the cosmological fields for example, scientific struggle between Harlow Shapley and Herbert D. Curtis in 1920. Then, Hubble explanation in this field maybe rejected.
In attention to “the further the layers of the cosmic snail near the core, the further the mass and density, and slower the time” and assume hardness of the cosmic snail septum, many of the distance measures according to the Hubble constant measurements, maybe needed to revise.  
It seems our theory will call the Hublle Law defenders to challenge. Because another problem with estimating the size of the universe, is curvature of space-time as we believe in spiral shape for the universe also held by the general theory of relativity. This curvature also would affect measurements of distance based on the passage of light through space from objects.
 
6.        Rejection the idea of colliding and merge the closing galaxies. Galaxies move in the layers of cosmic snail with rigid septum; and the layers are upon each other. The cosmologists suppose all the closing galaxies will collide and merge in together, but at least while two galaxies are in the separate layers, is not so, however near they may be. This viewpoint will solve many of the problems in cosmology field. Some examples:
2005 March 1 
 
NGC 1531/2: Interacting Galaxies 
Explanation: This dramatic image of an interacting pair of galaxies was made using 8-meter Gemini South telescope at Cerro Pachon, Chile. NGC 1531 is the background galaxy with a bright core just above center and NGC 1532 is the foreground spiral galaxy laced with dust lanes. The pair is about 55 million light-years away in the southern constellation Eridanus. These galaxies lie close enough together so that each feels the influence of the other's gravity. The gravitational tug-of-war has triggered star formation in the foreground spiral as evidenced by the young, bright blue star clusters along the upper edge of the front spiral arm. Though the spiral galaxy in this pair is viewed nearly edge-on, astronomers believe the system is similar to the face-on spiral and companion known as M51, the Whirlpool Galaxy. 
2005 May 7
 
NGC 3314: When Galaxies Overlap
Explanation: NGC 3314 consists of two large spiral galaxies which just happen to almost exactly line-up. The foreground spiral is viewed nearly face-on, its pinwheel shape defined by young bright star clusters. But against the glow of the background galaxy, dark swirling lanes of interstellar dust are also seen to echo the face-on spiral's structure. The dust lanes are surprisingly pervasive, and this remarkable pair of overlapping galaxies is one of a small number of systems in which absorption of visible light can be used to directly explore the distribution of dust in distant spirals. NGC 3314 is about 140 million light-years away in the multi-headed constellation Hydra. 
7.        Refining the views of cosmologists about the problems which may occur in the future or even nowadays; for example, COBE achievements:  
The maximum frequency of the radiation intensity is different in a special direction rather than others; in other words, we can find a superior direction in the space; WMAP confirmed this viewpoint in May 2005 too. 
None of the existing scientific theories can explain this problem; meanwhile, only belief in the cosmic snail and its powerful core (main universe) justify such special direction.  
 
8. Consideration how the aphelion and perihelion have created:
Perhaps nobody has yet answered this question, why the sun (or any other star or even planet) has not settled in the center of its elliptical orbit, therefore, the aphelion and perihelion, should have be created?    
The answer: it is because of the cosmic spiral shape. In the cosmic snail, the “velocity of escape” is greater than “core’s gravitational attraction”; therefore, the aphelion and perihelion should have created. This also explain how the orbits of the planets and stars, are elliptical.
 
9. Meanwhile, we also shall find the answers of many of the questions; for example, why according to Kepler second law, the orbital velocity is variable; and the planets have retrograde motion?
The answers are also concealed in the cosmic snail, and because the velocity of escape, is greater than core’s gravitational attraction.
 
10. This theory can help us to reach the targets of establishment the Large Hadron collider too. 
 
Some questions and the answers
May Dark matter be really ‘matter’ or only it so called?
It may be just the ‘antimatter’ we looking for, in the universe. At least a part of Dark matter has formed of the antimatter, because the universe is symmetrically and concurrently, in order. 
 
Why velocity of light is invariable? 
- If the source of gravity and something is running away from it, just from the same quality, the velocity of escape is invariable. 
- The main universe is the gravity source and its quality is of light. 
- Then the velocity of light is invariable.  
 
Why the light has two states? 
- The visible light and the other rays all radiate from the main universe.  
- The main universe is invisible quantum source for the rays.
- While the light radiates from its source, has quantum state, but while becomes visible, takes wavy state too.    
- In other words, quantum state is substantive state for light and wavy state is its accidental state. 
 
Why light moves on straight line?
It depends to volatility nature of the light. Everything that runs away from its source has to escape straightly. Light is so, but while be impressed by a gravitational force, becomes curved or deviated towards another direction. WMAP showed this viewpoint to confirm Einstein’s theory for second time in May 2005, after 1919.
 
Are cosmologists searching out a Final Theory? 
It seems this theory would be able unsettlingly to solve all cosmological problems, therefore we can ask: 
Maybe this theory, replace the Theory of Everything, which guides us to a Final Theory?
For accession to a Final Theory in the future, it is better at first we accept this theory; it seems impossible otherwise. 
 
If some cosmologists wouldn’t like to accept this modern model for the universe,
It is better they reject it with strong reasons; reasons stronger than those of this article
 
STEPHEN HAWKING:
&quot;Huge questions remain to be answered before we can hope to have a complete picture of the universe we live in. I want you to share my excitement at the discoveries, past and present, which have revolutionized the way we think. From the Big Bang to black holes, from dark matter to a possible Big Crunch, our image of the universe today is full of strange sounding ideas, and remarkable truths. The story of how we arrived at this picture is the story of learning to understand what we see.&quot; 
 
Question: is really the shape of the cosmos so, that cosmologists suppose for example as following?
 
 
 

Princeton University theorist Paul Steinhardt, who helped pioneer inflation in the early 1980s, calls the WMAP result &quot;a milestone achievement.&quot; He says theorists have spent years developing more exotic types of inflation models that require new fields or fine-tuning mechanisms. &quot;This milestone means that many of these exotic ideas are out the window, which cleans up the field a lot,&quot; he says. But he also points out that the new WMAP results are consistent with another idea that he helped develop: that our universe occasionally collides with another universe in higher-dimensional space-time, leading to endlessly repeating cycles of Big Bangs and expansion. WMAP team members agree that this cyclic model is consistent with their results, and that a next-generation satellite is needed to determine which model, if either, explains our universe.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==ABAP &amp; COBOL==

I find it odd that in a such an apparently complete listing of languages there's no mention of:
a) COBOL - which is largely obsolete, but still in heavy use. There's oodles (tech term) of programs being used by various institutions; e.g. US government and various banks. The lack of avaialble programmers to maintain this huge library of programs causes said institutions a variety of headaches. Since it's not much taught anymore, and not the sexy new langauge, there's a rapidly diminshing supply of folks capable of doing the job. On the flip side, this may result in a migration to newer products = jobs and projects.

b) ABAP - SAPs programming language. In the last couple of years I've been in a constant search for competent ABAPers and arranging training for exising SAP users who want/need to learn the language.


OK I'm new to this so please forgive me if I'm violating the social mores of the media, and I'm happy to accept constructive criticism if someone wants to point out the error of my ways...

=== Usage ===
Use on user pages or user talk pages when people shouldn't expect them to be answered to quickly. When using simply &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{busy}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, the template produces the message above

=== Parameters ===

There are two unnamed parameters. The first which replaces &quot;this user&quot; with the name placed.&lt;br&gt;
IE &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{busy|He}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; produces
{{busy|He}}
The second unnamed parameter replaces &quot;in real life&quot; with whatever is put. Unfortunately, at the time being it requires for there to be something in the first parameter (DO NOT use &lt;nowiki&gt;{{busy||foo}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;).&lt;br&gt;
IE &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{busy|This user|at school}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; produces
{{busy|This user|at school}}

=== Optional parameters ===

*'''reason''', use to specify a reason why you will be busy.&lt;br&gt;
IE &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{busy|reason=not being allowed to edit Wikibooks while at work,}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; produces
{{busy|reason=not being allowed to edit Wikibooks while at work,}}
*'''end''', use to specify until when you will be busy.&lt;br&gt;
IE &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{busy|end=Monday evening (UTC)}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; produces
{{busy|end=Monday evening (UTC)}}
*'''msg''' appends any custom message at the end.&lt;br&gt;
IE &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{busy|msg=April Fool!}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; produces
{{busy|msg=April Fool!}}
*'''small''' will display the small version of this box,&lt;br&gt;
IE &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{busy|small=yes}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; produces
{{busy|small=yes}}

{{-}}
=== Sample using all parameters ===
&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{busy|Johnny Doe|at school|reason=school being compulsory|end=Saturday morning (EST)|msg=I won't be on for Saturday the 25th, though.}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; produces

{{busy|Johnny Doe|at school|reason=school being compulsory|end=Saturday morning (EST)|msg=I won't be on for Saturday the 25th, though.}}

Let &lt;math&gt;u(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; be a harmonic function on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt; and suppose that 

&lt;math&gt;\int \int_{\mathbb{R}^2} |\nabla u | ^2 (x,y)\, dx\,dy &lt; \infty.&lt;/math&gt;

Show that &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is a constant function.
|}

===Solution===
Let &lt;math&gt;C=\int \int_{\mathbb{R}^2} |\nabla u | ^2 (x,y)\, dx\,dy &lt; \infty.&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is harmonic (i.e. &lt;math&gt;\Delta u=0&lt;/math&gt;) then so must &lt;math&gt;v=\nabla u&lt;/math&gt; (surely, &lt;math&gt;\Delta \nabla u =0&lt;/math&gt;).  Then since the absolute value as an operator is convex, we have that &lt;math&gt;|v|=|\nabla u|&lt;/math&gt; is a subharmonic function on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt;.  

Then by the mean value property of subharmonic functions, for any &lt;math&gt;x_0\in\mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt;we have

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{lll}
|v(x_0)|&amp;\leq&amp; \frac{1}{\pi r^2} \int_{B(x_0,r)} |v|\,dx\,dy\\
&amp;\leq&amp; \frac{1}{\pi r^2} \left( \int_{B(x_0,r)} 1\,dx\,dy \right)^{1/2} \left( \int_{B(x_0,r)} |v|^2\,dx\,dy\right)^{1/2}\\
&amp;\leq &amp; \frac{C}{\sqrt{\pi r^2}}
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;

where the second inequality is due to Cauchy-Schwarz (Hölder) inequality.

This estimate hold for all &lt;math&gt;r&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;.  Therefore if we send &lt;math&gt;r\to\infty&lt;/math&gt; we see that for all &lt;math&gt;x_0\in \mathbb{R}^2,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;|v(x_0)|=|\nabla u(x_0)|=0&lt;/math&gt;  which gives us that &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is constant.

Let &lt;math&gt;u(x,t)&lt;/math&gt; be a piecewise smooth weak solution of the conservation law 
&lt;math&gt;u_t+f(u)_x=0,\quad -\infty &lt; x &lt; \infty , t &gt; 0.&lt;/math&gt;

a) Derive the Rankine-Hugoniot conditions at a discontinuity of the solution.

b)Find a piecewise smooth solution to the IVP

&lt;math&gt;u_t+(u^2+u)_x=0,\quad -\infty&lt;x&lt;\infty, t&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;u(x,0)=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}1,&amp;x&lt;0\\-2&amp;x&gt;0.\end{array}\right.&lt;/math&gt;


|}
===Solution===
====a)====
When we solve the PDE by methods of characteristics, the characteristic curves can cross, causing a shock, or discontinuity.  The task at hand, is to find the curve of discontinuity, call it &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;.  
Multiply the PDE by &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;, a smooth test function with compact support in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}\times (0,\infty)&lt;/math&gt;.  Then by an integration by parts:

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} 0 =&amp; \int_0^\infty \int_{-\infty}^\infty (u_t + f(u)_x) v\,dx\,dt \\
=&amp;- \int_0^\infty \int_{-\infty}^\infty u v_t\,dx\,dt +\left.\int_{-\infty}^\infty v u \,dx \right|_{t=0}^{t=\infty} - \int_0^\infty \int_{-\infty}^\infty f(u)v_x\,dx\,dt + \left.\int_0^\infty f(u) v\,dt \right|_{x=-\infty}^{x=\infty}\\
=&amp;- \int_0^\infty \int_{-\infty}^\infty u v_t\,dx\,dt -\int_{-\infty}^\infty v u(x,0) \,dx  - \int_0^\infty \int_{-\infty}^\infty f(u)v_x\,dx\,dt.
  \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;V_l&lt;/math&gt; denote the open region in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}\times(0,\infty)&lt;/math&gt; to the left of &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; and simlarly &lt;math&gt;V_r&lt;/math&gt; denotes the region to the right of &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;.  If the support of &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; lies entirely in either of these two regions, then all of the above boundary terms vanish and we get &lt;math&gt; 0 = \int_0^\infty \int_{-\infty}^\infty (u_t + f(u)_x) v\,dx\,dt  = \int_0^\infty \int_{-\infty}^\infty uv_t + f(u)v_x\,dx\,dt.&lt;/math&gt;

Now suppose the support of &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; intersects the discontinuity &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;.



====b)====
We can calculate &lt;math&gt;\sigma = \frac{F(u_l)-F(u_r)}{u_l-u_r} = \frac{1^2+1-(4-2)}{1+2}=0&lt;/math&gt;.  Therefore, the shock wave extends vertically from the origin.  That is,

&lt;math&gt;u(x,t)=\left\{ \begin{align} 1&amp; x&lt;0\\ -2 &amp; x&gt;0 \end{align}\right.&lt;/math&gt;

Consider the evolution equation with initial data

&lt;math&gt;u_{tt}-u_{xx}+u_t=(u_{xt}^3)_x,\quad -\infty&lt;x&lt;\infty, t&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;u(x,0)=f(x), u_t(x,0)=g(x), u(0,t)=u(1,t)=0.&lt;/math&gt;

a)  What energy quantity is appropriate for this equation?  Is it conserved or dissipated?

b)  Show that &lt;math&gt;C^3&lt;/math&gt; solutions of this problem are unique.
|}
===Solution===
====3a====
Consider the energy &lt;math&gt;E(t)=\frac{1}{2}\int_0^1 u_t^2+u_x^2\,dx&lt;/math&gt;.  Then
&lt;math&gt;\dot{E}(t)=\int_0^1 u_tu_{tt}+u_xu_{xt}\,dx&lt;/math&gt;.  Integrate by parts to get
&lt;math&gt;\dot{E}(t)=\int_0^1 u_tu_{tt}-u_{xx}u_{t}\,dx  + \left. u_tu_x\right|_0^1&lt;/math&gt;.
The boundary terms vanish since &lt;math&gt;u(0,t)=0&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;u_t(0,t)=0&lt;/math&gt; (similarly at &lt;math&gt;x=1&lt;/math&gt;).  Then by the original PDE we get

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\dot{E}(t)&amp;=&amp;\int_0^1 u_t((u_{xt}^3)_x-u_t)\,dx\\
&amp;=&amp;\int_0^1 u_t(u_{xt}^3)_x-u_t^2)\,dx\\
&amp;=&amp;\int_0^1 -u_{xt}^4 -u_t^2\,dx + \left. u_{xt}^3u_t\right|_0^1.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where the last equality is another integration by parts.  The boundary terms vanish again by the same argument.  Therefore, &lt;math&gt;\dot{E}(t)&lt;0&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;; that is, energy is dissipated.

====3b====
Suppose &lt;math&gt;u,v&lt;/math&gt; are two distinct solutions to the system.  Then &lt;math&gt;w=u-v&lt;/math&gt; is a solution to

&lt;math&gt;w_{tt}-w_{xx}+w_t=(w_{xt}^3)_x,\quad -\infty&lt;x&lt;\infty, t&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;w(x,0)=0, w_t(x,0)=0, w(0,t)=w(1,t)=0.&lt;/math&gt; 

This tells us that at &lt;math&gt;t=0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;w_x=w_t=0&lt;/math&gt;.  Therefore, &lt;math&gt;E(0)=0&lt;/math&gt;.  Since &lt;math&gt;E(t)\leq E(0)&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;E(t)=0&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;.  This implies &lt;math&gt;w\equiv 0&lt;/math&gt;.  That is, &lt;math&gt;u=v&lt;/math&gt;.

==Problem 4 ==

Let &lt;math&gt;\Omega\subseteq \mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; be a bounded open set with smooth boundary &lt;math&gt;\partial\Omega&lt;/math&gt;.  Consider the initial boundary value problem for &lt;math&gt;u(x,t)&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;\left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
u_t - \nabla \cdot (a(x)\nabla u) + b(x) u = q,&amp; x\in\Omega,t&gt;0\\
u(x,0)=f(x),&amp;x\in\Omega\\
u_t+\partial u/\partial n +u =0,&amp; x\in \partial\Omega,t&gt;0
\end{array}
\right.&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\partial u/\partial n&lt;/math&gt; is the exterior normal derivative.  Assume that &lt;math&gt;a,b\in C^1(\bar\Omega)&lt;/math&gt; and that &lt;math&gt;a(x)\geq 0&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;x\in\Omega&lt;/math&gt;.  Show that smooth solutions of this problem are unique.
|}

===Solution===
Suppose &lt;math&gt;u,v&lt;/math&gt; are two distinct solutions.  Then &lt;math&gt;w=u-v&lt;/math&gt; is a smooth solution to 

&lt;math&gt;\left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
w_t - \nabla \cdot (a(x)\nabla w) + b(x) u = 0,&amp; x\in\Omega,t&gt;0\\
w(x,0)=0,&amp;x\in\Omega\\
w_t+\partial w/\partial n +w =0,&amp; x\in \partial\Omega,t&gt;0
\end{array}
\right.&lt;/math&gt;

Consider the energy &lt;math&gt;E(t)=\frac{1}{2} \int_\Omega w^2\,dx + \frac{1}{2}\int_{\partial\Omega} a(x) w^2\,dS&lt;/math&gt;.  It is easy to verify that &lt;math&gt;E(0)=0&lt;/math&gt;.  Then 

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\dot E(t) =&amp; \int_\Omega w w_t\,dx +\int_{\partial\Omega} a(x) w w_t\,dS\\
=&amp; \int_\Omega w \nabla\cdot(a(x)\nabla w) - b(x) w^2\, dx + \int_{\partial\Omega} a(x) w w_t\,dS\\
=&amp; \int_\Omega -\nabla w \cdot (a(x)\nabla w) - b(x) w^2\, dx + \int_{\partial\Omega} w a(x) \frac{\partial w}{\partial n} \, dS+ \int_{\partial\Omega} a(x) w w_t\,dS\\
=&amp; \int_\Omega -a(x) \nabla w \cdot \nabla w - b(x) w^2\, dx + \int_{\partial\Omega}  -a(x) w^2 - a(x) w w_t \, dS+ \int_{\partial\Omega} a(x) w w_t\,dS\\
=&amp; \int_\Omega -a(x) \nabla w \cdot \nabla w - b(x) w^2\, dx + \int_{\partial\Omega}  -a(x) w^2 \, dS\\
\leq &amp; \int_\Omega - b(x) w^2\,dx \\
 \leq&amp; \| b\|_{L^\infty(\Omega)} \int_\Omega w^2\,dx
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore &lt;math&gt;\dot E(t)\leq \| b\|_{L^\infty(\Omega)} E(t)&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;E(t)\leq E(0) e^{\| b\|_{L^\infty(\Omega)} t} =0&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus, &lt;math&gt;E(t)=0&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; which implies &lt;math&gt;w \equiv 0&lt;/math&gt;



==Problem 5 ==
{| WIDTH=&quot;80%&quot;

| style=&quot;background-color: #FFFFEE; border: solid 1px #FFC92E; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot; |

Let &lt;math&gt;\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; be a bounded open set with smooth boundary.  Let &lt;math&gt;K=\{u\in H_0^1(\Omega):u\geq 0 \text{ in } \Omega\}&lt;/math&gt;.  Let &lt;math&gt;f\in L^2(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt; and define the functional

&lt;math&gt;I(u)=\frac{1}{2} \int_\Omega |\nabla u|^2\,dx - \int_\Omega fu\,dx&lt;/math&gt;.

Show that &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is a minimizer of &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; over &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; satisfies the variational inequality

&lt;math&gt;\int_\Omega \nabla u \cdot \nabla(u-v)\, dx \leq \int_\Omega f(u-v)\,dx&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;v\in K&lt;/math&gt;.
|}

===Solution===
&lt;math&gt;(\Rightarrow)&lt;/math&gt;  Suppose &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; minimizes &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. &lt;math&gt;I[u]\leq I[w]\, \forall w\in K&lt;/math&gt;.  Then for any fixed &lt;math&gt;w\in K&lt;/math&gt;, if we let &lt;math&gt;g(t)=(1-t)u+tv&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;I[g(0)]\leq I[g(t)]\, \forall 0\leq t \leq 1&lt;/math&gt;.  Let &lt;math&gt;i(t)=I[g(t)]&lt;/math&gt;; then we can say that &lt;math&gt;i'(0)\geq0&lt;/math&gt;.  Now we must compute &lt;math&gt;i'(0)&lt;/math&gt;.  We have

&lt;math&gt;
i(t)=\frac{1}{2} \int_\Omega \left|(1-t)\nabla u + t \nabla v \right|^2   - f ((1-t)u+tv)\,dx 
&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;i'(t)=\int_\Omega -(1-t)|\nabla u|^2 +(1-2t) \nabla u \cdot \nabla v + t |\nabla v|^2 - (1-t)fu -tfv\,dx&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;i'(0) =\int_\Omega -|\nabla u|^2 + \nabla u \cdot \nabla v - fu \,dx &lt;/math&gt;

Since we know &lt;math&gt;i'(0)\geq 0&lt;/math&gt; then 

&lt;math&gt;\int_\Omega f(u-v)\,dx \geq \int_\Omega |\nabla u|^2 - \nabla u \cdot \nabla v = \int_\Omega \nabla u \cdot \nabla (u-v)\,dx&lt;/math&gt; as desired.


&lt;math&gt;(\Leftarrow)&lt;/math&gt; Conversely suppose

&lt;math&gt;\int_\Omega \nabla u\cdot\nabla(u-v)\,dx = \int_\Omega |\nabla|^2 - \nabla u \cdot \nabla v \,dx \leq \int_\Omega f (u-v)\,dx.&lt;/math&gt;

Then 
&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{lll}
\int_\Omega |\nabla u|^2 -fu\,dx &amp;\leq&amp; \int_\Omega \nabla u \cdot \nabla v -fv\,dx \\
&amp;\leq &amp; \int_\Omega |\nabla u||\nabla v| -fv\,dx \\
&amp; \leq &amp;  \int_\Omega 1/2|\nabla u|^2+1/2|\nabla v|^2 -fv\,dx
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, &lt;math&gt;1/2 \int_\Omega |\nabla u|^2 -fu\,dx \leq 1/2 \int_\Omega |\nabla v|^2-fv\,dx&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;v\in K&lt;/math&gt;.
That is, &lt;math&gt;I[u]\leq I[v]&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;v\in K&lt;/math&gt;, as desired.

What is a &quot;'''Skybox'''&quot;? It is basically a box that has clouds or sky on it that you use to make the sky.}}

'''#2'''. Are there parts of your landscape that you will never get to in the game but still see? If so, photo and then delete them. They'll take up too much space and RAM. Instead make them part of the skybox.}}

{{BBR/tip|
'''TIPS ON LANDSCAPING: Death Defying Drops!'''

'''#3'''. Add some death defying drops and some ponds (but only if they fit the landscape). You may also add a &quot;Physics Mesh&quot; around a pond like this which is invisible but stops you from falling in.

{{BBR/Note|
'''BLENDER NOTE: For Everyone'''

Is your landscape High-Poly? If so you can make your high-poly objects &quot;No Collision&quot; in the physics and add a less high poly model which is invisible around it. This is called a physics mesh. It will make it so that the physics engine doesn't have to handle so much stuff.}}

=== Usage ===
Use on user pages or user talk pages when people shouldn't expect them to be answered to quickly. When using simply &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{busy}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, the template produces the message above

=== Parameters ===
'''What State Are You In'''

This template says &quot;In a good mood&quot; automatically:

{{Hapgry}}

This is using: &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Hapgry}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

However you can get it to say a different mode by typing:

&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Hapgry|[Your User Name]|[Your mood starting with &quot;in a&quot;.]}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

It comes out with this:

{{Hapgry|[Your User Name]|[Your mood starting with &quot;in a&quot;.]}}

End result:

{{Hapgry|Downdate|in a very, very, VERY good mood}}</text>

I'm proud to announce a new template: Hapgry. This enables you to show your current mood on your user or talk page. Simply type in &quot;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Hapgry|[Your User Name]|[Your mood]}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&quot; and let it do the work. You may update it when ever you want. And an example of what it looks like?

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
[[File:Stele Mnesarete Glyptothek Munich 491 n1.jpg|thumb|Funerary stele of Mnesarete; a young servant (left) is facing her dead mistress.[1] Attica, circa 380 BCE. (Glyptothek, Munich, Germany)]]

Slavery was common practice and an integral component of ancient Greece throughout its rich history, as it was in other societies of the time including ancient Palestine and early Christian societies. It is estimated that in Athens, the majority of citizens owned at least one slave. Most ancient writers considered slavery not only natural but necessary, but some isolated debate began to appear, notably in Socratic dialogues while the Stoics produced the first condemnation of slavery recorded in history.

In conformity with modern historiographical practice, this article will discuss only chattel (personal possession) slavery, as opposed to dependent groups such as the ''penestae'' of Thessaly or the Spartan helots, who were more like medieval serfs (an enhancement to real estate). The chattel slave is an individual deprived of liberty and forced to submit to an owner who may buy, sell, or lease him or her like any other chattel.

The study of slavery in ancient Greece poses a number of significant methodological problems. Documentation is disjointed and very fragmented, focusing on the city of Athens. No treatise is specifically devoted to the subject. Judicial pleadings of the 4th century BCE were interested in slavery only as a source of revenue. Comedy and tragedy represented stereotypes. Iconography made no substantial differentiation between slave and craftsman.

==Terminology==

The ancient Greeks had many words to describe slaves which need to be placed in context to avoid ambiguity. In Homer, Hesiod and Theognis of Megara, the slave was called δμώς / ''dmôs''. The term has a general meaning but refers particularly to war prisoners taken as booty, in other words, property. During the classical period, the Greeks frequently used ἀνδράποδον / ''andrápodon'', literally, &quot;one with the feet of a man&quot;, as opposed to τετράποδον / ''tetrapodon'', &quot;quadruped&quot;, or livestock. The most common word is δοῦλος / ''doûlos'', an earlier form of which appears in Mycenaean inscriptions as do-e-ro, used in opposition to &quot;free man&quot; (ἐλεύθερος / ''eleútheros''). The verb δουλεὐω (which survives in modern Greek, meaning work) can be used metaphorically for other forms of dominion, as of one city over another or parents over their children. Finally, the term οἰκέτης / ''oikétês'' was used, meaning &quot;one who lives in house&quot;, referring to household servants.

Other terms used were less precise and required context:

* θεράπων / ''therápôn'' – At the time of Homer, the word meant &quot;squire&quot; (Patroclus was referred to as the therapôn of Achilles and Meriones that of Idomeneus); during the classical age, it meant &quot;servant&quot;.
* ἀκόλουθος / ''akólouthos'' – literally, &quot;the follower&quot; or &quot;the one who accompanies&quot;. Also, the diminutive ἀκολουθίσκος, used for page boys.
* παῖς / ''pais'' – literally &quot;child&quot;, used in the same way as &quot;houseboy&quot;, also used in a derogatory way to call adult slaves.
* σῶμα / ''sôma'' – literally &quot;body&quot;, used in the context of emancipation.

==Origins of slavery==
[[File:Aias Kassandra Louvre G458.jpg|left|thumb|Women as plunder of war: Ajax the Lesser taking Cassandra, tondo of a red-figure kylix by the Kodros Painter, ca. 440-430 BCE, Louvre.]]

Slaves were present through the Mycenaean civilization. In the tablets from Pylos 140 do-e-ro can be identified with certainty. Two legal categories can be distinguished: &quot;common&quot; slaves and &quot;slaves of the god&quot; (te-o-jo do-e-ro / θεοιο), the God in this case probably being Poseidon. Slaves of the god are always mentioned by name and own their own land; their legal status is close to that of freemen. The nature and origin of their bond to the divinity is unclear. The names of common slaves show that some of them came from Kythera, Chios, Lemnos or Halicarnassus, and were probably enslaved as a result of piracy. The tablets indicate that unions between slaves and non-slaves were not uncommon and that slaves could be independent artisans and retain plots of land. It appears that the major division in Mycenaean civilization was not between slave and free, but between those attached to the palace and those not.

There is no continuity between the Mycenaean era and the time of Homer, where social structures reflected those of the Greek dark ages. The terminology differs: the slave is no longer do-e-ro (''doulos'') but ''dmôs''. In the Iliad, slaves are mainly women taken as booty of war, while men were either ransomed or killed on the battlefield. In the Odyssey, the slaves also seem to be mostly women. These slaves were servants and sometimes concubines. There were some male slaves, especially in the Odyssey, a prime example being the swineherd Eumaeus. The slave was distinctive in being a member of the core part of the ''oikos'' (&quot;family unit&quot;, &quot;household&quot;): Laertes eats and drinks with his servants; in the winter, he sleeps in their company. The term dmôs is not considered pejorative, and Eumaeus, the &quot;divine&quot; swineherd, benefits from the same Homeric epithet as the Greek heroes. In spite of this, slavery remained a disgrace. Eumaeus himself declares that &quot;Zeus, of the far-borne voice, takes away the half of a man's virtue, when the day of slavery comes upon him.&quot;

It is difficult to determine when slave trading began in the archaic period. In Works and Days (8th century BCE), Hesiod owns numerous ''dmôes'', although their status is unclear. The presence of douloi is confirmed by lyric poets such as Archilochus or Theognis of Megara. According to epigraphic evidence, the homicide law of Draco (c. 620 BCE) mentioned slaves. According to Plutarch, Solon (c. 594-593 BCE) forbade slaves from practising gymnastics and pederasty. By the end of the period, references become more common. Slavery becomes prevalent at the very moment when Solon establishes the basis for Athenian democracy. Classical scholar Moses Finley likewise remarks that Chios, which, according to Theopompus, was the first city to organize a slave trade, also enjoyed an early democratic process (in the 6th century BCE). He concludes that &quot;one aspect of Greek history, in short, is the advance hand in hand, of freedom and slavery.&quot;

==Economic role==
[[File:Amphora olive-gathering BM B226.jpg|thumb|Agriculture, a common use for slaves, black-figure neck-amphora by the Antimenes Painter, British Museum.]]

All activities were open to slaves with the exception of politics. For the Greeks, politics was the only activity worthy of a citizen, the rest being relegated wherever possible to non-citizens. It was status that was of importance, not activity.

The principal use of slavery was in agriculture, the foundation of the Greek economy. Some small landowners might own one slave, or even two. An abundant literature of manuals for landowners (such as the Economy of Xenophon or that of Pseudo-Aristotle) confirms the presence of dozens of slaves on the larger estates; they could be common labourers or foremen. The extent to which slaves were used as a labour force in farming is disputed. It is certain that rural slavery was very common in Athens, and that ancient Greece did not know of the immense slave populations found on the Roman latifundia.

In mines and quarries slave labour was prevalent, with found large slave populations often leased out by rich private citizens. The strategos Nicias leased a thousand slaves to the silver mines of Laurium in Attica; Hipponicos, 600; and Philomidès, 300. Xenophon indicates that they received one obolus per slave per day, amounting to 60 drachmas per year. This was one of the most prized investments for Athenians. The number of slaves working in the Laurium mines or in the mills processing ore has been estimated at 30,000. Xenophon suggested that the city buy a large number of slaves, up to three state slaves per citizen, so that their leasing would assure the upkeep of all the citizens.

Slaves were also used as craftsmen and tradespersons. As in agriculture, they were used for labour that was beyond the capability of the family. The slave population was greatest in workshops: the shield factory of Lysias employed 120 slaves, and the father of Demosthenes owned 32 cutlers and 20 bedmakers.

Slaves were also employed in the home. The domestic's main role was to stand in for his master at his trade and to accompany him on trips. In time of war he was batman to the hoplite. The female slave carried out domestic tasks, in particular bread baking and textile making. Only the poorest citizens did not possess a domestic slave.

==Demographics==
===Population===
[[File:NAMA Cheval &amp; esclave éthiopien.jpg|left|thumb|Ethiopian slave attempts to break in a horse, date unknown, National Archaeological Museum of Athens.]]

It is difficult to estimate the number of slaves in ancient Greece, given the lack of a precise census and variations in definitions during that era. It is certain that Athens had the largest slave population, with as many as 80,000 in the 6th and 5th centuries BCE, on average three or four slaves per household. In the 5th century BCE, Thucydides remarked on the desertion of 20,890 slaves during the war of Decelea, mostly tradesmen. The lowest estimate, of 20,000 slaves, during the time of Demosthenes, corresponds to one slave per family. Between 317 BCE and 307 BCE, the tyrant Demetrius Phalereus ordered a general census of Attica, which arrived at the following figures: 21,000 citizens, 10,000 metics and 400,000 slaves. The orator Hypereides, in his Against Areistogiton, recalls that the effort to enlist 150,000 male slaves of military age led to the defeat of the Greeks at the Battle of Chaeronea (338 BCE), which corresponds to the figures of Ctesicles.

According to the literature, it appears that the majority of free Athenians owned at least one slave. Aristophanes, in Plutus, portrays poor peasants who have several slaves; Aristotle defines a house as containing freemen and slaves. Conversely, not owning even one slave was a clear sign of poverty. In the celebrated discourse of Lysias For the Invalid, a cripple pleading for a pension explains &quot;my income is very small and now I'm required to do these things myself and do not even have the means to purchase a slave who can do these things for me.&quot; However, the huge slave populations of the Romans were unknown in ancient Greece. When Athenaeus cites the case of Mnason, friend of Aristotle and owner of a thousand slaves, this appears to be exceptional. Plato, owner of five slaves at the time of his death, describes the very rich as owning 50 slaves.

Thucydides estimates that the isle of Chios had proportionally the largest number of slaves.

===Sources of supply===

There were four primary sources of slaves: war, in which the defeated would become slaves to the victorious unless a more objective outcome was reached; piracy (at sea); banditry (on land); and international trade.

====War====

By the rules of war of the period, the victor possessed absolute rights over the vanquished, whether they were soldiers or not. Enslavement, while not systematic, was common practice. Thucydides recalls that 7,000 inhabitants of Hyccara in Sicily were taken prisoner by Nicias and sold for 120 talents in the neighbouring village of Catania. Likewise in 348 BCE the population of Olynthus was reduced to slavery, as was that of Thebes in 335 BCE by Alexander the Great and that of Mantineia by the Achaean League.

The existence of Greek slaves was a constant source of discomfort for free Greeks. The enslavement of cities was also a controversial practice. Some generals refused, such as the Spartans Agesilaus II and Callicratidas. Some cities passed accords to forbid the practice: in the middle of the 3rd century BCE, Miletus agreed not to reduce any free Knossian to slavery, and vice versa. Conversely, the emancipation by ransom of a city that had been entirely reduced to slavery carried great prestige: Cassander, in 316 BCE, restored Thebes. Before him, Philip II of Macedon enslaved and then emancipated Stageira.

====Piracy and banditry====

Piracy and banditry provided a significant and consistent supply of slaves, though the significance of this source varied according to era and region. Pirates and brigands would demand ransom whenever the status of their catch warranted it. Whenever ransom was not paid or not warranted, captives would be sold to a trafficker. In certain areas, piracy was practically a national specialty, described by Thucydides as &quot;the old-fashioned&quot; way of life. Such was the case in Acarnania, Crete, and Aetolia. Outside of Greece, this was also the case with Illyrians, Phoenicians, and Etruscans. During the Hellenistic period, Cilicians and the mountain peoples from the coasts of Anatolia could also be added to the list. Strabo explains the popularity of the practice amongst the Cilicians by its profitability; Delos, not far away, allowed for &quot;moving a myriad of slaves daily&quot;. The growing influence of the Roman Republic, a large consumer of slaves, led to development of the market and an aggravation of piracy. In the 1st century BCE, however, the Romans largely eradicated piracy to protect the Mediterranean trade routes.

====Slave trade====

There was slave trade between kingdoms and states of the wider region. The fragmentary list of slaves confiscated from the property of the mutilators of the Hermai mentions 32 slaves whose origin have been ascertained: 13 came from Thrace, 7 from Caria, and the others came from Cappadocia, Caria, Scythia, Phrygia, Lydia, Syria, Ilyria, Macedon and Peloponnese. The mechanism was similar to that later seen in the African slave trade: local professionals sold their own people to Greek slave merchants. The principal centers of the slave trade appear to have been Ephesus, Byzantium, and even faraway Tanais at the mouth of the Don. Some &quot;barbarian&quot; slaves were victims of war or localised piracy, but others were sold by their parents. There is a lack of direct evidence of slave traffic, but corroborating evidence exists. Firstly, certain nationalities are consistently and significantly represented in the slave population, such as the corps of Scythian archers employed by Athens as a police force—originally 300, but eventually nearly a thousand. Secondly, the names given to slaves in the comedies often had a geographical link; thus Thratta, used by Aristophanes in The Wasps, The Acharnians, and Peace, simply signified Thracian woman. Finally, the nationality of a slave was a significant criterion for major purchasers; the ancient advice was not to concentrate too many slaves of the same origin in the same place, in order to limit the risk of revolt. It is also probable that, as with the Romans, certain nationalities were considered more productive as slaves than others.

The price of slaves varied in accordance with their ability. Xenophon valued a Laurion miner at 180 drachmas; while a workman at major works was paid one drachma per day. Demosthenes' father's cutlers were valued at 500 to 600 drachmas each. Price was also a function of the quantity of slaves available; in the 4th century BCE they were abundant and it was thus a buyer's market. A tax on sale revenues was levied by the market cities. For instance a large slave market was organized during the festivities at the temple of Apollo at Actium. The Acarnanian League, which was in charge of the logistics, received half of the tax proceeds, the other half going to the city of Anactorion, of which Actium was a part. Buyers enjoyed a guarantee against latent defects; the transaction could be invalidated if the bought slave turned out to be crippled and the buyer had not been warned about it.

===Natural growth===
[[File:Funerary stele Louvre Ma4498.jpg|thumb|Funerary stele for two young children and their pedagogue, killed in an earthquake, Nicomedia, 1st century BCE, Louvre.]]

Curiously, it appears that the Greeks did not &quot;breed&quot; their slaves, at least during the Classical Era, though the proportion of houseborn slaves appears to have been rather large in Ptolemaic Egypt and in manumission inscriptions at Delphi. Sometimes the cause of this was natural; mines, for instance, were exclusively a male domain. On the other hand, there were many female domestic slaves. The example of black people in the American South on the other hand demonstrates that slave populations can multiply. This incongruity remains relatively unexplained.

Xenophon advised that male and female slaves should be lodged separately, that &quot;…nor children born and bred by our domestics without our knowledge and consent—no unimportant matter, since, if the act of rearing children tends to make good servants still more loyally disposed, cohabiting but sharpens ingenuity for mischief in the bad.&quot; The explanation is perhaps economic; even a skilled slave was cheap, so it may have been cheaper to purchase a slave than to raise one. Additionally, childbirth placed the slave-mother's life at risk, and the baby was not guaranteed to survive to adulthood.

Houseborn slaves (''oikogeneis'') often constituted a privileged class. They were, for example, entrusted to take the children to school; they were &quot;pedagogues&quot; in the first sense of the term. Some of them were the offspring of the master of the house, but in most cities, notably Athens, a child inherited the status of its mother.

==Status of slaves==

The Greeks had many degrees of enslavement. There was a multitude of categories, ranging from free citizen to chattel slave, and including Penestae or helots, disenfranchised citizens, freedmen, bastards, and metics. The common ground was the deprivation of civic rights.

Professor Moses Finley proposed a set of criteria for different degrees of enslavement:

* Right to own property
* Authority over the work of another
* Power of punishment over another
* Legal rights and duties (liability to arrest and/or arbitrary punishment, or to litigate)
* Familial rights and privileges (marriage, inheritance, etc.)
* Possibility of social mobility (manumission or emancipation, access to citizen rights)
* Religious rights and obligations
* Military rights and obligations (military service as servant, heavy or light soldier, or sailor)

===Athenian slaves===

Athenian slaves were the property of their master (or of the state), who could dispose of them as he saw fit. He could give, sell, rent, or bequeath them. A slave could have a spouse and children, but the slave family was not recognized by the state, and the master could scatter the family members at any time. Slaves had fewer judicial rights than citizens and were represented by their master in all judicial proceedings. A misdemeanour that would result in a fine for the free man would result in a flogging for the slave; the ratio seems to have been one lash for one drachma. With several minor exceptions, the testimony of a slave was not admissible except under torture. Slaves were tortured in trials because they often remained loyal to their master. A famous example of trusty slave was Themistocles's Persian slave Sicinnus (the counterpart of Ephialtes of Trachis), who, despite his Persian origin, betrayed Xerxes and helped Athenians in the Battle of Salamis. Despite torture in trials, the Athenian slave was protected in an indirect way: if he was mistreated, the master could initiate litigation for damages and interest (δίκη βλάβης / ''dikê blabês''). Conversely, a master who excessively mistreated a slave could be prosecuted by any citizen (γραφὴ ὕβρεως / ''graphê'' ''hybreôs''); this was not enacted for the sake of the slave, but to avoid violent excess (ὕβρις / ''hubris'').
[[File:Phlyax scene Louvre CA7249.jpg|thumb|A master (right) and his slave (left) in a phlyax play, Silician red-figured calyx-krater, ca. 350 BC–340 BCE. Louvre Museum, Paris.]]

Isocrates claimed that &quot;not even the most worthless slave can be put to death without trial&quot;; the master's power over his slave was not absolute. Draco's law apparently punished with death the murder of a slave; the underlying principle was: &quot;was the crime such that, if it became more widespread, it would do serious harm to society?&quot; The suit that could be brought against a slave's killer was not a suit for damages, as would be the case for the killing of cattle, but a δίκη φονική (''dikê phonikê''), demanding punishment for the religious pollution brought by the shedding of blood. In the 4th century BCE, the suspect was judged by the Palladion, a court which had jurisdiction over unintentional homicide; the imposed penalty seems to have been more than a fine but less than death—maybe exile, as was the case in the murder of a Metic.

However, slaves did belong to their master's household. A newly-bought slave was welcomed with nuts and fruits, just like a newly-wed wife. Slaves took part in most of the civic and family cults; they were expressly invited to join the banquet of the Choes, second day of the Anthesteria, and were allowed initiation into the Eleusinian Mysteries. A slave could claim asylum in a temple or at an altar, just like a free man. The slaves shared the gods of their masters and could keep their own religious customs if any.

Slaves could not own property, but their masters often let them save up to purchase their freedom, and records survive of slaves operating businesses by themselves, making only a fixed tax-payment to their masters. Athens also had a law forbidding the striking of slaves: if a person struck what appeared to be a slave in Athens, that person might find himself hitting a fellow-citizen, because many citizens dressed no better. It astonished other Greeks that Athenians tolerated back-chat from slaves. Athenian slaves fought together with Athenian freemen at the battle of Marathon, and the monuments memorialize them. It was formally decreed before the battle of Salamis that the citizens should &quot;save themselves, their women, children, and slaves&quot;.

Slaves had special sexual restrictions and obligations. For example, a slave could not engage free boys in pederastic relationships (&quot;A slave shall not be the lover of a free boy nor follow after him, or else he shall receive fifty blows of the public lash.&quot;), and they were forbidden from the palaestrae (&quot;A slave shall not take exercise or anoint himself in the wrestling-schools.&quot;). Both laws are attributed to Solon. Fathers wanting to protect their sons from unwanted advances provided them with a slave guard, called a pedagogos, to escort the boy in his travels.

The sons of vanquished foes would be enslaved and often forced to work in male brothels, as in the case of Phaedo of Elis, who at the request of Socrates was bought and freed from such an enterprise by the philosopher's rich friends. The rape of slaves was against the law, just as with citizens.

===Slaves in Gortyn===
[[File:Gortys law inscription.jpg|thumb|A fragment of the Gortyn code in Gortyn, Crete.]]

In Gortyn, in Crete, according to a code engraved in stone dating to the 6th century BCE, slaves (''doulos'' or ''oikeus'') found themselves in a state of great dependence. Their children belonged to the master. The master was responsible for all their offences, and, inversely, he received amends for crimes committed against his slaves by others. In the Gortyn code, where all punishment was monetary, fines were doubled for slaves committing a misdemeanour or felony. Conversely, an offence committed against a slave was much less expensive than an offence committed against a free person. As an example, the rape of a free woman by a slave was punishable by a fine of 200 staters (400 drachms), while the rape of a non-virgin slave by another slave brought a fine of only one obolus (a sixth of a drachm).

Slaves did have the right to possess a house and livestock, which could be transmitted to descendants, as could clothing and household furnishings. Their family was recognized by law: they could marry, divorce, write a testament and inherit just like free men.

===A specific case: debt slavery===

Prior to its interdiction by Solon, Athenians practiced debt enslavement: a citizen incapable of paying his debts became &quot;enslaved&quot; to the creditor. The exact nature of this dependency is a much controversial issue amongst modern historians: was it truly slavery or another form of bondage? However, this issue primarily concerned those peasants known as ''hektēmoroi'' working leased land belonging to rich landowners and unable to pay their rents. In theory, those so enslaved would be liberated when their original debts were repaid. The system was developed with variants throughout the Near East and is cited in the Bible.

Solon put an end to it with the σεισάχθεια / ''seisachtheia'', liberation of debts, which prevented all claim to the person by the debtor and forbade the sale of free Athenians, including by themselves. Aristotle in his ''Constitution of the Athenians'' quotes one of Solon's poems:

:And many a man whom fraud or law had sold
:Far from his god-built land, an outcast slave,
:I brought again to Athens; yea, and some,
:Exiles from home through debt’s oppressive load,
:Speaking no more the dear Athenian tongue,
:But wandering far and wide, I brought again;
:And those that here in vilest slavery (''douleia'')
:Crouched ‘neath a master’s (''despōtes'') frown, I set them free.

Though much of Solon's vocabulary is that of &quot;traditional&quot; slavery, servitude for debt was at least different in that the enslaved Athenian remained an Athenian, dependent on another Athenian, in his place of birth. It is this aspect which explains the great wave of discontent with slavery of the 6th century BC, which was not intended to free all slaves but only those enslaved by debt. The reforms of Solon left two exceptions: the guardian of an unmarried woman who had lost her virginity had the right to sell her as a slave, and a citizen could &quot;expose&quot; (abandon) unwanted newborn children.

===Manumission===

The practice of manumission is confirmed to have existed in Chios from the 6th century BCE. It probably dates back to an earlier period, as it was an oral procedure. Informal emancipations are also confirmed in the classical period. It was sufficient to have witnesses, who would escort the citizen to a public emancipation of his slave, either at the theatre or before a public tribunal. This practice was outlawed in Athens in the middle of the 6th century BCE in order to avoid public disorder.

The practice became more common in the 4th century BCE and gave rise to inscriptions in stone which have been recovered from shrines such as Delphi and Dodona. They primarily date to the 2nd and 1st centuries CE, and the 1st century CE. Collective manumission was possible; an example is known from the 2nd century BCE in the island of Thasos. It probably took place during a period of war as a reward for the slaves' loyalty, but in most cases the documentation deals with a voluntary act on the part of the master (predominantly male, but in the Hellenistic period also female).

The slave was often required to pay for himself an amount at least equivalent to his street value. To do this he could use his savings or take a loan (ἔρανος / ''eranos'') from his master, a friend, or a client, which last was often the case for a courtesan, one of the most famous examples of which involved the hetaera Neaira.

Emancipation was often of a religious nature, where the slave was considered to be &quot;sold&quot; to a deity, often Delphian Apollo, or was consecrated after his emancipation. The temple would receive a portion of the monetary transaction and would guarantee the contract. The manumission could also be entirely civil, in which case the magistrate played the role of the deity.

The slave's freedom could be either total or partial, at the master's whim. In the former, the emancipated slave was legally protected against all attempts at re-enslavement—for instance, on the part of the former master's inheritors. In the latter case, the emancipated slave could be liable to a number of obligations to the former master. The most restrictive contract was the paramone, a type of enslavement of limited duration during which time the master retained practically absolute rights.

In regard to the city, the emancipated slave was far from equal to a citizen by birth. He was liable to all types of obligations, as one can see from the proposals of Plato in ''The Laws'': presentation three times monthly at the home of the former master, forbidden to become richer than him, etc. In fact, the status of emancipated slaves was similar to that of metics, the residing foreigners, who were free but did not enjoy a citizen's rights.

===Spartan slaves===

Spartan citizens used ''helots'', a dependent group collectively owned by the state. It is uncertain whether they had chattel slaves as well. There are mentions of people manumitted by Spartans, which was supposedly forbidden for helots, or sold outside of Lakonia: the poet Alcman; a Philoxenos from Cytherea, reputedly enslaved with all his fellow citizens when his city was conquered, later sold to an Athenian; a Spartan cook bought by Dionysius the Elder or by a king of Pontus, both versions being mentioned by Plutarch; and the famous Spartan nurses, much appreciated by Athenian parents.

Some texts mention both slaves and helots, which seems to indicate that they were not the same thing. Plato in ''Alcibiades I'' cites &quot;the ownership of slaves, and notably helots&quot; amongst the Spartan riches, and Plutarch writes about &quot;slaves and helots&quot;. Finally, according to Thucydides, the agreement that ended the 464 BCE revolt of helots stated that any Messenian rebel who might hereafter be found within the Peloponnese was &quot;to be the slave of his captor&quot;, which means that the ownership of chattel slaves was not illegal at that time.

Most historians thus concur that chattel slaves were indeed used in Sparta, at least after the Lacedemonian victory of 404 BCE against Athens, but not in great numbers and only amongst the upper classes. As was in the other Greek cities, chattel slaves could be purchased at the market or taken in war.

==Slavery conditions==
[[File:Black slave Louvre Br361.jpg|thumb|Black captive with tied hands, Ptolemaic Egypt, musée du Louvre.]]

It is difficult to appreciate the condition of Greek slaves. According to Aristotle, the daily routine of slaves could be summed up in three words: &quot;work, discipline, and feeding&quot;. Xenophon's advice is to treat slaves as domestic animals, that is to say punish disobedience and reward good behaviour. For his part, Aristotle prefers to see slaves treated as children and to use not only orders but also recommendations, as the slave is capable of understanding reasons when they are explained.

Greek literature abounds with scenes of slaves being flogged; it was a means of forcing them to work, as were control of rations, clothing, and rest. This violence could be meted out by the master or the supervisor, who was possibly also a slave. Thus, at the beginning of Aristophanes' ''The Knights'' (4–5), two slaves complain of being &quot;bruised and thrashed without respite&quot; by their new supervisor. However, Aristophanes himself cites what is a typical old saw in ancient Greek comedy:

:&quot;He also dismissed those slaves who kept on running off, or deceiving someone, or getting whipped. They were always led out crying, so one of their fellow slaves could mock the bruises and ask then: 'Oh you poor miserable fellow, what's happened to your skin? Surely a huge army of lashes from a whip has fallen down on you and laid waste your back?'&quot;
:
The condition of slaves varied very much according to their status; the mine slaves of Laureion and the ''pornai'' (brothel prostitutes) lived a particularly brutal existence, while public slaves, craftsmen, tradesmen and bankers enjoyed relative independence. In return for a fee (ἀποφορά / ''apophora'') paid to their master, they could live and work alone. They could thus earn some money on the side, sometimes enough to purchase their freedom. Potential emancipation was indeed a powerful motivator, though the real scale of this is difficult to estimate.

Ancient writers considered that Attic slaves enjoyed a &quot;peculiarly happy lot&quot;: Xenophon deplores the liberties taken by Athenian slaves: &quot;as for the slaves and Metics of Athens, they take the greatest licence; you cannot just strike them, and they do not step aside to give you free passage&quot;. This alleged good treatment did not prevent 20,000 Athenian slaves from running away at the end of the Peloponnesian War at the incitement of the Spartan garrison at Attica in Decelea. These were principally skilled artisans (''kheirotekhnai''), probably amongst the better-treated slaves. The title of a 4th-century comedy by Antiphanes, The Runaway-catcher (Δραπεταγωγός), suggests that slave flight was not uncommon.

Conversely, there are no records of a large-scale Greek slave revolt comparable to that of Spartacus in Rome. It can probably be explained by the relative dispersion of Greek slaves, which would have prevented any large-scale planning. Slave revolts were rare, even in Rome or the American South. Individual acts of rebellion of slaves against their master, though scarce, are not unheard of; a judicial speech mentions the attempted murder of his master by a boy slave, not 12 years old.

==Views of Greek slavery==
===Historical views===
[[File:Actor slave Louvre CA265.jpg|left|thumb|Depiction of a slave seated on an altar, looking at the purse he is about to steal, c. 400–375 BC, Louvre.]]

Very few authors of antiquity call slavery into question. To Homer and the pre-classical authors, slavery was an inevitable consequence of war. Heraclitus states that &quot;War is the father of all, the king of all ... he turns some into slaves and sets others free&quot;.

During the classical period, the main justification for slavery was economic. From a philosophical point of view, the idea of &quot;natural&quot; slavery emerged at the same time; thus, as Aeschylus states in ''The Persians'', the Greeks &quot;[o]f no man are they called the slaves or vassals&quot;, while the Persians, as Euripides states in Helen, &quot;are all slaves, except one&quot; — the Great King. Hippocrates theorizes about this latent idea at the end of the 5th century BC. According to him, the temperate climate of Anatolia produced a placid and submissive people. This explanation is reprised by Plato, then Aristotle in ''Politics'', where he develops the concept of &quot;natural slavery&quot;: &quot;for he that can foresee with his mind is naturally ruler and naturally master, and he that can do these things with his body is subject and naturally a slave.&quot; As opposed to an animal, a slave can comprehend reason but &quot;…has not got the deliberative part at all.&quot;

In parallel, the concept that all men, whether Greek or barbarian, belonged to the same race was being developed by the Sophists and thus that certain men were slaves although they had the soul of a freeman and vice versa. Aristotle himself recognized this possibility and argued that slavery could not be imposed unless the master was better than the slave, in keeping with his theory of &quot;natural&quot; slavery. The Sophists concluded that true servitude was not a matter of status but a matter of spirit; thus, as Menander stated, &quot;be free in the mind, although you are slave: and thus you will no longer be a slave&quot;. This idea, repeated by the Stoics and the Epicurians, was not so much an opposition to slavery as a trivialisation of it.

The Greeks could not comprehend an absence of slaves. Slaves exist even in the &quot;Cloudcuckooland&quot; of Aristophanes' ''The Birds'' as well as in the ideal cities of Plato's ''Laws'' or ''Republic''. The utopian cities of Phaleas of Chalcedon and Hippodamus of Miletus are based on the equal distribution of property, but public slaves are used respectively as craftsmen and land workers. The &quot;reversed cities&quot; placed women in power or even saw the end of private property, as in ''Lysistrata'' or ''Assemblywomen'', but could not picture slaves in charge of masters. The only societies without slaves were those of the Golden Age, where all needs were met. In this type of society, as explained by Plato, one reaped generously without sowing. In Telekleides' ''Amphictyons'' barley loaves fight with wheat loaves for the honour of being eaten by men. Moreover, objects move themselves—dough kneads itself, and the jug pours itself. Society without slaves is thus relegated to a different time and space. In a &quot;normal&quot; society, one needs slaves.

===Modern views===
[[File:NAMA Masque esclave.jpg|thumb|Theatre mask of a ''First slave'' in Greek comedy, 2nd century BC, National Archaeological Museum of Athens.]]

Slavery in Greek antiquity has long been an object of apologetic discourse among Christians, who awarded themselves the merit of its collapse. From the 16th century the discourse became moralizing in nature. The existence of colonial slavery had significant impact on the debate, with some authors lending it civilizing merits and others denouncing its misdeeds. Thus Henri-Alexandre Wallon in 1847 published a ''History of Slavery in Antiquity'' amongst his works for the abolition of slavery in the French colonies.

In the 19th century a politico-economic discourse emerged. It concerned itself with distinguishing the phases in the organisation of human societies and correctly identifying the place of Greek slavery. The influence of Marx is decisive; for him the ancient society was characterized by development of private ownership and the dominant (and not secondary as in other pre-capitalist societies) character of slavery as a mode of production. The Positivists represented by the historian Eduard Meyer (''Slavery in Antiquity'', 1898) were soon to oppose the Marxist theory. According to him slavery was the foundation of Greek democracy. It was thus a legal and social phenomenon, and not economic.

Current historiography developed in the 20th century; led by authors such as Joseph Vogt, it saw in slavery the conditions for the development of elites. Conversely, the theory also demonstrates an opportunity for slaves to join the elite. Finally, Vogt estimates that modern society, founded on humanist values, has surpassed this level of development.

In 2011, Greek slavery remains the subject of historiographical debate, on two questions in particular: can it be said that ancient Greece was a &quot;slave society&quot;, and did Greek slaves comprise a social class?

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Four colors of pills.jpg|thumb|400px|right|Four Different Dietary Supplements]]

According to the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration Food and Drug Administration] (FDA), a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_supplement dietary supplement] (DS) is a product taken by mouth that contains a &quot;dietary ingredient&quot; intended to supplement the diet. A dietary ingredient can include:
*a vitamin,
*a mineral,
*an herb or other botanical,
*an amino acid,
*a dietary substance for use by man to supplement the diet by increasing the total dietary intake (e.g., enzymes or tissues from organs or glands), or
*a concentrate, metabolite, constituent or extract.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Food and Drug Administration. (2009, December). What is a dietary supplement? http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/Transparency/Basics/ucm195635.htm. &lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the DS industry was estimated to be a $29 billion industry &lt;ref&gt;IBISWorld. (2012). Vitamin &amp; Supplement Manufacturing in the US Market Research. Vitamin &amp; Supplement Manufacturing in the US: Market Research Report. http://www.ibisworld.com/industry/default.aspx?indid=490&lt;/ref&gt;. In 2008, more than 75,000 DS were available in the U.S. &lt;ref name=&quot;Grollman&quot; &gt; Marcus, D. M., &amp; Grollman, A. P. (2012). The consequences of ineffective regulation on dietary supplements. Archives of Internal Medicine, 172(13).&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Current Legislation Governing the DS Industry==

===Dietary Supplement Health and Education (DSHEA) Act===
Since 1994, the DS industry has been regulated by the DSHEA act. DSHEA changed the classification of DS from 'drugs' to a food, eliminating the need for DS premarket safety testing and FDA approval &lt;ref&gt;Mason, S. A. (2010-2011). Dietary supplement regulation: A comparative study. Journal of Transnational Law and Policy, 20, 103-127.&lt;/ref&gt;.  Under DSHEA, DS manufacturers can make claims if product labels state the products has not been tested by the FDA and do not claim to &quot;prevent, treat, or cure a specific disease&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Cassileth, B. R., Heitzer, M., &amp; Wesa, K. (2009). The public health impact of herbs and nutritional supplements. Pharm Biol., 47(8), 761-767. doi:10.1080/13880200902991581.&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs)===
The FDA has established [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_manufacturing_practice Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs)] to require DS manufacturers to establish consistent quality, packaging, and labeling &quot;as specified in the master manufacturing record&quot; &lt;ref&gt;U.S. Food and Drug Administration. (2010, December). Guidance for industry: Current good manufacturing practice in manufacturing, packaging, labeling, or holding operations for dietary supplements; Small entity compliance guide. Food website:http://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation.&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Dietary Supplement and Nonprescription Drug Consumer Protection Act===
This act requires companies to include an address or phone number on the product label, so consumers may report adverse events they experience.  DS companies are required to report any adverse events to the FDA &lt;ref&gt;S. 3546 (109th): Dietary Supplement and Nonprescription Drug Consumer Protection Act, S. S.3546, 109th Cong., 1st Sess. (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Act===
The FTC Act gives the [http://www.ftc.gov/ FTC] authority to regulate DS advertising campaigns. The FTC requires advertisers to substantiate any claims before being released to consumers to avoid false and misleading advertising &lt;ref&gt;In the Matter of Regulations on Statements Made for Dietary Supplements Concerning the Effect of the Product on the Structure or Function of the Body; Docket No. 98N-0044 before the DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES and FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (1998) (testimony of Bureau of Consumer Protection of the Federal Trade Commission).&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Support for the DS Industry==

===Manufacturers and Trade Organizations===

As in any industry, DS manufacturers have formed trade groups to protect their interests. To distinguish themselves from competitors and improve perception of their industry, some companies are taking it upon themselves to make their products, innovations, and advertisements more transparent to consumers &lt;ref name = &quot;Sales&quot;/&gt;.

===Pro-DS Advocacy Groups===

Advocacy groups, such as the [http://www.citizens.org/ Citizens for Health Education Foundation (CFH)], work to influence government policy decisions (such as Senate Amendment 2127 to the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration_Safety_and_Innovation_Act Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act]) and to challenge unfavorable government actions legally.  In the 1999 case Pearson v. Shalala, two manufacturers, the American Preventive Medical Association (APMA), and the CFH, filed a lawsuit against the FDA, claiming the FDA could not require companies to scientifically validate health claims. The courts initially ruled in favor of the FDA, but later overturned the ruling &lt;ref&gt; Vladeck, D. C. (2000). Truth and consequences: The perils of half-truths and unsubstantiated health claims for dietary supplements. Journal of Public Policy &amp; Marketing, 132-138. &lt;/ref&gt;.  Following this case, the FDA lost a number of other cases surrounding the issue of product labels &lt;ref&gt; Emord &amp; Associates. (2010). Significant cases. http://www.emord.com/. &lt;/ref&gt;.

===Medical Professionals===
Some doctors do believe that some DS, such as vitamins and minerals, can benefit patients, especially when the &quot;food quality [of patients] is...poor&quot; &lt;ref&gt;BodyLogicMD. (2012). Will you prescribe me vitamins and supplements? [Video file]. http://www.bodylogicmd.com/faq/will-you-prescribe-me-vitamins-and-supplements.&lt;/ref&gt;. Doctors and physicians are increasingly recommending DS to their patients.  A recent study found that health practitioners constituted the third fastest growing sales channel for DS in 2009 &lt;ref&gt; (September 1, 2010 ). Recession Makes Wellness a More Urgent Priority for Most Consumer Groups. Nutrition Business Journal, www.lexisnexis.com/hottopics/lnacademic. &lt;/ref&gt;.

===Low Adverse Event Reporting===

Annual reports from the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Association_of_Poison_Control_Centers American Association of Poison Control Centers] revealed 177 deaths linked to DS consumption from 1994-2010, amounting to less than 11 deaths annually &lt;ref&gt;American Association of Poison Control Centers. (2012). Annual reports. http://www.aapcc.org/annual-reports/&lt;/ref&gt;. In fact, this annual death rate is low compared to those of many Americans' daily activities, such as falling out of bed (450 deaths annually) &lt;ref&gt;Nationmaster. [http://www.nationmaster.com/ &quot;Mortality&quot;].&lt;/ref&gt;. Manufacturers and trade organizations, such as the [http://www.crnusa.org/ Council for Responsible Nutrition (CRN)], claim the number of adverse event reports is low because of the industry has a good safety track record &lt;ref&gt; Link, C. (2012, February 23). CRN refutes supplement adverse event statistic as 'outdated and irrelevant'. http://m.newhope360.com/regulation-and-legislation/&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Concerns with DS Industry==

===Scientific Concerns===

Some medical professionals, including dietitians and nutritionists, claim their patients misuse supplements &lt;ref&gt;Consumer Reports. (2010, September). Dangerous supplements: What you don't know about these 12 ingredients could hurt you [Video file]. http://www.consumerreports.org.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Desai, K. (2012, August 2). Hidden dangers in vitamins, supplements? CNN, Health.&lt;/ref&gt;.  In fact, 73% of Americans would rather &quot;treat themselves than go to a doctor” &lt;ref&gt;PRoper Starch Worldwide, Inc. (2001). Self care in the new millenium: American attitudes toward maintaining personal health and treatment.&lt;/ref&gt;.  Although some medical professionals believe DS are beneficial, many are skeptical of the industry, believing the DS industry is unregulated and manufacturers can &quot;sell whatever [they] want&quot; as long as they do not get caught &lt;ref&gt;Lipson, P. A., M.D. (2009, July 20). DSHEA: A travesty of a mockery of a sham. Science-Based Medicine website: http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/.&lt;/ref&gt;. They believe this because DS manufacturers often do not pre-test their products for safety and effectiveness. Even when third-party testing takes place, it is difficult for scientists and doctors to determine the veracity of product claims &lt;ref&gt;Collins, N., Tighe, A. P., Brunton, S. A., &amp; Kris-Etherton, P. M. (2012). Differences between dietary supplement and prescription drug omega-3 fatty acid formulations: A legislative and regulatory perspective. Journal of the American College of Nutrition, 31(3).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Murdoch, D. R., MD, Slow, S., PhD, Chambers, S. T., MD, Jennings, L. C., PhD, Stewart, A. W., BSc, Priest, P. C., DPhil, . . . Scragg, R., PhD. (2012). Effect of vitamin D3 supplementation on upper respiratory tract infections in healthy adults: The VIDARIS randomized controlled trial. JAMA, 308(13), 1333-1339.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Li, K., Kaaks, R., Linseisen, J., &amp; Rohrmann, S. (2012). Associations of dietary calcium intake and calcium supplementation with myocardial infarction and stroke risk and overall cardiovascular mortality in the Heidelberg cohort of the European prospective investigation into cancer and nutrition study. Heart, 98, 920-925. doi:10.1136/heartjnl-2011-301345.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Powers, H. J. (2003). Riboflavin (vitamin B-2) and health. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, 77(6).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zimmermann, M. B. (2009). Iodine deficiency. Endocrine Reviews, 30(4), 376-408. doi:10.1210/ er.2009-0011.&lt;/ref&gt;.  It has been so difficult to prove the danger and effectiveness of DS products that only one DS has been banned by the FDA - [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephedrine ephedrine] &lt;ref&gt;U.S. Food and Drug Administration. (2004, November 23). FDA acts to remove Ephedra-containing dietary supplements from market [Press release].&lt;/ref&gt;. Although many products claim to provide benefits, it is unclear what proportion of DS is actually effective.

===Manufacturing Problems===

=====GMP Failures=====
In 2010, the FDA stated there was a 25% failure rate of GMP compliance for DS manufacturers, as opposed to the expected 4-5% GMP violation failure rate &lt;ref name=&quot;Wright&quot; &gt;Wright, J. (2012, February 17). FDA GMP inspections: How to comply. http://www.naturalproductsinsider.com/news.&lt;/ref&gt;.  Many violations are cited for not meeting ingredient specifications and failure to record product specifications &lt;ref name=&quot;Wright&quot; /&gt;. Such FDA findings have caused consumer awareness groups, such as [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ConsumerLab.com ConsumerLab.com], to alert consumers of the dangers of DS &lt;ref&gt;U.S. Food and Drug Administration. (2001, July 6). FDA advises DS manufacturers to remove comfrey products from the market [White paper].&lt;/ref&gt;. 


Increasingly, large companies have independent organizations (such as the [http://www.usp.org/ United States Pharmacopeial Convention (USP)] and  the Natural Products Association (NPA)) verify they abide by adequate manufacturing and product quality standards.  Further, three leading DS companies, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBTY NBTY], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmavite Pharmavite], and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perrigo Perrigo], are currently participating in USP conventions to verify the quality and safety of their products &lt;ref name = &quot;Sales&quot;&gt;(June 1, 2010 ). '09 Sales Growth Sputters in Every Nutrition Category as Economy Takes its Toll. Nutrition Business Journal, www.lexisnexis.com/hottopics/lnacademic.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; U.S. Pharmacopeial Convention. (2012). Companies participating in the USP verified program for dietary supplements. http://www.usp.org/.&lt;/ref&gt;. Manufacturers like these welcome new regulations as &quot;clean up measures,&quot;  but also fear that bad press from the failing companies may impact their business &lt;ref name = &quot;Sales&quot; /&gt;.

=====Product Adulteration=====
Adebowale et al. (2000) studied the labeled claims of eleven DS that contained chondriotin sulfate and found that the percentage of claimed chondriotin sulfate in the products ranged from 33% to 110% of the claim main ingredients &lt;ref name=&quot;Adebowale&quot; &gt;Adebowale, A. O., PhD, Cox, D. S., MS, Liang, Z., MS, &amp; Eddington, N. D., PhD. (2000). Analysis of glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate content in marketed products and the Caco-2 permeability of chondroitin sulfate raw materials. Journal of American Nutraceutical Association, 3(1), 37-44.&lt;/ref&gt;. Findings such as these are common and  the FDA issues warning letters to companies that are known to produce adulterated DS products &lt;ref&gt;U.S. Food and Drug Administration. (2012, November 20). Warning letters - health fraud. For Consumers website: http://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ProtectYourself/HealthFraud/ ucm255474.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Misleading Marketing===
DS are marketed with the use of testimonials and various product claims.  Although there is little scientific evidence to support many DS claims, DS advertisements and product claims are vague and leave room for consumer misinterpretation &lt;ref&gt; (February 1, 2011 ). How Weight Loss Ads Slip Past the FTC. Nutrition Business Journal, www.lexisnexis.com/hottopics/lnacademic &lt;/ref&gt;.   

=====Product Testimonials=====
DS manufacturers often use customer testimonials in advertising. A common technique is the use of before and after pictures. Celebrity endorsements are particularly effective.  For example, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Garvey Steve Garvey], a former MLB player, known as &quot;Mr. Clean&quot; for his sterling reputation, was enlisted by Enforma Natural Products in the 1990s to endorse &quot;The Enforma System.&quot; Together, they claimed the system caused weight-loss without dieting or exercise.  The FTC banned the company from advertising the weight loss supplements citing the use of misleading claims &lt;ref&gt;Federal Trade Commission (2000, April 4). Marketers of &quot;The Enforma System&quot; settle FTC charges of deceptive advertising for their weight loss products, [Press Release].&lt;/ref&gt;. Although some DS advertising testimonials are genuine, many are just an appeal to consumers to purchase their products.

=====Fine-Print=====
Clinical or pre-market tests are often performed in-house, so the “proof” and experimentation of these claims is often unclear &lt;ref name= &quot;ODS&quot;&gt; Office of Dietary Supplements. (2011, June). Frequently asked questions. http://ods.od.nih.gov/ &lt;/ref&gt;. Products with fine print, such as clinically proven or clinically tested on labels and in advertisements, frequently lack specificity, leaving room for consumer misinterpretation, which can eventually lead to adverse effects. In 2009, the FDA warned consumers about the &quot;clinically tested&quot; Hydroxycut products following 23 cases of serious health problems, which prompted manufacturers to the recall the products &lt;ref&gt; (February 1, 2011 ). Weight-Loss Sales in 2010 Return to 2003 Levels in Wake of Hydroxycut Recall. Nutrition Business Journal, www.lexisnexis.com/hottopics/lnacademic &lt;/ref&gt;. As previously mentioned, the USP and the NPA offer &quot;seals of approval&quot; to companies for meeting quality manufacturing standards; however, many consumers may mistake this to mean the product is safe or effective &lt;ref name = &quot;ODS&quot;/&gt;.

=====Snake Oil Salesman=====
DS salespeople have been known to make misleading promises to close a sale. These fraudulent sales techniques are similar to those of the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_oil snake oil salesmen]. To investigate fraudulent sales techniques, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_Accountability_Office Government of Accountability Office (GAO)] informants (disguised as elderly people) called DS companies for supplement advice.  The informants were often told by the salespersons that their products would prevent or cure serious conditions.  A video of some of these calls can be seen [http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=x7S1GyQaDE8 here] &lt;ref&gt; Government Accountability Office, Examples of Deceptive or Questionable Marketing Practices and Potentially Dangerous Advice, Rep. No. GAO-10-662T (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Regulatory Concerns===
The GAO published a report expressing concern about the FDA’s lack of authority and limited access to information, recommending that the FDA Commissioner request additional authority to oversee DS products and new DS ingredients &lt;ref&gt; Government Accountability Office, FDA Should Take Further Actions to Improve Oversight and Consumer Understanding, Rep. No. GAO-09-250 (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;.  Further, the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Health_and_Human_Services U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS)] has expressed concerns to the US Senate about a study which estimated that only 1% of adverse events from DS products are reported to the FDA &lt;ref&gt;Consumer Safety and Weight-Loss Supplements: Hearings before the Oversight of Government Management (2012) (testimony of Michael F. Mangano, Principal Deputy Inspector General Department of Health and Human Services).&lt;/ref&gt;. Senator [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_Durbin Richard Durbin] of Illinois attempted to deal with these concerns by adding Senate Amendment 2127 to the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, but the amendment was defeated 77-20 &lt;ref&gt;Sen Durbin, R. Senate Amendment 2127 (2012). 112th Congress. http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d112:sp2127:&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Social Influences on the Consumption of DS==
In the US, 20% of people are regular consumers of DS, 32% are occasional users of DS, and 48% do not use DS &lt;ref name = &quot;blendon&quot; /&gt;.

===Truthiness===
There is a widespread belief by consumers that DS, even if untested, can improve health. This is the concept of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truthiness truthiness] popularized by [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Colbert Stephen Colbert] - when you feel it in your gut, you know it must be right.  Most people who take DS do not discuss their DS usage with their doctor because they believe their doctors would not know anything about supplements or would be biased against them &lt;ref name = &quot;blendon&quot;&gt;Blendon, Robert J., DesRoches, Catherine M., Benson, John M., Brodie, Mollyann, Altman, Drew E. Altman. (2001). Archives of Internal Medicine, 161(6). doi:10-1001/&lt;/ref&gt;. In fact, 67% of people who take DS would continue to do so even if the FDA found them to be ineffective &lt;ref name = &quot;blendon&quot; /&gt;.

===Placebo Effect===
Some people believe in the power of DS so strongly that they experience what is known as the [[Lentis/Placebos|placebo effect]]. The placebo effect occurs when a patient sees an improvement in their health after a medically ineffective therapy due to their belief in the ability in the treatment to improve their health. The placebo effect can explain why some DS manufacturers can claim success stories even if their product contains no medically active ingredients.

===Risk Compensation===
Many Americans use DS a form of risk compensation, feeling DS are adequate to make up for an unhealthy diet.  Experts, however, say DS products to do not make up for the health effects of a poor diet &lt;ref&gt;Donaldson, M. S. (2004). Nutrition and cancer: A review of the evidence for an anti-cancer diet. Nutrition Journal, 19(3), 1-21. doi:10.1186/1475-2891-3-19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nichols, B., Nielsen, F., Spence, J., &amp; Turnlund, J. (2012, November 19) Founding American nutrition science. Agricultural Research Service/USDA website: http://www.ars.usda.gov&lt;/ref&gt;. People who took vitamin supplements were more likely to not exercise and less likely to eat healthier, organic meals &lt;ref name=&quot;Chiou&quot;&gt;Chiou, W.-B., Yang, C.-C., &amp; Wan, C.-S. (2011). Ironic effects of dietary supplementation: Illusory invulnerability created by taking dietary supplement licenses health-risk behaviors. Psychological science, 22(8), 1081-1086.&lt;/ref&gt;.  Chiou et al. (2011) demonstrates risk compensation is linked to DS products by showing people feel they are guaranteed &quot;health protection&quot; and think they are &quot;licensed [to] self-indulgence&quot; &lt;ref name = &quot;Chiou&quot;/&gt;.

===Nutritional Insurance===


According to Harvard University researchers, people who eat well and take DS do so often as a form of “nutritional insurance,” just in case they are excluding any necessary nutrients from their diet &lt;ref&gt;Harvard School of Public Health. (2012). Nutrition Insurance Policy: A Daily Multivitamin. The Nutrition Source. http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/what-should-you-eat/multivitamin/&lt;/ref&gt;. A good example of this phenomena is children’s multivitamins – The [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Academy_of_Pediatrics American Academy of Pediatrics] does not recommend supplemental vitamin use for healthy children over a year old, yet 32% of children (70% of which are active) are given multivitamins by their parents because parents know they have more to gain by betting that DS work rather than by betting that they don’t worth, especially when the costs are so low &lt;ref&gt;Ulfat Shaikh, M., MPH; Robert S. Byrd, MD, MPH; Peggy Auigner, MS. (2009). Vitamin and Mineral Supplement Use by Children and Adolescents in the 1999-2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Arch Pediatric Adolescent Medicine, 163(2), 150–157.&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Conclusion==
Since the passing of DSHEA, the DS industry has significantly increased in market size &lt;ref name=&quot;Grollman&quot; /&gt;. People continue to take DS for psychological reasons, despite a lack of supporting evidence for most product claims. Supporters for the DS industry emphasize a desire for &quot;freedom of health choices&quot; and cite the historically low risk from consumption. However, there is broad support for DS industry regulations to ensure that supplements are safe, manufactured with good practices, and advertised truthfully. Americans seem to want the best of both worlds- they want their government to regulate DS safety yet have the freedom and access to choose any DS they desire.  Therefore, the DS industry is an example of a myriad of technologies that are continuously changing in product form and advertising due to the influence of surrounding social groups.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==== Managed C++ (C++/CLI) ====
'''Managed C++''' is a shorthand notation for Managed Extensions for C++, which are part of the [[w:Microsoft .NET|.NET framework]] from [[w:Microsoft|Microsoft]]. This extension of the C++ language was developed to add functionality like automatic garbage collection and heap management, automatic initialization of arrays, and support for multidimensional arrays, simplifying all those  details of programming in C++ that would otherwise have to be done by the programmer.

Managed C++ is not compiled to machine code. Rather, it is compiled to [[w:Common Intermediate Language|Common Intermediate Language]], which is an object-oriented machine language and was formerly known as MSIL.

[[File:Issues icon.jpg|right|100px]]

In the [[Development Cooperation Handbook/The Vrinda Project|Vrinda Project]], the team interviewed different stakeholders to understand who contributes to the Global Agenda for Development and what are the challenges of raising the required resources. See ⇒ the [[Development Cooperation Handbook/List of questions we have asked to Development Cooperation Stakeholders|List of questions we have asked]].
&lt;br /&gt;
We collected the answers and compiled them in 10 main issues where we compared the aptitudes of stakeholders from different nations while  assuming responsibility for global development and inter-cultural dialogue. Each issue was then included in one of the [[Development Cooperation Handbook/The Vrinda project Documentary|8 episodes of the Documentary]] where we illustrate the work in progress for the achievement of the 8 MDGs and we propose the establishment of 2 new development cooperation goals.&lt;br /&gt;
The discussion on the development cooperation issues is in progress and you are welcome to [[Development_Cooperation_Handbook/Overview_of_the_Handbook_Content#Feedback|contribute]].&lt;br /&gt;

In the main pages of the handbook we have defined the concepts, illustrate the work phases and shared the work tools. These are &quot;authored&quot; pages. Then we linked them to the &quot;issues&quot;,  where the testimonials give their different point of view.  The manual pages define and enclose: the issue pages widens the scope and open the debate. The manual pages synthesize, the issue pages discuss.  So we tried to generate a dynamic forward-backwards movement between questions and answers, thesis and antithesis, leaving the user to make  the synthesis and make her/his own opinion.

Here, below are the issues and the indications of the [[Development Cooperation Handbook/The Vrinda project Documentary|Documentary episode]] related to each one of them.

This material may need to be put in the accessories section or can be left as is. This is quite a full page but since a cable section already exists in the accessories section and consists of nothing more than a sentence redirecting to this page; it might be a better idea if this is all moved to accessories.

As I'm sure you noticed, images cannot be created the same way that regular pages are.  You have to upload them.  By default, the upload link will take you to Wikimedia Commons.  If you have material that they will not accept due to licensing (such as fair use material) ask an admin [[Wikibooks:Reading room/Administrative Assistance|here]] to upload it to Wikibooks locally.  You will have to provide a rationale for its inclusion at Wikibooks though.  I will delete the logi.gif page that was created in error.  If you have questions, don't hesitate to ask.  --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Jomegat|contribs]]) 12:51, 31 October 2012 (UTC)

=== Usage ===
Use this to show your kindness on Christmas or your evilness on Halloween. Just insert on your user page on those days and fill in the forms.

=== Parameters ===
Most of the time it looks like this:

{{HappyHolidays}}

That's from: &lt;nowiki&gt;{{HappyHolidays}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

However you must set an add and a signature like this:

&lt;nowiki&gt;{{HappyHolidays|[Holiday image]|[Holiday Name]|[Your User Name}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

It comes out with this:

{{HappyHolidays||Holiday Name|[[User:Downdate|Your User Name]]}}

End result:

{{HappyHolidays|Jack-o'-Lantern 2003-10-31.jpg|Halloween|''Downdate''}}

Of:

&lt;nowiki&gt;{{HappyHolidays|Jack-o'-Lantern 2003-10-31.jpg|Halloween|''Downdate''}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;</text>

 MOLD value /only /all /flat 

= DESCRIPTION: = 
Converts a value to a REBOL-readable string.

MOLD is a native value.

==Converts a value to what?==

The text &quot;Converts a value to a REBOL-readable string.&quot; is the help string of the function. When REBOL is the language, what does &quot;REBOL-readable&quot; mean? This is not hard to resolve, REBOL-readable means &quot;readable by the REBOL interpreter&quot;. To explain it further, it means that the string shall be recognized as a valid Load dialect, i.e., accepted as valid when processed by the LOAD function.

==The &quot;old&quot; syntax==

Originally, Rebol syntax was not able to directly describe some values. For example,

&lt;pre&gt;make object! [field: 1]&lt;/pre&gt;

is a Rebol expression that can be loaded yielding:

&lt;pre&gt;load &quot;make object! [field: 1]&quot; ; == [make object! [field: 1]]&lt;/pre&gt;

, which is a block containing three values: two words and a (sub)block. When evaluated by the DO function, the expression yields an object. The evaluation is based on semantic properties of the Do dialect evaluating the MAKE function (one of the most frequently used constructor functions in Rebol) supplying it two arguments: the type of the value to construct (OBJECT! in this case) and the specification block.

Depending on the way how we interpret it, the above source may either describe certain block (when interpreted as the Load dialect) or it can describe an object (when interpreted as the Do dialect). One may think that this ambiguity is easy to resolve by always using the Do dialect to interpret source text, however, only a slightly more contrived example bites us again:

&lt;pre&gt;string1: mold [make object! [field: 1]] ; == &quot;[make object! [field: 1]]&quot;
string2: mold reduce [make object! [field: 1]] ; == &quot;[make object! [^/        field: 1^/    ]]&quot;&lt;/pre&gt;

STRING1 above is a result of molding the block containing three values, while the STRING2 is a result of moding a block containing just one element: an object. It does not matter whether STRING1 or STRING2 is interpreted by LOAD only or evaluated by DO, the result is always a block containing three elements: two words and a subblock, i.e., none of the approaches yields a block containing the object.

==The &quot;new&quot; syntax==

To overcome the difficulties with describing objects by Rebol syntax a new syntactic construction was introduced. It looks as follows:

&lt;pre&gt;#[object! [field: 1]]&lt;/pre&gt;

and as one may easily find out it describes the object in a &quot;syntactic way&quot;, i.e., the LOAD function yields an object when processing it:

&lt;pre&gt;type? load &quot;#[object! [field: 1]]&quot; ; == object!&lt;/pre&gt;

==The &quot;new&quot; syntax usage and name==

After the introduction of the new syntax, the behaviour of the MOLD function was not changed (to maintain backward compatibility, I guess) and the new syntax was used just by MOLD/ALL when bringing an advantage, i.e., in cases like the above.

Some of the users proposed the &quot;serialized syntax&quot; name for the &quot;new&quot; syntax type. Unfortunately, the &quot;serialized syntax&quot; notion is (Paraphrasing Lord Westbury, i love British humour!) just a &quot;redundant and pleonastic&quot; equivalent of the &quot;syntax&quot; notion (&quot;syntax&quot; and &quot;series&quot; are actually the same notions coming one from Greek the other from Latin in the similar way as the words &quot;redundant&quot; and &quot;pleonastic&quot;). Therefore, it is quite inappropriate to use a combination of them thinking it may have some special meaning.

Fortunately, when observing similarities between &lt;code&gt;make object! [field: 1]&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;#[object! [field: 1]]&lt;/code&gt; we can come to the conclusion that the latter is just describing a list of constructor arguments present in the former. The only part missing is the constructor. That is why the term &quot;constructor&quot; would not be adequate either. Hostile Fork noticing the similarity called the &quot;new&quot; syntax &quot;construction syntax&quot;, which looks adequate and also it can be used as a one-word term &quot;construction&quot; or alternatively as a shortened two-word term &quot;construction spec&quot; or &quot;construction format&quot; etc.

Domino walls, domino pillars, cones moving all over the place, rolling spheres, fragmenting balconies, falling objects... --Breath--

Yes there is a lot that we could have. But let me simplify. Here we learn how to make objects that fall on you or must be pushed over. So let's start.

==Objects To Push==
How do you make an object to push? By creating the model for a start. Make it and then put it in the position you would want it to be in. Set it as Dynamic in the physics. Now play and push it over. Should work.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Development Cooperation Definitions}} 

Sustainability, in a broad sense, is the capacity of maintaining a certain process or state. It is now most frequently used in connection with biological and human systems. In an ecological context, sustainability can be defined as the ability of an ecosystem to maintain ecological processes, functions, biodiversity and productivity into the future.&lt;br&gt; 

Sustainable development is a pattern of utilizing the existing natural and human resource capitals without decreasing their value for future utilizations. &amp;nbsp;(see also ⇒&amp;nbsp;[[Development Cooperation Handbook/Defining Development|defining development]]). 

The term was used by the Brundtland Commission which coined what has become the most often-quoted definition of sustainable development as development that &quot;meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.&quot; &lt;br&gt; 

Sustainable development implies economic growth together with the protection of environmental quality, each reinforcing the other. Sustainable development is maintaining a delicate balance between the human need to improve lifestyles and preserving natural and cultural ecosystems. The field of sustainable development can be conceptually broken into three constituent parts: environmental sustainability, economic sustainability and sociopolitical sustainability. The essence of this form of development is a stable relationship between human activities and the natural world, which does not diminish the prospects for future generations to enjoy a quality of life at least as good as our own. Participatory democracy is a prerequisite for achieving sustainable development.  (see ⇒  [[Development Cooperation Handbook/The participatory approach|participation]])

By “participated development” we mean a process through which stakeholders influence and share control over development initiatives and the decisions and resources which affect them. For an innovative community effective and comprehensive participation enables exchange of ideas and opinions both among themselves and also from external experts and resource persons, strong interpersonal rapport and sharing of information (communication), that is grounded in mutual respect and shared responsibilities (commitment), and working together towards common and mutual benefit (cooperation). (see also development). Getting the participation of the poor requires strengthening the organizational and financial capacities of the poor so that they can act for themselves. The constructive dialogue between civil society and local authorities is an essential prerequisite for a sustained and participated development.

Participation is a process through which stakeholders influence and share control over development initiatives and the decisions and resources which affect them. Participation in political science is an umbrella term including different means for the public to directly participate in political, economical or management decisions. The term is also used in management theory (as in &quot;participatory management&quot;) to denote a style of management that calls for a high level of participation of workers and supervisors in decisions that affect their work. 

Sustainability is about fostering participation - with dialogue, cooperation and communication. 

For an innovative community effective and comprehensive participation enables exchange of ideas and opinions both among themselves and also from external experts and resource persons, strong interpersonal rapport and sharing of information (communication), that is grounded in mutual respect and shared responsibilities (commitment), and working together towards common and mutual benefit (cooperation). 

Participation is a process through which stakeholders influence and share control over development initiatives and the decisions and resources which affect them. 

Through the participatory process, , people can make informed commitments, and, by observing the participatory process, assessments can be made by Bank and government staff, among others, about the presence or absence of the commitment necessary to ensure sustainability. 

Getting the participation of the poor involves a lot more than finding the right technique. It requires strengthening the organizational and financial capacities of the poor so that they can act for themselves. In searching for ways to build local capacity, we found it useful to think in terms of a continuum along which the poor are progressively empowered. On one end of this continuum, the poor are viewed as beneficiaries--recipients of services, resources, and development interventions. In this context, community organizing, training, and one-way flows of resources through grant mechanisms are often appropriate. Although much good work has been done in this mode, the provision of benefits delivered to people in this way may not be sustainable in the long term and may not improve the ability of people to act for themselves. As the capacity of poor people is strengthened and their voices begin to be heard, they become &quot;action sponsors/beneficiaries&quot; who are capable of demanding and paying for goods and services from government and private sector agencies. Under these changed circumstances, the mechanisms to satisfy their needs will change as well. In this context, it becomes necessary to move away from welfare-oriented approaches and focus rather on such things as building sustainable, market-based financial systems; decentralizing authority and resources; and strengthening local institutions. We reach the far end of the continuum when these action sponsors/beneficiaries ultimately become the owners and managers of their assets and activities. This stage ranks highest in terms of the intensity of participation involved. A question we asked ourselves while preparing the Sourcebook was, how can we support and prepare poor people to own and manage assets and activities in a sustainable manner? In part, we found out that the more poor people are involved upstream in the planning and decisionmaking process, the more likely they are to own a development intervention, contribute to it, and sustain it; this alone, however, is not sufficient. Constraints exist at the policy level that impinge on the rights of people to organize, access information, engage in contracts, own and manage assets, and participate fully as members of civil society. Efforts are needed, therefore, to create an enabling policy environment that allows all stakeholders-especially poor and disadvantaged ones-to be part of the definition we noted at the outset. They too must be enabled to: ...influence and share control over development initiatives and the decisions and resources which affect them. 

When all stakeholders collaborate in designing their collective future, it increases the chances of former differences being resolved and a new consensus emerging around issues everyone can agree on. This is probably so because people who have to live and work together can often find ways to agree if given the chance. Unfortunately, people do not often get the chance to work together to determine their collective future. Development projects prepared in the external expert stance do not provide that chance. The participatory process, however, facilitates working together. So participation can be a &quot;conflict avoidance&quot; process to the degree that it helps stakeholders with different interests explore and potentially find common interests.

The concept of “human development” (HD) was developed in the late 80s, by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), in order to overcome and expand the traditional meaning of development focused only on economic growth. This different approach reflects an old tension within international organizations, including those which focus their attention primarily on economic growth, identifying it as development and those who are mainly interested in the aspects and the social consequences of development itself. 

(See the chapter [[Development Cooperation Handbook/Defining Development|&lt;u&gt;Defining Development&lt;/u&gt;]] in the section &quot;Development and Aid&quot; of the handbook.)


[[File:Bernhard Hoeper - you cannot &quot;buy&quot; development.webm|thumb|left| You cannot &quot;buy&quot; development; beneficiary communities must own the projects - [[Development Cooperation Handbook/Interviews/Bernhard Hoeper|B.Hoeper]] ]]
&lt;br /&gt;

The HD approach puts people at the heart of development and rests on the belief that the human dimension of development has been neglected in the past due to excessive emphasis placed on economic growth. Examples of this emphasis are the measure of GNP per capita, used as the primary measure of levels of development among states, and variables such as income or consumption calculated in monetary terms as a measure of wealth or poverty of individuals, families and different social groups. 

From this perspective, the primary objective of policies that support development was industrialisation and the trickle-down mechanism, or rather the “overflow of economic growth”, represented the means by which poverty would be progressively eliminated. 

From this principle, the basic needs concept was born in the 70s (developed by the ILO), which recognised the importance of using elements other than just income per capita for the assessment of development. Per capita income remains an important indicator of development, but only in terms of the acquisition and consumption of a sampling of goods and services essential to the achievement of an acceptable threshold of living. In particular, the ILO pointed out that the pursuit of greater access to basic needs on the part of the poorest groups of people would be facilitated by the achievement of an adequately remunerated employment status. It showed the importance of increasing the profitability of the work of the poor, the need to effect changes in the composition of output and ownership of productive factors and, finally, to make way for radical changes in the organizational structure of production. 

The UNDP distanced itself from the basic needs approach, rejected especially by the least developed countries by formulating the concept of human development and introducing a new index for measuring the development of countries, the HDI (Human Development Index). 

“Human development is the process of enlarging people's choices. Income is certainly one of these choices, but it does not represent the sum total of human experiences. Health, education, a healthy environment, the freedom of action and expression are also important.” (UNDP Report No. 3) 

Human development, therefore, represents a new sense of development and made it possible to redefine the priorities for action and move away from GDP growth to the improvement both of the quality of life, and of the conditions of social and ecological sustainability. Development, therefore, is not promoted by a one-way search of economic growth; the amount of growth is essential but its distribution is equally important, that is, full participation in the growth process. 

The primary objectives of development, considering its new meaning, thus become: the promotion of sustainable economic growth, improvement of the population's health, with priority attention to the most common problems and the most vulnerable groups, improvement of education of the population, with particular attention to basic education, literacy and development education and the promotion of human rights, with particular regard to the right to live peacefully together, the right to democratic participation, to equity of opportunity for development and integration in social life. 

&lt;br&gt;Human development is thus an aim for society, which is why the problem arises of how the process of economic growth - seen as an increase in GDP per capita - can help further this purpose and how human development itself can result in greater economic growth. Human development has thus become, in recent years, the goal of programs, policies and guidelines for development cooperation. 

An example is the decision, voted by the Copenhagen Conference of the United Nations for Social Development, to ensure at least 20% of development interventions are of a social nature. 

Another example are the objectives that the OECD in its Shaping the 21st Century: The Contribution of Development Cooperation conference has set for the near future: 

*Ensuring basic education for all inhabitants of all countries by 2015; 
*Realizing irrefutable progress towards gender equality and strengthening the autonomy of women, the elimination of any gender discrimination in primary and secondary education by 2005; 
*Reducing by two thirds the child mortality rates and children under five and maternal mortality by three quarters by 2015.

Obligation to demonstrate that work has been conducted in compliance with agreed rules and standards or to report fairly and accurately on performance results vis à vis mandated roles and/or plans. For instance, a report to parliament, to a board or a constituency answers to the accountability obligation. 

Political accountability is the accountability of the government, civil servants and politicians to the public and to legislative bodies such as congress or parliament. 

In a few cases, recall elections can be used to revoke the office of an elected official. Generally, however, voters do not have any direct way of holding elected representatives to account during the term for which they have been elected. Additionally, some officials and legislators may be appointed rather than elected. Constitution, or statute, can empower a legislative body to hold their own members, the government, and government bodies to account. This can be through holding an internal or independent inquiry. Inquiries are usually held in response to an allegation of misconduct or corruption. The powers, procedures and sanctions vary from country to country. The legislature may have the power to impeach the individual, remove them, or suspend them from office for a period of time. The accused person might also decide to resign before trial. Impeachment in the United States has been used both for elected representatives and other civil offices, such as district court judges. 

In parliamentary systems, the government relies on the support or parliament, which gives parliament power to hold the government to account. For example, some parliaments can pass a vote of no confidence in the government. 

Ethical accountability&lt;br&gt;Ethical accountability is the practice of improving overall personal and organizational performance by developing and promoting responsible tools and professional expertise, and by advocating an effective enabling environment for people and organizations to embrace a culture of sustainable development. Ethical accountability may include the individual, as well as small and large businesses, not-for-profit organizations, research institutions and academics, and government. One scholarly paper has posited that &quot;it is unethical to plan an action for social change without excavating the knowledge and wisdom of the people who are responsible for implementing the plans of action and the people whose lives will be affected.&quot; 

&amp;nbsp;Administrative accountability&lt;br&gt;Internal rules and norms as well as some independent commission are mechanisms to hold civil servant within the administration of government accountable. Within department or ministry, firstly, behavior is bounded by rules and regulations; secondly, civil servants are subordinates in a hierarchy and accountable to superiors. Nonetheless, there are independent “watchdog” units to scrutinize and hold departments accountable; legitimacy of these commissions is built upon their independence, as it avoids any conflicts of interest. Apart from internal checks, some “watchdog” units accept complaints from citizens, bridging government and society to hold civil servants accountable to citizens, but not merely governmental departments.&lt;br&gt;</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Development Cooperation Definitions}} 
In February 2005, international community came together at the Paris High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness, hosted by the French government and organised by the OECD. The role of aid in promoting development was attracting increasing public scrutiny in the run-up to the G8 Summit in Gleneagles, Scotland, and the global campaigns such as Make Poverty History. 

While some progress had been made in harmonising the work of the different international aid donors in developing countries, it was acknowledged that much more needed to be done. The aid process was still too strongly led by donor priorities and administered through donor channels, making it hard for developing countries to take the lead. Aid was still too uncoordinated, unpredictable and un-transparent. Deeper reform was felt to be essential if aid was to demonstrate its true potential in the effort to overcome poverty. 

At the Paris meeting, more than 100 signatories—from donor and developing-country governments, multilateral donor agencies, regional development banks and international agencies—endorsed the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness. The Paris Declaration went much further than previous agreements; it represented a broader consensus among the international community about how to make aid more effective. At its heart was the commitment to help developing-country governments formulate and implement their own national development plans, according to their own national priorities, using, wherever possible, their own planning and implementation systems. 

The Paris Declaration contains 56 partnership commitments aimed at improving the effectiveness of aid. It lays out 12 indicators to provide a measurable and evidence-based way to track progress, and sets targets for 11 of the indicators to be met by 2010. 

The Declaration is focused on five mutually reinforcing principles: 

• Ownership: Developing countries must lead their own development policies and strategies, and manage their own development work on the ground. This is essential if aid is to contribute to truly sustainable development. Donors must support developing countries in building up their capacity to exercise this kind of leadership by strengthening local expertise, institutions and management systems. The target set by the Paris Declaration is for three-quarters of developing countries to have their own national development strategies by 2010. 

• Alignment: Donors must line up their aid firmly behind the priorities outlined in developing countries’ national development strategies. Wherever possible, they must use local institutions and procedures for managing aid in order to build sustainable structures. In Paris, donors committed to make more use of developing countries’ procedures for public financial management, accounting, auditing, procurement and monitoring. Where these systems are not strong enough to manage aid effectively, donors promised to help strengthen them. They also promised to improve the predictability of aid, to halve the amount of aid that is not disbursed in the year for which it is scheduled, and to continue to “untie” their aid from any obligation that it be spent on donor-country goods and services. 

• Harmonisation: Donors must coordinate their development work better amongst themselves to avoid duplication and high transaction costs for poor countries. In the Paris Declaration, they committed to coordinate better at the country level to ease the strain on recipient governments, for example by reducing the large numbers of duplicative field missions. They agreed on a target of providing two-thirds of all their aid via so-called “programme-based approaches” by 2010. This means aid is pooled in support of a particular strategy led by a recipient country—a national health plan for example—rather than fragmented into multiple individual projects. 

• Managing for results: All parties in the aid relationship must place more focus on the end result of aid, the tangible difference it makes in poor people’s lives. They must develop better tools and systems to measure this impact. The target set by the Paris Declaration is for a one-third reduction by 2010 in the proportion of developing countries without solid performance assessment frameworks to measure the impact of aid. 

• Mutual accountability: Donors and developing countries must account more transparently to each other for their use of aid funds, and to their citizens and parliaments for the impact of their aid. The Paris Declaration says all countries must have procedures in place by 2010 to report back openly on their development results. 

A first round of monitoring of the 12 Paris Declaration indicators was conducted in 2006 based on activities undertaken in 2005 in 34 countries. A second survey was organised in early 2008 in which 54 developing countries examined progress against the targets at country level. This 2008 Survey covers more than half all the official development assistance delivered in 2007—nearly USD 45 billion. The evidence so far suggests that progress has been made. For example, more than one third of developing countries surveyed had improved their systems for managing public funds; almost 90% of donor countries had untied their aid; and technical cooperation is more in line with developing countries’ own development programmes. Despite these improvements, however, the results of the Survey show that the pace of progress remains too slow to reach the targets set in 2010. In particular, although many countries have made significant efforts to strengthen their national systems (for instance by improving how they manage their public funds), in many cases donors are still reluctant to use them. The predictability of aid flows also remains low (with just over a third of aid disbursed on schedule), thereby making it hard—or impossible—for governments to plan ahead. In summary, whilst some progress has been made there are still many areas where the pace of change must be accelerated if the targets set for 2010 are to be reached. In addition to the data from the monitoring survey a useful way of understanding donor and recipient country performance is to examine donor and recipient country self-assessments, donor evaluations and Development Assistance Committee Peer Reviews. 

In some quarters, the Paris Declaration is almost synonymous with aid effectiveness; it is expected that aid will be effective and achieve development outcomes when the principles are observed for government sector aid. However, there continue to be criticisms and alternative views, particularly from non-government aid organisations. Implementation of the Paris Declaration still needs to be significantly stepped up, according to the results of the 2008 Monitoring Survey. Concrete targets set for 2010 (such as an increased proportion of aid to be untied; establishment of &quot;mutual accountability&quot; mechanisms in aid recipient countries; and for two-thirds of aid to be delivered in the context of so-called programme approaches rather than projects) may be difficult to meet. Independent NGOs, such as Eurodad, also release their own evaluations, showing that the Declaration is not being implemented as planned. The Overseas Development Institute has specified that better monitoring of the relationship between the Paris Principles and development results at sector level is necessary.&lt;br&gt;</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Through community based outreach, consultative processes, local capacity building, creating an enabling environment and carrying out financial interventions, a development actor/ entity/ organization creates platforms and mechanisms of interaction among communities and their municipalities for sustainable development. The methodology of facilitating constructive dialogue and proactive participation contributes to increased community engagement and municipality effectiveness for local economic development based on common local interest and a wider community consensus.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Through sector specific value chain analysis in rural economic sectors, based on stakeholder consultations and supported by technical assistance and financial interventions, new economic opportunities can be created, contributing to improved local livelihoods and an increase in incomes and jobs. These analyses combined with investment priorities identified by citizens within the same sectors can help determine real needs and economic opportunities in rural areas.

      <text xml:space="preserve">When national policies contribute to empowering communities and foster good local governance through local development, it becomes possible to use local resources efficiently and effectively for sustainable national development. As capacity of people is strengthened and their voices begin to be heard, they become capable of being owners and managers of their resources and of choosing the life they have reason to value. Constraints exist at the policy level that impinge on the rights of people to organize, access information, own and manage assets and participate fully as members of civil society. The more people are involved upstream in the planning and decision making process, inform and improve policies, legislative frameworks and implementation processes and procedures, the more likely they are to own a development intervention, contribute to it and sustain it. Efforts are thus required to create an enabling policy environment that allows all stakeholders to participate as active partners of development processes.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Economy==

The economy of ancient Greece was characterized by the extreme importance of importing goods, all the more so because of the relative poverty of Greece's soil. Beginning in the 6th century BCE, craftsmanship and commerce (principally maritime) developed and became increasingly more important in the classical period.

The idea of an &quot;economy&quot; as it is understood today is relatively anachronistic when used to refer to ancient Greece. The Greek word ''oikonomia'' (οἰκονομία) designates mainly the ''oikos'' (οἶκος), meaning the home or hearth. Thus Xenophon's dialogue entitled ''Oeconomicus'' is concerned with household management and agriculture. The Greeks had no precise term to designate the processes of production and exchange. The economist Murray Rothbard, however, notes that ancient Greek philosophers grappled with questions that today would be identified as economy.

===Agriculture===
[[File:Olive trees.jpg|thumb|Olive trees were one of the bases of Greek agriculture.]]

Greek soil's &quot;stinginess&quot; or &quot;tightness&quot; explains Greek colonialism and the importance of the cleruchies of Asia Minor in controlling the supply of wheat. The olive tree and grapevine were complemented by the cultivation of herbs, vegetables, and oil-producing plants. In fact, the Greeks would cut down all their enemies' olive trees to deprive them of olive oil. Husbandry was badly developed due to a lack of available land. Sheep and goats were the most common types of livestock. Woods were heavily exploited, first for domestic use and eventually to build triremes. Bees were kept to produce honey, the only source of sugar known to the ancient Greeks.

Since it was so labor-intensive, agriculture employed up to 80% of the Greek population. Agricultural work followed the rhythm of the seasons: harvesting olives and trimming grapevines at the beginning of autumn and the end of winter, setting aside fallow land in the spring, harvesting cereals in the summer, cutting wood, sowing seeds, and harvesting grapes in autumn.

In the ancient era, most land was held by the aristocracy. During the 7th century BCE, demographic expansion and the distribution of successions created tensions between these landowners and the peasants. In Athens, the crisis was resolved by Solon's reforms, which eliminated debt bondage and protected the peasant class. Nonetheless, the Greek aristocrat's domains remained small compared with the Roman latifundia.

===Crafts===
[[File:NAMA Travail de la laine.jpg|thumb|Woman working with wool, 480-470 BCE, National Archaeological Museum of Athens.]]

Much of the craftsmanship of ancient Greece was part of the domestic sphere. However, the situation gradually changed between the 8th and 4th centuries BCE, with the increased commercialization of the Greek economy. Thus, weaving and baking, activities, so important to the Western late medieval economy, were done only by women before the 6th century BC. After the growth of commerce, slaves started to be widely used in workshops. Only fine dyed tissues, like those made with Tyrian purple, were created in workshops. On the other hand, working with metal, leather, wood, or clay, was a specialized activity, and looked down upon by most Greeks. The basic workshop was often family-operated. Lysias' shield manufactory employed 120 slaves; Demosthenes' father, a maker of swords, used 32. After the death of Pericles in 429 BC, a new class emerged: that of the wealthy owners and managers of workshops. Examples include Cleon and Anytus, noted tannery owners, and Kleophon, whose factory produced lyres.

Free workers were paid by assignment, since the workshops could not guarantee regular work. In Athens, those who worked on state projects were paid one drachma per day, no matter what craft they practiced. The workday generally began at sunrise and ended in the afternoon.

====Pottery====

The potter's work consisted of selecting the clay, fashioning the vase, drying and painting, baking it, and applying varnish. Part of the production went to domestic usage (dishes, containers, oil lamps) or for commercial purposes, and the rest served religious or artistic functions. Techniques for working with clay have been known since the Bronze Age; the potter's wheel is a very ancient invention. The ancient Greeks did not add any innovations to these processes.

The creation of artistically decorated vases in Greece had strong foreign influences. For instance, the famed black-figure style of Corinthian potters most likely was derived from the Syrian style of metalworking. The heights to which the Greeks brought the art of ceramics is therefore due entirely to their artistic sensibilities and not to technical ingenuity.

Pottery in ancient Greece was most often the work of slaves. Many of the potters of Athens assembled between the agora and the Dipylon, in the Kerameikon. They most often operated as small workshops, consisting of a master, several paid artisans, and slaves.

====Metalworking====

Deposits of metal ore are common in Greece. Of these, the best known are the silver mines of Laurium. These mines contributed to the development of Athens in the 5th century BCE, when the Athenians learned to prospect, treat, and refine the ore. Fortuitously, the composition of the earth below the mines rendered drainage unnecessary, an important provision given that ancient mine drainage techniques did not allow for excavation below the level of subsoil waters. The passageways and steps of Greek mines were dug out with the same concern for proportion and harmony found in their temples. The work was extremely difficult, due to the tunnels' depth—they were sometimes more than 100 meters (110 yd). The miner, armed with his pick and iron hammer and hunched over in two, labored to extract lead ore. The Laurium mines were worked by a large slave population, originating for the most part from Black Sea regions such as Thrace and Paphlagonia. With these metals, Weapons, armor tools and a variety of other goods were created.

Other Greek mines include:

* Gold: Sifnos, Thasos
* Silver: Cyprus, Sifnos
* Iron: Euboea, Rhodes
* Copper: Chalcis, Euboea, and Cyprus

===Trade===
====Maritime trade====
[[File:AGMA Poids plomb 1.jpg|left|thumb|Commercial lead weight found in the Agora, National Archaeological Museum of Athens.]]

Very early on, the geographic position of Greece and the necessity of importing wheat forced the Greek world to engage in maritime trade. The areas which provisioned Greece with wheat were Cyrenaica, Egypt, Italy (specifically the Magna Graecia area and Sicily), and regions surrounding the Black Sea. Athens and Corinth served as waystations of exchange for the isles of the Aegean Sea. Other imported products included papyrus, spices, fabrics, metals, and shipbuilding materials such as wood, linen, and pitch, grain was also imported. For their part, Greek cities exported wine, pottery, and olive oil. Athens sold marble extracted from Penteli, renowned in the Greek world, and also silver coins, known for their elegant workmanship and high proportion of silver. These served not only as a means of exchange, but also as a source of metal: in places that did not use money, they were melted back into silver. Available sources do not provide enough information to evaluate with moderate precision the volume of goods exchanged in Greek trade.

The main participants in Greek commerce were the class of traders known as ''emporoi'' (ἕμποροι). The state collected a duty on their cargo. At Piraeus (the main port of Athens), this tax was set initially at 1%, then at 2%. By the end of the 5th century, the tax had been raised to 33 talents (Andocides, I, 133-134). In 413, Athens ended the collection of tribute from the Delian League and imposed a 5% duty on all the ports of her empire (Thucydides, VII, 28, 4) in the hope (unrealized) of increasing revenues. These duties were never protectionist, but were merely intended to raise money for the public treasury.

The growth of trade in Greece led to the development of financial techniques. Most merchants, lacking sufficient cash assets, resorted to borrowing to finance all or part of their expeditions. A typical loan for a large venture in 4th century BCE Athens, was generally a large sum of cash (usually less than 2,000 drachmas), lent for a short time (the length of the voyage, a matter of several weeks or months), at a high rate of interest (often 12% but reaching levels as high as 100%). The terms of the contract were always laid out in writing, differing from loans between friends (''eranoi''). The lender bore all the risks of the journey, in exchange for which the borrower committed his cargo and his entire fleet, which were precautionarily seized upon their arrival at the port of Piraeus.

Trade in ancient Greece was free: the state controlled only the supply of grain. In Athens, following the first meeting of the new Prytaneis, regulations on trade were reviewed, with a specialized committee overseeing the trade in wheat, flour, and bread.

The number of shipwrecks found in the Mediterranean Sea provides valuable evidence for the development of trade in the ancient world. Only 2 shipwrecks were found that dated from the 8th century BCE. However archeologists have found 46 shipwrecks dated from the 4th century BCE, which would appear to indicate that there occurred a very large increase of the volume of trade between these centuries. Considering that the average ship tonnage also increased in the same period, the total volume of trade increased probably by a factor of 30.

====Retail====

Information about retail activity in ancient Greece is limited. While peasants and artisans often sold their own wares, there were also retail merchants known as ''kápêloi'' (κάπηλοι). Grouped into guilds, they sold fish, olive oil, and vegetables. Women sold perfume or ribbons. They paid a fee for their space in the marketplace. They were viewed poorly by the general population, and Aristotle labeled their activities &quot;a kind of exchange which is justly censured, for it is unnatural, and a mode by which men gain from one another.&quot;

Parallel to the &quot;professional&quot; merchants were those who sold the surplus of their household production, be it vegetables, olive oil, or bread. This was the case for many of the small-scale farmers of Attica. Among townsfolk, this task often fell to the women. For instance, Euripides' mother sold chervil from her garden (cf. Aristophanes, ''The Acharnians'', v. 477-478).

===Taxation===

Direct taxation was not well-developed in ancient Greece. The ''eisphorá'' (εἰσφορά) was a tax on the wealth of the very rich, but it was levied only when needed — usually in times of war. Large fortunes were also subject to liturgies, that is, the support of public works. Liturgies could consist, for instance, of the maintenance of a trireme, a chorus during a theater festival, or a ''gymnasium''. In some cases, the prestige of the undertaking could attract volunteers. Such was the case for the choragus, who organized and financed choruses for a drama festival. In other instances, like the burden of outfitting and commanding a trireme, the liturgy functioned more like a mandatory donation. In some cities, like Miletus and Teos, heavy taxation was imposed on citizens.

On the other hand, indirect taxes were quite important. Taxes were levied on houses, slaves, herds and flocks, wines, and hay, among others. The rights to collect many of these taxes were often transferred to publicans, or ''telônai'' (τελῶναι). However, this was not true of all cities. Thasos' gold mines and Athens' taxes on business allowed them to eliminate these indirect taxes. Dependent groups such as the Penestae of Thessaly and the Helots of Sparta were taxed by the city-states to which they were subject.

===Currency===
[[File:Syracusa Drachma 405 82000306.jpg|thumb|Syracusa Drachma coin (405-367 BCE).]]

Coinage probably began in Lydia around 600 BCE, and circulated in the cities of Asia Minor under its control; early ''electrum'' coins have been found at the Temple of Diana at Ephesus. The technique of minting coins arrived in mainland Greece around 550 BCE, beginning with coastal trading cities like Aegina and Athens. Their use spread, and the city-states quickly secured a monopoly on their creation. The very first coins were made from ''electrum'' (an alloy of gold and silver), followed by pure silver, the most commonly found valuable metal in the region. The mines of the Pangaeon hills allowed the cities of Thrace and Macedon to mint a large quantity of coins. Laurium's silver mines provided the raw materials for the &quot;Athenian owls&quot;, the most famous coins of the ancient Greek world. Less-valuable bronze coins appeared at the end of the 5th century.

Coins played several roles in the Greek world. They provided a medium of exchange, mostly used by city-states to hire mercenaries and compensate citizens. They were a source of revenue: foreigners had to change their money into the local currency at an exchange rate favorable to the State. They served as a mobile form of metal resources, which explains discoveries of Athenian coins with high levels of silver at great distances from their home city. Finally, the minting of coins lent an air of undeniable prestige to any Greek city or city state.

==Social Structure==

Only free, land owning, native-born men could be citizens entitled to the full protection of the law in a city-state (later Pericles introduced exceptions to the native-born restriction). In most city-states, unlike the situation in Rome, social prominence did not allow special rights. Sometimes families controlled public religious functions, but this ordinarily did not give any extra power in the government. In Athens, the population was divided into four social classes based on wealth. People could change classes if they made more money. In Sparta, all male citizens were given the title of equal if they finished their education. However, Spartan kings, who served as the city-state's dual military and religious leaders, came from two families.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Rural life and Agriculture==

Agriculture was the foundation of the Ancient Greek economy. Nearly 80% of the population was involved in this activity.

===Environment===

The Mediterranean climate is characterized by two seasons: the first dry and hot, from April to September (river beds tend to dry up); the second is humid, and is marked by often violent rain storms brought in by west winds, with mild, frost-free temperatures. As such in the mountains winters can be rigorous and snowy. Attica, Cyclades, the south of Peloponnese, and Crete are more dry than the rest of Greece.

===Agricultural products===
====Farming====
[[File:Amphora olive-gathering BM B226.jpg|thumb|Scene of olive-gathering by young people. Attic black-figured neck-amphora, ca. 520 BCE, from Vulci, Italy (British Museum).]]

During the early part of Greek history, as shown in the Odyssey, Greek agriculture - and diet - was based on cereals (''sitos'', though usually translated as wheat, could in fact designate any type of cereal grain). In reality, 90% of cereal production was barley. Even if the ancients were aware of the better nutritional value of wheat, the growing of barley was less demanding and more productive. Attempts have been made to calculate Attican grain production in the period, but results have not been conclusive. It did not take long for demand to outpace production capabilities, as arable land was limited. The &quot;tightness&quot; of the land (στενοχωρία / ''stenokhôría'') also explains Greek colonization, and the importance Anatolian cleruchies would have for the Athenian empire in controlling grain provision.

On the other hand, the Greek land was well suited for olive trees, which provided olive oil. The growing of olive trees dates back to early Greek history. Olive plantations are a long-term investment: it takes more than twenty years for the tree to provide fruit, and it only fruits every other year. Grapes also do well in the rocky soil, but demand a lot of care. Grapes have been grown since the Bronze age.

These core crops were augmented by vegetable gardens (cabbage, onion, garlic, lentils, chick pea, beans) and herb gardens (sage, mint, thyme, savory, oregano). Orchards included those of fig, almond, apple, and pear trees. Oilseed plants such as linseed, sesame, and poppy were also grown.

====Animal husbandry====
[[File:Bronze billygoat Louvre Br197.jpg|left|thumb|Bronze billygoat found in the deme of Kephissia, 5th century BCE, Louvre.]]

Animal husbandry, seen as a sign of power and wealth in the works of Homer, was in fact not well developed in ancient Greece. While the Mycenean civilisation was familiar with the rearing of cattle, the practice was restricted as a result of geographic expansion into less suitable terrain. Goats and sheep quickly became the most common livestock; less difficult to raise and providers of meat, wool, and milk (usually in the form of cheese). Pork and poultry (chicken and geese) were also raised. Oxen were rare and normally used as a work animal, though they were occasionally used as sacrificial animals. Donkeys, mules and their mixes were raised as pack or draught animals.

Horses were raised on the plains of Thessaly and Argolis; it was a luxury animal, signifying aristocracy. ''The Clouds'', a comedy by Aristophanes, illustrates the equestrian snobbery of Athenian aristocrats: Pheidippides, the son of the hero is addicted to race-horses and so ruins his father Strepsiades.

It is likely that most farms practiced some limited animal husbandry; poultry or small animals grazing on waste land or fed kitchen scraps. Combined farm/livestock operations also existed, as well as those specializing in livestock. An inscription also mentions a certain Eubolos of Elateia, in Phocis, the owner of 220 head of cattle and horses and at least 1000 sheep and goats. Flocks of sheep were herded between the valley in winter and the mountains in summer. Taxes existed for the transit or stopover of flocks in cities.

====Other products====

Wood was exploited, primarily for domestic use; homes and wagons were made of wood as was the ''aratrum'', or light plough. The Greek forests located in the highlands were denuded by goats and charcoal production; it was not long before it had to be imported especially for ship production (see trireme).

Beekeeping provided honey, the only source of sugar known to the Greeks. It also was used in medicines and in the production of mead. The Ancient Greeks did not have access to sugarcane. The Hymettus region of Attica was known for the quality of honey produced there. Wax was also produced, used in the lost wax process to produce bronze statues as well as in medicines.

Bronze was used for farm tools and weaponry.

Hesiod's ''Works and Days'', 8th century BCE and Xenophon's ''Economy'' of the 4th century BCE provide information about working off the land.

The olive harvest took place from late autumn to the beginning of winter, either by hand or by pole. They were placed in wicker baskets and left to ferment for a few weeks before being pressed. The screw press, although referred to as the Greek press by Pliny the Elder (XVIII, 37) was a late (2nd century BCE) Roman invention. Oil was preserved in terra cotta vases for use later. This was also the time for pruning of trees and vines and harvesting of legumes.

Spring was the rainy season; farmers took advantage of this to bring fallow ground back into production. They practised biennial crop rotation, alternating from year to year between fallow and cultivated. Attempts to introduce triennial crop rotation with legumes in the third year, ran into problems due to the poor Greek soil, lack of power, and absence of mechanization. The Greeks did not use animal manure, possibly due to the low number of cattle. The only soil additive was weeds ploughed back into the ground after fields came out of fallow.

In summer, irrigation was indispensable. In June, they harvested with sickles; the scythe was not used. Wheat was threshed with animal power; it was trampled by oxen, donkeys or mules, and the grain stored. Women and slaves ground it and made bread.

In early autumn, they collected deadfall and prepared supplies of firewood; while winters were mild on the coast they could be brutal in the highlands. Farmers also had to break the hard crust that had formed over the summer on grain fields. To do this required three passes; the ard plough was wooden (iron ploughshares were rare). A hoe and mallet were also used to break clumps of earth. The fallow land for next year was sown by hand. This was the time of the grape harvest, the grapes were crushed by foot in large vats then the wine was left to ferment in jugs. After that process, people could drink the ambrosial wine and enjoy it.

In the nearly four centuries that passed between Hesiod and Xenophon, no improvements can be found in agriculture. Tools remained mediocre and there were no inventions to lighten the work of either man or animal. It was not until the rise of Romans that the water mill came into wide use, employing hydraulic power to augment muscle power. It took until the Middle Ages for true plows which turned the earth to be widely adopted. Neither irrigation, nor soil improvements, nor animal husbandry saw notable advances. Only the very richest of land, such as that of Messinia was capable of supporting two crops per year.

===Agricultural property===

With the exception of Athens, and a few areas where aerial surveys have permitted analysis of historical land distribution, agricultural property allocation is not well known. Before the 5th century BCE, it is certain that the land belonged to great landowners, such as the Attican Eupatrides. Nevertheless, land use varied regionally; in Attica domains were divided among smaller plots, whereas in Thessaly they had single tenants.

From the 8th century BCE, tensions grew between the great landowners and the peasants, who were finding it more and more difficult to survive. This can probably be explained by population growth brought on by reduced infant mortality, and aggravated by the practice of equally subdividing land amongst several inheritors each generation (attested to by both Homer and Hesiod). In Athens, the crisis was resolved with the arrival of Solon in 594 BCE. He forbade slavery for debt and introduced other measures intended to help the peasants. In the 5th century BCE, the practice of liturgy (λειτουργία / ''leitourgia'' - literally, &quot;public work&quot;) placed the responsibility for provision of public services heavily on the shoulders of the rich, and led to a reduction in large scale land ownership. It is estimated that most citizens of hoplite rank owned around 5 hectares of land. In Sparta, the reforms of Lycurgus led to a drastic redistribution of land, with 10 to 18 hectare lots (''kleroi'') distributed to each citizen. Elsewhere, tyrants undertook redistributions of land seized from wealthy political enemies.

From the 4th century BCE onwards property starts to become concentrated among few land owners, including in Sparta where according to Aristotle, the land has passed into the hands of a few (''Politics'', II, 1270a). Nevertheless, the aristocratic estates in Greece never achieved the scope of the great Roman latifundia; during the classical period, the wealthy Alcibiades possessed only 28 hectares (Plato, ''Alcibiades I'', 123c). In all cases, land remains intimately associated with the concept of wealth. The father of Demosthenes possessed 14 talents and for land owned only a home, but he was the exception. When the banker Pasion made his fortune, he hurried to buy land.

Some Greek land was public and/or sacred. Each city possessed such land and it is estimated that in Athens during the classical period these lands represented a tenth of cultivable land. This was an administrative division and the property of the city itself (for example in Attica, it was a ''deme'') or a temple. These lands were leased to individuals.

In the [[Development Cooperation Handbook/The Vrinda Project|Vrinda Project]], the team interviewed different stakeholders to understand who contributes to the Global Agenda for Development and what are the challenges of raising the required resources. See  [[File:Film-Camera.png|17px]]  ⇒ the [[Development Cooperation Handbook/List of questions we have asked to Development Cooperation Stakeholders|List of questions we have asked]].
&lt;br /&gt; We collected the answers and compiled them in [[Development Cooperation Handbook/Issues|10 main issues]] where we compared the aptitudes of stakeholders from different nations while  assuming responsibility for global development and inter-cultural dialogue. Each issue was then included in one of the [[Development Cooperation Handbook/The Vrinda project Documentary| episodes of the documentary]] where we illustrate the work in progress for the achievement of the 8 MDGs and we propose the establishment of 2 new development cooperation goals.

An important object containing information about a weighted graph ''G(V,E,w)'' is its [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplacian_matrix Laplacian matrix]. Given a numbering of the vertices of the graph, it's an ''n'' by ''n'' square matrix ''L&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;'', where ''n'' is the number of vertices in the graph, with the entries:

: &lt;math&gt;l_{kl}:=
\begin{cases}
\sum_{v_k \rightarrow v_l} w_{kl} \mbox{  if}\ k = l, \\
-w_{kl} \mbox{  if}\ v_k \rightarrow v_l, \\
0,  \mbox{  otherwise,}
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''v''&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; → ''v''&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt; means that there is a directed edge from vertex ''v''&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; to the vertex ''v''&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;, and where ''w'' is the weight function.

'''Exercise (*)'''. Given a directed graph ''G'' without cycles, prove that one can number its vertices so that the corresponding Laplacian matrix ''L&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;'' is triangular.

Given a weighted graph with boundary it is often convenient to number its boundary vertices first and to write its Laplacian matrix in the block form. 

: &lt;math&gt;
L_G = 
\begin{pmatrix}
A &amp; B \\
C &amp; D
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

'''Exercise (*).''' Prove that a function/vector ''u'' is harmonic at the interior nodes of a graph ''G'' if 

:&lt;math&gt;
u|_{int G} = -D^{-1}Cu|_{\partial G}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Let

: &lt;math&gt;M=\begin{pmatrix} A &amp; B \\ C &amp; D \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

be a block matrix with an invertible square block ''D''.

Then the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schur_complement Schur complement] of the
matrix ''M'' w/respect of the block ''D''  is the matrix

:&lt;math&gt; M/D = A-BD^{-1}C.&lt;/math&gt;

The Leibniz definition of '''determinant''' (a multilinear function in the rows and columns) of a square ''n'' by ''n'' matrix ''M'' is:

:&lt;math&gt;\det M = \sum_{\sigma \in S_n} \sgn(\sigma) \prod_{k=1}^n M_{k,\sigma_k}.&lt;/math&gt;
 
'''Exercise (*).''' Prove the following determinant identity for a square matrix ''M'':

: &lt;math&gt;
\det M = \det(M/D) \det D.
&lt;/math&gt;

The following matrix ''W(G)'' consisting of random walk exiting probabilities (sums over weighted paths in a graph) plays an important role as boundary measurement for inverse problems. Suppose a weighted graph ''G'' has ''N'' boundary nodes, then the ''kl'' 'th entry of the ''N'' by ''N'' matrix equals to the probability that the first boundary vertex, that a particle starting its random walk at the boundary vertex ''v&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' occupies, is the boundary vertex ''v&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;''.
For a finite connected graph the columns of the matrix ''W(G)'' add up to ''1''.

'''Exercise (**).''' Derive an explicit formula for the matrix ''W(G)'' in terms of the blocks of Laplace matrix ''L(G)'' of the graph ''G''.

: &lt;math&gt;
W_G = I - D_A^{-1}(A - BD^{-1}C).
&lt;/math&gt;

'''Exercise (***).''' Prove the following expansion formulas for entries and blocks of the matrix ''W(G)'', 

* for two boundary vertices ''p&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''p&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;'' of a graph ''G'' 

: &lt;math&gt; 
w_{kl} = \sum_{v_k\xrightarrow[]{path} v_l}\prod_{e=(p,q)\in path}w(e)/l_{pp},
&lt;/math&gt;

* for two distinct boundary vertices ''v&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''v&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;'' of a graph ''G''

:  &lt;math&gt;
w_{kl}\det D = \frac{1}{l_{kk}}\sum_{v_k\xrightarrow{path}v_l}\prod_{e\in path}l(e)\det D(\tilde{path},\tilde{path}),
&lt;/math&gt;

where 

: &lt;math&gt; \tilde{path} = V-(\partial G\cup path).&lt;/math&gt; 

* for two disjoint subsets of boundary vertices ''P'' and ''Q'' of size ''n'' of a graph ''G'', see [6],[7] and [14]

: &lt;math&gt;
\det W(P,Q) \det D = \pm\frac{\sum_{\sigma\in S_{n}}(-1)^{\sgn(\sigma)}\sum_{p_k\xrightarrow{paths}q_{\sigma_k}}\prod_{e\in paths}l(e)\det D(\tilde{paths},\tilde{paths})}{\prod_{p\in P}l_{pp}},
&lt;/math&gt;

where 

: &lt;math&gt; \tilde{paths} = V-(\partial G\cup paths).&lt;/math&gt; 

The exercises above provide a bridge b/w connectivity property of graph ''G'' and ranks of submatrices of its Laplacian matrix ''L(G)'' and the matrix of hitting probabilities ''W(G)''.

'''Exercise (*).''' Let ''G'' be a planar graph w/natural boundary, numbered circulary. Let ''P'' and ''Q'' be two non-interlacing subsets of boundary nodes of size ''n''. Prove that

: &lt;math&gt; (-1)^{\frac{n(n+1)}{2}}\det\Lambda_G(P,Q) \ge 0,
&lt;/math&gt;

w/the strict inequality iff there is a disjoint set of paths from ''P'' to ''Q''.

'''Exercise (*).''' Show that the numbers of paths in the following graph are equal to the binomial coefficients. 
[[File:Pascal paths (1).jpg|300px|center| The numbers of the paths of the graph are binomial coefficients]]

Gluing the graphs w/out loops corresponds to multiplication of the weighted paths matrices. 

'''Exercise (**).''' Use the result of the previous exercise to it to prove the following [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_triangle Pascal triangle] identity, see[13],

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix}
 1     &amp; 1  &amp;  1 &amp; 1 &amp; \ldots \\

\end{pmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;

'''Exercise (***).''' Give a proof of a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menger%27s_theorem Menger's theorem] based on the results of the exercise above: Let ''G'' be a finite  graph and ''p'' and ''q'' two vertices that are not neighbors. Then the size of the minimum vertex cut for ''p'' and ''q'' (the minimum number of vertices whose removal disconnects ''p'' and ''q'') is equal to the maximum number of pairwise vertex-independent paths from ''p'' to ''q''.</text>

      <comment>Added WIKI BOOKS note.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello! (Important Note: This is my WIKI BOOKS page. I am also interested in, and contributing to: Wikimedia Commons, Wikiversity, and Wikipedia, so far. [[User:Ray Calvin Baker|Ray Calvin Baker]] ([[User talk:Ray Calvin Baker|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Ray Calvin Baker|contribs]]) 00:08, 14 November 2012 (UTC)) 

I was searching for &quot;puzzles&quot; on Google, and one of the many links there directed me to a page for the bare beginnings of a book on &quot;Puzzles&quot; in Wikibooks. 
Most of my work occurs in the Wikiversity, so if you are really curious about me, I suggest that you consult my user page (and articles) there. 

I noticed that the &quot;Puzzles&quot; page was (at least once) nominated for deletion (IMHO, deletion would be a great loss), nevertheless, the page is currently in need of a major overhaul. I think it best to read through all the discussions regarding the &quot;Puzzles&quot; page, before I attempt any serious update. However, I am sure such an update is necessary, to support my plans to create a &quot;Department of Puzzles&quot; in the &quot;School of Creativity&quot; of the Wikiversity. 

With regard to PUZZLES, I am interested mainly in 3-D interlocking block puzzles (less so, bent wire entanglement puzzles and string entanglement puzzles) (much less so, word puzzles, crossword puzzles, and jigsaw puzzles). I have an offline map file, to which I am current ently adding links of interest to me. I hope to &quot;see you soon&quot; at the Wikiversity.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Text Processing Instructions ===

SSE 4.2 adds four string text processing instructions &lt;code&gt;PCMPISTRI&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;PCMPISTRM&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;PCMPESTRI&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;PCMPESTRM&lt;/code&gt;. These instructions take three parameters, &lt;code&gt;arg1&lt;/code&gt; an xmm register, &lt;code&gt;arg2&lt;/code&gt; an xmm or a 128-bit memory location and &lt;code&gt;IMM8&lt;/code&gt; an 8-bit immediate control byte. These instructions will perform arithmetic comparison between the packed contents of &lt;code&gt;arg1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;arg2&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;IMM8&lt;/code&gt; specifies the format of the input/output as well as the operation of two intermediate stages of processing. The results of stage 1 and stage 2 of intermediate processing will be referred to as &lt;code&gt;IntRes1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;IntRes2&lt;/code&gt; respectively. These instructions also provide additional information about the result through overload use of the arithmetic flags(&lt;code&gt;AF&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;CF&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;OF&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;PF&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;SF&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ZF&lt;/code&gt;). 

The instructions proceed in multiple steps:
#&lt;code&gt;arg1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;arg2&lt;/code&gt; are compared
#An aggregation operation is applied to the result of the comparison with the result flowing into &lt;code&gt;IntRes1&lt;/code&gt;
#An optional negation is performed with the result flowing into &lt;code&gt;IntRes2&lt;/code&gt;
#An output in the form of an index(in &lt;code&gt;ECX&lt;/code&gt;) or a mask(in &lt;code&gt;XMM0&lt;/code&gt;) is produced

==== IMM8 control byte description ====

IMM8 control byte is split into four group of bit fields that control the following settings:

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;IMM8[1:0]&lt;/code&gt; specifies the format of the 128-bit source data(&lt;code&gt;arg1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;arg2&lt;/code&gt;):

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!IMM8[1:0]
!Description
|-
| 00b || unsigned bytes(16 packed unsigned bytes)
|-
| 01b || unsigned words(8  packed unsigned words)
|-
| 10b || signed bytes(16 packed signed bytes)
|-
| 11b || signed words(8  packed signed words)
|}
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;IMM8[3:2]&lt;/code&gt; specifies the aggregation operation whose result will be placed in intermediate result 1, which we will refer to as &lt;code&gt;IntRes1&lt;/code&gt;. The size of &lt;code&gt;IntRes1&lt;/code&gt; will depend on the format of the source data, 16-bit for packed bytes and 8-bit for packed words:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!IMM8[3:2]
!Description
|-
| 00b ||  &lt;b&gt;Equal Any&lt;/b&gt;, arg1 is a character set, arg2 is the string to search in. IntRes1[i] is set to 1 if arg2[i] is in the set represented by arg1:
               arg1    = &quot;aeiou&quot;
               arg2    = &quot;Example string 1&quot;
               IntRes1 =  1010001000010000
|-
| 01b ||&lt;b&gt;Ranges&lt;/b&gt;, arg1 is a set of character ranges i.e. &quot;09az&quot; means all characters from 0 to 9 and from a to z., arg2 is the string to search over. IntRes1[i] is set to 1 if arg[i] is in any of the ranges represented by arg1:

               arg1    = &quot;09az&quot;
               arg2    = &quot;Testing 1 2 3, T&quot;
               IntRes1 =  0111111010101000
|-
| 10b || &lt;b&gt;Equal Each&lt;/b&gt;, arg1 is string one and arg2 is string two. IntRes1[i] is set to 1 if arg1[i] == arg2[i]:

               arg1    = &quot;The quick brown &quot;
               arg2    = &quot;The quack green &quot;
               IntRes1 =  1111110111010011
|-
| 11b || &lt;b&gt;Equal Ordered&lt;/b&gt;, arg1 is a substring string to search for, arg2 is the string to search within. IntRes1[i] is set to 1 if the substring arg1 can be found at position arg2[i]:

               arg1    = &quot;he&quot;
               arg2    = &quot;, he helped her &quot;
               IntRes1 =  0010010000001000
|}
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;IMM8[5:4]&lt;/code&gt; specifies the polarity or the processing of &lt;code&gt;IntRes1&lt;/code&gt;, into intermediate result 2, which will be referred to as &lt;code&gt;IntRes2&lt;/code&gt;:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!IMM8[5:4]
!Description
|-
| 00b || &lt;b&gt;Positive Polarity&lt;/b&gt; || IntRes2      = IntRes1
|-
| 01b || &lt;b&gt;Negative Polarity&lt;/b&gt; || IntRes2      = -1 XOR IntRes1
|-
| 10b || &lt;b&gt;Masked Positive&lt;/b&gt; || IntRes2      = IntRes1
|-
| 11b || &lt;b&gt;Masked Negative&lt;/b&gt; || IntRes2      = IntRes1 if reg/mem[i] is invalid else ~IntRes1 
|}
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;IMM8[6]&lt;/code&gt; specifies the output selection, or how &lt;code&gt;IntRes2&lt;/code&gt; will be processed into the output. For &lt;code&gt;PCMPESTRI&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;PCMPISTRI&lt;/code&gt;, the output is an index into the data currently referenced by &lt;code&gt;arg2&lt;/code&gt;:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!IMM8[6]
!Description
|-
| 0b || &lt;b&gt;Least Significant Index&lt;/b&gt; || ECX contains the least significant set bit in IntRes2
|-
| 1b || &lt;b&gt;Most Significant Index&lt;/b&gt; || ECX contains the least significant set bit in IntRes2
|}
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;For &lt;code&gt;PCMPESTRM&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;PCMPISTRM&lt;/code&gt;, the output is a mask reflecting all the set bits in &lt;code&gt;IntRes2&lt;/code&gt;:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!IMM8[6]
!Description
|-
| 0b || &lt;b&gt;Least Significant Index&lt;/b&gt; || Bit Mask, the least significant bits of XMM0 contain the IntRes2 16(8) bit mask. XMM0 is zero extended to 128-bits.
|-
| 1b || &lt;b&gt;Most Significant Index&lt;/b&gt; || Byte/Word Mask, XMM0 contains IntRes2 expanded into byte/word mask
|}
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;IMM8[7]&lt;/code&gt; should be set to zero since it has no designed meaning.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;

This report presents the finding of a Women's Tribunal in New York City which calls for systemic changes to end poverty. The findings were presented to the UN Secretary-General and the President of the UN General Assembly on the occasion of the High-level Event on the Millennium Development Goals held on September 25, 2008. The verdicts of this, as in the other Tribunals, arrive at the same general conclusion: the eradication of poverty cannot succeed without equality and justice for women. Prepared by Rosa G. Lizarde, Director, ENLACE and North American Representative of the Feminist Task Force-GCAP &lt;br&gt;

'''UNDP Survey on Knowledge and Information Level of Romanian Citizens on EU Development Policies'''&lt;br&gt; 

A relevant quantitative research report conducted by UNDP to determine the knowledge and information level of Romanian citizens regarding the development policy of the European Union, the visibility of the European policy for development in Romania and the knowledge level regarding the Millennium Development Objectives. 

Also, the study is meant to reveal the public attitude towards shift of Romania’s statute from recipient to fund donor and the most adequate messages to promote the new statute of Romania as a international donor. https://docs.google.com/fileview?id=0B3jANqe7Hsl3NTQxZWY1NDItNzQxMi00NjliLThmNWYtYTRhN2Q2YmNjNWQ3&amp;amp;hl=en&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt; 

&lt;br&gt; 

Related to any Call for proposal financed by EuropeAid it is recommended, for the optimization of Concept Notes to be sent to EC, to pay attention to the evaluation criteria usually applied by the European Commission to evaluate (and in case approve or reject) the quality of a New proposal asking for Funds. 

&lt;br&gt; 

In the following you can read a list of these criteria.&lt;br&gt; 

&lt;br&gt; 

= Relevance of the action  =

- How relevant is the proposal to the objectives and priorities of the Call for Proposals? 

- How relevant to the particular needs and constraints of the target country/countries or region(s) is the proposal? (including synergy with other EC initiatives and avoidance of duplication) 

- How clearly defined and strategically chosen are those involved&lt;br&gt;(final beneficiaries, target groups)? Have their needs been clearly defined and does the proposal address them appropriately? 

- Does the proposal contain specific added-value elements such as&lt;br&gt;environmental issues, promotion of gendere quality and equal opportunities, needs of disabled people, rights of minorities and rights of indigenous peoples... 

&lt;br&gt; 

= Design of the action  =

- How coherent is the overall design of the action? In particular, does it reflect the analysis of the problems involved, take into account external factors and relevant stakeholders? 

- Is the action feasible and consistent in relation to the objectives and expected results? 

&lt;br&gt; 

= &lt;br&gt; Financial and operational capacity  =

- Do the applicant and partners (if any) have sufficient experience of project management? 

- Do the applicant and partners have sufficient technical expertise (notably knowledge of the issues to be addressed)? 

- Do the applicant and partners have sufficient management capacity (including staff, equipment and ability to handle thebudget for the action)? 

- Does the applicant have stable and sufficient sources of finance? 

&lt;br&gt; 

= &lt;br&gt;Sustainability  =

- Is the action likely to have a tangible impact on the stakeholders involved? 

- Is the proposal likely to have multiplier effects (including scope for replication and extension of the outcome of the action and dissemination of information)? 

- Are the expected results of the proposed action sustainable?
