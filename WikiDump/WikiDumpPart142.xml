      <text xml:space="preserve">= A few comments =

Here are my comments after a first real read:

* I suggest telling the reader what base code you rely on, so (s)he can copy/paste the code and recreate the tutorial by him/herself.
:Ok.
:: Similarly, I saw that in a few places, there is code to add, but the reader doesn't know where (global variables for instance).
:: At the end of the &quot;Vertex buffer objects&quot; section, we don't have the shader code yet, so it's difficult to start the exercices ;)
:: I understand that this is a tedious way to write the tutorials, and that this series has a more advanced audience that the basics series though. Maybe recommend to do the exercices by modifying the final code from the repository.

* Possibly quickly explain GL_LINE_STRIP (vs. GL_LINE_LOOP) - the other tutorials mostly use GL_TRIANGLES and don't cover the different ways to draw lines.
:Ok.

* I would also recommend to link with &lt;code&gt;-lm&lt;/code&gt; for portability

* There's an extra &lt;code&gt;uniform_mytexture&lt;/code&gt; in the first graph code.

* For reference, slight advantage to glMap on my hardware (Radeon HD 5450):
** 20,000,000 points in ~1850ms for glMap
** 20,000,000 points in ~1950ms for malloc'd array (can't allocate that much points in the stack) (transmission itself in 55ms)
** I'm surprised that this point-by-point definition is efficient with glMap, probably the data is transferred in bulk on glUnmap in this particular case.

* Apparently there's no glPointSize and glEnable(GL_POINT_SPRITE) in ES2 (to test) - maybe mention it when introducing these features.

* Setting gl_PointSize = 100; in the vertex shader randomly messes up the display; with LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1, it has no effect.  Not sure how to use it :)

Stewart ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==types==
Newton method can be used for finding successively better approximations to one root (zero) of :
*  a real-valued function
*  a complex-valued function
*  a system of equations

If one wants to find another root must apply the method again with other initial point

==What is needed ?==
* function f ( a differentiable function )
* it's derivative f' 
* starting point x0 ( which should be in the basin of root's attraction )
* stopping rule ( criteria to stop iteration )

 exp  =  function of one variable, x
 var = variable 
 x0 = inital value of variable
 eps = 

The search begins with x = x_0 and proceeds until abs(expr) &lt; eps (with expr evaluated at the current value of x). 

output : xn = an approximate solution of expr = 0 by Newton's method

== recurrence relations ==

Define the [[Fractals/Iterations_in_the_complex_plane/def_cqp#Iterated_function_.28map.29|iterated function]] &lt;math&gt;f^n&lt;/math&gt; by:

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
f^0 (z, c) &amp;= z \\
f^1 (z, c) &amp;= z^2 + c \\
f^{m+1} (z, c) &amp;= f (f^m (z, c), c)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Pick '''arbitrary names''' for the [[Fractals/Iterations_in_the_complex_plane/def_cqp#Iterated_function_.28map.29|iterated function]] and it's [[Fractals/Iterations_in_the_complex_plane/def_cqp#Derivative_of_Iterated_function_.28map.29|derivatives]] 
These derivatives can be computed by recurrence relations.

The boundary point &lt;math&gt;c = b&lt;/math&gt; at angle &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; (measured in turns) satisfies system of 2 equations :

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases}
f^p(w, b) - w &amp;= 0 \\
\dfrac{\partial }{\partial z}f^p(w, b) - e^{2 \pi i t} &amp;= 0
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

Defining a function of two complex variables:

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
g \begin{pmatrix} z \\ c \end{pmatrix} &amp;= \begin{pmatrix} f^p(z, c) - z \\ \dfrac{\partial }{\partial z}f^p(z, c) - e^{2 \pi i t} \end{pmatrix}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

and applying Newton's method in two variables:

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\boldsymbol{v}_0 = \begin{pmatrix} n \\ n \end{pmatrix} \\
J_g(\boldsymbol{v}_m) (\boldsymbol{v}_{m+1} - \boldsymbol{v}_m) = -g(\boldsymbol{v}_m)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
J_g = \begin{pmatrix}
\dfrac{\partial}{\partial z} (f^p(z, c) - z) &amp; 
\dfrac{\partial}{\partial c} (f^p(z, c) - z) \\
\dfrac{\partial}{\partial z} (\dfrac{\partial }{\partial z}f^p(z, c) - e^{2 \pi i t}) &amp;
\dfrac{\partial}{\partial c} (\dfrac{\partial }{\partial z}f^p(z, c) - e^{2 \pi i t})
\end{pmatrix}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

This can be expressed using the recurrence relations as:

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\begin{pmatrix} w_0 \\ b_0 \end{pmatrix} &amp;= \begin{pmatrix} n \\ n \end{pmatrix} \\
\begin{pmatrix} B_p - 1 &amp; D_p \\ C_p &amp; E_p \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} w_{m+1} - w_m \\ b_{m+1} - b_m \end{pmatrix} &amp;= - \begin{pmatrix} A_p - w_m \\ B_p - e^{2 \pi i t} \end{pmatrix}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\{A,B,C,D,E\}_p&lt;/math&gt; are evaluated at &lt;math&gt;(w_m, b_m)&lt;/math&gt;.
===Example===
&quot;The process is for numerically finding one boundary point on one component at a time - you can't solve for the whole boundary of all the
components at once.  So pick and fix one particular nucleus n and one particular internal angle t &quot; (Claude Heiland-Allen &lt;ref&gt;[http://mathr.co.uk/ Home page of Claude Heiland-Allen]&lt;/ref&gt;)

Lets try find point of boundary ( bond point )  

&lt;math&gt;c = b&lt;/math&gt; 

of hyperbolic component of Mandelbrot set for :
* period p=3 
* angle t=0 
* center ( nucleus )  c = n = -0.12256116687665+0.74486176661974i

There is only one such point. 

Initial estimates (first guess) will be center ( nucleus ) &lt;math&gt;c = n&lt;/math&gt;  of this components. This center ( complex number) will be saved in a [[vector]] of complex numbers containing  two copies of that nucleus:

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\boldsymbol{v}_0 = 
\begin{pmatrix} 
n\\
n
 \end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix} 
-0.12256116687665+0.74486176661974i\\
-0.12256116687665+0.74486176661974i 
 \end{pmatrix}

\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
 				
 		
	

The boundary point at angle &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; (measured in turns) satisfies system of 2 equations :

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases}
f^3(z, c) - z &amp;= 0 \\
\dfrac{\partial }{\partial z}f^3(z, c) - e^{2 \pi i 0} &amp;= 0
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

so :

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases}
z^8 +4cz^6 +6c^2z^4+2cz^4 +4c^3z^2 +4c^2z^2 -z+c^4 +2c^3 +c^2+c = 0 \\
8z^7 +24cz^5 +24c^2z^3 +8cz^3 +8c^3z +8c^2z-1 = 0
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

Then function g

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
g(\boldsymbol{v}) = \begin{cases}
z^8 +4cz^6 +6c^2z^4+2cz^4 +4c^3z^2 +4c^2z^2 -z+c^4 +2c^3 +c^2+c  \\
8z^7 +24cz^5 +24c^2z^3 +8cz^3 +8c^3z +8c^2z-1 
\end{cases}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;



Jacobian matrix &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt; is 

&lt;math&gt;
J_g(\boldsymbol{v}) = 
\begin{pmatrix}
8z^7+24cz^5+24c^2z^3+8cz^3+8c^3z+8c^2z-1 &amp; 4z^6+12cz^4+2z^4+12c^2z^2+8cz^2+4c^3+6c^2+2c+1\\
56z^6+120cz^4+72c^2z^2+24cz^2+8c^3+8c^2 &amp; 24z^5+48cz^3+8z^3+24c^2z+16cz
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
J^{-1}_g(\boldsymbol{v}) = 
\begin{pmatrix}
\frac{24z^5+48cz^3+8z^3+24c^2z+16cz}{d}&amp;
\frac{-4*z^6-12*c*z^4-2*z^4-12*c^2*z^2-8*c*z^2-4*c^3-6*c^2-2*c-1}{d}\\
\frac{-56*z^6-120*c*z^4-72*c^2*z^2-24*c*z^2-8*c^3-8*c^2}{d}&amp;
\frac{8*z^7+24*c*z^5+24*c^2*z^3+8*c*z^3+8*c^3*z+8*c^2*z-1}{d}
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;


where denominator d is :

&lt;math&gt;d = (24z^5+48cz^3+8z^3+24c^2z+16cz)(8z^7+24cz^5+24c^2z^3+8cz^3+8c^3z+8c^2z-1)+(-56z^6-120cz^4-72c^2z^2-24cz^2-8c^3-8c^2)(4z^6+12cz^4+2z^4+12c^2z^2+8cz^2+4c^3+6c^2+2c+1)&lt;/math&gt;



Then find better aproximation of point c=b using iteration :

&lt;math&gt;
 \boldsymbol{v}_{m+1} = \frac{ \boldsymbol{v}_m -g(\boldsymbol{v}_m)}{J_g(\boldsymbol{v}_m)} = (\boldsymbol{v}_m -g(\boldsymbol{v}_m) ) J^{-1}_g(\boldsymbol{v}_m)
&lt;/math&gt;

using &lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{v}_0&lt;/math&gt; as an starting point :

&lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{v}_0&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{v}_1 = (\boldsymbol{v}_0 -g(\boldsymbol{v}_0) ) J^{-1}_g(\boldsymbol{v}_0)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{v}_2 = (\boldsymbol{v}_1 -g(\boldsymbol{v}_1) ) J^{-1}_g(\boldsymbol{v}_1)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; ...&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{v}_{m+1} = (\boldsymbol{v}_m -g(\boldsymbol{v}_m) ) J^{-1}_g(\boldsymbol{v}_m)&lt;/math&gt;

== size ==

Newton's method (providing the initial estimate is sufficiently good and the function is well-behaved) provides successively more accurate approximations.  How to tell when the approximation is good enough?  One way might be to compare the center with points on its boundary, and continue to increase precision until this distance is accurate to enough bits.

Algorithm:

# given a center location estimate &lt;math&gt;n_m&lt;/math&gt; accurate to &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; bits of precision
# compute a boundary location estimate &lt;math&gt;b_m&lt;/math&gt; accurate to the same precision, using center &lt;math&gt;n_m&lt;/math&gt; as starting value
# compute &lt;math&gt;|n_m - b_m|&lt;/math&gt; to find an estimate of the size of the component
## if it isn't zero, and if it is accurate enough (to a few 10s of bits, perhaps) then finish
## otherwise increase precision, refine center estimate to new precision, try again from the top

Measuring effective accuracy of the distance between two very close points might be done by comparing floating point exponents with floating point mantissa precision.

/* 

it is a c console program which 
- computes external parameter ray 
- for complex quadratic polynomial fc(z) = z^2+c
- uses arbitrary precision ( mpfr) with dynamic precision adjustment
- uses Newton method ( described by T Kawahira) http://www.math.nagoya-u.ac.jp/~kawahira/programs/mandel-exray.pdf

 program uses the code by Claude Heiland-Allen
 from https://gitorious.org/maximus/book/
 



&quot; ray_in computes 4 points per dwell band, and ray_out currently computes 16.  
 Moreover ray_in has dynamic precision adjustment and 
ray_out doesn't (so you need a high precision to get through the thin 
gaps) - fixing both of these is on my mental todo list.  ray_out will 
always be slower though, as it needs to compute extra points when 
crossing dwell bands to accumulate angle bits (and to work correctly).&quot;

What algorithm do you use for drawing external ray ?

&quot;essentially the Newton's method one in
http://www.math.nagoya-u.ac.jp/~kawahira/programs/mandel-exray.pdf

precision is automatic, effectively it checks how close dwell bands are 
together and uses higher precision when they are narrow and lower 
precision when they are wide.  in general precision will increase along 
the ray as it gets closer to the boundary. &quot;


&quot;periodic rays stop near the landing point at the current zoom level, 
manually retrace if you zoom in and find the gap annoying.  tracing 
periodic rays is a lot slower than tracing preperiodic rays, especially 
if you zoom in to the cusp - suggestions welcome for improvements here 
(perhaps a larger radius than a single pixel for landing point nearness 
threshold?). &quot;

In answer to your question in the Muggles' Guide, might I suggest that a good first place to look is the entry for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peeves|Peeves]]? Key point is that Peeves is not a ghost, but a poltergeist. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 15:22, 12 September 2011 (UTC)

== More Muggles' Guide ==

Just as a reminder, for the Muggles' Guide, we are concerning ourselves only with the 7 original books, plus ''The Tales of Beedle the Bard'', ''Quidditch Through the Ages'',  and ''Fantastic Creatures and Where to Find Them''. Things in the movies and in the video games directly contradict things in the books, and some video games contradict each other. And we are interested in dealing with Potter as a guide to the literature, as well, analyzing the story to a greater depth and analyzing what it was about the story and the writing that made it so very popular. Your edit this morning about the Banishment Charm had to be backed out because it was not part of the books, and because the sequence of events in the game is not the sequence of events in the books, and therefore suspect: Harry learned the Banishment Charm from Flitwick, not Sirius, and it was in GoF, not OotP.

      <text xml:space="preserve">GTK is part of GNOME project and is used to create advanced graphical user interfaces, pyGTK is the wrapper of the GTK library on python. This book aims at learning by constructive examples.
===Examples===
The basic GUI program to pop up a simple window
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
#!/usr/bin/env python
import gtk
win = gtk.Window()
win.show()
gtk.main()  # not win.main()
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
Its always good to use class paradigm in programming GUI using pyGTK
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
#!/usr/bin/env python
import gtk
class StartWindow:
    def __init__(self):
        win = gtk.Window()
        win.show()
StartWindow()    
gtk.main()
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
The window quit method is not proper in the program, the intercommunication and integrity of the widgets in pyGTK are based on events and signals, so when the user actually clicks on the 'X' button, it generates a signal called &quot;destroy&quot;, if there is an event to handle the signal, it will be triggered, gtk.main_quit() is the right method that will quit the GUI window in its proper method. So   use win.connect(&quot;destroy&quot;, callback) to connect the &quot;destroy&quot; signal generated by the window manager and the respective callback function; in callback function call the method gtk.main_quit()
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
#!/usr/bin/env python
import gtk
class StartWindow:
    def __init__(self):
        win = gtk.Window()
        win.connect(&quot;destroy&quot;, self.close)
        win.show()
    def close(self, widget):    #add the variable widget as the caller calls 
        gtk.main_quit()         #with two arguments
StartWindow()    
gtk.main()
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
Now let us add a button widget to the window and link the &quot;clicked&quot; signal from the window manager with the call back function print_message, where it prints a message to console  
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
#!/usr/bin/env python
import gtk
class StartWindow:
    def __init__(self):
        win = gtk.Window()
        win.set_title(&quot;Simple Window&quot;)
        #win.set_border_width(10)       #uncomment and see the change      
        #win.set_size_request(200,50)   #uncomment and see the change
        win.connect(&quot;destroy&quot;, self.close)
        bu = gtk.Button(&quot;start&quot;)
        bu.connect(&quot;clicked&quot;, self.print_message)    
        win.add(bu)             #don't forget to add button to window
        win.show_all()          #use show_all to display all widgets
    def close(self, widget):    
        gtk.main_quit()         
    def print_message(self, widget):
        print &quot;clicked...&quot;
StartWindow()    
gtk.main()
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
Now, we have to see ways to accommodate more buttons in the desired pattern into the window, to be more generic, we have to know how to pack widgets into the window, here is a little example with two buttons, a separator and a quit button to quit the window
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
#!/usr/bin/env python
import gtk
class StartWindow:
    def __init__(self):
        self.win = gtk.Window(gtk.WINDOW_TOPLEVEL)
        self.win.set_title(&quot;Allign Buttons&quot;)
        self.win.connect(&quot;destroy&quot;, self.close)
        self.win.set_border_width(10)
        self.win.set_size_request(225, 144)

        verticalBox = gtk.VBox(True, 0)                         #homogeneous, spacing

        la = gtk.Label(&quot;Label&quot;)
        la.set_alignment(0.5, 0)
        verticalBox.pack_start(la, False, False, 0)             #child, expand, fill, padding
        la.show()

        horizontalBox = gtk.HBox(True, 0)                       #homogeneous, spacing
        bu = gtk.Button(&quot;start&quot;)
        bu.connect(&quot;clicked&quot;, self.print_start)
        horizontalBox.pack_start(bu, True, True, 0)             #child, expand, fill, padding
        bu.show()
        bu = gtk.Button(&quot;stop&quot;)                                 #note that the samle handler bu is used twice
        bu.connect(&quot;clicked&quot;, self.print_stop)
        horizontalBox.pack_start(bu, True, True, 0)             #child, expand, fill, padding
        bu.show()
        verticalBox.pack_start(horizontalBox, True, True, 0)    #child, expand, fill, padding
        horizontalBox.show()

        sep = gtk.HSeparator()
        verticalBox.pack_start(sep, True, True, 0)              #child, expand, fill, padding
        sep.show()

        hbx = gtk.HBox(True, 0)                                 #homogeneous, spacing
        qb =  gtk.Button(&quot;quit&quot;)
        qb.connect(&quot;clicked&quot;, lambda w: gtk.main_quit())  
        hbx.pack_start(qb, False, False, 0)                     #child, expand, fill, padding
        verticalBox.pack_start(hbx, False, False, 0)            #child, expand, fill, padding
        qb.show()
        self.win.add(verticalBox)
        verticalBox.show()
        self.win.show_all()          

    def close(self, widget):                             #add the var widget as the caller calls 
        gtk.main_quit()                                  #with two arguments
    def print_start(self, widget):
        print &quot;started something...&quot;
    def print_stop(self, widget):
        print &quot;stopped something...&quot;
StartWindow()    
gtk.main()

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi Deep!

Nice to see you taking interest in updating the book. I also see that you have updated the book with content from Wikipedia.

I'd like to remind you gently that the book is not a consolidation of articles from a secondary source. It is a book of problems and thought processes. Mere information will not suffice.

Please keep this in mind. Do write on my Talk Page if you wish to carry on a discussion.

* [[/The Central Processing Unit (CPU)/]]
* [[/Introduction to Binary Logic/]]
* [[/Memory/]]
* [[/Input and output devices/]]
* [[/Secondary storage/]]

Each of these topics has its own page

= How the parts fit together =
The diagram below gives some examples of these different types of device and shows how data can be transferred between them in a computer system.  &lt;br /&gt;
As an exercise work out where each of the five items listed above fit into this diagram.

[[Image:Diagram-_Computing_Hardware_Devices.PNG|center|Types of device in a computer system]]

'''Input Devices''' include any kind of device which can be used for getting data in to the computer system from the outside world and there are many more different kinds of input device than it is possible to list here. However some examples include; keyboard, mouse, microphone, heat sensors, switches, touch screens, digital cameras and so on.

When talking about '''Processing Devices''' we are usually referring to the Central Processing Unit (CPU), the &quot;brain&quot; of the computer which performs calculations and processes data.

'''Storage Devices''' include any device which will store data until it is needed for processing. This can include temporary storage devices, like the computer's memory, or long-term storage devices like hard-drives, DVD drives or tape drives, etc.

'''Communication Devices''' deal with the transfer of data from one computer system to another for instance a modem can be used to communicate data to another computer via the Internet.

'''Output Devices''' include any kind of device which can provide data in a useful format to a user. For instance a computer monitor, speakers and printers, etc.


===Peripheral Devices===
Many hardware devices, which also fit in to one of the categories above, are also known as '''peripheral devices'''. These are devices which are not part of the main computer system, but are added on to increase the capabilities of the system. For instance keyboards, mice, scanners, printers, external hard-drives and so on.

      <text xml:space="preserve">= What you need to know =
The exam board say that you must be able to explain &quot;why data is represented in computer systems in binary form&quot;.

= Introduction =
We are all used to counting in tens, and there being only ten different digits (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9).  when we want to go above 9 we have no problem in sticking two digits together - for example a 1 and a 0 making 10.  We understand that the &quot;1&quot; in fact means &quot;one lot of ten&quot;.  We can do this for pretty much any number, knowing that 8,456 means &quot;eight lots of a thousand, four lots of a hundred, five tens and six units&quot;.

Using tens like this is called &quot;Base 10&quot;, and arose as we have ten fingers so it is easy to count like this - it's just a convenient way of doing things.  Since computers don't have fingers, Base 10 is not very convenient for them.  For them the best system is what is called &quot;Base 2&quot; or &quot;Binary&quot;.  The equivalent of fingers is detecting the amount of electricity going through a wire.  For simplicity we think of the electricity as being &quot;on&quot; or &quot;off&quot;.  If electricity is off we call it a zero, if it is on we call it a 1. [[/On Off or High Voltage Low Voltage/|Note]]

One wire can tell us just if something is on or off, which isn't very useful.  Suppose we have three wires together, and we (or rather the computer) checks each wire to see if it is on or off.  We get the following possibilities:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|+ Figure 1
|-
! Status !! Wire 1 !! Wire 2 !! Wire 3
|-
| Current? || Off || Off || Off
|-
| Current? || Off || Off || On
|-
| Current? || Off || On || Off
|-
| Current? || On || Off || Off 
|-
| Current? || On || Off || On
|-
| Current? || On || On || Off 
|-
| Current? || On || Off || On
|-
| Current? || On || On || Off 

|}

If we think of &quot;Off&quot; as zero and On as One we get 

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|+ Figure 2
|-
! Status !! Wire 1 !! Wire 2 !! Wire 3
|-
| Current? || 0 || 0 || 0
|-
| Current? || 0 || 0 || 1
|-
| Current? || 0 || 1 || 0
|-

|-
| Current? || 1 || 0 || 1
|-
| Current? || 1 || 1 || 0 
|-
| Current? || 1 || 1 || 1
|}

Now let's go back to ordinary Base 10.  we have column headings like this:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|+ Figure 3
|-
! Hundreds !! Tens !! Units || Meaning
|-
| 8 || 3 || 2  || Eight hundreds, 3 tens and two units - 832
|-
| 4 || 0 || 5|| Four hundreds, zero tens and 5 units - 405
|}

we can do the same in Binary but the column headings change

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|+ Figure 4
|-
! Sixteens !! Eights !! Fours !! Twos !! Units || Meaning
|-
| 1 || 0 || 1 || 1 || 0 || 16 + 4 + 2 = 22
|-
| 0 || 0 || 0 || 1 || 1 || 2 + 1 = 3
|-
| 1 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 1 || 16 + 1 = 17
|}

The column headings are different, but the idea is the same: the column heading tells you how much an entry in that column is worth.  In normal base 10, anything in the second column (from the right) is worth 10, in binary it is worth 2.  The next column is worth 100 in Base 10, but only 4 in Binary.

No we can look again at Figure One or Figure Two, and say that the way those wires are on or off can tell us a number.  So if the wire on the left is off, and the next two are on the &quot;value&quot; is 3.  Figure 6 below may help you understand this.


{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|+ Figure 6
|-
! Status !! Wire 1 !! Wire 2 !! Wire 3
|-
| Current? || O || O || O || No fours, no two's, no units = 0
|-
| Current? || O ||0 || 1 || No fours, no two's, one unit = 1
|-
| Current? || 0 || 1 || 0 || No fours, one two, no units = 2
|-
| Current? || 0 || 1 || 1  || No fours, one two, one unit = 3
|-
| Current? || 1 || 0 || 0 || One four, no two's, no units = 4
|-
| Current? || 1 || 0 || 1 || One four, no two's, one units = 5
|-
| Current? || 1 || 1 || 0 || One four, One two, no units = 6
|-
| Current? || 1 || 1 || 1 || One four, One two, One unit = 7
|}

==Exercise==

=The maths and logic of it=
Base 10 (ordinary maths) evolved because we have ten fingers and it is easy to think of ten digits (0 to 9)&lt;br /&gt;

Base 2 (Binary) is useful because computers can only really record two possibilities: on or off.  So they use 0 and 1 for these.  '''Therefore, base 2 does not have the digits 2 to 9.  They are NEVER used.'''.  This is exactly the same as there not being a special digit for eleven in Base 10: you just use to 1's.  To make three in Base 2, use two 1's, meaning one lot of two, and one lot of one = 3

==If you are happy with maths ...==
(If not, see below!)

Each column goes up by a power, as follows:
Base 10
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! 10^5 !! 10^4 !! 10^3 !! 10^2 !! 10^1 !! 10^0
|-
| 100,000 || 10,000 || 1000 || 100 || 10 || 1
|}
Base 2
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! 2^5 || 2^4 || 2^3 || 2^2 || 2^1 || 2^0
|-
| 32 || 16 || 8 || 4 || 2 || 1
|}

== If you are not so happy with maths ...==
In normal base 10 each column is TEN TIMES the column to its right.&lt;br /&gt;
In Base 2 (Binary) each column is DOUBLE the one to its right.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===What, Why Arduino?===
[[File:Duemilanove.jpg|thumb|The discontinued Arduino Duemilanove, replaced by the UNO in late 2010]]
The [[wikipedia:Arduino|Arduino]] contains a microcontroller. Microcontrollers evolved from the same microprocessors that started the PC revolution such as the Motorola 6502 and Intel 8088. Microcontrollers differ from modern CPUs in that IO, RAM, and Flash memory are imbedded in a single chip. They are found in embedded applications such as the control panel of a microwave, printer or car dashboard. They exist in a variety of configurations and price points starting at under two dollars for quantity one. Two popular microcontroller companies used in the DIY community are [[wikipedia:Atmel|AMTEL]] and [[wikipedia:Microchip_Technology|Microchip PIC]]. They are popular because they give away the software development environment (C language) for free and they scale up to supporting [[wikipedia:Linux|Linux]].

The Arduino is open source hardware. It contains chips from for profit companies. The open source features are:
*The form factor: the way wires attach to it, the way add on products stack on top of it
*The circuit board 
*The circuit that connects the chips
*Standard boot loader (what happens when you turn it on)
[[File:UnoArduino.jpg|thumb|The starting point, the Arduino Uno]]

The Arduino evolved out of the open source [[wikipedia:Wiring_(development_platform)|Wiring project]], which was inspired by the [[wikipedia:Processing_(programming_language)|Processing programming language]]. The Arduino was created at the Interaction Design Institute in Ivrea Italy (where Olivetti is located) in 2003 in almost [http://vimeo.com/18539129 one evening] (24 minute video link). The goal of Wiring is to create an single board microcomputer, a programming language and an [[wikipedia:Integrated_development_environment|IDE]]  that caters to artists. The Arduino is a success for several reasons:
*Surface mount chips are hard to solder. The DIY community needed to move away from designing circuits, building unique big circuit boards and soldering chips. They needed to move to small standard circuit boards that are stacked on top of each other. 
*Test driven software development
*Example driven software learning
*Active community expanding examples
*Physical feedback through lights, motors, sounds of software success
*Price points, competition and branding necessary for economic success
[[File:UnoStickers.jpg|thumb|Stickers and Documentation that comes with the Uno]]
Every year for the last 20 years both universities and companies have come up with new microcontrollers targeting the DIY educational market. The starting price point has been around $300. The Arduino has lowered this to around $30.

In summary the Arduino has a lower starting point in both cost, experience and expectations. Yet it scales up to the dominate professional software development environments used by electrical engineers to create circuits and computer engineers to build systems. It also scales up to enabling complicated open source, Linux applications such as the robot operating system (ROS) and autopilots to travel in battery operated robots.
[[File:Wear-tech-workshop-8.jpg|thumb|left|Different Arduino models]]

The term &quot;Arduino&quot; refers to a [[wikipedia:List_of_Arduino_compatibles|family of controllers]] that use the same software but have different target applications and form factors. The rest of this document refers to the Uno Arduino specifically. 
[[File:StackedShields.jpg|thumb|right|Shields stacked on top of Uno]]

===Shields===
The Arduino Uno's function is expanded by sandwiching different circuit boards on top of it. These circuit boards are called [http://shieldlist.org/ shields]. New shields spark creativity, demand and profit. Pictured are a USB Host Shield .. which enables the Arduino to act like a PC rather than the device being plugged into the PC. 
[[File:UsbHostShield.jpg|thumb|left|USB Host Shield]]
To the right is a picture of an Uno (blue) with a USB Host Shield (red) and motor Shield (green) stacked on top of it. The USB Host Shield and UNO have stackable or female headers. The motor shield has been made with breakaway or male headers that prevent stacking of more shields.
[[File:Motorshield.jpg|thumb|right|Motor Shield]]

===Connections===
====Power====
The Uno can be powered through the USB cable. Eventually adding stuff to the Uno will cause everything to stop working. The solution is to plug in a 5 to 12 volt DC in cable to the Uno. Things will then work, more will be added and eventually the Uno will stop working again. At this point the individual shields may need their own power sources. This is especially true if motors are involved. 

The USB cable is designed to be attached to a computer so that software can be downloaded to the Arduino. Once the program is downloaded, the USB cable can be disconnected (if another power source is available) and the program will run without a computer.

====USB====
A USB mouse or keyboard can not be plugged into the Arduino as if it were a computer. The USB port on an Uno is a slave port, not the [[wikipedia:USB_On-The-Go|USB On-The-Go port]] found in cell phones. The Uno needs a USB host to talk to. Keyboards and mice are slaves. Two slaves can not talk to each other. That is why a USB Host shield for the Arduino exists.

====6 Analog In Pins====
Six pins (or holes where pins go) are clearly labeled on the Uno. EEG, ECG, temperature sensors, light sensors, and strain gauges are examples of devices that turn physical measured information into a voltage. The Uno can [[wikipedia:Analog-to-digital_converter|turn the voltage into a number]] between 0 and 1023 through the Analog pins. The maximum voltage defaults to 5 volts, but can be changed to 1.1 or 3.3 volts through software.

====AREF====
The word &quot;AREF&quot; on the Uno points a pin. AREF stands for '''A'''nalog '''REF'''erence. A different maximum voltage for the Analog pins can be connected here and then selected through software. The maximum voltage is 5 volts. 1.1 and 3.3 volts can be selected through software. Anything different will have to be connected to the AREF pin. Doing this enables the Uno to be more accurate when converting information from the 6 analog pins to numbers. 
[[File:UnoConnections.jpg||Center|Uno Connections]]

====Digital Pins====
The digital pins put out either 0 or 5 volts. They can turn off and on LEDs. Or they could tell a fax machine LCD panel what to say. Pins 3,5,6,9,10,11 are PWM or Pulse Width Modulation pins, meaning that the time on and time off do not have to equal. This enables the control of [[wikipedia:Electronic_speed_control|Electronic Speed Controllers]] (ESC). This enables an Uno to change the speed of helicopter propellers. Pins 0 and 1 stand for transmit and receive ... with anything including another UNO. This for example would enable one UNO to talk to another.

====Shield pins====
The Uno pins move up through the headers and thus are available to all the shields. The shields themselves may have additional features. There is a [http://www.sparkfun.com/products/7914 protoboard] shield that adds no features other than providing a platform on which to build unique circuits.

===The Competition===
The arduino has spun off a number of competing open source hardware projects. The uno header pin out and compatibility with arduino software are the two major features of all arduino boards. 

Many companies are making &quot;almost compatible&quot; arduino products like the [http://pinguino.cc/ Pinguino]. Some feature the [http://www.digilentinc.com/Products/Detail.cfm?NavPath=2,396,984&amp;Prod=CEREBOT-MX3CK pic processor] rather than the arduino's [http://www.atmel.com/products/microcontrollers/avr/default.aspx Atmel]. Others like the [http://papilio.cc papilio] (based on Xilinix FPGA) don't claim software capatibility, just compatibility with the UNO header pinout.

Some projects require running a linux distribution in the device that is being built. The [http://www.raspberrypi.org/ raspberry pi] and [http://www.pcduino.com/ pcduino] are examples of these.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Electronic motors are found in kids toys , RC cars, airplanes and helicopters, printers, scanners, and fax machines. They are expensive when purchased, quantity 1, new with manual. This is because the motors are part of a supply chain that is usually just making enough to fill orders for kids toys, etc. Many can be found for sale on the internet, but very few are in stock and the price is high if they are. Often it is easier to purchase the kid's toy and take it apart. The goal is to connect these motors to the arduino and then make something new with them. The goal of this document is to describe what to expect.
[[File:Dc_motors.jpg|thumb|DC Brushed Canned Motors from Toys]]
===DC or Brushed Motors===
These are also known as canned motors. Two wires go into them. They often are directly connected to a battery. A switch turns them on. Higher voltages cause them to spin faster. Often geared down in toys, they are designed to spin fast. If turned on and forced to not spin, the motor will heat up, and may even burn up. The motor is made by copper wire covered with clear paint, and wound together in a ball. When the motor heats up too much, the paint turns into smoke, nearby copper wires connect, the motor becomes weaker, the motor heats up more, more smoke comes out, etc. The winding resistance keeps going down. Measure the winding resistance when the motor is new and measure again when there are problems. 
[[File:Esc1.jpg|thumb|left|2 Wire Electronic Speed Controller]]
Speed can be varied by either changing the voltage or pulsing the motor. Most computer controlled DC motors are pulsed. Pulses of a fixed voltage are sent to the motor, usually by an Electronic Speed Controller or ESC. A pulse of 1.5 ms causes no motion. Wider pulses cause faster spinning in one direction. Shorter pulses cause faster spinning in the opposite direction. Eventually, an overstressed ESC stops pulsing and turns one wire on and one wire off, depending on the direction. 
[[File:BrushKidsToy.jpg|thumb|example of a brush]]
The motor can be directly pulsed by the arduino. The arduino can also supply power to the motor, but normally this is only a good idea for demonstration purposes. The arduino has a very weak power supply, and attempting to power a motor through it can destroy the arduino. Furthermore the arduino may not be able to supply the exact correct maximum voltage. For this reason, an ESC is placed between the arduino and the motor.

Three wires of the ESC go back to the arduino. These wires are typically:
* arduino --&gt;  ESC (5 volt pulse of various widths .. pulse width modulation (PWM))
* arduino ---  ESC ground
* arduino &lt;--  ESC can supply power to the arduino (normally don't want to do this)

The ESC has two wires coming from a battery, and then two wires going to the DC brushed motor.  These can be any voltage that maximizes the motor's revolutions per minute (RPM). Ideally the ESC optically isolates the arduino from the DC motor.

===Servo Motors===
[[File:Servo1.jpg|thumb|left|Plotter servo motor]]

2 wires. [[wikipedia:Servomechanism|Servomechanisms]] are designed to move to a spot and hold it's position. They are not designed to spin continuously. Used to position print heads in ink jet printers, plotters, scanners. Travel at set speeds. Go to a spot and stop. When stopped and still turned on, will attempt to hold it's position. Forcing it to move in this position can damage the motor. Typically is controlled by a circuit board that counts shadows with an LED and light sensor or has a resistor that changes value depending upon position. Often zooms to one side when powered on to figure out where it is at.

Servo motors are usually mounted on a circuit board. Some have two wires traveling to the circuit board much like between a DC motor and ESC. Attached to the board are wires for motor power and again three wires going to the arduino, the same three wires mentioned above. 

The arduino sends pulses to the [[wikipedia:Servo_control|servo motor]] much like sending them to an ESC. The pulses have a different meaning. The pulses describe a spot to go to. Within the servo there is a feedback mechanism that counts shadows or turns a variable resistor. The servo circuit board then moves the servo to that spot. It knows when it has reached the spot when a certain number of shadows have past or when the resistance reaches a certain value. The arduino has to keep sending the same position over and over again to hold the motor in a current spot. Short pulses go one direction, long pulses the opposite direction, medium pulse widths go to the middle. Middle is typically 1.5 milli seconds. 

Identical model motors vary, so each needs to be calibrated by banging against some edge ... think of the banging noise when an inkjet printer is turned on.

Servo motors are good for robot wheels that have to turn a certain distance then stop. They are good for robots that have to balance themselves somehow. Auto pilots can use these to navigate a hallway. They are not good for spinning propellers like brushed dc motors and brushless motors.

===Brushless Motors===
3 wires. Brushless motors are more expensive than dc brushed motors. Lots of PC fans are brushless motors. The motor that drives the paper path in laser printers is brushless. 

They are build differently than servo or brushed motors. There are no places where metal is rubbing against metal. Brushless motors will last longer, spin faster, help batteries last longer. They have three wires instead of two. There are two types: inrunner and outrunner. 
[[File:Inrunner.jpg|thumb|Inrunner brushless motor attached to ESC and gears on a D.R. Parrot Quadcopter]]
====Inrunner====
Brushless inrunners are very similar from the outside to a brushed DC motor in terms of size. They are usually mounted on a circuit board like a servo motor with a gear box. They spin very fast and have to be geared down like a brushed dc motor. They are different than a brushed dc motor in that they are stronger, more efficient and last longer. They can be matched to a wider variety of propellers or loads by adjusting the gearing. 

The five wires coming off the circuit board are the same as those coming off the ESC attached to the brushed dc motor and the servo motor circuit board (2 for power in and 3 go to the arduino). The pulses mean the same as the brushless dc motor. The only difference is that at maximum RPM, there are still pulses. There is not one long pulse like the brushed dc motor. The only physical difference is that there are three wires into the motor (you may not be able to see them when it is mounted on a circuit board.) 

[[File:Outrunner.jpg|left|thumb|Outrunner brushless motor purchased]]

====Outrunner====
[[File:LaserPrinterMotor.jpg|thumb|right|Outrunner brushless motor from paper path of laser printer]]
The outrunner is already the standard motor in laser printers, copy machines, fax machines, scanners, blue ray players, cd players, where a very precise, constant speed is needed. It is also found in model helicopters, RC airplanes and other variable speed applications where there are light weight requirements. It is totally different than all other motors. It appears to be falling apart like a vacuum cleaner motor. You don't need to tear these apart. Look at these [[Commons:Category:Brushless_DC_electric_motors|wikicommons pictures]].  
[[File:cdPlayerMotor2.jpg|thumb|left|top view of cd motor]]

Taking apart a CD player and finding the motor is fairly easy. 
[[File:cdPlayerMotor3.jpg|thumb|right|bottom of cd motor]]

Start by turning it upside down and removing the screws holding the bottom plate on.
[[File:cdPlayerMotor4.jpg|thumb|left|bottom plate and screws of cd motor]]

The screws and plate reveal a retaining ring that pops off easily with knife or screw driver.
[[File:cdPlayerMotor6.jpg|thumb|right|spinning assembly of cd motor]]

After the retaining ring is removed, the entire assembly that spins can be removed. There may be some resistance that feels like removing magnets from each other.
[[File:cdPlayerMotor7.jpg|thumb|left|close up of coils and hall effect probes]]

Underneath the cup of all outrunner brushless motors is a series of coils. On some motors, between the coils, are hall effect probes. Hall effect probes detect the spinning magnetic field and provide a pulse out of the brushless motors to the electronics. From this pulse the electronics can precisely control the speed of the motor. Variable speed motors don't necessary have the [[wikipedia:Hall_effect_sensor|hall effect probes]]. The electronics in the ESC pulses the motor to tell it's initial direction and some other feed back system (humans using [[wikipedia:Radio_control|RC]] or an autopilot reading [[wikipedia:Accelerometer|accelerometers]] or [[wikipedia:Gyroscope|gyros]] adjusts the speed). 

Parts of the motor are often attached to a circuit board. Magnets are attached on the inside of the can that spins with the shaft .. sort of like a spinning umbrella.

All brushless motors have a spinning umbrella. Inside the umbrella is a permanent magnet. It looks like one continuous round magnet. However it is more like [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9CPX3EJoN4&amp;feature=player_embedded#! series] of magnets.

Brushless outrunners are always built on a circuit board. This makes them cheaper. The circuit board for this CD motor has no electronics on it. A ribbon cable attaches 11 wires to another controller circuit board. But often the controller is built onto the same circuit board. The circuit boards interface with a controller in two ways. Fixed speed motors have a cable that contains power, inputs (motor on, motor half speed) and an output pulse related to the motors motion. 

Variable speed motors typically have no circuitry directly associated with the motor. Instead there are typically three wires coming out that attach to an &quot;Electronic Speed Controller.&quot; 
[[File:Esc2.jpg|thumb|3 wire electronic speed controller (ESC) for brushless motors]]

====ESC====
Outrunners and inrunners both use the same ESC's. This ESC is different than that of the brushed DC motor. There are three wires going to the motor instead of two. The wiring between the ESC and the Arduino consists if the same 5 wires. The three wires give the brushless motors more pulling power. Understanding this helps understand stepper motors below.

The two wires of the brushed dc motor can be thought of as forward and reverse. The three wires of brushless can be thought of as 1, 2 and 3. Going forward would be this sequence 1-2, 2-3, 3-1, 1-2, etc. Going backwards would be 1-3, 3-2, 2-1, 1-3, etc. What this means is that one third of the motor is helping maintain momentum while another third is pulling the motor in a new direction.

[[File:Motorshield.jpg|thumb|left|motor shield]]
===Stepper Motors===
[[wikipedia:Stepper motor|Stepper motors]] are like a servo motor in that they move to a spot and hold their position. But they can also spin like a DC and Brushless Motor. They can not hold their position as strongly as a servo motor, and they can not spin as fast as a brushed or brushless motor. 

They are not controlled through a circuit board or ESC. They have to be connected to the arduino through a motor shield or custom built circuit. They are typically the most expensive.

Stepper motors can have 4, 5, 6, or 8 wires. To use them with the arduino, understanding the internal wiring is absolutely necessary.

The best way to learn the internal wiring is to assume no manual exists, and [http://www.piclist.com/techref/io/stepper/wires.htm &quot;discover&quot; the internal wiring].

      <text xml:space="preserve">I had no idea that cooking a duck was any different than cooking chicken other than duck has more fat.  When I started to look up recipes I was shocked to learn that it took 4 or more hours to cook.  
I have a vertical roaster, and thought that would be the perfect to cook a duck.  I was, however, concerned that cooking for 4+ hours was going to leave me with a dry bird!  
I followed the recipe for the vertical roaster and it turned out perfect.  The only change I will try next duck is scoring a diamond pattern into the duck skin on the breast.  I'll also start cooking a few hours earlier!

      <text xml:space="preserve">Clayton, Edward W. &quot;The Audience for Aristotle's Rhetoric.&quot; ''Rhetorica'' 22 (2004): 183-203.

Edward Clayton attempts to make a claim of single, unified audience for Aristotle’s ''Rhetoric''. Clayton’s article assesses the “four main claims concerning the audience Aristotle intended to receive the Rhetoric” (203). He examines the support for Rhetoric being directed toward Athenian legislators, the Athenian public (or an “elite subset of the public” (183)), Aristotle’s own students, or a variety of audiences (based on the hypothesis that Rhetoric was not written as a unified work).

Calling on statements in ''Rhetoric, Ethics and Politics'', as well as historical data, Clayton asserts that he can disprove three theories of audience and concludes that the most likely audience is Aristotle’s students. This inference is based a great deal on challenging the support provided by scholars for the other three audiences. Clayton points out that Aristotle held a seemingly negative view of Athenian legislators and public (intellectually) and held a clear notion of an ideal city (which he felt Athens was not), thus disproving the idea that Aristotle would be writing to these groups. Similarly, Clayton finds the historical data supporting Rhetoric being written at a variety of times for a variety of audiences spotty and inconclusive. Ultimately, Clayton concludes that the most likely audience of ''Rhetoric'' was the students under Aristotle’s guidance, as they would have been the most capable of following “Aristotle’s methods and conceptual language” (200).

      <text xml:space="preserve">A possible downside with competing within a market is the idea of forking. Because the firm will be competing for market shares within a standard, competition focus will change from features to price, but there is always the attempt to further the standard by competing on proprietary standards . In an attempt to improve a product, there is the possibility of &quot;forking&quot; the standard. Forking the standard is a phrase used to describe the division of a network into two (or more) parallel networks. If firm furthers features too much in a network, the effect can be a competition for the market, basically destroying the standard and greatly decrease network externalities. An example of a firm splintering the market is Unix. &quot;Several hardware vendors including IBM, Sun, HP, Silicon-Graphics, and Novell, in a desire to differentiate their product, to add value, and to make improvements created their own flavors of Unix&quot; &lt;ref name=InformationRules&gt;{{cite book|last=Shapiro|first=Carl|authorlink=Carl Shapiro||coauthors=Hal R. Varian|title=Information Rules|year=1999|publisher=Harvard Business School Press|location=Boston, MA|}}&lt;/ref&gt;. These companies did not want to wait for a formal standard to be set and instead essentially divided the market for computers. Another such case involves Microsoft when they created Java Virtual Machine. The effect was,&quot;to splinter the Java market by building a Java Virtual Machine tailored specifically to Windows. Applications written to it would run only on Windows&quot;&lt;ref name=Java&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.cnet.com/Jinxed-by-Java/2009-1001_3-218429.html |title=Jinxed by Java |author=CNET News |date=2 December 1998|publisher=CNET News |accessdate=2 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;. &quot;The company then designed a Java tool, Visual J++, with special extensions that favored designs for Windows&quot;&lt;ref name=Java&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;. Microsoft created software that was designed to work on their own systems, not the standard which leads to forking. A example of a market that may splinter soon is the market for the smartphone the Android.&lt;ref name=Android&gt;{{cite web |url=http://techcrunch.com/2009/10/11/a-chink-in-androids-armor/ |title=A Chink in Android's Armor |author=Michael Arrington |date=11 October 2009 |publisher=TechCrunch.com |accessdate=2 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Many users are running many different versions of Anroid, causing many bugs and lags in the software. Equipment compatibility as well as problems downloading 3rd party software is frustrating many users and developers all due to the forking of the market.

In [[w:software engineering|software engineering]], a '''project fork'''  happens when developers take a [[w:legal|legal]] copy of [[w:source code|source code]] from one [[w:Computer software|software package]] and start independent development on it, creating a distinct piece of software.

[[w:Free and open source software|Free and open source software]] is that which, by definition, may be forked from the original development team without prior permission without violating any [[w:copyright|copyright]] law. However, licensed forks of proprietary software (''e.g.'' [[w:Unix|Unix]]) also happen.

==Forking free and open source software==
Free and open source software may be legally forked without the approval of those currently managing a software project or distributing the software, per the definitions of &quot;[[w:free software|free software]]&quot; copyright license (&quot;Freedom 3: The freedom to improve the program, and release your improvements to the public, so that the whole community benefits&quot;) and &quot;[[w:Open Source Definition|open source]]&quot; (&quot;3. Derived Works: redistribution of modifications must be allowed. (To allow legal sharing and to permit new features or repairs.)&quot;).

In free software, forks often result from a schism over different goals or personality clashes. In a fork, both parties assume nearly identical code bases but typically only the larger group, or whoever controls the web site, will retain the full original name and the associated user community. Thus there is a reputation penalty associated with forking. The relationship between the different teams can be cordial or very bitter.

Forks are considered an expression of the freedom made available by free and open source software, but a weakness since they duplicate development efforts and can confuse users over which forked package to use. Developers have the option to collaborate and pool resources with free and open source software software, but it is not ensured by [[w:free software licenses|free software licenses]], only by a commitment to cooperation.

Eric Raymond, in his seminal essay ''[[w:The Cathedral and the Bazaar|The Cathedral and the Bazaar]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/homesteading/ar01s03.html|title=Promiscuous Theory, Puritan Practice|date=Last-Modified: Thu, 15 Aug 2002|author=[[w:Eric S. Raymond]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; stated in 1997 that &quot;The most important characteristic of a fork is that it spawns competing projects that cannot later exchange code, splitting the potential developer community&quot;.

In some cases, a fork can merge back into the original project or replace it. [[w:EGCS|EGCS]] (the Experimental/Enhanced GNU Compiler System) was a fork from [[w:GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] which proved more vital than the original project and was eventually &quot;blessed&quot; as the official GCC project. Some have attempted to invoke this effect deliberately, ''e.g.'', [[w:Mozilla Firefox|Mozilla Firefox]] started as an unofficial project within [[w:Mozilla|Mozilla]] that soon replaced the [[w:Mozilla Suite|Mozilla Suite]] as the focus of development.

On the matter of forking, the [[w:Jargon File|Jargon File]] says:
:Forking is considered a Bad Thing&amp;mdash;not merely because it implies a lot of wasted effort in the future, but because forks tend to be accompanied by a great deal of strife and acrimony between the successor groups over issues of legitimacy, succession, and design direction. There is serious social pressure against forking. As a result, major forks (such as the [[w:GNU Emacs|Gnu-Emacs]]/[[w:XEmacs|XEmacs]] split, the fissioning of the [[w:386BSD|386BSD]] group into three daughter projects, and the short-lived GCC/EGCS split) are rare enough that they are remembered individually in hacker folklore.

It is easy to declare a fork, but can require considerable effort to continue independent development and support. As such, forks without adequate resources can soon become inactive, ''e.g.'', GoneME, a fork of [[w:GNOME|GNOME]] by a former developer, which was soon discontinued despite attracting some publicity. Some well-known forks have enjoyed great success, however, such as the [[w:X.Org Server|X.Org]] [[w:X Window System|X11]] server, a fork from [[w:XFree86|XFree86]] which gained widespread support from developers and users and notably sped up X development.

More recently, the use of [[w:distributed revision control|distributed revision control]] (DVCS) tools has made the term 'fork' less emotive. With a DVCS such as [[w:Mercurial|Mercurial]] or [[w:Git (software)|Git]], the normal way to contribute to a project is to first 'fork' the repository, and later seek to have your changes integrated with the main repository. These tools have been designed to make creating, maintaining and merging branches (internal forks) much easier than with a centralised [[w:Revision_control|VCS]], and in so doing they eliminate the difference between a branch and a fork from the point of view of the VCS tool. In addition, sites such as [[w:Github|Github]], [[w:Bitbucket|Bitbucket]] and [[w:Launchpad_(website)|Launchpad]] provide free DVCS hosting with very easy-to-use support for this kind of forking, so that the technical, social and financial barriers to forking a source code repository are massively reduced. While forking the community necessarily remains costly and painful, having many competing forks of the source code has become a more natural and accepted part of the development process.

Usually, forks restart from version 0.1 or 1.0 even if the original software was at version 3.0, 4.0, or 5.0.  An exception is when the forked software is designed to be a drop-in replacement of the original project, in which case, for example, forked version 5.2 is compatible with version 5.2 of the original software (as it happens in the case of [[w:MariaDB|MariaDB]] and [[w:MySQL|MySQL]] as of 2011).&lt;ref&gt;http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/31551/forked-a-project-where-do-my-version-numbers-start&lt;/ref&gt;

==Forking proprietary software==

In [[w:proprietary software|proprietary software]], the copyright is usually held by the employing entity, not by the individual software developers.  Proprietary code is thus more commonly forked when the owner needs to develop two or more versions, such as a [[w:Window (computing)|windowed]] version and a [[w:command line interface|command line]] version, or versions for differing operating systems, such as a [[w:wordprocessor|wordprocessor]] for [[w:IBM PC|IBM PC]] compatible machines and [[w:Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]] computers. Generally, such internal forks will concentrate on having the same look, feel, data format, and behavior between platforms so that a user familiar with one can also be productive or share documents generated on the other. This is almost always an economic decision to generate a greater [[w:market share|market share]] and thus pay back the associated extra development costs created by the fork.

A notable proprietary fork not of this kind is the many varieties of proprietary [[w:Unix|Unix]] &amp;mdash; all derived from AT&amp;T Unix and all called &quot;Unix&quot;, but increasingly mutually incompatible.&lt;!-- see the see-also for the reference for this --&gt; ''See'' [[w:UNIX wars|UNIX wars]].

The [[w:BSD licenses|BSD licenses]] permit forks to become proprietary software, and some say that commercial incentives thus make proprietisation almost inevitable. Examples include [[w:Mac OS X|Mac OS X]] (based on [[w:Nextstep|Nextstep]] and thus [[w:BSD|BSD]]), [[w:Cedega (software)|Cedega]] and [[w:CrossOver|CrossOver]] (proprietary forks of [[w:Wine (software)|Wine]], though CrossOver tracks Wine and contributes considerably),
[http://www.enterprisedb.com EnterpriseDB] (a fork of [[w:PostgreSQL|PostgreSQL]], adding Oracle compatibility features), [http://web.archive.org/web/20060819022355/http://www.fastware.com.au/docs/FujitsuSupportedPostreSQLWhitePaperV1_02.pdf Fujitsu Supported PostgreSQL] 
with their proprietary ESM storage system, and [http://www.netezza.com/media/2004/Weblog.htm Netezza]'s proprietary highly scalable derivative of PostgreSQL. Some of these vendors contribute back changes to the community project, while some keep their changes as their own competitive advantages.

==Other notable forks==
[[File:Linux_Distribution_Timeline.svg|thumb|A timeline chart of how Linux distributions forked.]]

*Most [[w:Linux distribution|Linux distribution]]s are descended from other distributions, most being traceable back to [[w:Debian|Debian]], [[w:Red Hat Linux|Red Hat|]] or [[w:Slackware|Slackware]]. Since most of the content of a distribution is free and open source software, ideas and software interchange freely as is useful to the individual distribution. Merges (''e.g.'', [[w:United Linux|United Linux]] or [[w:Mandriva|Mandriva]]) are rare.
*[[w:Pretty Good Privacy|Pretty Good Privacy]] was forked outside of the United States&lt;!-- see that article for ref--&gt; to free it from restrictive US laws on the [[w:export of cryptography|exportation of cryptographic software|]].
*The game ''[[w:NetHack|NetHack]]'' has spawned a number of variants using the original code, notably ''[[w:Slash'EM|Slash'EM]]'', and was itself a fork of ''[[w:Hack (Unix video game)|Hack|]]''.
*[[w:OpenBSD|OpenBSD]] was a fork of [[w:NetBSD|NetBSD]] 1.0 by [[w:Theo de Raadt|Theo de Raadt]]
*[[w:OpenSSH|OpenSSH]] was a fork from [[w:Secure Shell|SSH]], which happened because the license for SSH 2.x was non-[[w:free software|free]] (even though the source was available), so an older version of SSH 1.x, the last to have been licensed as [[w:free software|free software]], was forked. Within months, virtually all Linux distributions, BSD versions and even some proprietary Unixes had replaced SSH with OpenSSH.
*[[w:XOrg|XOrg]] forked from [[w:XFree86|XFree86]] in 2004, due to the latter's change to a license many distributors found unacceptable.
*[[w:DragonFly BSD|DragonFly BSD]] was forked from [[w:FreeBSD|FreeBSD]] 4.8 by long-time FreeBSD developer [[w:Matt Dillon (computer scientist)|Matt Dillon]], due to disagreement over FreeBSD 5's technical direction.
*[[w:Adempiere|Adempiere]] is a community maintained fork of [[w:Compiere|Compiere]] 2.5.3b, due to disagreement with commercial and technical direction of Compiere Inc.
*[[w:NeoOffice|NeoOffice]] is a fork of [[w:OpenOffice.org|OpenOffice.org]], with an incompatible license (GPL rather than LGPL), due to disagreements about licensing and about the best method to [[w:porting|port]] OpenOffice.org to [[w:Mac OS X|Mac OS X]].
*[[w:Joomla!|Joomla!]] is a fork of [[w:mambo (software)|Mambo]].
*The [[w:Inkscape|Inkscape]] vector-graphics program started as a fork of [[w:Sodipodi|Sodipodi]].
*[[w:Xvid|Xvid]] was a fork of Open[[w:DivX|DivX]].
*[[w:Boxee|Boxee]] and [[w:Plex (software)|Plex]] media player software's was both forked from [[w:XBMC|XBMC]] media center.
*[[w:Oracle Corporation|Oracle]]'s purchase of [[w:Sun Microsystems|Sun Microsystems]] soon resulted in the forking of [[w:LibreOffice|LibreOffice]] from OpenOffice.org, and [[w:MariaDB|MariaDB]] from [[w:MySQL|MySQL]], due to concerns about Oracle's commitment to open-source development.

'''Slideshow''' allows you to have an interactive slideshow on a page. You can click the left and right buttons to move to the previous and next slide. [[MediaWiki:Common.js/Slideshows.js]] and [[MediaWiki:Common.css/Slideshows.css]] are required for this to work.

== Usage ==
&lt;pre style=&quot;border:0px; background-color:transparent;&quot;&gt;
{{slideshow
| frame style = CSS to use (optional)
| slides style = CSS to use (optional)
| slide 1 =
....
| slide 15 =
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

slide 1 through slide 15 are what to show for each slide.

== Example ==

{{slideshow
| frame style = width:550px;
| slides style = padding:25px; background-color:#ccffcc;
| slide 1 = [[File:Wikiversity-banner.jpg|500px|link=]]
| slide 2 = [[File:Wikiversity Banner Fachbereich_Geschichte (2).png|500px|link=]]
| slide 3 = [[File:File-Banner Year of Astronomy TvJ 1 1600x440.png|500px|link=]]

Define the terms bit, nibble, byte

== A bit ==
If we only have one wire (or other piece of data storage), it can be on or off.  So we could only store a very small piece of information, such as if one thing were true (on) or false (off). This is called a bit.  
== A nibble ==
Usually we want to store more than true or false.  It could be anything, but let's start simply with trying to store a moderate size number. If we had four bits together we could store 16 numbers (0 to 15).  
=== Exercise === 
Check that you understand why four bits lets you store 16 different numbers, by writing out every possibility.  The start and end of the table to do it is here:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|+ Figure 1 - Table for a nibble
|-
! Eights !! Fours !! Twos !! Ones !! Equals
|-
| 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0
|-
| 0 || 0 || 0 || 1 || 1
|-
| 0 || 0 || 1 || 0 || 2
|-
| ... || ... || ... || ... || ...
|-
| 1 || 1 || 1 || 1 || 15
|}

== A byte ==
A nibble isn't a very useful amount.  The main size up from a bit that people usually talk about is a byte, which is normally made up of 8 bits.  If we had eight bits we could store 256 numbers (0 to 255).

=== Exercise === 
Check that you understand why eight bits lets you store 256 different numbers, by writing out the first ten numbers (0 to 9) and the last ten numbers (246 to 255).

=== ASCII Table ===
Let's look at trying to store a single letter.  It's not as simple as 26 letters - we might need capitals or lower case, plus there are punctuation marks etc.  The table below shows some of the characters available.  If you look at the column headed Glyph it shows what letter or symbol it is.  The Binary column tells you the binary equivalent.  Again, think why we care about binary.  A capital letter A, which has the binary 1000001 (65 in Base 10) means that, if this is being transmitted round a computer wires 1 and 7 have a voltage and the others don't.

==== ASCII - more detail ====
You may wonder why the table above starts at 32 and not 0.  The answer is that codes 0 to 31 are used for other things that aren't letters, such as a backspace or a new line character.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Some comments about this tutorial.

* Use vec3 for colors in the material, since the alpha component does not make sense here, and it saves some casts to vec3 later on.

* As a physicist, I really don't like the contents of struct lightSource. Physically, light has just one color, which is neither &quot;diffuse&quot; or &quot;specular&quot; or whatever. And even then using the word &quot;intensity&quot; instead of &quot;color&quot; is more accurate. Physical point light sources always have quadratic attenuation. Of course, for a far away point source, you can simplify things using a constant attenuation. Linear attenuation only happens if you have a line source instead of a point source (think fluorescent tubes in an office), but then you need more than just a position vector to specify the direction of the line. It is also unrealistic for a light source to have a combination of constant, linear and quadratic attenuation. So I suggest:
** Dropping linear attenuation from this tutorial.
** Changing vec4 lightSource.diffuse to vec3 lightSource.intensity.
** Using values bigger than 1 for some intensity components to make it clear this is not something that needs to be in the [0, 1] range.
** Drop the attenuation variables completely. Use only fully constant or fully quadratic attenuation based on position.w.

* I would not make light0.spotCutoff &lt; 90.0 a special case. If you set spotCutoff to 180 anyway for non-spot lights then the code still works as expected. I would not worry too much about performance, an if statement itself is pretty costly.

: Thanks for your comments!
: Much of this tutorial decisions (naming and light model) are based on the Blender and Unity versions, which themselves are based on the OpenGL 1.x fixed Phong (non-realistic) lighting.  Actually the serials of tutorials reimplements the OpenGL 1.x classic lighting.  Later tutorials goes beyond that model.
: Using a value bigger than 1 is a good idea :) [[User:Beuc|Beuc]] ([[User talk:Beuc|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Beuc|contribs]]) 21:30, 14 September 2011 (UTC)

What does the &quot;mesh.object2world&quot; represent? What is the purpose of the m_3x3_inv_transp?
:m_3x3_inv_transp in particular confuses me, as it is not explained at all.  How am I supposed to compute it?


Should &quot;One Directional&quot; light source be changed to &quot;Unidirectional&quot; or &quot;Omnidirectional&quot;?  It's confusing because a spot light has a direction. What's the difference between this &quot;one directional&quot; source and a &quot;point&quot; light source?</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">In many cases we say that binary is shown by whether a wire (or other electrical signal) is on or off.  You should understand that this is not literally true.  What a computer is really detecting is whether the signal is high or low voltage.  Sometimes you will see things referring to this high or low voltage instead of on or off.  It is exactly the same idea, just explained slightly differently.

We also talk about a current in a wire.  This is often absolutely what is happening, but you need to understand that the wire is not like a normal wire you'd see attached to something: it is absolutely tiny, etched inside a chip.  The widths are constantly getting narrower, but are measured in nanometers, where one nanometer is one billionth of a metre.  These wires are far too small to be seen with a microsocope.

= Introduction =
A major part of a processor's job is making decisions and comparing values.  It does this by what is called a logic gate: it takes (usually) two values, and outputs a value as a result.
[[File:LogicGatesWorking.png|right|An AND and an OR logic gate]]
= Types of Logic Gate =

== OR Gate ==

An OR gate takes two inputs.  If either of them is on (has a high voltage) then the gate outputs a high voltage.  Otherwise it outputs a low voltage.

== AND Gate ==
 
An AND gate takes two inputs.  If BOTH of them are on (has a high voltage) then the gate outputs a high voltage.  Otherwise it outputs a low voltage.

= Example =
In the diagram the AND gate outputs a low voltage (the light is off) because it needs BOTH values to be on.  The OR gate outputs a high voltage (the light is on) because at least one input is on. 

This diagram was made using the page at http://logic.ly/demo/ which gives you a chance to create your own combination.  Go to that site and reproduce the diagram above.  After you have done that change the inputs until you understand what causes the lights to go on and off.  Make sure that you have tested all of these possibilities: 
* both inputs on, 
* both inputs off, 
* first on, second off, 
* first off, second on

In the last lesson, you learned that electrons and, in fact, all objects with mass, have wavelike properties. It might be tempting to visualize matter waves as being just like ocean waves, or waves in a puddle, but it turns out that matter waves are special. Unlike ocean waves or puddle waves, matter waves are &quot;trapped&quot; in space and, as a result, can never die out, escape, or disappear. If you think carefully, you'll realize that this isn't true of most other waves with which you are familiar. You can form waves in a puddle by stirring the puddle with a stick. When you do, what you'll notice is that the waves you create actually move from your stick out to the edge of the puddle, where they disappear. As long as you disturb the puddle with your stick, the puddle will have waves in it. But as soon as you leave the puddle alone, the surface of the puddle will become as calm as glass. Matter waves aren't like that. Unlike puddle waves, which eventually die out as they escape from the puddle, matter waves never do, because matter waves ''don't move''. As a result, they are ''forever'' trapped in the matter that holds them. We'll talk more about these special matter waves in the next section.

==Lesson Objectives==
* Distinguish between traveling and standing waves.
* Explain why electrons form standing waves, and what this means in terms of their energies.
* Define an electron wave function and electron density and relate these terms to the probability of finding an electron at any point in space.

==An Electron is Described as a Standing Wave==
Most of the waves that you're probably familiar with are known as ''traveling'' waves, because they ''travel'' or ''move''. When you're sitting on your surfboard, trying to catch a good wave, you'll often look out to sea in the hopes of spotting a &quot;big one&quot; (Figure 6.3). When you finally do, you know that even though the big wave may be quite a distance off, it will eventually arrive at your surfboard and carry you in to shore. This, of course, implies that ocean waves are ''traveling waves'' because they actually ''move'' through the water. Similarly, if you're in the stands watching the Oakland As play ball, you might find yourself jumping up and cheering as &quot;the wave&quot; passes through the stadium (Figure 6.4). Again, this is an example of a ''traveling wave'', because it ''moves'' from fans at one end of the stadium to fans
at the other. There are, however, special waves that stay in one spot. Scientists call these waves ''standing waves''.

[[File:Surfer above the wave.jpg|500px|thumb|center|'''Figure 6.3''': When you're surfing, you wait for a good wave. Surfing is possible because ocean waves are traveling waves. In other words, ocean waves actually move through the water.]]
[[File:Confed-Cup 2005 - Laolawelle.JPG|500px|thumb|center|'''Figure 6.4''': Some fans getting ready for &quot;the wave&quot; as it passes through the stadium.]]

In an earlier part of this text, a wave was described in which a rope was tied to a tree and a person jerked the other end of the rope up and down to create a wave in the rope. When a wave travels down a rope and encounters an immoveable boundary (like a tree), the wave reflects off the boundary and travels back up the rope. This causes interference to occur between the wave traveling toward the tree and the reflected wave traveling back toward the person. If the person adjusts the rhythm of their hand just right, they can arrange for the crests and troughs of the wave moving toward the tree to exactly coincide with the crests and troughs of the reflected wave. When this occurs, the apparent horizontal motion of the wave ceases and the wave appears to &quot;stand&quot; in the same place in the rope. This is called a '''standing wave'''. In such a case, the crests and troughs will remain in the same places and nodes will appear between the crests and troughs where the rope does not appear to move at all.

In the standing wave shown in Figure 6.5, the positions of the crests and troughs remain in the same positions. The crests and troughs appear to exchange places above and below the center line of the rope. The flat places where the rope crosses the center axis line are called nodes (positions of zero displacement). These nodal positions do not change. ''Traveling waves appear to travel, and standing waves appear to stand still''.

[[File:Standing wave in a rope.png|500px|thumb|center|'''Figure 6.5''': Standing wave in a rope.]]

Even though standing waves don't move themselves, they are actually composed of traveling waves that ''do''. Standing waves form when two traveling waves traveling in opposite directions at the same speed combine or run into each other. In today's lab, you'll learn how to create standing waves in a jump rope by feeding traveling waves into the jump rope from opposite directions. Even though a standing wave doesn't move, it can still &quot;die out&quot;. As soon as the traveling waves that form a standing wave disappear, so does the standing wave itself. You'll see this first hand in the jump rope experiment. When you stop flicking the jump rope, the jump rope slackens and the standing waves are gone.

Why, then, are standing waves often associated with &quot;trapped&quot; waves, or waves that never die out? The connection between standing waves and trapped waves isn't a misconception or a misunderstanding. It turns out that standing waves almost always form when traveling waves are &quot;trapped&quot; in a small region of space. Imagine what would happen if you took a whole train of traveling waves, locked them up and threw them into jail. Those traveling waves would probably go crazy running around the jail cell trying to escape. No matter how hard they tried, though, they'd always end up hitting the jail cell walls. As a result, the
poor waves would bounce back and forth and back and forth from one end of the jail cell to the other. Now, if there were several traveling waves trapped in the same jail cell at the same time, one set of waves would end up bouncing off of the left wall, at the same time (and speed) as another set of waves was bouncing off of the right wall. This, of course, is exactly what's required to set up a &quot;standing wave&quot; (two waves traveling in opposite directions at the same speed).

The electron waves that you learned about in the last lesson form standing waves as a result of being trapped inside the atom. What do you think might imprison an electron wave inside an atom? The answer, of course, is that electrons are trapped because they are strongly attracted to the protons in the nucleus. Using the laws of physics to describe the forces of attraction between electrons and protons, scientists can figure out the size and shape of any electron's jail cell. Amazingly, by knowing the size and shape of an electron's jail cell, scientists can tell you what a particular electron standing wave will look like.

Frequently, rather than using words to describe an electron standing wave, scientists use what's known as an '''electron wave function'''. Wave functions for electrons, first developed by a man named Erwin Schrödinger, are mathematical expressions that describe the magnitude or &quot;height&quot; of an electron standing wave at every point in space. Now, let's discuss electron energy, which is another important electron property that can be explained and predicted by electron standing waves and their associated wave functions.

==Each Wave Function has an Allowed Energy Value==
Electrons form standing waves whenever they're trapped inside an atom, and thus in order to understand and predict electron behavior, it's important to understand electron standing waves. One of the most important properties that electron standing waves can help to predict is electron energy. The energy of an electron in any atom depends on the size and shape of the electron's standing wave when it's trapped inside that atom. As a result, scientists can use the ''wave function'', or the mathematical description of an electron's standing wave, to figure out how much energy that electron has.

While wave functions are helpful in predicting the amount of energy an electron ''has'', they are also helpful in predicting the amount of energy an electron is ''allowed'' to have. In any confined space, like a box, a jail cell, or an atom, only certain standing waves are possible. Why? In order to exist, a standing wave must begin at one side of the box and end at the other. Waves that either don’'t begin where the box begins, or don't end where the box ends aren't allowed. Figure 6.6 shows several ''allowed'' standing waves and several ''forbidden'' standing waves. Notice that if the wave doesn't &quot;fit&quot; perfectly inside the box, it isn't allowed.

[[File:Allowed and forbidden standing waves.png|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 6.6''': The standing waves on the left-hand side of the figure are allowed to form in the brown box, because they fit perfectly inside the box. In contrast, the waves on the right-hand side of the figure cannot form in the brown box because they do not fit perfectly inside the box.]]

Now here's the really strange thing about describing electrons as standing waves. Since only certain standing waves will fit perfectly inside an atom, electrons trapped in that atom can only have certain electron wave functions with certain electron energies. In other words, the standing wave picture accounts for the fact that some energy values are &quot;allowed&quot; (energy values associated with standing waves that &quot;fit&quot; perfectly inside the atom) while others are &quot;forbidden&quot; energy values (energy values associated with standing waves that do not &quot;fit&quot; perfectly inside the atom). That's ''exactly'' what Bohr said when he developed his model to explain atomic spectra! Bohr said that electrons could exist at specific &quot;allowed&quot; energy levels, but that they couldn't exist ''between'' those energy levels. Bohr, however, did not have an explanation for why only certain energy levels were allowed. Remarkably, the standing wave description of electrons predicts ''quantized'' electron energies just like the Bohr model!

When we represent electrons inside an atom, quantum mechanics requires that the wave must &quot;fit&quot; inside the atom so that the wave meets itself with no overlap; that is, the &quot;electron wave&quot; inside the atom must be a standing wave. If the wave is to be arranged in the form of a circle so that it attaches to itself, the waves can only occur if there is a whole number of waves in the circle.

The standing wave on the left in Figure 6.7 exactly fits in the electron cloud and hence represents an &quot;allowed&quot; energy level whereas the standing wave on the right does not fit in the electron cloud and therefore is not an &quot;allowed&quot; energy level. There are only certain energies (frequencies) for which the wavelength fits exactly to form a standing wave. These are the same energy levels the Bohr model suggested but ''now'' there is a reason for why electrons may have ''only'' these energies.

[[File:Standing wave electron cloud.png|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 6.7''': The left-hand standing wave fits in the electron cloud while the right-hand one does not.]]

==Max Born and Probability Patterns==
There are very few scientists, if any, who can visualize the behavior of an electron during chemical bonding or chemical reactions as standing waves. When chemists are asked to describe the behavior of an electron during a chemical change, they do not describe the mathematical equations of quantum mechanics nor do they discuss standing waves. The behavior of electrons in chemical reactions is best understood in terms of a particle.

Erwin Schrödinger's wave equation for matter waves is similar to known equations for other wave motions in nature. The equation describes how a wave associated with an electron varies in space as the electron moves under various forces. Schrödinger worked out the solutions of his equation for the hydrogen atom and the results agreed with the Bohr values for the energy levels of these atoms. Furthermore, the equation could be applied to more complicated atoms. It was found that Schrödinger's equation gave a correct description of an electron's behavior in almost all cases. In spite of the overwhelming success of the wave equation in describing electron energies, the very meaning of the waves was vague.

A physicist named Max Born was able to attach some physical significance to the mathematics of quantum mechanics. Born used data from Schrödinger's equation to show the probability of finding the electron, as a particle, at the point in space for which Schrödinger's equation was solved. Born's ideas allowed chemists to visualize the results of the wave equation as probability patterns for electron positions.

Suppose we had a camera with such a fast shutter speed that it could take a photo of an electron in an electron cloud and show it frozen in position. We could then take a thousand pictures of this electron at different times and find it in many different positions in the atom. We could then plot all the different electron positions on one picture.

Figure 6.8 shows the result of plotting many different positions of a single electron in the electron cloud of a hydrogen atom. One way of looking at this picture is as an indication of the probability of where you are likely to find the electron in this atom. You must recognize, of course, that the dots are not electrons; this atom has only one electron. The dots are positions where the electron can be found at different times. From this picture, it is clear that the electron spends more time near the nucleus than it does far away. As you move away from the nucleus, the probability of finding the electron becomes less and less. It is also important to note that there is no boundary for this electron cloud. That is, there is no distance from the nucleus where the probability becomes zero.

[[File:Single electron probability pattern.png|frame|center|'''Figure 6.8''': The probability pattern for a single electron atom.]]

For much of the work we will be doing with atoms, it is convenient to have a boundary for the atom. Most often, chemists choose some distance from the nucleus beyond which the probability of finding the electron becomes very low and arbitrarily draw in a boundary for the atom. Frequently, the boundary is placed such that 90% or 95% of the probability for finding the electron is inside the boundary (Figure 6.9).

[[File:Artificial boundaries for an atom.svg|400px|thumb|center|'''Figure 6.9''': Artificial boundaries for an atom.]]

Most of the time, we will be looking at drawings of atoms that show an outside boundary for the electron cloud. You should keep in mind, however, that the boundary is there for our convenience and there is no actual boundary on an atom; that is, the probability of finding the electron never becomes zero. This probability plot is very simple because it is for the first electron in an atom. As the atoms become more complicated (more energy levels and more electrons), the probability plots also become more complicated.

==Lesson Summary==
* There are two types of waves – traveling waves that move from one place to another, and standing waves that are stationary. Standing waves are formed when two traveling waves traveling in opposite directions at the same speed combine. Electrons in atoms form standing waves because they are trapped by the attractive forces that exist between their negative charges and the positive charges on the protons in the atom's nucleus. These attractive forces determine the shape and size of the electron's standing wave.
* Mathematical expressions called wave functions are used to describe an electrons standing wave in an atom. The energy of an electron in any atom depends on the size and shape of the electron's standing wave. The wave function can be used to determine the energy of an electron when it is trapped inside an atom.
* Electrons in atoms are only allowed to have certain energy levels (i.e. – those which correspond to standing waves that &quot;fit perfectly&quot; inside the atom). All other electron energies are forbidden. The probability patterns for electrons (electron density) show the probability of finding the electron at a given point.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In today’s modern society Touch Screen are becoming more and more popular since fingers are not always precise enough a digital '''Pen''' was created. The '''Stylus''' is a type of digital, electronic, or tablet pen that can be used with these all types of Touch Screen Devices. It is basically a pen with a round-tip that can interact with the touch screen device. The Stylus is especially useful for devices with very small screens. The Stylus in general makes interacting, and digitally writing with touch screens much easier for the user.  It is often seen used in medical offices with healthcare applications.

Although pen/styluses were ultimately created to facilitate the input process on touch screen devices such as mobile devices, Personal Digital Assistants (PDA’s), Ultra Mobile PC’s (UMPC’S), and slate tablets, its technology has evolved so much that it offers the user many more features. Depending on your computer software capabilities, pen/styluses can be used on your personal computer monitor and also convert anything you hand write into computer text that can ultimately be edited by the user.  It can also provide the option to select certain text, and even alter the size of your content.  Pen/Styluses are being used in cartoon animation, graphic design, and photography editing.

Styluses/Pens are very popular in todays society. Being able to use them for more than cellphone related reasons, making them a must have. Most people may think that the Stylus is mainly used for cellphones, but there main focus was for the Nintendo DS. This Game console allows players to use there stylus to create/play games without a single touch of a button. Stylus are mostly made of plastic with a rubber tip on the end,so the screen is not scratched while using the stylus. Stylus are a great invention, and it will continue to spread across the world.

Good work.
 
As always with any language page of any kind whatsoever, it would be nice to have an audio accompaniment.

Clickable would be nice, as long as the response time was fast.  Nothing is stupider than audio feeds that take three or more seconds of waiting time per click.
 
Failing that, a mere background babble of commentary would be nice: Learning Chinese is ''hard'', and every bit of connected sound is valuable.
====
The beginning of the explanation is, technically, incorrect. The Chinese word for radical is 部首. 偏旁 can refer to any component of a character (the confusion likely comes from the description of radicals as in 人字旁). Furthermore, the explanation about the use of a radical to differentiate words that sound alike is inaccurate. In the example given, the character 东 was borrwedto lend the pronunciation to the new character 冻, the radical providing the meaning element of the character.</text>

      <comment>/* The Uncertainty Principle */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{TOC right}}

If you think back to the last lesson, you'll remember that scientists had a lot of difficulty understanding electron density and the wave function in terms of the wave properties and the particle properties of the electron. Max Born found a way to use the electron wave function to calculate electron density, and that electron density is actually equal to the ''probability'' of finding an electron at any point in space. This, however, leads to the question, why can't scientists predict where the electron will be with ''certainty''. Why can they only predict the ''probability'' of finding an electron at any given point in space? Is there something wrong with the theory? Is it possible to improve the theory so that scientists ''can'' predict exactly where an electron is and where it's going?

==Lesson Objectives==
* Define the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.
* Explain what the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle means in terms of the position and momentum of an electron.
* Explain why the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle helps to justify the fact that a wave function can only predict the probable location of an electron and not its exact location.

==Heisenberg Proposed the Uncertainty Principle for Behavior of Electrons==
===The Uncertainty Principle===
[[File:Heisenberg 10.jpg|200px|thumb|'''Figure 6.10''': Warner Heisenberg.]]

When scientists first suggested that the wave function was related to the ''probability'' of an electron being at a specific point in space, it raised a lot of questions. Most importantly, scientists wondered why the wave function could ''only'' predict the ''probability'' of finding an electron at a given location, and not the ''exact'' location where the electron actually was. Some scientists suggested that the wave function couldn't make exact predictions because it wasn't complete. They believed that the wave function was actually missing information that was necessary to describe electron behavior with &quot;certainty&quot;.

Some early scientists thought that perhaps the wave function could only predict the probability of an electron being at a given location because the wave function was missing information. Many scientists spent time looking for &quot;hidden variables&quot; that controlled electron behavior just like the spin controls the movement of a baseball. The assumption was that if the correct &quot;hidden variables&quot; could be found and included in the wave function, then the exact movement, and the exact location of an electron could be predicted, just as easily as we can predict the movement of larger objects like baseballs, cars and planets.

Everything changed, however, in 1926 when a man named Werner Heisenberg (Figure 6.10) proposed what's known as the '''Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle'''. According to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, it is impossible to measure certain properties, like momentum (speed multiplied by mass) and position at the same time without introducing uncertainty into the measurement. Of course, if you can't make accurate measurements, you can't make accurate predictions either.

What prevents scientists from making accurate predictions about small objects like atoms and electrons? Is it that the machinery used to make the measurements is simply not good enough? Could scientists design better machines and better measurements and ''then'' be able to predict electron behavior with certainty? According to Werner Heisenberg, the answer is &quot;no – when it comes to small objects, scientists will ''never'' be able to make accurate measurements and accurate predictions, no matter how good their machinery is&quot;. If you find that statement strange, you're not alone. Many scientists, even today, are bothered by
the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle – it seems as if, with improved machines, we should be able to make better measurements and thus better predictions! To some extent, that's true. Better machines can help us to make better measurements and better predictions, but according to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, there is a fundamental limit to how much we can know and how accurately we can know it. It's as if there is &quot;something&quot; in the universe which prevents us from being able to make absolutely, one hundred percent accurate measurements and, as a result, we will always be plagued by some uncertainty. For large objects, like baseballs and planets, the uncertainty is just too small to matter, but for tiny things, like atoms and electrons, the uncertainty becomes important.

===Impossible to Fix Both the Position of an Electron and Its Momentum===
The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle actually applies to a lot of different measurements, but often, scientists are concerned with two in particular – position and momentum. You probably know what position means, but momentum is a term that you don't hear a lot in everyday life. Momentum, p, is the quantity that you get when you multiply an object's mass by its speed (to be truly correct momentum is actually mass times velocity, but we won't worry about the difference between speed and velocity).

In terms of the position and momentum, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle is as follows: {{cquote|There is a fundamental limit to just how precisely we can measure both the position and the momentum of a particle at the same time.}}

So how does the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle relate to the electron and all the problems scientists have interpreting the electron wave function? Well, if you think about it logically, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle basically means that it’s impossible to predict ''both'' exactly what the electron will do or exactly where the electron will be found. Suppose, for instance, that you know the electron's precise position, then according to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, you can't know its precise momentum as well. In other words, ''when you know where the electron is, you don’t know where it's going'' (since where it's going is determined by the velocity component of its momentum). Suppose, on the other hand, that you know the electron's precise momentum. According to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, you can't know its precise position as well. In other words, ''when you know where the electron is going, you don't know where it is''.

Obviously, there is always some uncertainty when it comes to electrons. You either don't know where they are, or else you don't know where they're going. As a result, any theory that claimed to predict exactly ''where'' the electron was, or exactly which path it would take as it traveled around inside the atom would go against the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. Luckily, the wave function description ''doesn't'' claim to predict the precise behavior of the electron. Instead, it only makes statements about the probability of finding the electron at one place or another.

In other words, the wave function model is consistent with the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. Moreover, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle suggests that the electron wave function equation is as complete as it can possibly be. It may not entirely predict electron behavior, but that isn’t because the model is wrong, or faulty. It's because, in our universe, there is a limit to how accurately we can actually know what tiny objects like electrons are doing.

===The Problem of Making Very Small Measurements===
When you use a thermometer to measure the temperature of a volume of water, you place the thermometer into the water and leave it there until the water and the thermometer have adjusted to the same temperature. Almost all solids and liquids expand when they are heated and contract when they are cooled. Each substance, however, expands and contracts by different amounts. In the case of the mercury and glass in a thermometer, the mercury expands and contracts faster than the glass and so as a thermometer is heated, the mercury expands faster that the glass tube and the mercury runs up the tube. The glass has been marked (calibrated) for each temperature so that you can read the correct temperature from the markings on the tube. In the process of measuring the temperature of hot water, the thermometer is placed in the water and the thermometer ''absorbs'' heat from the water so that its temperature becomes the same as the water and you can read the temperature of the water from the temperature of the thermometer.

You should see, at least theoretically, that when the thermometer absorbs heat from the water, the water is cooled down; that is, the temperature of the water decreases because of the heat lost to the thermometer. Therefore, the temperature you get when you measure the temperature is not the same temperature of the water that was present before you introduced the thermometer. ''The act of measuring the temperature of the water changed the temperature''. When the volume of the water is reasonably large, the magnitude of the change caused by introducing the thermometer is not significant so we don't bother to
consider it. What about if the volume of the water is very small? If the volume of water is 200 mL and the thermometer absorbs 20 Joules of heat, the introduction of the thermometer might change the temperature of the water by approximately 0.03 °C. Which is certainly not a significant change. But what if the volume of water whose temperature we were measuring was only 2 mL? Introducing the same thermometer into this small volume might change the temperature of the water 3 °C, which would certainly be a significant change. The point is that when we measure very small things, the act of making the measurement may change
what we are observing.

Consider the method that humans use to see objects. We arrange for photons (quanta) of light to strike the object and we see the object by the directions, angles, and colors of the photons that bounce off the object and strike us in the eye or other light measuring instrument. If only red photons bounce back, we say the object is red. If no photons bounce back, we say there is no object present. Suppose for a moment that humans were gigantic stone creatures and we used golf balls to &quot;see&quot; with. That is, we would fire off golf balls at our surroundings and the balls would bounce off objects and come back and enter our eyes so we could see the object. If this were true, we could see mountains successfully and large buildings and trees … but could we see butterflies or small flowers? Obviously, the answer is no. The golf balls would simply knock small objects out of the way and continue on … they would not bounce back to our eyes.

In the case of humans trying to look at electrons, the photons we use to see them with are of significant energy compared to electrons and when the photons collide with the electrons, the motion and/or position of the electron would be changed by the collision. Heisenberg's Uncertainty principle tells us we cannot be sure of both the location of the electron and the motion (path) of an electron at the same time. As a consequence, ''scientists had to give up the idea of knowing the path the electron follows inside an atom''.

==Lesson Summary==
* The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that it is impossible to measure certain pairs of properties like momentum (mass multiplied by velocity) and position at the same time without introducing uncertainty into one or both of the measurements. In other words, it is impossible to know both the exact momentum and the exact position of a particle at the same time.
* The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle suggests that the electron wave function is complete and that it does not predict the exact behavior of an electron because it is actually impossible to do so.
* The uncertainty that Heisenberg spoke of is not due to the failure or inadequacies of the measuring equipment, but rather a fundamental limit imposed by our universe.

ある {{furi|日|ひ}}、 おじいさん が べんとう を {{furi|木|き}} に つるして おいた ら、 ちゅんちゅん すずめ が やって き ました。 

「おや、 うまそうな ごちそう だ こと。」

すずめ は べんとう づつみ の なか に こっそり もぐりこみ ました。 

「やれ、 やれ、 はら が へった。」

おじいさん が しごと を やめ、べんとうづつみ を

とろう と したら、すずめ が ちょっこり くび を

だして ねて い ます。

「よし、 よし、おまえ に も くわせて やる ぞ。」


おじいさん が つつみ を ひらく と どう でしょう。

すずめ は もう べんとう を たらふく たべて ころころ ふとって い ました。


おじいさん は すずめ を いえ に つれて かえり ました。

なんとも かわいい すずめ で ちょんちょん ないちゃ おじいさん の そば を はなれ ません。


おじいさん は この すずめ に おちょん と

いう {{furi|名|な}}まえ を つけて それ は それ は だいじ に

そだて ました。


よい てんき の 日 でした。 おばあさん が いろり で ぐつぐつ のり を にて い ました。

「おじいさん、 はよ しごと に ゆき なされ。」

「でも、 おちょん が かわゆうて......」

おじいさん は おちょん を {{furi|手|て}} に のせ、はなし ません。

「ふん、 すずめ ばっかり かわいがって。」

おばあさん が おこって いい ました。 

そこで おじいさん は しぶしぶ おちょん を はなして 山 へ しごと に でかけ ました。


「おちょん、 ねこ に のり を くわれん よう しっかり ばん を して おれ。」

おばあさん は {{furi|川|かわ}} へ せんたく に いき ました。

のり は いい ぐあい に さめて、 なんとも うまそう。

おちょん は もう がまん できず に のり を たべ ました。


おばあさん が もどって くる と、なべ の なか の のり が ありません。

「おちょん、 のり は どう した。」

「ねこ が くうた よ。」

おばあさん が ねこ の {{furi|口|くち}} を みる と のり が ついて い ません。

ところが おちょん の 口 には のり が いっぱい です。

おちょん は あわてて なめ ました が もう おそい。

「この おんしらず め が。」

おばあさん は おこって おちょん の した を はさみ で ちょんぎり、 そと へ おいだし ました。


おじいさん は おちょん に あいたくて しごと が すむ と いそいで もどって き ました。

ところが おちょん の すがた が あり ません。

「おばあさん、おちょん は どうした。」

「のり を くうた で、した を ちょんぎり おいだして やった だ。」

「なん じゃ と。そんな むごい こと を......」


おじいさん は ぽろぽろ なみだ を こぼし ました。

しばらく しょんぼり して いました が、おちょん の こと を おもう と じっと して い られ ません。

「おら、 おちょん を さがして くる。」


おちょん すずめ は どっち へ いった

したきりすずめ は どっち へ いった

なき そうな こえ で よび ながら おじいさん は とぼとぼ あるいて いき ました。

すると うし あらい が 川 で うし を あらって い ました。

「うし あらい どん、うし あらい どん、したきりすずめ を みなんだ か。」

「みた みた。だ ども、 うし を あろうた {{furi|水|みず}} を {{furi|三|さん}}ばい のまにゃ おしえん ぞ。」

おじいさん は がまん して その 水 を のみ ました。

「そん なら この さき の うま あらい どん に きく が ええ。」


しばらく いく と、うま あらい が 川 で うま を あらって い ました。

「うま あらい どん、うま あらい どん、したきりすずめ を みなんだ か。」

「みた みた。だ ども、 うま を あろうた 水 を 三 ばい のまにゃ おしえん ぞ。」

おじいさん は がまん して その みずを のみ ました。

「そん なら この さき の な あらい どん に きく が ええ。」


また また しばらく いく と、 な あらい が 川 で だいこん を あらって い ました。

「な あらい どん、な あらい どん、したきりすずめ を みなんだ か。」

「みた みた。だども、 だいこん を あろうた 水 を 三 ばい のまにゃ おしえん ぞ。」

おじいさん は がまん して その 水 も のみ ました。

「そん なら この さき の たけやぶ に いく が ええ。」


したきりすずめ はどっち へ いった

おちょん すずめ はどっち へ いった

おじいさん が たけやぶ に はいって いく と、 {{furi|一|いっ}}ぽん の ふとい たけ の あな から すずめ の こえ が し ました。

「おじいさん か、おばあさん か。」

「おじいさん じゃ おじいさん じゃ。」

「そん なら はよう はいり ませ。」

おじいさん が たけ の あな を のぞいた ら、みるみる あたり が くらく なり、 き が とおく なり ました。


はっ と き が つくと、おじいさん は りっぱな ざしき に すわって い ました。

「おじいさん、 よく きて くれ ました。」

きれいな きもの を きた すずめ たち が ごちそう を

はこんで くる やら、うた を うたう やら。おじいさん は

じかん の たつ の も わすれて みとれて い ました。


おじいさん が かえろう と する と、すずめ たち が ふたつ の つづら を もって き ました。

「おじいさん、おみやげ です。おもい つづら と かるい つづら と どっち が ほしい。」

「おら としより だ で かるい ほう が ええ。」


おじいさん が いえ に もどって つづら を あける と どう でしょう。{{furi|大|おお}}ばん {{furi|小|こ}}ばん が ぎっしり。

「あれ まあ、おじいさん、 どこ で もろうた。」

「おら、 すずめ に もろうた。」

おじいさん は おばあさん に きょう の こと を くわしく はなして あげ ました。 その とたん、 おばあさん が いい ました。

「なん ちゅう ばかもん だ。 なんで おもい つづら を もろうて こん。 よし、 おら が いって くる。」


したきりすずめ は どっち へ いった

おちょん すずめ は どっち へ いった

おばあさん が こえ を はりあげる と たけ の あな から すずめ の こえ が し ました。

「おじいさん か おばあさん か。」

「おばあさん じゃ おばあさん じゃ。」

「そん なら はよう はいり ませ。」


き が つく と おばあさん は いつ の ま に やら ざしき に すわって い ました。

すると きもの を きた すずめ たち が かけた ちゃわん でおちゃ を もって きました。

「おら ちゃ など ほしく ない。 はよう つづら を くれ。」

おばあさん は おもい つづら を せおう と、さっさと かえって いき ました。


ところが つづら は おもくて おばあさん は あっち へ ふらふら、こっち へ ふらふら。

やっと たけやぶ を で ました が もう 一ぽ も あるけ ません。

「どれ この へん で ちょっくら やすんで なか を のぞいて みる か。」

おばあさん は つづら を おろし、 そっと ふた を あけ ました。

「ぎゃあ！」


おばあさん は とびあがり ました。なんと つづら の なか から 

へび やら むかで やら が つぎつぎ と でてきて おばあさん を

さし ころして しまい ました。

{{Wikipedia|Hyssop}}
Hyssop is a semi evergreen shrub or &quot;sub-shrub&quot; with aromatic leaves and spikes of blue, two-lipped, late-summer flowers.

==Uses==
The sharp-flavored leaf is added to liqueurs, adds bite to sweet and savory dishes, and aids in the digestion of fatty meat. Once used for purifying temples and cleansing lepers, the leaves contain an antiseptic, antiviral oil. A mold that produces penicillin grows on the leaves. An infusion is taken as sedative expectorant for flu, bronchitis, and phlegm. A leaf poultice treats bruises and wounds. The essential oil is used to treat cold sores, disperse bruises, and heal scars. This oil can be hazardous and should be avoided when epilepsy, high blood pressure, or pregnancy are indicated. Hyssop is added to potpourri and laundry rinses.</text>

Bless my soul! I know it looks strange and incredibly, and probably you will not believe me... but I have finally revealed the secret of the ubiquitous electrical resonance phenomenon! It is interesting that the [[Wikipedia:Negative resistance|negative impedance]] phenomenon has helped me to find out credible intuitive explanations about the impedances of series and parallel LC circuits. I would like first to share my insights with you here; then to compress these lengthy explanations into a few sentences and to place them in the main article...

=== Realizing the LC arrangement ===

The fault of the classic formal approach when explaining the zero and infinite impedance of [[Wikipedia:Talk:Electrical resonance#Why the impedance of a series LC circuit is zero|series]] and [[Wikipedia:Talk:Electrical resonance#Why the impedance of a parallel LC circuit is infinite|parallel]] AC-supplied LC circuits is that it implies two dual impedances (inductive and capacitive) that cancel each other thus giving total zero or infinite LC impedance. But this widespread assertion is misleading...

It is hard for people to imagine how two humble impedances can cancel each other as &quot;impedance&quot; gives an impression of something passive. Two passive &quot;things&quot; shouldn't cancel each other; '''one of them should be active (a source)'''. So, we have to consider an LC circuit as a combination of two elements: a ''source'' (active element) driving a ''load'' (passive element). Depending on the situation, the either element (the inductor or capacitor) can act as a source; meantime, the other element will act as a load. Strictly speaking, both they are sources containing energy (magnetic or electric); but figuratively speaking, the load is a source that is &quot;forced&quot; to act as a load (like a charging accumulator). They can be distinguished by the signs of the current through and the voltage across them - in the source they are different while in the load they are equal.

=== Why the impedance of a series LC circuit is zero ===

[[Image:RLC series circuit.png|thumb|right]]

We have an arrangement consisting of four elements connected in series: an AC input voltage source, a load (a resistor), an inductor and a capacitor. Or, we may combine the input voltage source and the resistor into a real voltage source (with internal resistance).

The main article says: ''&quot;Inductive reactance magnitude''X''&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; increases as frequency increases while [[Wikipedia:reactance (electronics)#Capacitive reactance|capacitive reactance]] magnitude ''X''&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; decreases with the increase in frequency. At a particular frequency these two reactances are equal in magnitude but opposite in sign; so ''X''&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;  and ''X''&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; cancel each other out. The only opposition to a current is coil resistance. Hence in series resonance the current is maximum at resonant frequency&quot;''. Let's now try to comprehend this magic...

According to the considerations about [[Wikipedia:Talk:Electrical resonance#Realizing the LC arrangement|LC arrangement]] above, we can think of the series LC circuit as of an AC source and impedance connected in series. At the resonant frequency, this &quot;source&quot; has the same polarity as the input source; the two AC voltages are in phase with each other so they add together. Let's for concreteness consider the voltage polarities travelling along the loop at both the half waves.

'''Positive input half wave''' (travelling clockwise): -V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;+ (source), +V&lt;sub&gt;LOAD&lt;/sub&gt;- (impedance), -V&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;+ (source), +V&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;- (impedance). The charged inductor acts as a source that &quot;helps&quot; the input source. Note the voltage across the inductor (the source) is equal to the voltage drop across the capacitor (the impedance) so the total voltage across the series LC circuit is zero. Its total impedance is zero and it does not impede the current. Very interesting... as though the inductor acts like a [[Circuit Idea/Revealing the Mystery of Negative Impedance#The basic electrical circuit|negative capacitor]] or like the output part of the op-amp in an inverting integrator that neutralize the capacitor impedance! Well, there is still a subtle difference:) The true negative capacitor and the op-amp use additional external energy (a power supply) for this purpose while this &quot;negative capacitor&quot; draws energy from the input source.

'''Negative input half wave''' (travelling counterclockwise): -V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;+ (source), -V&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;+ (source), +V&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;- (impedance), +V&lt;sub&gt;LOAD&lt;/sub&gt;- (impedance). Now the charged capacitor acts as a source &quot;helping&quot; the input source. The voltage across the capacitor (the source) is equal to the voltage drop across the inductor (the impedance) so the total voltage across the series LC circuit is zero again; its total impedance is zero and it does not impede the current again. Now as though the capacitor acts as a negative inductor that neutralizes the inductor impedance!

We can generalize the two cases by one conclusion: ''An AC supplied series LC circuit consists of two elements connected in series and having equal voltages across them; one of the elements acts as a voltage source while the other acts as impedance.''

It is interesting fact that from this [[Wikipedia:Negative resistance|negative impedance]] viewpoint, both the reactive elements can have negative impedance in this sense. They change alternatively their roles: once the inductor acts as a negative impedance element, then the capacitor does the same and so on, and so forth...

=== Why the impedance of a parallel LC circuit is infinite ===

Now we have a simpler arrangement consisting of two elements: an AC input voltage source driving an LC tank.

The main article says: ''&quot;Let R be the internal resistance of the coil. When X&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; equals X&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;, the reactive branch currents are equal and opposite. Hence they cancel out each other to give minimum current in the main line. Since total current is minimum, in this state the total impedance is maximum.&quot;''

To comprehend this assertion as above, we can now think of the parallel LC circuit as of an AC &quot;helping&quot; source and impedance connected in parallel. At the resonant frequency, the &quot;source&quot; provides all the current needed for charging the impedance to the input voltage; so there is no need the input source to do this donkey work:) The helping &quot;source&quot; as though acts as a [[Circuit Idea/Revealing the Mystery of Negative Impedance#Voltage-driven negative resistor (&quot;neutralizing&quot; a load resistance)|load canceller]] (i.e., as a negative impedance again)! Actually, this arrangement is similar to the exotic [[Wikipedia:Bootstrapping (electronics)|bootstrapping]] technique: a voltage &quot;source&quot; (i.e., the LC tank) is connected in opposite direction to the input voltage source; as a result, the current is almost zero and the impedance is infinite. Of course, there is a subtle difference again:)

Welcome to the Simple Machines family! As part of the family, there are a few things we'd like
you to read and understand . As a new member of the team, we understand you probably don't
have much of a clue what you're expected to be doing, so this guide should help you a bit, if
you're having trouble speak to a peer or a team leader and they will be glad to help you.

==A Brief History of  Simple Machines==
On July 4, 2000, a 17-year-old Dutch high school student named Zef Hemel made his first alpha release of YaBB, a flat-file-based forum written in Perl, under the GPL license. With a few months of Perl under his belt, and no budget, he needed a high-quality alternative to expensive forum software. The YaBB forum community grew quickly at Yabb.com.ru. Zef sometimes implemented user-requested features twice daily.  Several regular contributers soon joined the YaBB core developer team, and developed the first automatic installer for a growing repository of YaBB modifications. 

In 2001 Zef turned management of YaBB over to Jeff Lewis. Later that year, Joseph Fung and Jeff Lewis spent a weeking translating YaBB to PHP, to take advantage of PHP's speed and the MySQL database. YaBB SE would be suitable for larger, more active forums. Once released, YaBB SE grew from 2 to 10,000 members.

Several copyright issues delayed development of YaBB SE 2.0 -- the community and support staff were confused by several unauthorized forks still bearing the YaBB SE. One developer even created a commercial version of the software, under a new name, and without giving credit its developers. During this time, one of the newer developers, &lt;nowiki&gt;[Unknown]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, started a &quot;Secret Project&quot; to optimize, scrap outdated code, and add important features. The team soon adopted this as the basis for the next release. To save forum owners and hosting providers from confusing it with YaBB, they rebranded it as Simple Machines Forum.  Lewis Media took the project under its wing to protect it from license violations, and, with the help of copyright lawyers, the team developed the license used for YaBB SE 1.5.1 and SMF 1.0 and SMF 1.1 versions. The renamed project moved to new servers, and Simple Machines Forum 1.0 was released in 2004.[1]

By 2007, SimpleMachines.org had 100,000 members. After many discussions, the team decided that the project was ready to  stand on its own as a US-registered LLC. Shortly after the founding of Simple Machines LLC, Jeff Lewis took a step back from Simple Machines.&lt;!--

--&gt;{{User:AngelinaBelle/template/Did you know|above=Easter Eggs
|text=Yes, there are Easter Eggs. If you find one, please don’t broadcast it to everyone, as that will
spoil the search for everyone else!}}
By 2009, the SMF team had grown, and there were a growing number of disagreements on issues ranging from the best way to organize the project to the best license for the software.  With significant turnover on the development team, work on SMF 2.0 slowed. In January 2010, heated discussions between former and current team members resulted in a decision to re-organize the project as a non-profit organization (NPO), and to use a BSD license on future versions of the software. Between June 2010 and April 2011, the LLC merged with the NPO and was dissolved. Simple Machines is now a member-run organization, with an elected board of directors as specified in its Bylaws, and the SMF project is a part of the SimpleMachines NPO.

When SMF 2.0 was released in June of 2011, simplemachines.org had over 250,000 members.

==Our Core Values==
The following is a list of precepts and values key to the Simple
Machines team. These beliefs and values are critical to the
ongoing success of the project and should be embodied in everything
we do and every decision we make.

===Free Software===
We will provide our software to the public for free. A full and complete version of any
software title developed by this project will be available to everyone without any cost, be
it monetary or otherwise.
===Respect and Fairness===
We will treat others with consideration, high regard, courtesy and dignity; in a just,
equitable and unbiased manner. We will demonstrate good manners, pay attention and
treat others as we would like to be treated. We will be consistent, listen and be open to
feedback, be careful making judgments about others, and treat people equally and
equitably.
===Development and Growth===
We will support the personal and professional growth of each and every member of the team.
This project was founded by people and for people looking to development their skills as
well as themselves. We will always strive to help and encourage others and to provide 
opportunity for growth, development and learning.

=== Recognition and Credit===
We will recognize the successes and accomplishments of the team and the individuals
who make up this team. We will give credit where credit is due. This applies to
successes, contributions, licenses and rewards.
===Friendly Competition===
We exist in a competitive world, with many other
alternative software titles. We will persevere in this arena
through quality and respect, not through antagonism and
hate. We will support competitors and treat them as we
would have them treat us. We will not insult, disparage or
in any other way teardown other projects, businesses or
organizations.
===Peers and Equals===
Everyone on this team is an equal. We have structure and process because they allow us
to improve communications, responsibility and ability to do what needs to be done -
NOT because it infers power. We will make decisions in a democratic manner, and no
one team member will hold sway over another.
===Volunteers===
Everyone on this team is a volunteer and gives what they can of their free time. They
each give what they want and/or can, but we must accept that life and family come first.
We will be understanding and supportive of each other, and will respect other members
when they take breaks from and/or leave the team.
===Activity===
All team members are registered members of the main community boards. We all strive
to be as active as required to fulfill the duties of our role on the team. There is no required
level of activity on the boards; however, a long unexplained absence is inconsiderate,
causes unnecessary speculation and is cause for replacement.
===Support===
Our reputation is built by our users. Excellent support is fundamental to this reputation.
We will continue to provide support and assistance to the members of the user
community. A product has little value if it is not supported. Ongoing support and ongoing
development are equally important.

===Intellectual Property===
We are contributing our time and efforts to benefit the project. All code, graphics,
algorithms and other work provided by team members are donations to the Simple
Machines project. This donation of intellectual property cannot be revoked.

==Free and Open Source Software==
====SMF 2.0====
SMF 2.0 has been released under a BSD license, which requires all redistribution (modified or unmodified, in source or binary form) to retain the copyright notice in the source files, and prohibits using the names of Simple Machines, Simple Machines Forum, or any of its contributors to promote or endorse any derived work.

The License agreement may be viewed on the [http://www.simplemachines.org/about/smf/license.php SMF license page]

====Earlier versions of SMF====
Earlier versions of SMF (versions in the 1.0.x line and 1.1.x line, as well as beta and RC versions of SMF 2) are licensed under a proprietary open-source license which was more restrictive than those described by the Open Source Initiative. This license permits anyone to use the code, view the code, or distribute instructions to modify it (as SMF mod packages do), but no one may modify the copyright notice or redistribute the forum/software itself without written permission.  The SMF team worked with copyright lawyers to develop this license in response to instances where code from YaBB SE (released under a GPL license) was redistributed by another project under a new name, without giving any credit to those who wrote the code.

The License agreement may be viewed on the [http://www.simplemachines.org/about/smf/license.php SMF license page]

==Simple Machines Web Sites==
*http://www.simplemachines.org -- The main site for Simple Machines and SMF, with links to download SMF and SMF themes and modifications
* http://wiki.simplemachines.org -- Online documentation for SMF.
*http://www.simplemachinesforum.org -- a &quot;backup&quot; site, which is activated when there is a problem with simplemachines.org
*http://www.yabbse.org -- the site of the yabbse project. Much of the material here has been preserved as an archive.
*http://dev.simplemachines.org -- Home of the SMF Function database and bug tracker, as well as several tools used by developers and translators.

==Business Structure==
The SMF project team is responsible for handling the development, support, documentation, customization, and translation of the SMF software.  In addition, SMF team members invite and recruit community members to beta test new releases, to help moderate non-English speaking boards, to help provide support, and to help with documentation.

The Simple Machines Forum (SMF) project is part of Simple Machines, a US Non-profit Organization registered in Nevada. The organization owns all the servers, collects all donations and any other income, and is responsible for paying all the bills and handling any legal matters.  The corporate organization is led by a Board of Directors (BoD) elected by the organizations members as detailed in the Simple Machines Bylaws.  Every member of the SMF team is eligible to be a member of the organization, subject to the approval of the BoD. Site, server, and marketing functions are handled by the corporate organization for the SMF team.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{User:AngelinaBelle/template/PolicyDisclaimer}}
{{TOCright}}
The SimpleMachines Forum (SMF) project is a project team under the umbrella of the Simple Machines NPO. 
==The SMF team==
The SMF project has a project manager and several sub-teams.  The heads of these teams, along with the project manager, constitute the projects's steering committee, which is responsible for developing plans for the project and leading the project toward achieving its goals.

===Moderation Duties===
The purpose of board and post moderation is to maintain a friendly environment where community members can get the help and support they need.

It is the duty of every SimpleMachines team member to patrol every publicly-viewable boards, review every post for inappropriate content, and move, remove, split, merge or lock topics as required to maintain civility and good order. Language Moderators (not members of the SMF team) are responsible for patrolling non-English language boards.

When deciding what to do with a slightly-misplaced post, please be careful and extra-friendly. New users are often confused and frustrated when they make their first post. A simple message like &quot;I hope you won't mind that I've moved your post to the XXX board, where I hope you'll get the help you need&quot;, goes a long way.  Similarly, when users have double-posted in different boards (often because they were unsure where to post), a friendly post explaining the move, merge, or deletion will go a long way toward helping the new user feel welcomed.

===Project Manager===
The SMF Project Manager (PM) is responsible for representing the SMF project to the NPO and to the SMF community. The PM leads the team, maintaining the vision and spirit of the project. The PM encourages and supports team members, works with the steering committee to set goals for the project.

The PM's duties are:
#To help the SMF team set goals.
#To lead the SMF team toward meeting the team's goals, help solve problems
#To help the teams collaborate, stay informed of the effect they have on one another, and work together effectively.
#To mediate conflict between team members, or between team members and community members, in order to help the parties reach an agreement.
# When authorized by the SC, to speak on behalf of the steering committee.
# To serve as team figurehead -- representing the team to the community, answering general inquiries, turning some questions over to other experts on the team.
# To identify areas for improvement within the project. 
#*Inform or advise the responsible parties, bring it to the attention of the SC, or appoint someone to handle it. 
#*The SC must be notified of all such appointments.

In order to carry out these duties,
# The PM should have administrative access to simplemachines.org, and related sites.
# The PM should have root access to the servers/VMs holding the infrastructure of the SMF project, in order to be able to help in case of emergency.

The PM is empowered to:
# Perform administrative duties necessary for the team, such as changing groups (set as Friend, apprentice, etc.).
# Intervene and make project decisions, in case of emergency, when the SC is not available. These situations include, but are not limited to:
#* The responsible team lead or member is inactive or otherwise unavailable, and immediate action needs to be taken.
#* The project is seriously endangered, as when immediate removal of a team member is necessary.

Restrictions on the powers of the PM are:
# When the PM takes administrative action to change member access, removal of team members, or other emergency actions, he must inform the SC or the team.
# The PM must provide an explanation for any decision or action, at the request of the SC.
# The SC can reverse any decision or action of the SC. The SC may make a decision without taking a formal poll. If any member of the SC (including the PM) requests a poll on the matter, a poll may be taken.
# The SMF team can reverse any decision or action of the PM.

===Team Leads===
Each of the teams within the SMF project has a team lead. The team lead are responsible for:
* Reporting progress during team meetings.
* Participating in Steering Committee discussions.
* Keeping the other teams informed of important changes or events.
* Keeping their team motivated &amp; on task.
* Helping team members stay involved.
* Giving team members the recognition and credit they merit for their successes and accomplishments.
* Supporting the personal and professional growth of each and every member of the team
* Watching for new team members and recruiting them.
* Making sure apprentice members and new team members have a mentor, that the mentor works as closely with the new member as necessary, and that apprentices makes appropriate progress during the apprenticeship period.

===Developers===
{{User:AngelinaBelle/template/Did you know|above=Did you know?
|text=The “SE” in YaBB SE stood for “Splinter Edition” after Splinter from the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Ninjas are cool, and YaBB SE was designed to be cool, too. And it was a developed by a small splinter group of the original YaBB Team.}}&lt;!--

--&gt;Developers create the software. Without them, there is no software community. For the SMF community to remain vital, the software must remain vital. The developers must lead in decisions about where technology is going, and where SMF needs to go to stay current. They need to consider everything from what the users want, to making the features run efficiently, to making sure all the pieces get tested properly. The development team must:

* Maintain a roadmap to plan for the short-term and long-term development of SMF software
** Review current and coming technology, to make sure SMF stays current.
** Provide direction and leadership to discussions of the future of SMF.
** Review and select features for future versions.
** Monitor the bug trackers and get feedback from the beta testers.
** Monitor and address security reports, and keep the SC informed of all security issues.
* Develop new versions of SMF.
** Work with beta testers to make sure new features are tested adequately.
** Fix bugs.
** Provide useful &quot;changelog&quot; comments with every code check-in.
* Release SMF versions to the community
** Determine when the latest version of SMF is ready for release
** Provide a changelog, derived from commit comments, to accompany each release of SMF.
** Prepare the upgrade, update, and full install sets for each SMF release
** Make the install sets available on the SMF website
** Work with the SMF team to make an announcement of each SMF release
* Work with and communicate with other SMF teams and the community.
** Assist with support, when advice from a developer is needed.
** Keep the other teams up-to-date on changes (Support needs to support it, Doc needs to write about it, and Customization needs to know about new best practices).
** Manage the code repositories, including user accounts.
** Communicate plans and progress to the SMF team and community.

===Support Specialists===
* Helping our users have an exceptional SMF experience.
* Providing special attention to the Charter Members.
* Monitoring the help desk &amp; getting tickets to a “closed”  state.
** Check Help Desk first.
** Check Charter Member boards.
** Check Support boards.
* Revisit your old posts and mark as solved when appropriate.
* Perform upgrades and installs for Charter Members.
* Support the core software by answering questions, suggesting fixes, etc.
* Act as a filter for bug reports, reporting legitimate ones to the bug tracker.
* Look for common problems/errors and suggest documentation or code changes to reduce them.
* Assume nothing. Always ask questions, no matter how tedious that can get. If a post is unclear, don't make assumptions. Ask for clarification.
* Some posts may seem trivial, to you. Remember that they aren't trivial to our users. Always strive to be friendly and helpful. You are SMF's &quot;Front line&quot;. The way you are perceived will reflect on SMF, not just you.
* Always try to remember to tell users to backup, before attempting anything. If you don't remind them, they'll almost certainly forget.
* If you begin helping, on a certain topic, try to maintain an interest in that topic; don't just leave it if you're stuck. There's a &quot;Support Helpers&quot; board. Use that to alert other support team members of your plight.
* If you're going to be away from the boards, whilst you're helping someone, try to let other members of the team know, so that they can take that topic over for you, rather than letting the person you're helping just &quot;Hang&quot;.

===Customizers===
Customizers are developers who can provide mods and/or themes for SMF. They review and approve mods and themes submitted by the community, and they maintain the customization site. Their duties include:

==Others who contribute to the SMF project==
These individuals also volunteer their time on behalf of the project, but are not members of the team.

===NPO teams===
The SMF project depends on the Simple Machines NPO for Marketing and to maintain its site and its servers. These teams are not part of the SMF project. The site team is responsible for upgrading SimpleMachines.org and re-installing necessary modifications. The server team is responsible for specifying, configuring and maintaining all of the NPO's servers and have all the account access required to get these tasks done.

===Forum Administrators===
Forum administrators take care of routine tasks like banning and deleting accounts, as well as less-common tasks like creating membergroups and adjusting membergroup permissions. These tasks are generally handled by site and server team members, by the SMF project manager and by other SMF team members.

===Friends===
Former members of the SMF team, some of whom are still members of the NPO. They often share their experiences with the team. Some Friends may re-join the team when they again have time to commit to the SMF project.

===Community Helpers===
Many members of the community contribute in one way or another without holding any title at all.
Others may join, or be invited to join, community support groups. These include
*Language Moderators -- moderate and provide support on non-English language boards.
*Beta Testers.
*Documentation Helpers.
*Support Helpers.
*Translators -- with their work SMF is available for [http://download.simplemachines.org/?smflanguages many languages].</text>

==Introduction==
'''The SRAM Gripshift 3.0 'comp' shifter is in wide use''' for straight handlebar bicycles, and other bikes that are known generally as mountain bikes (MTB).   It is used in three-speed versions for front derailleur (FD) shifting, and exists in seven, eight and nine-speed units for rear derailleur (RD) shifting. At the time of writing the shifters are available as new spare parts with the cable pre-wired, but the cable itself can be replaced as often as necessary by the user.   '''This page explains how to install a new cable for the shifter'''.  

'''The rear shifter is supplied for two cable-pull families''', the straight 1:1 family version and the Shimano-compatible 2:1 version.   The Shimano-compatible version exists as three models, marked on the item as 'MRX' (7/8-speed), 'MRX Pro' (7/8/9-speed), or as 'Centera' (8/9-speed).   Items without these 'MRX' or 'Centera' markings in their descriptions belong to the straight, native SRAM 1:1 family.   This description applies to both families.   The length of cable pulled for these two differ;   a seven-speed SRAM 1:1 GripShift pulls 4.5mm of cable (for RD shift ratio of 1.1), while the Shimano-compatible MRX 7-speed version pulls just 2.9mm of cable (for RD shift ratio of 1.7).   There are also ''low-normal'' (''rapid-rise'') versions for the Shimano-compatible rear GripShifts, where the labeling of the shifter's index numbers is reversed, compared to the conventional ''high-normal'' style.   The exact cable pull of Shimano's ''front'' shifters is unclear, but since SRAM advertise their ''front'' shifters as being suitable for Shimano front shifting also, they probably belong to the 1:1 shift family, with a shift ratio of about 1.1 (one point one).    

'''There is little maintenance associated with such twist shifters''' and not much goes wrong with them, though it is true to say that they are not true ''indexed shifters''.   That is to say, it is ''fairly'' free, but not ''entirely'' free of  the cleanness of shifting on the part of the rider.   They use click-stops inside the shifter, but it is still possible to twist the grip too far, so that they lack a true ''all-or-nothing'' response.  They are capable of a clean shift provided that the rider concentrates a little on doing so.         

'''The SRAM GripShift 3.0 'comp' shifter''' is so-called because it is supplied ''comp''lete with its shift cable already connected, and it is perhaps just as well, for '''many have difficulty in threading a new cable''' and resort to buying new units instead.   Whereas some shifters take a new cable as easily as a brake lever, with a simple alignment of barrel slots, this shifter is undoubtedly more awkward, and many have remarked that they have difficulty in feeding a cable through the aperture in the outer grip, using the manufacturer's procedure.

'''This page explains how to fit a new cable by opening the unit, as this method always gives good results'''.

==The Preferred Re-cabling Method==
Individual bikes differ in their handlebar equipment so whereas some can leave the shifter on the bar, others may find it best to remove it entirely from the handlebar for cable threading.   In this event, once the cable is free of the derailleur and the handlebar grip removed, the entire shifter can be removed by unscrewing the small hex-screw that locks it onto the handlebar.   Refer to the two photographs of a typical unit on the right as you read the preferred method. 
===Open the shifter===
*Make sure that the old cable is disconnected from the derailleur's clamp.   Note exactly how the cable was attached to the clamp, since it must be replaced in that way, paying attention to its exact direction of approach and the angle at which it is clamped. 
*Pull the cable through the housings without entirely removing it from the shifter.   This point is useful in allowing the user to learn the cable routing within the shifter when it is opened.
*Remove the bike's handlebar grip, partially or entirely, and any washer, in preparation for sliding the grip section along the handlebar.
*If the shifter is for a REAR DERAILLEUR then first set it to the index number that corresponds to the slackest cable.   This is often the highest index but not always.   If for a FRONT DERAILLEUR then the slackest is often the smallest index number.   The matter is not critical since the parts are to be removed, but this makes it easier to see the routing when inside.
*The grip section is not screwed to the shifter's body but is a firm ''press-on-fit''.   Carefully ease off the shifter's rubber grip section outwards along the handlebar to access the internal parts.   It can be removed altogether by sliding it all the way, and by depressing the plastic prongs that hold it captive.   The cable will be seen to run through a hole in cable ring. It also acts as a cable stop for the cable end. Refer to figures 2 and 3.
*Party withdraw the cable ring, (it also will slide along the shaft), to reveal the cable channel that runs into the barrel adjuster.   By this point the intended cable route should be obvious.   Only when the old cable's routing is clearly understood, should the the old cable be removed.

===Feed the New Cable===
It is important not to cut the welded end of the cable until the cable runs are complete and the dérailleur and shifter have been properly tested.  Also, make sure that there is enough spare housing at the front handlebars to allow the handlebars to turn fully to each side and in addition, to allow about four more inches of length for any future rework.

'''Be sure to use only a cable that is sold and marked clearly as intended for gear shifting'''.
*The cable need not be fed though the outer grip but instead it should be fed through the hole in the cable stop of the cable wheel. See figure 2.
*First remove the adjustable part of the barrel adjuster by unscrewing it completely; this makes the cable easier to feed. Then bend the last  centimeter or so of the cable in a gentle curve to help it negotiate the turn, and feed the end down the cable channel that leads into the barrel adjuster.   When doing so arrange the direction of the pre-bent end so that it best feeds through the barrel transition.   When the cable is through the barrel then pull up the slack, and remember to thread the adjustable part of the barrel adjuster onto the cable.
*Replace the cable wheel so that the top-V of the spring is adjacent to the slackest index number, and draw up any slack so that the cable end is in the cable stop and the cable runs in the channel. See figure 3.
*Replace the outer grip with its pointer at the slackest index number, being careful to maintain the position of the cable wheel as it is done, and make sure that the cable stays in its channel as the grip is closed.
*Test the shifter for smooth operation in both directions before feeding the cable through the housings for reconnection to the dérailleur.   Refer to [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Bicycles/Maintenance_and_Repair/Derailleurs/Rear_Derailleur_Adjustment#Set_the_Cable_Tension '''Set the Cable Tension'''] for notes on tensioning the cable and adjusting the derailleur.    
Note that when the housings are in place, the ferrule that terminates the shift housing must not bind in the end of the barrel-adjuster when it is turned to make adjustments; it is intended to be a loose fit, so choose any new ferrules with this in mind.   In the event that new housings are to be run at the same time the page [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Bicycles/Maintenance_and_Repair/Cables_and_Housings '''Cables and Housings'''] might be of some help.

==Other Thoughts==
*Whereas it would seem possible to use the old cable to pull through a new cable, attaching the two cables well enough to do so has proved difficult.   Perhaps somebody will devise such a method in the future.
*Some fine day, a manufacturer will design such a shifter that is programmable.   That is, one that allows the cable-pull for any single shift to be chosen with a dial.   In this way, the shifter could be used to match ''any'' cog-set to ''any'' derailleur provided that the number of gears was the same.  Alas, I do not know of such a thing. (Although not available in a twist-grip shifter, Campagnolo systems since their earliest indexed models in the mid-1980s have used a replaceable index ring.  Different index rings were available to program the right shifter for different numbers of cogs and different freewheel/cassette, derailleur and even chain combinations.  These systems could be made to work quite well, but they got a bad rap, due to design deficiencies in the first generation, as well as bad shifting due to mismatched index rings.  Once the 10-speed era arrived, the ability to reprogram a shifter with different index rings diminished, at least with brake-shift combination units.  Campagnolo non-electronic left shifters have never been indexed, as Campagnolo correctly understands that indexed front systems are a curse on humanity.)

[[File:Vancouver SkyTrain Map.svg|thumb|right|400px|Vancouver SkyTrain Map]]
Vancouver has a relatively extensive transit system that is best known for the Skytrain system.  Skytrain consisted originally of raised tracks on which trains ran using a system similar to a typical subway.  In subsequent expansions it also includes underground tunnels, with some at-grade sections; however it is primarily a grade-separated form of mass transit.  A transit solution between central Vancouver and the University of British Columbia (UBC) is currently being considered, with Skytrain being one of the primary candidate modes.  There are a number of issues that have arisen when planning this development, and we present these issues as a launching point for discussion of universal issues when considering any transportation system.  In particular, we analyze different transit technologies and the governmental structure for ownership and funding sources of the mass transit in the area.   We look at some of the tradeoffs a planner must make when designing a system and the stakeholders that are involved in such a project.

== Narrative ==
Vancouver is the third largest metro area in Canada.  It is located along the west coast of Canada with the Pacific to the west, the United States to the south and the North Shore Mountains to the north.&lt;ref name=&quot;R1&quot; /&gt; The Vancouver area has seen rapid growth in the past few years.  It is estimated that the metro area’s population will increase by about 50% by the year 2041.&lt;ref name=&quot;R2&quot; /&gt;  Because of the geographical constraints of the area much of this growth is happening through increasing population density instead in favor of increasing developed land area.  The growth and density of the area over the years has allowed for the development of an intricate mass transit system including buses, ferries and light rail transit.

=== History of transit and governance in metropolitan Vancouver ===
==== Original transit system (streetcars) ====

Mass transit in Vancouver began in the early 1890s with the installation of electric streetcars along 9 km of track in the city center. The system expanded rapidly through WWI, and was vital to residents affected by the Great Depression needing a cheaper form of transport. The system was privately owned and operated by the British Columbia Electric Railway (BCER).&lt;ref name=&quot;T7&quot; /&gt;

==== Electric buses (trolley buses) ====

Motor buses were used to supplement streetcar service by the 1920s, but the relatively low power of diesel buses at the time resulted in the implementation of electrified bus (trolleybus) service. By 1955, the electric streetcar fleet was retired and Vancouver possessed the largest trolleybus fleet in Canada.

In 1961, the provincial government took over ownership of the privately run transit system and created BC Hydro, a government owned Crown corporation.

In 1979, the provincial government created the Urban Transportation Authority, in order for local governments to have an increased role in providing transit service. The UTA became BC Transit in 1982, and in 1999, greater Vancouver created the Greater Vancouver Transportation Authority, later known as Translink, which now oversees the operation of the entire transit system for the Vancouver region.&lt;ref name=&quot;T7&quot; /&gt;

==== Skytrain ====

Vancouver had been rethinking its approach to large scale mass transit since the retirement of the streetcar fleet in the 1950s. Worsening congestion in the metro Vancouver area, coupled with the city being awarded the 1986 World Exposition, which focused on Transportation and Communication Vancouver, gave the city the opportunity to build its first form of rapid transit, Skytrain.&lt;ref name=&quot;N5&quot; /&gt;

The first Skytrain line -  the Expo Line - opened in 1985 and currently connects Vancouver to Surrey.  The Millenium Line was added in 2002 and circulates Vancouver and the adjacent city of Burnaby.&lt;ref name=&quot;N5&quot; /&gt;  The most recently completed line, the Canada Line, was opened in 2009 connecting the Vancouver airport and the southern suburbs of Vancouver to the central transportation hub, and is currently 3 years ahead of ridership projections.&lt;ref name=&quot;N6&quot; /&gt;  An extension of the Millenium Line, named the Evergreen Line, is currently beginning construction and is expected to open in 2014/2015.  This line will connect the Millenium Line to the eastern suburbs and terminate at Douglas College.&lt;ref name=&quot;N7&quot; /&gt;

In 2010 the Skytrain system carried people for 347 million total trips and had a net revenue of about $244 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;N3&quot; /&gt;  It uses a zone-based pricing scheme, where travel within a single zone costs $2.50, whereas crossing through all 3 zones during a trip costs $5.00.&lt;ref name=&quot;N8&quot; /&gt;

==== UBC Line ====
The Broadway Corridor connects Central Broadway with the University of British Columbia.  The Central Broadway area is the second largest job center in the Vancouver metro area while the University of British Columbia in Vancouver is one of the county’s largest colleges.  There are 100,000 daily bus trips taken along this corridor which leads to overcrowding and inconsistent timing.  During peak times buses run along this route almost every 90 seconds which adds to the already congested area.&lt;ref name=&quot;R3&quot; /&gt;  An upgrade to the transit system along the Broadway Corridor is severely needed.

==Annotated List of Actors (Stakeholders)==
===Business Interests===
The general opinion of businesses is that mass transit would be good for the overall economic health of the area, however the majority are against a Skytrain system.  One of the main arguments against a Skytrain is the disruption caused by construction, which in order to be kept affordable would likely use the cut-and-fill technique.  This technique was used in the construction of the Canada Skytrain line where businesses located in the Cambie Street area ended up suing the provincial government for compensation for the economic losses suffered.&lt;ref name=&quot;N1&quot; /&gt;  Businesses fear similar economic hardships and bankruptcies, which would likely occur if an underground Skytrain line were to be constructed.  One merchant, who went bankrupt during the construction of the Canada line, spoke at a public hearing stating “What’s happening along here is exactly what happened on Cambie Street.”&lt;ref name=&quot;N1&quot; /&gt;  This opinion is one held by the Business and Residents Association for Sustainable Transportation Alternatives (BARSTA), who also questioned the long term benefits of Skytrain on the UBC line, with one member stating  “We want to make some suggestions about transit alternatives that would be best for not only improving transit, but for respecting and enhancing our communities and local businesses”.&lt;ref name=&quot;N1&quot; /&gt;  The businesses of the organization favor less expensive transit options that provide more access to local businesses, such as light rail or improved busing.&lt;ref name=&quot;N2&quot; /&gt;  By providing more visibility to the local businesses due to being at-grade there would be less disconnect from the Broadway business district than a more separated system.

===University of British Columbia===
The majority of the users of the current 99 line are University of British Columbia.  Upgrading the transit on this line would lower commuter times for students and faculty.  This project would give students who live on campus a better connection with the Vancouver area including the international airport.  The University of Vancouver has been named one of the most sustainable campuses in North America by the U.S. Sustainable Endowments Institute.  Improving transit in the area would help the keep the university on this list.&lt;ref name=&quot;U1&quot; /&gt;

===Citizen Groups===
====SPEC====
The British Columbia-based Society Promoting Environmental Conservation (SPEC) was founded in 1969 to address environmental issues in British Columbia in general and urban areas in particular. SPEC sent out a press release advocating for the reallocation of transportation funds away from highway transportation projects in order to expand transit projects in the metro Vancouver area. In a press release from 2010, SPEC cites previous years’ increased carbon emissions and increased per-capita gasoline sales as evidence that the province is failing to meet their climate change goals. Since they claim 40% of carbon emissions are transportation related, SPEC suggests that investing in transit will shift mode choice to transit, thereby reducing carbon emissions. SPEC also advocates for transit as a means to drive economic development.&lt;ref name=&quot;T1&quot; /&gt;

====Canadian Taxpayers Federation====
The Canadian Taxpayers Federation is a citizen advocacy group that advocates for lower taxes and greater efficiency and accountability in government. In Vancouver, they have written in opposition of spending over $100 million on fair gates at Skytrain stations as a method to combat fare evasion. Riders currently operate on the honor system and face a fine for not possessing a valid ticket. As an alternative, the CTF supports greater fines and enforcement to reduce fare evasion and increase fare revenue. In addition, CTF opposes the high rate of gas taxes, particularly in British Columbia, where gas taxes are highest.&lt;ref name=&quot;T5&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;T6&quot; /&gt;

====Sustainable Transportation Coalition====
An influential group of planners, architects, and environmentalists is campaigning to persuade local and provincial governments to implement the funding measures necessary to accomplish the goals identified in Metro Vancouver’s 2040 Plan. The Coalition is comprised of a number of citizens active in transportation issues across the province, and is headed by Peter Ladner, a 2008 mayoral candidate for Vancouver.&lt;ref name=&quot;T3&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;T4&quot; /&gt;

====CUTA - Canadian Urban Transit Association====

The Canadian Urban Transit Association is a trade group that promotes transit infrastructure and the transit industry as a whole within Canada and believes in transits ability to contribute to quality of life in the Canadian communities that transit serves. Its members consist of professionals working or affiliated with the transit industry. CUTA publishes a number of reports to advocate and promote transit in Canada, including their “Transit Vision 2040” report, that identifies major themes in improving transit effciency such as improving service and customer relations, being environmentally and fiscally sustainable, and advancing support for transit in Canadian communities.&lt;ref name=&quot;T2&quot; /&gt;

===Government Agencies===

====Provincial Government====
The government of British Columbia has been very involved with the transit system of the metro Vancouver area.  Translink was set up by the province to bring together the municipal governments and local transit companies and took over many transit operations previously held by the province. British Columbia has been one of the main financiers of previous transit projects, including Skytrain, and has used transit changes to meet its environmental goals.&lt;ref name=&quot;N9&quot; /&gt;

====National Government====
The Canadian government has been supportive of the Skytrain system in the past.  It has contributed $1.1 billion dollars to the system through the Building Canada Fund, Public Transit Capital Trust and other federal funding programs.  Nina Grewal, a member of Canadian Parliament, has said “…Our government is proud to support environmentally sustainable municipal infrastructure, like the Skytrain, which contributes to cleaner air and reduced greenhouse gas emissions, improving the environment and benefiting all Canadians,”.&lt;ref name=&quot;R4&quot; /&gt;  Although the Canadian government would be supportive of any increase in mass transit that would decrease emissions the federal government, the Skytrain system has been singled out by the federal government time and time again because it is a large scale, technologically advanced mass transit option.

====Translink====
In 2010, Translink received 32% of its revenue from transit fees, which was its largest single source of revenue.&lt;ref name=&quot;N3&quot; /&gt;  Consequently, Translink has a strong interest in any projects that would increase the income from transit fares as a result of expansion of the system.  A transit system would also likely increase the property values near the line and change consumer fuel use which would effect Translink's primary sources of income (property and fuel taxes, which comprise 45% of Translink’s revenue stream).&lt;ref name=&quot;N3&quot; /&gt;  In addition to having large impacts on the potential revenue of the company, Translink would also have to make a large initial investment in the line.  While the project is still too early in development to determine funding sources they have historically provided a large share of the funding for similar projects.  For example, for the Evergreen Line currently under construction Translink has agreed to contribute $400-Million of the total $1.4-Billion project cost, or about 29% of the total.&lt;ref name=&quot;N4&quot; /&gt;  Less concretely, Translink is the primary entity in planning and operating the line, so any positive or negative aspects of the UBC Line will reflect most directly on them.  As a result, Translink has a large stake in the success or failure of the project and is less concerned about any one particular technology.

== Clear Identification of Policy Issues ==
=== Planning ===
==== Alternatives Analysis ====
For most large-scale projects an alternative analysis, or a weighing of options to obtain the goal most efficiently, is conducted. Alternative analyses require a commitment of time and money from the stakeholder(s) funding the given project.  Without the analyses, the planning process would be rather impractical. In the case of the projected UBC line there has been extensive alternative analysis conducted. This has been funded by two stakeholders: Translink and the Province of British Columbia.&lt;ref name=&quot;A1&quot; /&gt;

The first alternative proposed for the system is a Bus Rapid Transit line running a linear route along Broadway. The buses would run along the center of the street, with stations being located in the median and connected by crosswalks. The line would offer access to three different north-south running bus lines. This option is the least expensive but also the slowest. The capital cost of the BRT alternative is $350 million for the diesel buses, and $450 million for the trolley buses. These costs are less than half of the other alternatives because very few infrastructure changes would need to be made. One-way trip time from end to end would take approximately 33 minutes. The proposed ridership for the BRT option is 75,000 trips per day. Proposed trips per day for other alternatives are at 100,000 or more.&lt;ref name=&quot;A2&quot; /&gt; This implies that the BRT alternative would be inadequate given the demanded travel needs of the line.

There are two LRT alternatives. The first LRT alternative includes two options, labeled “A” and “B.” The A option would be aligned on Broadway Ave for the entirety of the line. This option would be faster than the B option, which would loop up to the VCC Clark Station and Great Northern Way Campus. Option A would most likely provide service to UBC students commuting to campus, while option B would also be serving tourists, shoppers, and Great Northern Way students. The one-way trip travel time for option A would be approximately 26 minutes and option B would be 29 minutes. The capital costs for the A and B options would be at $1.1 billion. The projected trips per day for option A is 99,000. and 109,000 for B.&lt;ref name=&quot;A2&quot; /&gt; This alternative fits in better with the 100,000 trips per day goal, although the capital and incremental costs being considerably larger. Signaling priority would be given to the LRT alternative, although this would only cut trip time by a few minutes.

The Second LRT alternative proposes more stops, because of the B option encompassing a larger loop. The B option route connects with the A at the Arbutus stop, about halfway along the total line. This alternative allows for increased development along Central Broadway and northward. Capital costs increase to $1.38 billion for the A option, and $1.48 billion for the B option. Daily projected ridership levels stay about the same for option A as expected, but rise to 116,000 trips per day in the extended option B.&lt;ref name=&quot;A2&quot; /&gt;

RRT, or Rail Rapid Transit, is yet another option for the UBC line. The plan proposes tunneled RRT for most of the line, with only a small portion of the line being elevated. This alternative poses two options; with the routes being similar to the previously proposed alternatives. Option A would run exclusively underground. Option B would be an extension of the Millennium Line, and would begin elevated until reaching the Great Northern Way campus. The capital costs for this alternative are large, with option A totaling $3.2 billion and option B $2.9 billion. This is undoubtedly because of the switch of grades along the B route. Estimated ridership levels are 137,000 for option A, and 146,000 for option B. Riders of these routes would experience 20 minute trip times one-way.&lt;ref name=&quot;A2&quot; /&gt;

There are two combination alternatives in regards to RRT. The first alternative being predominantly LRT, with tunneled RRT splitting off at the Arbutus stop. This alternative boasts the highest potential ridership levels, with daily estimates reaching 145,000 trips. Because of the modal interchanges required, the trip time for this alternative would rise to 25-27 minutes. The capital cost would be $2.4 billion. Infrastructure would need to be changed to allow for this alternative. Elevators or stairs would be necessary for the tunnel or raised RRT.&lt;ref name=&quot;A2&quot; /&gt;

The other combined alternative features BRT for the entire Broadway line, with RRT (connected from the Millennium Line) running parallel along Broadway until at last an interchange to BRT must be made at the Arbutus stop. Capital cost for this alternative would be $1.9 billion, with most of the cost coming from the extension of the Millennium Line to Arbutus. The incremental operating cost would be $4 million. This alternative is expected to serve 138,000 trips per day. The one-way trip time would be increased to 32 minutes along the line.&lt;ref name=&quot;A2&quot; /&gt; This alternative would potentially relieve congestion because of its interesting alignment. The multi-modal system of RRT and BRT would give riders choices.

The final alternative simply offers improved bus service between UBC and Commercial Broadway. Named “Best Bus Alternative,” the plan is to increase frequency on multiple routes between the two points, as well as provide express bus service. Changes needed to implement the Best Bus alternative are relatively simple compared to the other alternatives. An increased deployment of buses would be needed, as well as the provision of real-time schedules and increased shelters. The trip time between UBC and Commercial Broadway would be approximately 30 minutes. The capital cost of this alternative would be $325 million, with incremental operating costs being $18 million. This alternative is the cheapest, easiest to deploy and easiest to maintain. The projected ridership level, like the first alternative, is at 75,000 trips per day. This is almost half that of the first combination alternative.&lt;ref name=&quot;A2&quot; /&gt;

===Funding===
As with any upgrade to a transit system, cost is an important issue and one of the main factors in the decision of how to fix the transit problem in the Broadway Corridor.  The seven options outlined in the alternatives analysis have costs varying from $325 million to $3.2 billion in capital costs with the rail rapid transit option being the most expensive and the best bus option being the least.&lt;ref name=&quot;R3&quot; /&gt;  Different funding options are currently being looked at for the region including federal and provincial funds, tax increases and increasing current transit fares.

The majority of the funding for large transit projects in the Vancouver area has come from different federal and provincial funding programs and Translink. These were three of the four largest contributors to the $1.9 billion initial cost of Skytrain’s Canada line with 22% federal money, 12% provincial money and 17% from Translink.&lt;ref name=&quot;R5&quot; /&gt; The other contributor was the international airport which was a main destination on that line.  These funding patterns are also the case for the upcoming Evergreen line due in 2014. It would be logical to assume this will happen for similar future projects, such as the UBC line.

An increase in gas taxes of two cents per liter is currently being proposed to help fund the UBC line and other Translink projects.  This idea has been met with opposition from the public.  British Columbia already has the highest gas taxes of any Canadian province with 33.6% of the cost of gas being taxes while having the second highest total cost for gasoline.  Adding more taxes would only increase the gap between the second highest province, Quebec.&lt;ref name=&quot;R6&quot; /&gt;

Other ways to raise money for this and other projects in the Vancouver metro area have been suggested and implemented.  The governor of Surrey, a city located south of Vancouver, has suggested selling the naming rights to different Skytrain stations to raise money.&lt;ref name=&quot;R7&quot; /&gt;  Others see increasing property taxes and current transit fares as an option.  Upgrades to the current systems are also being looked at to increase ridership and funds.  For example, new fare gate systems are being installed in the current Skytrain stations which should help stop fare jumpers.

===Cost Considerations===
The capital costs for transportation modes such as streetcar, LRT and Skytrain are relatively easy to determine because the large initial investment to build the transportation infrastructure (tunnels and elevated tracks, vehicles, stations etc.) is generally tied directly to the project. However, many costs associated with personal automobile, local bus service and to a lesser extent BRT and trolley bus are more difficult to determine because they operate on existing roadways, the construction and maintenance of which are not included in most cost calculations for these modes. 

===Environmental Concerns===
Studies by leading experts indicate that climate change may impose significant economic, social and environmental costs and cause catastrophic damage.  In 2008, the most recent year for which there are records, greenhouse gases increased in BC despite a national trend of decreasing emissions.   2009 saw per-capita gasoline sales in BC rise almost 10 percent which was the largest single-year increase for the province in at least 30 years.

SPEC is calling on the province to scale back or cancel the many highway expansion projects that are either in process or planned. This would free up well over a billion dollars for public transportation, education and social programs

Legislation now exists that requires municipalities and regions to arrange land uses and transportation systems in a manner that reduces greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (ie. British Columbia’s Greenhouse Gas Reduction Targets Act). The use of transit, which was heretofore considered solely from the perspective of reducing auto dependence and providing transportation equity to the disadvantaged, now has a broader mandate to help governments meet their GHG targets.

Modes such as LRT and Skytrain have very low external costs because the infrastructure for these types of projects generally have to be built from scratch so the costs are already included in their higher initial capital costs.  If most trips in the region are short then the rationale for investment in trams is overwhelming. If all trips are long then the rationale for the very expensive Skytrain system may still hold sway.

===Public Safety===
Each of the 7 alternatives for the Broadway Corridor transit upgrade comes with their own set of safety concerns.  Buses, LRT, or any other form of transit using the same grade as pedestrians, bicycles, and automobiles will face a future of potential collisions. The option for a separate-grade transportation system would not face these same concerns, as they have their own right of way, as well as built in sensors that detect, and warn of,  any impediment along the track. However, other safety concerns about the lack of natural surveillance arise when considering below grade boarding stations. To appease such safety concerns, Translink currently has its own fully accredited police agency called the South Coast British Columbia Transportation Authority Police Service (link).  This agency would be involved in whichever alternative is chosen to help enforce fairs, increase surveillance, and reduce crimes. 

===Aesthetics/Design===
The different transit alternative designs could have an effect of the overall look of the area.  The Best Bus option would only increase the number of busses on the current roadway while the Bus Rapid Transit option would require two paved lanes of its own.  The light rail options would also require a lane for each direction of light rail traffic but could be designed as grass tracks adding some vegetation to the streets.  This would be a visual reminder of the environmental benefits of light rail.  Both the Bus Rapid Transit option and light rail options would require new stop areas, possibly with shelters, to be added to the area. Depending on the design these could either enhance or reduce the aesthetics of the area.  The three options that contain rail rapid use tunnels and would not disturb the roadway or aesthetics of the Broadway corridor.&lt;ref name=&quot;R3&quot; /&gt;
== Project Future ==

The future of the transit in the Broadway Corridor is not well defined.  An alternative from the seven proposed options will be chosen and included in the Translink 2045 report due out in August 2013.&lt;ref name=&quot;U2&quot; /&gt;  No funding is being planned specifically for this project but for the larger Translink and Government funds and trusts that would likely be used to finance the project.  No timeline or deadlines for the project have been set.

      <text xml:space="preserve">　　むかし　あるところに　お爺さんとおばあさんが住んでいました。
ふたりは　大変正直のうえ働き者でしたが、年をとってしまった上に　その年の米や畑の作物の出来が良くなくて、そろそろ年の瀬を迎えるという頃になった時には　二人の家には　殆ど食べ物がなくなってしまっていました。これでは　お正月を迎えることもままならないと　お爺さんは　残り少なくなったわらで笠を編み、それを町に売りに行くことにしました。&lt;br /&gt;


　　外に　冷たい雪の降る大晦日の朝、お爺さんは　おばあさんに見送られて　やっと編み上げた五枚の笠を持って、町にでかけました。
途中、山をくだったところに　六つのお地蔵様が並んでいるところがあり、お爺さんもおばあさんも　前を通る時は、いつもそれぞれのお地蔵様に向かって　手を合わせて　日ごろの感謝とその日の無事を祈るようにしていましたが、この日も　お爺さんは　冷たい雪の中を立ち止まって、どうぞ　笠が売れて　正月の仕度が出来ますように　と　一つ一つのお地蔵様の前で祈ってから、町に向かいました。　&lt;br /&gt;


　　一日中　お爺さんは笠を売るために　町のあちこちで声を張り上げていましたが、たくさんの人でごった返す年末の町では、いまさら年取ったおじいさんから　わざわざ笠を買おうなどという人は なく、日が落ちて　薄暗くなる頃になっても　笠は一枚も売れずに残ってしまいました。おばあさんががっかりするだろうなぁ　と思いながらも、どうにも仕方なく　お爺さんは　持ってきた笠をそのまま背中にしょって、とぼとぼと　家に帰っていきました。&lt;br /&gt;

　

　　山へ上がる前に　やはりお地蔵様のところへやってきましたが、朝からの雪で　お地蔵様たちは　それぞれのおつむに真っ白な雪をかむっておられました。
お爺さんは其れを見て、やれ　これでは冷たくておいででしょう、といいながら、手で雪を払いのけ、そうそう、ちょうどいいものがあります。こんなものでも　ちょいのしのぎにはなりましょう　といって、持っていた笠を　それぞれのお地蔵様の頭に　かぶせてあげました。　ところが、最後のお地蔵様の前にきたとき、お爺さんは　もう持っている笠がないことに気がつきました。笠は　五枚編んだのですが、お地蔵様は六体おられたからです。&lt;br /&gt;


　　はて。。こまった　このままでは　こちらのお地蔵様がお寒かろう・・。　そして　ふと思いついて、自分の頭にかぶっていた手ぬぐいを　最後のお地蔵様の頭にかぶせ
お地蔵様、じいの汚い手ぬぐいで申し訳ござんせんが、どうか　これで勘弁してくださいまし。笠ほど役には立ちませんが、いくらかは　しのげることと存じます。ごめんくださいまし。　といって　手ぬぐいの端を顎の下できちんと結んでから手を合わせました。そして　 いそいで　頭を手でおおいながら、山道を登っていきました。&lt;br /&gt;


　　入り口の戸をあけたおばあさんは　お爺さんが　ぬれて帰ってきたのを見て、まぁ　どうしましたね？まさか　手ぬぐいまでうらっしゃったんじゃ・・？　といいましたが、あたたかい白湯を飲んで　ほっとしているお爺さんの話を聞いて、ああ　そうでしたか、それは　それはようござった。よいことをなされたなぁ、きっとお地蔵様も　よろこんでおいででっしゃろ。といって　お爺さんのしたことを　一緒に喜びました。&lt;br /&gt;


　　しかし、相変わらず　二人の家の中には　正月の備えどころか、なんのこれというものもなく、このままでは　あるものを食べてしまったら　何もなくなってしまう　というままでした。でも　仕方ありません。ふたりは　薄い布団に包まって　その日は早く寝てしまいました。&lt;br /&gt;


　　さて、しんしんと降る雪が　ますます冷たくかたく積もっていく　大晦日の夜更け。
お爺さんとおばあさんは　ふと　申し合わせたように　目を覚ましました。&lt;br /&gt;


　　あれ・・、なんじゃろうか？　ええ、さっきから　何の音だか、どすんどすんと。
鬼かと思うたが　なにやら　景気のええ歌声もするで・・
そうなんですよね、にぎやかで　楽しそうな歌声がね。&lt;br /&gt;


そのどすんという音と歌声は　どうやら　二人の家に向かってやってくるような様子です。ふたりは　何がやってくるのかと　入り口の戸に隙間を空けて、じっと見ていました。

　　雪はすでにやんでいて、あたりには　月の光がさしていました。
その明るくなった表にあらわれたのは、なんと　笠をかぶったお地蔵様たちだったのです。　お地蔵様たちは　楽しそうに、正直で信心深い優しいお爺さんのおかげで、冷たい雪をかぶらずにすんだと歌い、それぞれ　なにやら重そうな荷物を転がしながら、家の前に　次々と　それを積み上げました。&lt;br /&gt;


　　ふたりは　顔を見合わせて、びっくりしていましたが、その時　一番最後のお地蔵様が、ちいさいつつみを戸口に置いたのも　みました。
そのお地蔵様の頭には　お爺さんの手ぬぐいがありました。
ふたりは　思わず、手を合わせて、やれ　ありがたや、ありがたや、なんまいだぶ　なんまいだぶ・・・と　一生懸命　いのりました。　&lt;br /&gt;


　　お地蔵様たちは　そのあと、また　きた道を楽しそうに歌を歌いながら　戻っていかれました。
お爺さんとおばあさんが　表に出てみると、なんと　積み上げられていたのは　米俵や餅や炭など・・。そして　たくさんの野菜や魚やお酒まで、いろんなものがあったのです。
ふたりは　いちいち　手を合わせて感謝してから、それらのものを　家の中に運び込みました。家の中は　あっという間にりっぱな正月を迎えるためのものでいっぱいになりましたが、おそらく　正月が終わったとしても　まだまだ　充分に　暖かくすごすことが出来るでしょう。&lt;br /&gt;


さいごに　家の中に入ろうとしたとき　お爺さんは　手ぬぐいでほっかむりをしたお地蔵様が置いていった　小さな包みを見つけ、手にとって　中に入りました。&lt;br /&gt;


　　なんじゃろうかねぇ、という　おばあさんの声を聞きながら、包みを開けると、なかには　まあたらしい　手ぬぐいが何枚か　たたんでありました。
あれあれ、お爺さんが気の毒だとおもわっしゃったんじゃろうねぇ、かわいげのあることをなさる。とおばあさん。
お爺さんは　さっそく　お地蔵様の染め絵の入った手ぬぐいを広げて　頭にかぶってみました。　そして　ふたりは　お地蔵様のことを思い出しながら、楽しく話したり、お地蔵様達が歌っていた歌をまねてうたってみたりして、愉快に大晦日の夜をすごしたということです。&lt;br /&gt;

We've spent a lot of this chapter talking about waves, and electron waves in particular. While most of us know what normal water waves look like, very few people have an understanding of what electron waves look like. In the last lesson, we talked about electron density, and how an electron wave could be thought of as representing the thickness or thinness of the electron density &quot;fog&quot; at any point in space within the atom. We considered the probability pattern for the electron in a hydrogen atom. Now let's consider some more complicated atoms.

==Lesson Objectives== 
* Explain the meaning of the principal quantum number, ''n''.
* Explain the meaning of the azimuthal quantum number, ''ℓ''.
* Explain the meaning of the magnetic quantum number, ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt;.

==Schrödinger's Equation Provides Three Integers Used to Define the Energy States and Orbital for an Electron==
[[File:Erwin Schrödinger.jpg|200px|thumb|'''Figure 6.11''': Erwin Schrödinger.]]
You should remember that electrons form standing waves whenever they are trapped within an atom. You should also remember that only certain standing waves are allowed in any confined space because only certain standing waves can fit perfectly inside that space (remember, a perfect fit requires that a wave begin and end where its box begins and ends). In a one-dimensional box, it's easy to picture all of the possible waves that fit perfectly inside. In three dimensions, it's a little harder. Unfortunately when it comes to electrons in an atom, there's an additional complication ''on top'' of the fact that electron waves are three-dimensional! It turns out that the electrons in an atom aren't confined to nice square or rectangular boxes. Instead, they're confined to spherical boxes (which should make sense, since atoms are, after all, tiny little spheres). In other words, electron waves inside an atom must begin and end on the surface of a sphere. You may have a really good imagination, and an amazing ability to picture objects in three-dimensions, but for most people, trying to figure out what these spherical three-dimensional waves look like can be quite a challenge.

Luckily, that's how electron wave functions can help. Electron wave functions basically describe the possible shapes that electron waves can take. We won't actually worry about the wave functions. Instead, we'll only worry about specific numbers, called ''quantum numbers''. Quantum numbers are always part of an electron wave function and are extremely important when it comes to determining the shape of a probability pattern.

When electron wave functions were first developed by a man named Erwin Schrödinger (Figure 6.11), his goal was to show how a wave-like description of the electron could be used to understand the behavior of an electron in a hydrogen atom. In order to do this, Schrödinger first defined the size and spherical shape of the hydrogen atom itself. Schrödinger then assumed an electron trapped within a hydrogen atom formed a standing wave that fit perfectly inside without &quot;spilling out&quot; or &quot;doubling over&quot; on itself (it turns out that in circular or spherical boxes, misfit waves don't &quot;spill out&quot; so much as they &quot;double over&quot;, as shown in Figure 6.12. Finally, Schrödinger supposed that an electron wave had to be continuous (remember, something that is continuous has no gaps, holes or jumps).

[[File:Electron wave doubling over.png|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 6.12''': When waves fit perfectly on a circle (or a sphere) they meet up with themselves and form a closed loop. When waves ''don't'' fit perfectly on a circle, though, they end up &quot;doubling over&quot; on themselves.]]

Amazingly, what Schrödinger discovered was that in order to satisfy his basic assumptions about the electron wave both fitting inside the atom and being continuous, certain quantities in the electron wave function had to be &quot;whole number integers&quot;. Whenever Schrödinger assigned a whole number to these quantities, he ended up with a wave that fit perfectly inside the hydrogen atom. However, whenever he assigned a decimal number to these quantities, he ended up with a wave function that either &quot;doubled over&quot; on itself, or was discontinuous! The quantities that had to be assigned whole numbers soon became known as '''quantum numbers'''. In the wave function for a hydrogen electron there are always three quantum numbers. The first quantum number, ''n'', is called the principal quantum number, the second quantum number, ''ℓ'', is called the azimuthal quantum number, and the third quantum number, ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt;, is called the magnetic quantum number. Together these three quantum numbers define the energy state and orbital of an electron, but we'll talk more about exactly what that means in the next section.

==''n'' = Principal Quantum Number (Energy Level)==
The first quantum number, known as the '''principal quantum number''', is given the symbol ''n''. In order to describe a valid standing wave, ''n'' has to have integer values, but there's an additional restriction on ''n'' as well. The value of ''n'' must be a positive integer value (''n'' = 1, 2, 3, . . .). In other words, ''n'' can never equal a negative integer. In fact, ''n'' can never even equal 0! The principal quantum number gives you two different clues as to what an electron wave looks like. First, it tells you how the electron density spreads out as you move away from the center of the atom. For electron waves with low principal numbers, like ''n'' = 1, the electron density is very thick right in close to the center of the atom, but then becomes rapidly thinner as you move out. In contrast, for electron waves with high principal quantum numbers, like ''n'' = 6, the electron density isn't as thick near the center of the atom, but is spread quite a bit further out. In general, the higher the principal quantum number, the further away from the nucleus you'll be able to detect a significant amount of electron density (Figure 6.13).

Sometimes, you will hear people say that the principal quantum number determines the &quot;size&quot; of the electron wave function. When people say this, they don't actually mean the absolute or total &quot;size&quot; of the electron wave. What they mean is how big or small the electron wave ''appears'' to be based on where most (usually about 90%) of the electron density is concentrated. In an electron wave with a low principal quantum number, the electron density is mostly found close to the center of the atom. Even though there is a tiny bit of electron density at distances far away from the atom's nucleus, there's so little that you can't really tell it's there. As a result, electron waves with low principal quantum numbers appear small. On the other hand, in an electron waves with a high principal quantum number, the electron density is much more spread out, and thus much thicker at distances far from the center of the atom. Therefore, electron waves with high principal quantum numbers appear big.

The principal quantum number also describes the total number of nodes that the electron wave contains. What are nodes? '''Nodes''' are places where the electron wave has absolutely no amplitude, or &quot;height&quot;. Take a look at the one-dimensional waves in the figure below. Can you spot the nodes (portion a.)? Now take a look at the two-dimensional waves (portion b.). Can you spot the nodes? A three-dimensional wave with nodes is something like an onion. Think of how the onion has layers and how in between the different layers there’s always an empty space or a break. If the onion was a three-dimensional wave, the breaks in between the onion layers would be like the nodes. The higher the principal quantum number, ''n'', the more nodes an electron wave has.

[[File:Principal quantum number nodes.png|500px|center]]

A node is any place where a wave has zero amplitude, or zero height. Both a. and b. illustrate different ways of representing waves. In a. the amplitude corresponds to the height of the yellow line above (or below) the black axis. When the yellow wave crosses the black axis, the wave has zero amplitude and thus a node. In b., the amplitude of the wave corresponds to the thickness of the blue cloud. When there is no blue cloud, the wave has zero amplitude and thus a node.

The principal quantum number is extremely important, not only because it tells you something about the &quot;size&quot; of an electron wave and the number of nodes in an electron wave, but also because it tells you something about the energy of that wave. If you think back, you'll remember that negative electrons like to be close to the positive nucleus because the energy of an electron is lower the closer it is to a positive charge. What does that mean in terms of the principal quantum number? It means that an electron wave with a ''lower principal quantum number'', and electron density centered ''close'' to the nucleus of the atom, will have a ''lower energy'', while an electron wave with a ''higher principal quantum number'', and electron density spread ''further away'' from the nucleus of the atom, will have a ''higher energy''.

Similarly, as the number of nodes in an electron wave increases, the energy of the wave increases as well. Think about the jump rope experiment. Do you remember how you created standing waves in a jump rope? Did it take more or less energy on your part to get multiple waves to form along the rope? It should have taken you more energy to create more waves. That's because in the process of creating more waves, you also created more nodes and nodes are always associated with an increase in energy. Again, let's take a look at what his means in terms of the principal quantum number. An electron wave with a ''lower principal quantum number'' has ''fewer nodes'', and thus will also have a ''lower energy''. On the other hand, an electron wave with a ''higher principal quantum number'' has ''more nodes'' and thus will have a ''higher energy''.

Notice that as ''n'' increases, both the &quot;size&quot; of the electron wave and the number of nodes it has increase as well. As a result, the energy of an electron wave always increases with ''n''.

# The bigger value of the ''n'', the higher the energy.
# The smaller the value of ''n'', the lower the energy.

Since the principal quantum number determines the energy of a particular electron wave, ''n'' is often thought of as referring to the &quot;energy level&quot; of the electron. The term &quot;energy level&quot; actually comes from Bohr's old solar system model of the atom. Thanks to Schrödinger, and his wave equation, though, we now know that the energy level doesn't correspond to a particular orbit around the nucleus, but rather, to a particular electron wave adopted by the electron when it becomes trapped inside the atom.

==The Angular Momentum Quantum Number (Sub-levels, ''s'', ''p'', ''d'', ''f'')==
The second quantum number, known as the '''azimuthal quantum number''', is given the symbol ''ℓ''. While the principal quantum number told you about the &quot;size&quot; of an electron wave and the number of nodes in an electron wave, the azimuthal quantum number tells you more about the &quot;shape&quot; of an electron wave. In other words, the shape that the electron wave appears to have as a result of its electron density being &quot;thicker&quot; in one place than it is in another. You might be tempted to think that the shape of an electron wave is always spherical because the atom itself is spherical. It turns out, however, that while there are spherical electron waves, there are also waves that look like dumb-bells and waves that look like butterflies, and waves that look so crazy it's almost impossible to describe them! Some of the different
possible shapes for electron waves are shown in the figure below.

{{multiple image

| image2    = Hydrogen eigenstate n2 l1 m0.png
| image3    = D3M1.png
| image4    = Hydrogen eigenstate n3 l1 m-1.png
}}

You might wonder about the various balloon-like shapes in the figure above. One difficulty with using drawings to represent electron waves is that the electron density itself is actually spread over a ''huge'' region of space surrounding the center of the atom. As you learned earlier, though, for many electron waves, almost ''all'' of the electron density is in close to the nucleus of the atom, with only a tiny bit of electron density further out. Over the years, scientists have developed a standard way of drawing electron waves. Rather than trying to account for ''all'' of the electron density in an electron wave, scientists usually just draw &quot;balloons&quot; around the region of space that contains about 90% of the electron wave's total electron density. The figure below shows how scientists convert a cloud of electron density into a balloon. Even though there is a little bit of electron density outside of the cartoon balloons (and thus a small probability of finding the electron outside of its balloon), most electron behavior can be understood by ignoring the tiny bit of electron density that the cartoon balloon doesn't capture.

[[File:Electron density balloons.png|500px|center]]

The exact shape of the cartoon balloon representing an electron wave is determined by the value of ''ℓ''. In other words, the dumb-bell shaped balloon in the image above has one value of ''ℓ'', while the butterfly-shaped balloon has another value of ''ℓ''. Of course, scientists would get pretty tired of saying things like &quot;the dumb-bell shaped wave&quot;, or &quot;the butterfly shaped wave&quot;, so instead, they name the different waves using letters from the alphabet. The most common shapes for waves are called ''s'', ''p'', ''d'' and ''f''. (You would probably find it a lot easier to remember what the different waves looked like if scientists had given them nice descriptive names, like the &quot;dumb-bell wave&quot; or the &quot;butterfly wave&quot;, but boring names like ''s'', ''p'', ''d'' and ''f'' turn out to be much more convenient).

In the next lesson, we'll take a closer look at exactly what some of the common wave shapes look like. First, though, we have to consider the relationship between ''n'' and ''ℓ''. Remember that a wave function for an electron always has three quantum numbers. In order to fully describe an electron wave, then, you have to know the values of all three of these numbers (''n'', ''ℓ'' and ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt;). Now you might think that as long as ''n'', ''ℓ ''and ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt; are all integers, the wave that they describe will be a perfectly good electron wave. But that's ''not'' the way it works. It turns out that for a particular value of ''n'', only certain values of ''ℓ'' are allowed.

For wave functions that actually describe electrons in an atom, ''ℓ'' is always no less than 0, but also no more than ''n'' − 1 (''ℓ'' = 0, 1, 2, … ''n'' − 1). The following examples should help to clarify the restriction on ''ℓ''.
{{High School Chemistry/Example|Example 1}}
What are the allowable values of ''ℓ'' for an electron wave with ''n'' = 3?
----
'''Solution''':

''n'' = 3

1. Find the minimum value of ''ℓ''.

:The minimum value of ''ℓ'' is always 0.

2. Find the maximum value of ''ℓ''.

:The maximum value of ''ℓ'' is always ''n'' – 1
:maximum ''ℓ'' = ''n'' − 1
:maximum ''ℓ'' = 3 − 1
:maximum ''ℓ'' = 2

3. List ''all'' of the integers (no decimals!) starting from the minimum value of ''ℓ'' and ending with the maximum value of ''ℓ''.

:''ℓ'' = 0, 1, 2

What are the allowable values of ''ℓ'' for an electron wave with ''n'' = 1?

'''Solution''':

''n'' = 1

1. Find the minimum value of ''ℓ''.

:The minimum value of ''ℓ'' is always 0.

2. Find the maximum value of ''ℓ''.

:The maximum value of ''ℓ'' is always ''n'' − 1
:maximum ''ℓ'' = ''n'' − 1
:maximum ''ℓ'' = 0

3. List ''all'' of the integers (no decimals!) starting from the minimum value of ''ℓ'' and ending with the maximum value of ''ℓ''.

:''ℓ'' = 0
{{Robox/Close}}

Often, scientists will refer the different values of ''ℓ'' as ''electron sublevels''. In a hydrogen atom with one electron, the value of ''ℓ'' has ''no'' effect on the energy of the electron. However, in an atom with ''more'' than one electron, the value of ''ℓ'' does have a ''small'' effect on the electron's energy. In other words, the principle quantum number, ''n'', always determines the overall energy level of an electron, but that energy level is actually divided into multiple sublevels based on the value of ''ℓ''. All of these sublevels have equal energy in a hydrogen atom, because the hydrogen atom only has one electron. For atoms with more than one electron, though, the different sublevels split apart, and some of them end up having more energy than others.

==''m''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt; = Magnetic Quantum Number (Identifies Orbital)==
The third, and final quantum number, known as the '''magnetic quantum number''', is given the symbol ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt;. Remember, the principal quantum number told you about the &quot;size&quot; of an electron wave and the number of nodes in an electron wave, while the azimuthal quantum number told you more about the &quot;shape&quot; of an electron wave. The magnetic quantum number, though, gives you even more information about what the electron wave looks like. The magnetic quantum number tells you how the electron wave is orientated in space.

Orientation in space basically means where the electron wave points. Take a look at the two dumb-bell shaped electron waves shown in Figure 6.14 (in the next lesson, you'll learn that these are actually ''p'' orbitals). In the first electron wave, lobes of the wave point &quot;up-and- down&quot; along the ''z''-axis, while in the second electron wave, the lobes of the wave point &quot;in-and-out&quot; along the ''x''-axis. These two electron waves have different orientations in space, and thus different values for the quantum number ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt;.

[[File:Electron wave dumb-bell shape.png|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 6.14''': Two possible orientations for an electron wave with a dumb-bell shape.]]

Now compare Figure 6.14 with Figure 6.15. In both figures, the electron wave has a different orientation in space, as indicated by the red arrow. But what do you notice about the orientations of the electron wave in Figure 6.15? They look the same, don't they? Obviously, orientation doesn't matter for the spherical electron wave. In other words, because the spherical electron wave looks the same no matter how you rotate it, there's really just ''one'' orientation. So how many different ml values should an electron wave with a spherical shape have (remember, ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt; values are used to describe orientation)? Clearly, an electron wave with a spherical shape should only have one ml value, because it only has ''one'' possible orientation. What about an orbital with a dumb-bell shape? Should it have a single ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt; value, or should it have several different ml values? Well, since different orientations of the dumb-bell shaped wave actually ''look'' different, you'd probably expect the dumb-bell shaped
wave to have several different ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt; values, one for each possible orientation. In fact, the dumb-bell shaped wave actually has three possible values for ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt;, and so it has three possible orientations. (Don't worry about why there are ''exactly'' three orientations for the dumb-bell shaped wave. We'll talk a little bit about that in the next lesson, but the full explanation requires a lot of math that you'll learn about if you decide to study quantum physics or quantum chemistry). Hopefully, by comparing Figures 14 and 15, you should be convinced that the ''shape'' of the wave (which depends on ''ℓ'') is important when it comes to determining the number of possible orientations (or the number of possible ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt; values). It shouldn't be surprising, then, that for any given value of ''ℓ'', only certain ml values are allowed if you want to end up with a wave function that makes sense and actually describes electrons in a hydrogen atom.

[[File:Electron wave spherical shape.png|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 6.15''': Two possible orientations for an electron wave with a spherical shape. Notice that there isn't a noticeable difference between these orientations.]]

For a particular value of ''ℓ'', only certain values of ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt; are allowed.

The rule for ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt; is that for any value of ''ℓ'', ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt; can be any integer starting from −''ℓ'' and ending at +''ℓ''. ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt; = −''ℓ'' … +ℓ''''). The following examples should help to clarify the restriction on ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt;.
{{High School Chemistry/Example|Example 3}}
What are the allowable values of ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt; for an electron wave with ''ℓ'' = 2?
----

''ℓ'' = 2

1. Find the minimum value of ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt;.

:The minimum value of ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt; is '''always''' −''ℓ''.
:minimum ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt; = −2

2. Find the maximum value of ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt;.

Now that we’ve talked about all three of the different quantum numbers, you should have a good understanding of how different electron waves can be described. You can describe the &quot;size&quot; of an electron wave, and the number of nodes in an electron wave using the principal quantum number, ''n''. You can describe the shape of an electron wave using the azimuthal quantum number, ''ℓ''. Finally, you can describe the orientation of the electron wave using the magnetic quantum number, ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt;. Since you know how to describe a general electron wave, it's time to look at several examples of specific electron waves. That’s what we'll talk about in the next lesson.

==Lesson Summary==
* Schrödinger discovered that in order for a wave function to describe a standing wave that was continuous, and that didn't &quot;doubled back&quot; on itself, certain quantities in his wave function had to have integer values.
* The quantities in the wave function which must have integer values are known as quantum numbers.
* In the wave function for hydrogen, there are three quantum numbers. They are called the principal quantum number (''n''), the azimuthal quantum number (''ℓ)'', and the magnetic quantum number (''m''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt;).
* The principal quantum number can only have positive integer values, (''n'' = 1, 2, 3 …).
* The principal quantum number determines how far the bulk of the electron density extends from the center of the atom. The higher the value of ''n'', the further away from the nucleus you will be able to detect a significant amount of electron density.
* The principal quantum number also determines the number of nodes in an electron standing wave. The higher the value of ''n'', the more nodes there are in the electron wave.
* The higher the principal quantum number, the greater the energy of the electron. Therefore the principal quantum number is determines the ''energy level'' of the electron.
* The azimuthal quantum number, ''ℓ'', determines the shape of the electron wave. The values of ''ℓ'' are also called the ''electron sublevels''. They are labeled with the letters ''s'', ''p'', ''d'', ''f'', ''g'', ''h'', etc.
* For a wave function that actually describes an electron in an atom, ''ℓ'' is always no less than zero, but also no more than ''n'' − 1 (''ℓ'' = 0, 1, 2 … ''n'' − 1).
* In atoms with more than one electron, ''ℓ'' has a small effect on the electron's energy.
* The magnetic quantum number, ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt;, determines how the electron wave is orientated in space. For any given value of ''ℓ'', ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt; can be any integer from −''ℓ'' to + ''ℓ'' (''m''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt; = −''ℓ'' … +''ℓ'').
# Match each quantum number with the property that they describe.&lt;table class=&quot;wikitable&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;(a) ''n''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;i. shape&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;(b) ''ℓ''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;ii. orientation in space&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;(c) ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;iii. number of nodes&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
# A point in an electron wave where there is zero electron density is called a _________.
# Choose the correct word in each of the following statements.
#: (a) The (higher/lower) the value of ''n'', the more nodes there are in the electron standing wave.
#: (b) The (higher/lower) the value of ''n'', the less energy the electron has.
#: (c) The (more/less) energy the electron has, the more nodes there are in its electron standing wave.
# Fill in the blank. For lower values of ''n'', the electron density is typically found ________ the nucleus of the atom, while for higher values of ''n'', the electron density is typically found __________the nucleus of the atom.
# Circle all of the statements that make sense: Schrodinger discovered that certain quantities in the electron wave equation had to be integers, because when they weren't, the wave equation described waves which…
#: (a) were discontinuous
#: (b) were too small
#: (c) were too long and narrow
#: (d) were too short and fat
#: (e) &quot;doubled back&quot; on themselves
# What are the allowed values of ''ℓ'' for an electron standing wave with ''n'' = 4?
# How many values of ''ℓ'' are possible for an electron standing wave with ''n'' = 9?
# What are the allowed values of ml for an electron standing wave with ''ℓ'' = 3?
# How many different orientations are possible for an electron standing wave with ''ℓ'' = 4?
# What are the allowed values of ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt; for ''n'' = 2?

: Determines the orientation of the electron standing wave in space.
; node
: A place where the electron wave has zero height. In other words, it is a place where there is no electron density.
; principal quantum number (''n'')
: Defines the energy level of the wave function for an electron, the size of the electron's standing wave, and the number of nodes in that wave.

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are many components inside the computer that can be upgraded.

'''Graphics Card:'''
The graphics card inside a computer can allow for different resolutions, improved graphical processing power, and increased pixel display capability.  

'''Motherboard:'''
Upgrading your mother board can allow for more space for CPU fans, additional input slots(USB, firewire, etc.), compatibility with CPU's, and extra input slots for multiple hard drives.

'''RAM(Random Access Memory):'''
Having more RAM will result in your computer &quot;thinking&quot; quicker and being able to handle heavier data loads more smoothly.  You will be able to run applications and games with less lag, or choppiness. 

'''Hard Drive:'''
Buying a new hard drive can provide many benefits.  You can increase your data storage capabilities on a cheap budget by opting for a HDD(hard disk drive), they are cheaper than SSD's(solid state drive) but not as fast and are susceptible to crashing.  SSD's on the other hand offer increased speed and no chance of crashing(due to the absence of moving parts inside), but at a much heftier price.

'''Cooling System:'''
There are advanced cooling systems that utilize water, but the majority of traditional computer cooling comes from fans.  Mini fans can be purchased and added in the amount determined by whichever case you purchase.  Your motherboard also has a limited amount of inputs for fans, so it may need to be upgraded as well.

'''Tower(Case computer is in):'''
Choosing an appropriate tower is very important because computer components all vary in size.  You may need a large case just for a large motherboard to fit, or you might be designing a computer to minimize clutter and therefore opt for a smaller tower.  You need room for air to flow though, so parts don't overheat and break.  Keeping your computer cool is part of properly maintaining it.

Las Vegas is a very congested place, with millions of tourists who visit every year.  Getting around Vegas and its surrounding areas by rail is faster, more efficient, and environmentally friendly.  Therefore, this Wikibook's aim is to cover the basics of rail transport in Las Vegas.  This Wikibook is closely related to the larger [[Getting around Los Angeles by Rail]] project.

==Contributing Timeline==
This timeline will record the progress of the book as it expands.  The timeline was last updated on September 16, 2011.

===September 2011===
*Book created

===Future Goals===
*All pages should be created and expanded to 25% by the end of October.
*A title banner like the one for [[Getting around Los Angeles by Rail]] would be appreciated.
*This book isn't very large.  If at any time a Las Vegas Wikibook is created, this should be immediately merged into that book in some &quot;Transportation&quot; category (e.g. Las Vegas/Transportation/Rail Transport).
*Templates and route maps will eventually be implemented across this Wikibook.

Thanks for all your help!

      <text xml:space="preserve">The ratio of crushed wafers to powdered sugar is way off.  It should be about 2.5c of wafers to 1c of powdered sugar.  I would also suggest several variations.  Soak about 1 - 1 1/2c of Raisins in rum overnight and then chop them up.  Use this as a substitute to the corn syrup.  Any excess rum can be used as part of the quotient of rum.  Use a 50/50 mix of aged rum and a coffee liquor such as Kahlua or Tia Maria.  Add mini-chocolate chips, and about 1/8 - 1/4c turkish ground coffee.  Any good coffee bean ground to a turkish grind is fine.  A turkish grind will be a fine powder.  And a final suggestion is use orange marmalade instead of corn syrup, and a 50/50 blend of aged rum and either triple sec or Cointreau.  I would also add the mini chocolate chips to this one as well. 

Omit the chopped pecans if anyone has an allergy to them.  Or add chopped almonds, toasted to enhance their flavor.

If batter is too thin, add some crushed wafers.  If batter is to dry, add more liquids sparingly.

== A recipe on rum balls without rum? ==

I find this recipe a bit weird. Of course it could be done and it might taste excellent, but as an example-recipe for rum balls, it just fails. Please put up a recipe for rum balls ''with'' rum.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[agriculture]], '''crop yield''' (also known as &quot;agricultural output&quot;) is not only a measure of the yield of cereal per unit area of land under [[tillage|cultivation]], '''yield''' is also the seed generation of the plant itself (e.g. one wheat grain produces a stalk yielding three grain, or 1:3).{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} The figure, 1:3 is considered by [[agronomists]] as the minimum required to sustain human life.&lt;ref&gt;Pipes, Richard, ''Russia under the Old Regime'' (Charles Scribner's Sons, NY 1974) p.8&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the three seeds must be set aside for the next planting season, the remaining two either consumed by the grower, or one for human consumption and the other for livestock feed{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}. 
The higher the surplus, the more livestock can be established and maintained, thereby increasing the physical and economic well-being of the farmer and his family. This, in turn, resulted in better stamina, better over-all health, and better, more efficient work. In addition, the more the surplus the more draft animals -- horse and oxen -- could be supported and harnessed to work, and manure, the soil thereby easing the farmer's burden.
Increased crop yields meant few hands were needed on farm, freeing them for industry and commerce. This, in turn, led to the formation and growth of cities. 

Formation and growth of cities meant an increased demand for food stuffs by non-farmers, and their willingness to pay for it. This, in turn, led the farmer to (further) innovation, more intensive farming, the demand/creation of new and/or improved farming implements, and a quest for improved seed which improved crop yield. Thus allowing the farmer to raise his income by bringing more food to non-farming (city) markets.

==History==
Historically speaking, a major increase in crop yield took place in the early eighteenth century with the end of the ancient, wasteful cycle of the three-course system of [[crop rotation]] whereby a third of the land lay fallow every year and hence taken out of human food, and animal feed, production. 

It was to be replaced by the four-course system of crop rotation, devised in England in 1730 by Viscount [[Charles Townshend]] or &quot;Turnip&quot; Townshend during the [[British Agricultural Revolution]],&lt;ref&gt;Durant, Will, ''The History of Civilization: Vol. IX The Age of Voltaire'' p.47&lt;/ref&gt; as he was called by early detractors.

In the ''first year'' [[wheat]] or [[oats]] were planted; in the ''second year'' [[barley]] or oats; in the ''third year'' [[clover]], [[rye]], [[rutabaga]] and/or [[kale]] were planted; in the ''fourth year'' [[turnips]] were planted but not harvested. Instead, sheep were driven on to the turnip fields to eat the crop, trample the leavings under their feet into the soil, and by doing all this, fertilize the land with their droppings. In the fifth year (or ''first year'' of the new rotation), the cycle began once more with a planting of wheat or oats, in an average, a thirty percent increased yield{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}.

Realize that when working alone you are limited to what you can manage on your own. Most things that you have no experience with will put you in a learning curve, and you will mostly fail to successfully deal with what you don't know or understand, this resource consuming being time one of the more important one.

When working alone prioritization becomes a matter of life and death, with the only positive factor that if you fail you are the only one that will pay for it.

== Team Work ==
Spreading task between various elements will get things going faster and safer, since risks are also shared. It is in human nature to cooperate and join together to face adversity. Depending on the situation your best chance will be to act on what humanity has done for time immemorial and join a larger group of people.

In the last lesson, we learned how the principal quantum number determines the size of an electron wave (and the number of nodes), ''ℓ'' determines the shape of an electron wave, and ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt; determines the orientation of an electron wave. Now the effects of ''n'' are probably easy to visualize. For bigger values of ''n'', the electron wave gets bigger, and it ends up with more nodes. Similarly, the effects of ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt; are easy to visualize as well. For different values of ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt;, the electron wave gets rotated into different orientations. In other words, the electron wave points in different directions. What about the effects of ''ℓ''? You know that ''ℓ'' tells you something about the shape of the electron wave. You also know that certain waves are spherical while others are dumb-bell shaped, or butterfly shaped or just plain crazy shaped! But how do you know which value of ''ℓ'' corresponds to ''which'' shape?

Unless you have a lot of training in mathematics, and can understand the wave function, there's really no way for you to predict what the shape of a wave with a particular value of ''ℓ'' will look like. Really, you just have to know, or be told – so that's what we'll do in the next few sections. We'll ''tell'' you what an ''ℓ''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 wave looks like, and what an ''ℓ''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 wave looks like.

==Lesson Objectives==
* Define an electron orbital.
* Be able to recognize ''s'' orbitals by their shape.
* Be able to recognize ''p'' orbitals by their shape.

==When the Azimuthal Quantum Number is 0, The Electron Occupies an ''s'' Orbital==
In the last lesson, you learned that different electron wave shapes have different names, and that these names are always letters of the alphabet like ''s'', ''p'', ''d'', and ''f''. (These letters were chosen on the basis of observations of line spectra. Certain lines were observed as a &quot;sharp&quot; series; others were classified as &quot;principal&quot;, &quot;diffuse&quot;, or &quot;fundamental&quot; series, thus ''s'', ''p'', ''d'', ''f''.) These letters correspond to the shape of the electron wave, or at least the shape that the electron wave appears to take as a result of its electron density being thicker in one place than it is in the other. Now this can get a little confusing, but remember, electron waves describe electron density, or electron &quot;fog&quot; which comes from interpreting the wave-like properties of the electron. Nevertheless, we always have to be careful that we don’t forget about the particle-like properties of the electron as well. As a result, once scientists know the shape of a particular electron wave, they will often switch and start describing the electron as a particle again. To do this, they use the name for the shape of the wave, but rather than saying &quot;the ''electron wave'' has an ''s'' shape&quot;, or &quot;the ''electron wave'' has a ''p'' shape&quot;, they will say &quot;the ''electron'' is ''in'' an ''s'' orbital&quot;, or &quot;the ''electron'' is ''in'' a ''p'' orbital&quot;. This makes it sound as if the electron is a particle again, and as if the orbital is some sort of box that the particle is confined to, or at least some sort of territory that the particle patrols.

This switching back and forth between the wave-like description of the electron and the particle-like description of the electron may seem confusing, or annoying, or just plain strange, but scientists do it to remind themselves that electrons are ''both'' particles ''and'' waves. So exactly what ''is'' an '''orbital'''? Technically speaking, an orbital is a wave function for an electron defined by the three quantum numbers, ''n'', ''ℓ'' and ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt;. What the wave function describes, though, is a region in space with a particular shape, where you are likely to find an electron. In terms of waves, the orbital describes the region in space where the electron density is very thick. In terms of particles, the orbital describes the region in space where there is a high probability of finding the electron (which should make sense, because wherever the electron density is thick, there is also a high probability of finding the electron).

So far we've decided that ''ℓ'' describes the shape of an orbital, which in turn describes where the electron density is thick (and there is a high probability of finding the electron) and where the electron density is thin (and there is a low probability of finding the electron). We're still, however, working towards a description of what these waves with regions of thick and thin electron density actually look like. Let's begin with the simplest wave shape. The simplest wave shape occurs for ''ℓ''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0. Whenever an electron wave is described by the quantum number ''ℓ''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, we say that the wave function describes what's known as an ''s'' wave and thus the electron is in an ''s'' orbital. ''s'' waves can be big or small, depending on the value of ''n''. ''s'' waves can also have a huge number of nodes, or no nodes at all, again depending on the value of ''n''. What all ''s'' waves have in common, though, is their shape. That's what we'll talk about in the next section.

==''s'' Sublevels are Spherically Shaped==
All ''ℓ''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 electron waves are s waves, or waves from the ''s'' sublevel, and they all describe electrons in ''s'' orbitals. As suggested in the previous section, all electron waves from the ''s'' sublevel have the same overall shape, regardless of the value of ''n'', regardless of their size, and regardless of the number of nodes they contain. ''s'' orbitals always correspond to spherical waves. The quantum numbers ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 and ''ℓ''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 describe a small spherical wave with no nodes, the quantum numbers ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2 and ''ℓ''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 describe a larger spherical wave with a single node, and the quantum numbers ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3 and ''ℓ''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 describe an even larger spherical wave with two nodes. These waves all look slightly different, as shown in Figure 6.16.

[[File:S orbitals.png|frame|center|'''Figure 6.16''': Various ''s'' orbitals. All of these orbitals have ''ℓ''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, but they have different values for ''n''. The first orbital has ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, and thus is small and has no nodes. The second orbital has ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2, and thus is larger and has one node. The third orbital has ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3, and thus is even larger and has two nodes.]]
[[File:Orbital s1.png|200px|thumb|'''Figure 6.17''': Notice that the amount of electron density (here represented by the intensity of the blue color) doesn't depend on direction. It does, however, depend on distance from the center of the atom.]]

Nevertheless, they are all spherical, because they all have ''ℓ''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0. Their shapes don't change – only their sizes and the number of nodes that they contain.

Now if you think back to an earlier lesson, you might remember something special about the different orientations of a spherical wave. Do you remember what happened when we rotated the spherical wave so that it pointed in different directions? It ended up looking the same, didn't it! No matter which way you rotate a sphere, it always looks the same. So how many different ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt; values do you expect for a spherical wave? One, of course! Now that you know spherical waves all have ''ℓ''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, you can use your rules for ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt; to figure out exactly how many different ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt; are allowed. If you look back to Example 4 in the previous lesson, you'll see that we actually did that calculation. It turned out that there was only ''one'' allowable value for ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt;, and that was ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0. In other words, there is only ''one'' orientation of a spherical wave. It all makes sense!

So what does a spherical wave really mean? It means that your probability of finding an electron at any particular distance from the center of the atom ''only'' depends on the distance, and ''not'' on the direction. You can see this in Figure 6.17.

==When the Azimuthal Quantum Number is 1, then ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt; Can Only Be -1, 0 or +1==
All ''ℓ''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 electron waves are ''p'' waves, or waves from the ''p'' sublevel, and they describe electrons in what are known as ''p'' orbitals. Unlike ''s'' orbitals, ''p'' orbitals are not spherical, so they ''can'' have different orientations in space. Now that you know all ''p'' orbitals have ''ℓ''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, you should be able to figure out exactly ''how many'' different ''p'' orbital orientations exist by using your rules for ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt;. (''m''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt; is the quantum number associated with the orientation of a particular orbital). Let's figure it out.
{{High School Chemistry/Example|Example 1}}
How many different ''p'' orbital orientations are possible?
----
'''Solution''':

''ℓ'' = 1

From now on, whenever you're told an electron is in a ''p'' orbital, you're expected to know that electron has the quantum number ''ℓ''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1.

The question asks how many ''p'' orbital orientations are possible, but what it's really asking is how many different ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt; values are allowed when ''ℓ''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1. We've already done this type of problem.

1. Find the minimum value of ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt;.

:The minimum value of ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt; is '''always''' −''ℓ''.
:minimum ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt; = −1

2. Find the maximum value of ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt;.

:The maximum value of ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt; is always +''ℓ''
:maximum ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt; = +1

3. List all of the integers (no decimals!) starting from the minimum value of ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt; and ending with the maximum value of ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt;.

:''m''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt; = −1, 0, 1

In this case ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt; can equal −1, 0 or 1, so there are a total of 3 allowed values for ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt;, and thus 3 possible ''p'' orbital orientations.
{{Robox/Close}}

==The ''p'' Orbitals are Often Described as Dumb-bell Shaped==
Even though you know that there are three possible orientations for ''p'' orbitals, you can't really predict their shape unless you know a lot more about mathematics, physics, and wave functions. When scientists use the wave function to draw the shape of an electron's ''p'' orbital, though, they always end up with is something that looks a lot like a dumb-bell. Not only that, the three different ''p'' orbitals (one with ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt; = −1, another with ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, and the third with ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1) turn out to be perpendicular to each other. In other words, if one ''p'' orbital points along the ''x''-axis, another ''p'' orbital points along the ''y''-axis, and the third points along the ''z''-axis. Scientists typically label these three orbitals ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;, and ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;/sub&gt; respectively. The below figure shows each of the three ''p'' orbitals separately, and then all three together on the same atom.

[[File:Px py pz orbitals.png|525px|center]]

Sometimes we get so caught up thinking about electron wave functions, and electron orbitals, that we forget entirely about the atom itself. Remember, electron standing waves form because electrons get trapped inside an atom by the positive charge on the atom's nucleus. As a result, ''s'' orbitals, and ''p'' orbitals and even ''d'' and ''f'' orbitals always extend out from the atom's nucleus. Don't get so caught up in orbitals that you forget where they are and why they exist.

As with ''s'' orbitals, ''p'' orbitals can be big or small, depending on the value of ''n'', and they can
also have more or less nodes, also depending on the value of ''n''. Notice, however, that unlike
the ''s'' orbital, which can have no nodes at all, a ''p'' orbital always has at least one node. Take
a look at the ''p'' orbital figure above again. Can you spot the node in each of the ''p'' orbitals?
Since all ''p'' orbitals have at least one node, there are no p orbitals with ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1. In fact, the
first principal quantum number, ''n'', for which ''p'' orbitals are allowed is ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2. Of course you
could have figured that out for yourself, right? No? Well, here’s a hint – remember the rules
for predicting which values of ''ℓ'' are allowed for any given value of ''n''. In the last lesson, you
learned that ''ℓ'' must be no less than 0, but also, no greater than ''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1. For the ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 energy
level, then, the maximum allowed value for ''ℓ'' is:

:maximum ''ℓ'' = ''n'' − 1
:maximum ''ℓ'' = 1 − 1
:maximum ''ℓ'' = 0

As a result, only ''s'' orbitals (''ℓ'' = 0) are allowed. For the ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2 energy level, though, the maximum allowed value for ''ℓ'' is

:maximum ''ℓ'' = ''n'' − 1
:maximum ''ℓ'' = 2 − 1
:maximum ''ℓ'' = 1

which means ''p'' orbitals (''ℓ'' = 1) are allowed as well. So now you see that the restrictions on ''ℓ'' are actually there to make sure that all ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 wave functions have no nodes, all ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2 wave functions have 1 node, all ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3 wave functions have 2 nodes, all… well, you get the picture.

One interesting property of ''p'' orbitals that is different from ''s'' orbitals is that the total amount of electron density changes with ''both'' the distance from the center of the atom and the direction. Take a look at Figure 6.18. Notice how the electron density is different depending on which direction you travel from the center of the atom out. In the particular ''p'' orbital shown, the probability of finding the electron is greater as you head straight up from the center of the atom than it is as you head straight to the left or to the right of the atom. It turns out that this dependence on direction is very important when it comes to studying how different atoms interact and form bonds. We'll talk more about that in a later chapter.

[[File:P orbital electron density.png|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 6.18''': For ''p'' orbitals, the amount of electron density, and thus the probability of finding an electron, depends on both the distance from the center of the atom ''and'' the direction.]]

==The ''d'' Orbitals and ''f'' Orbitals are Not Easily Visualized==
Did you notice how the ''p'' orbitals looked a lot fancier than the simple spherical ''s'' orbitals? Well, you can imagine that if ''p'' orbitals with ''ℓ''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 are fancy, then ''d'' orbitals, with ''ℓ''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2 are even fancier, and ''f'' orbitals, with ''ℓ''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3 are just plain crazy! Most people can visualize ''p'' orbitals, but ''d'' orbitals and ''f'' orbitals are actually rather difficult to imagine. Most ''d'' orbitals are butterfly shaped, although one has an unusual shape that looks like a doughnut surrounding a Q-tip! The 5 possible ''d'' orbitals are shown in Figure 6.19 (and you could have figured out that there were 5, right?). Don't worry too much about why one of the ''d'' orbitals is different. Again, it takes a lot of complex math to understand where the different ''d'' orbital pictures came from, and you won't have to worry about that unless you decide to go on and study quantum chemistry at the university level. As for ''f'' orbitals, they are even hard to draw, not to mention the fact that there are a total of 7 of them (Figure 6.20)! We won't be too concerned with ''d'' orbitals in this course, although they do become very important if you want to study certain metals like those found in the center of the periodic table. Similarly, ''f'' orbitals aren't all that important when it comes to common chemicals like hydrogen, or oxygen, or even copper. They do become important, though when you want to study some of the most important radioactive elements like uranium and plutonium!

==Lesson Summary==
* An orbital is a wave function for an electron defined by the three quantum numbers, ''n'', ''ℓ'' and ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt;. Orbitals define regions in space where you are likely to find electrons.
* ''s'' orbitals (''ℓ'' = 0) are spherical shaped.
* ''p'' orbitals (''ℓ'' = 1) are dumb-bell shaped.
* The three possible ''p'' orbitals are always perpendicular to each other.

==Review Questions==
# Fill in the blanks. When ''ℓ'' = 0, the electron orbital is _________ and when ''ℓ'' = 1, the electron orbital is _________ shaped.
# The ''n'' = 1 ''s'' orbital has _____ nodes.
# The ''n'' = 2 ''s'' orbital has _____ nodes.
# The ''n'' = 2 ''p'' orbital has _____ nodes.
# The ''n'' = 1 ''p'' orbital has _____ nodes.
# There are ____ different ''p'' orbitals.
# What energy level (or value of ''n'') has ''s'', ''p'' and ''d'' orbitals, but no ''f'' orbitals?
# How many different ''d'' orbital orientations are there?
# How many ''f'' orbital orientations are there?
# How many different orbitals are there in the ''n'' = 3 energy level?

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Gustatory System or sense of taste allows us to perceive different flavors from substances like food, drinks, medicine etc.
Molecules that we taste or tastants are sensed by cells in our mouth, which send information to the brain. These specialized cells are called taste cells and can sense 5 main tastes: bitter, salty, sweet, sour and umami (savory). 
All the variety of flavors that we know are combinations of molecules which fall into these categories.

Measuring the degree by which a substance presents one of the basic tastes is done subjectively by comparing its taste to a taste of a reference substance according to relative indexes of different substances. For the bitter taste quinine (found in tonic water) is used to rate how bitter a substance is. Saltiness can be rated by comparing to a dilute salt solution. The sourness is compared to diluted hydrochloric acid (H+Cl-). Sweetness is measured relative to sucrose. The values of these reference substances are defined as 1.

===Bitter===
(Coffee, mate, beer, tonic water etc.)

It is considered by many as unpleasant. In general bitterness is very interesting because a large number of bitter compounds are known to be toxic so the bitter taste is considered to provide an important protective function. Plant leafs often contain toxic compounds. Herbivores have a tendency to prefer immature leaves, which have higher protein content and lower poison levels than mature leaves. 
It seems that even if the bitter taste is not very pleasant at first, there is a tendency to overcome this aversion because coffee and drinks containing rich amount of caffeine and are widely consumed.
Sometimes bitter agents are added to substances to prevent accidental ingestion. 

===Salty===
(Table salt)

The salty taste is primarily produced by the presence of cations such as Li+ (lithium ions), K+ (potassium ions) and more commonly Na+ (sodium). The saltiness of substances is compared to sodium chloride, which is typically used as table salt (Na+Cl-). Potassium chloride K+Cl- is the principal ingredient used in salt substitutes and has an index of 0.6 (see bellow part 5) compared to 1 of Na+Cl-.

===Sour===
(Lemon, orange, wine, spoiled milk and candies containing citric acid)

Sour taste can be mildly pleasant and it is linked to salty flavor but more exacerbated. Typically sour are fruits, which are over-riped, spoiled milk, rotten meat, and other spoiled foods, which can be dangerous. It also tastes acids (H+ ions) which taken in large quantities can cause irreversible tissue damage. 
Sourness is rated compared to hydrochloric acid (H+Cl-), which has a sourness index of 1. 

===Sweet===
(Sucrose (table sugar), cake, ice cream etc.)

Sweetness is regarded as a pleasant sensation and is produced by the presence of mostly sugars. Sweet substances are rated relative to sucrose, which has an index of 1. 
Nowadays there are many artificial sweeteners in the market, these include saccharin, aspartame and sucralose but it is still not clear how these substitutes activate the receptors.

===Umami (savory or tasty)===
(Cheese, soy sauce etc.)

Recently, monosodium glutamate (umami) has been added as the fifth taste.   This taste signals the presence of L-glutamate and it is a very important for the Eastern cuisines.

Our GLUT tutorials can be run on Android using the simple provided wrapper.

Note: the wrapper will be integrated in the next official [http://freeglut.sf.net/ FreeGLUT] (version 3.0)!

= Making-of =

To understand of the GLUT wrapper works internally, see [[../../Android_GLUT_Wrapper|Android GLUT Wrapper]].

= Dependencies =

First you'll need a minimal Java development environment:
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
sudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jdk ant
&lt;/source&gt;

Then get the Android NDK r9d from [http://developer.android.com/ Android Developers] to compile C/C++ code for Android.

Last you need to install the Android API level 10, get the Android SDK from the same site and use the &lt;tt&gt;android&lt;/tt&gt; graphical tool to install it.

The programs themselves may also require the GLM and FreeType libraries - see the dedicated sections below.

== Emulator (lack of) support for OpenGL ES 2.0 ==

The Android emulator only supports OpenGL ES 2.0 since April 2012, requires a specific emulator configuration and system image, and doesn't seem to work on all platforms.

Also beware that the &quot;API Demos&quot; applications ships an &quot;OpenGL ES 2.0&quot; sample that silently and confusingly falls back to OpenGL ES 1.0 if 2.0 is not available, so it's not a good test to see if OpenGL ES 2.0 is supported.

It's still best to experiment with OpenGL 2.0 on Android with a [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/APIs,_Libraries_and_acronyms#Hardware_support|supporting device]].

Official documentation: https://developer.android.com/tools/devices/emulator.html#accel-graphics

= Connecting with USB =

When you connect your device through USB, you can use the &lt;code&gt;adb&lt;/code&gt; command (from the Android SDK) to browse the filesystem, install applications, debug them, etc.

 $ adb devices
 List of devices attached 
 4520412B47C0207D	device

= Using our wrapper =

In this wikibook, the samples are based on the GLUT library.

Since GLUT is not ported to Android yet, we wrote a simple GLUT-compatible wrapper for Android (see the [https://gitorious.org/wikibooks-opengl/modern-tutorials/trees/master code repository]).

Note: the wrapper is still in its early life and may change in the near future.

== Compile tutorials code ==

Look at the 'android_wrapper/' directory.
* Plug your device (smartphone, tablet...) with USB
* Add the Android tools to your PATH, for instance:
 export PATH=&quot;$PATH:/usr/src/android-sdk-linux/tools:/usr/src/android-sdk-linux/platform-tools:/usr/src/android-ndk-r9d&quot;
* Inside the &lt;code&gt;jni/&lt;/code&gt; directory, make &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; a symlink to the GLUT code you need to compile (e.g. &lt;code&gt;ln -nfs ../../tut02_clean src&lt;/code&gt;)
* Make &lt;code&gt;assets&lt;/code&gt; a symlink to the tutorial you're compiling (e.g. &lt;code&gt;ln -s jni/src assets&lt;/code&gt;)
* Now you can type:
 make clean; make &amp;&amp; make install
* You'll get an &quot;OpenGL Wikibook&quot; application on your device, ready to run!

== Full-screen ==

To make your application full-screen, add this attribute in your AndroidManifest.xml
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;application
  ...
  android:theme=&quot;@android:style/Theme.NoTitleBar.Fullscreen&quot;
&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Keyboard ==

The default Android keyboard does not have keys such as F1/F2/F3.

Instead, you can use Hacker's Keyboard, an alternative input method with more keys:
* [http://code.google.com/p/hackerskeyboard/ homepage].
* [https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdfilter=hacker&amp;fdid=org.pocketworkstation.pckeyboard F-Droid] / [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.pocketworkstation.pckeyboard GPlay]

== Icon ==

Make sure your application has &lt;code&gt;android:icon&lt;/code&gt; defined in &lt;code&gt;AndroidManifest.xml&lt;/code&gt;:
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
    &lt;application ...
		 android:icon=&quot;@drawable/icon&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

Create two icons:
* res/drawable/icon.png (48x48)
* res/drawable-hdpi/icon.png (72x72)

Now your application will have a custom icon on the launcher.

= Debugging =

== Browsing standard output ==

If you want to see your program's standard outputs (stdout and stderr), you need to redirect them to the system log :

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
adb shell stop
adb shell setprop log.redirect-stdio true
adb shell start  # this may restart your Android session
&lt;/source&gt;

To check the log files, you can use:
* The command: adb logcat
* The 'monitor' utility, with its graphical GUI to browse the logs
* Eclipse, which embeds a LogCat viewer similar to 'monitor'

== Checking JNI calls ==

The following will turn on more checks when calling JNI from C/C++:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
adb shell stop
adb shell setprop dalvik.vm.checkjni true
adb shell start
&lt;/source&gt;

You'll get additional traces on the system log, and JNI will be more strict on what it accepts.

== GDB ==

GDB can be enabled too.

Note: in NDKr7, use the &quot;stabs&quot; format for debug symbols in Android.mk, otherwise GDB will show the wrong source code lines &lt;ref&gt;http://groups.google.com/group/android-ndk/browse_thread/thread/ebd969a055af3196&lt;/ref&gt;:
&lt;source lang=&quot;make&quot;&gt;
LOCAL_CXXFLAGS  := -gstabs+
&lt;/source&gt;


GDB requires a debug build, add NDK_DEBUG=1 when building your C++ code:
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
ndk-build NDK_DEBUG=1
&lt;/source&gt;

When starting gdb, make sure your AndroidManifest.xml mentions it's debuggable, otherwise gdb will behave badly (lack of thread information, crash, etc.):
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
    &lt;application ...
            android:hasCode=&quot;true&quot; android:debuggable=&quot;true&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

The gdb-server needs a few seconds to start on the device, so your program will start running before it can be paused by the debugger. A work-around is to add a wait in your &lt;code&gt;android_main&lt;/code&gt; function:
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
  sleep(5);
&lt;/source&gt;

To start the debug session, type:
 ndk-gdb --start

== Unable to load native library ==

If you get errors such as:
 E/AndroidRuntime( 3021): java.lang.RuntimeException: Unable to start activity
 ComponentInfo{org.wikibooks.OpenGL/android.app.NativeActivity}: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException:
 Unable to load native library: /data/data/org.wikibook.OpenGL/lib/libnative-activity.so
the system couldn't load your .so due to a low-level reason.

To get more information, you need to create a minimal Java application that loads the library manually:
* src/com/example/test_native_activity/Main.java
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
package com.example.test_native_activity;

import android.app.Activity;
import android.os.Bundle;

public class Main extends Activity {
    @Override
    public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        System.loadLibrary(&quot;native-activity&quot;);
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;
* AndroidManifest.xml:
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;manifest xmlns:android=&quot;http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android&quot;
    package=&quot;com.example.test_native_activity&quot;
    android:versionCode=&quot;1&quot;
    android:versionName=&quot;1.0&quot; &gt;

    &lt;uses-sdk android:minSdkVersion=&quot;7&quot; /&gt;

    &lt;application android:label=&quot;test_native_activity&quot;&gt;
        &lt;activity android:name=&quot;.Main&quot;&gt;
            &lt;intent-filter&gt;
                &lt;action android:name=&quot;android.intent.action.MAIN&quot; /&gt;
                &lt;category android:name=&quot;android.intent.category.LAUNCHER&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;/intent-filter&gt;
        &lt;/activity&gt;
    &lt;/application&gt;
&lt;/manifest&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
Compile, install and prepare it:
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
android update project --name test_native_activity --path . --target &quot;android-10&quot;
ant debug
ant installd

adb shell
su -c bash
cd /data/data/
cp -a org.wikibooks.OpenGL/lib/libnative-activity.so com.example.test_native_activity/lib/
&lt;/source&gt;

When you run this application, you'll get a more precise error in the Android logs, such as a wrong STL implementation:
 E/AndroidRuntime(3009): java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: Cannot load library:  reloc_library[1311]:
 2323 cannot locate '_ZStlsISt11char_traitsIcEERSt13basic_ostreamIcT_ES5_PKc'...
or a missing dependency:
 E/AndroidRuntime( 3327): java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: Cannot load library:link_image[1962]:
 2323 could not load needed library 'libglut.so.3' for 'libnative-activity.so'
 (load_library[1104]: Library 'libglut.so.3' not found)


In the worst case, the library might not even load properly.
This may happen e.g. when the C++ constructor of a global static variable crashes while it is called at library loading time, even before your application is started.
You'll need to reproduce library loading at the C level:
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;dlfcn.h&gt;

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
  const char* err = NULL;
  const char* filename = &quot;/data/data/org.wikibooks.OpenGL/lib/libnative-activity.so&quot;;

  if (argc == 2)
    filename = argv[1];

  printf(&quot;Clearing errors: &quot;); fflush(stdout);
  err = dlerror();
  printf(&quot;%s\n&quot;, (err == NULL) ? &quot;OK&quot; : err); fflush(stdout);

  printf(&quot;Loading library: &quot;); fflush(stdout);
  void* handle = dlopen(filename, RTLD_LAZY);
  err = dlerror();
  printf(&quot;%s\n&quot;, (err == NULL) ? &quot;OK&quot; : err); fflush(stdout);
  
  if (handle != NULL) {
    printf(&quot;Loading symbol: &quot;); fflush(stdout);
    dlsym(handle, &quot;ANativeActivity_onCreate&quot;);
    err = dlerror();
    printf(&quot;%s\n&quot;, (err == NULL) ? &quot;OK&quot; : err); fflush(stdout);
  }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Then send it to the device and execute it:
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
$ arm-linux-androideabi-gcc test-dlsym.c
$ adb push a.out /
$ adb shell
# /a.out
Clearing errors: OK
Loading library: OK
Loading symbol: OK
&lt;/source&gt;
You can also use &lt;code&gt;strace&lt;/code&gt; for more precision:
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
# strace /a.out
&lt;/source&gt;


There is no &lt;code&gt;ldd&lt;/code&gt; for Android by default, but you can simulate it using:
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
arm-linux-androideabi-objdump -x libs/armeabi/libnative-activity.so | grep NEEDED
# or
arm-linux-androideabi-readelf -d libs/armeabi/libnative-activity.so | grep NEEDED
&lt;/source&gt;

= Abstracting differences between OpenGL and GLES2 =

When you only use GLES2 functions, your application is nearly portable to both desktops and mobile devices.
There are still a couple issues to address:
* The GLSL &lt;code&gt;#version&lt;/code&gt; is different
* GLES2 requires precision hints that are not compatible with OpenGL 2.1.

See the Basic Tutorials 02 and 03 for details and a proposed solution.

= GLM =

To install GLM, you just need to extract the latest release in &lt;code&gt;/usr/src/glm&lt;/code&gt; (such that &lt;code&gt;/usr/src/glm/glm/glm.hpp&lt;/code&gt; exists).
It is a header-only library that doesn't require separate compilation.

= SOIL =

* Download the Simple OpenGL Image Library from http://lonesock.net/soil.html
* Apply patch from &lt;tt&gt;android_wrapper/soil.patch&lt;/tt&gt;.
* Follow instructions in &lt;tt&gt;projects/Android/Makefile&lt;/tt&gt;.
* NDK module ready in &lt;tt&gt;src/build/soil/&lt;/tt&gt;.

= FreeType =

If you need FreeType (a library to render fonts), you'll need to cross-compile it.
Note: The Android system uses FreeType but internally it doesn't expose it to native apps.

First, prepare the cross-compiler from the NDK:
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
/usr/src/android-ndk-r9d/build/tools/make-standalone-toolchain.sh --platform=android-9 \
  --install-dir=/usr/src/ndk-standalone-9
PATH=/usr/src/ndk-standalone-9/bin:$PATH
&lt;/source&gt;

Then use it to cross-compile freetype:
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
tar xf freetype-2.5.3.tar.bz2
cd freetype-2.5.3/
./configure --host=arm-linux-androideabi --prefix=/freetype --without-zlib --with-png=no
make -j4
make install DESTDIR=$(pwd)
&lt;/source&gt;

Then write an &lt;code&gt;Android.mk&lt;/code&gt; file in the new &lt;code&gt;freetype/&lt;/code&gt; directory:
&lt;source lang=&quot;make&quot;&gt;
LOCAL_PATH:= $(call my-dir)

include $(CLEAR_VARS)

LOCAL_MODULE := freetype
LOCAL_SRC_FILES := lib/libfreetype.a
LOCAL_EXPORT_C_INCLUDES := $(LOCAL_PATH)/include $(LOCAL_PATH)/include/freetype2

include $(PREBUILT_STATIC_LIBRARY)
&lt;/source&gt;

See &lt;code&gt;docs/STANDALONE-TOOLCHAIN.html&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;docs/PREBUILTS.html&lt;/code&gt; in the NDK for details.
The &lt;code&gt;CLEAR_VARS&lt;/code&gt; bit is not documented, but is necessary to avoid mixed-up paths; it is used in the &lt;code&gt;native_app_glue&lt;/code&gt; NDK module.

(Alternatively you can install it in --prefix=/usr/src/ndk-standalone-9/sysroot/usr if you don't plan to use the NDK build system.)

To use FreeType in your project, edit your &lt;code&gt;Android.mk&lt;/code&gt;:
&lt;source lang=&quot;make&quot;&gt;
...
LOCAL_STATIC_LIBRARIES := ... freetype
...
$(call import-module,freetype)
&lt;/source&gt;

You will need to specify the &lt;code&gt;freetype&lt;/code&gt; directory location as well, using the &lt;code&gt;NDK_MODULE_PATH&lt;/code&gt; variable.
For instance, you can copy &lt;code&gt;freetype&lt;/code&gt; in your project directory and build using:
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
	ndk-build NDK_MODULE_PATH=. ...
&lt;/source&gt;

Our wrapper already defines &lt;code&gt;NDK_MODULE_PATH=$$NDK_MODULE_PATH:.&lt;/code&gt;.

= Troubleshootings =

== Device is marked offline ==

The first time you connect your device to a new computer, it will ask to to confirm the computer fingerprint.
Until you accept on the device screen, it's marked offline.

If you are not asked for confirmation, make sure your &lt;tt&gt;adb&lt;/tt&gt; is up-to-date.

== Allow USB access for non-root users ==

These days, Android devices are references in your &lt;tt&gt;/lib/udev/rules.d/&lt;/tt&gt;, but adb gets permission issues with your new device: 
* See if it works when running &lt;code&gt;adb&lt;/code&gt; as root. 
* To allow unprivileged users to securely connect to the device, create an udev rule as follow.

First, determine your device's &lt;code&gt;idVendor&lt;/code&gt;, by typing 'dmesg' after you plug it; check for :
 usb 2-1: New USB device found, idVendor=18d1, idProduct=4e22

Then create an udev rule as below, for instance in  /etc/udev/rules.d/51-android.rules :
 # Galaxy S
 SUBSYSTEM==&quot;usb&quot;, ATTR{idVendor}==&quot;18d1&quot;, MODE=&quot;0666&quot;, GROUP=&quot;plugdev&quot; 

(This can be further specialized by idProduct.)

Then restart your udev deamon:
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
/etc/init.d/udev restart
&lt;/source&gt;

If you plug your device, the USB character device should have the &quot;plugdev&quot; group:
 # ll /dev/bus/usb/002/
 total 0
 crw-rw-r-T 1 root plugdev 189, 140 janv. 19 21:50 013

== Issue with zlib ==

In FreeType, &lt;code&gt;--without-zlib&lt;/code&gt; uses the internal copy of zlib inside freetype rather than one independently recompiled for Android. Otherwise you'd get errors such as:
 ./obj/local/armeabi/libfreetype.a(ftgzip.o): In function `ft_gzip_file_init':
 ftgzip.c:(.text+0x3c4): undefined reference to `inflateInit2_'
 ./obj/local/armeabi/libfreetype.a(ftgzip.o): In function `ft_gzip_file_done':
 ftgzip.c:(.text+0x43c): undefined reference to `inflateEnd'
 ./obj/local/armeabi/libfreetype.a(ftgzip.o): In function `ft_gzip_file_reset':
 ftgzip.c:(.text+0x514): undefined reference to `inflateReset'
 ./obj/local/armeabi/libfreetype.a(ftgzip.o): In function `ft_gzip_file_fill_output':
 ftgzip.c:(.text+0x780): undefined reference to `inflate'

Humanity when in dire situations has shown to ultimately preferred to explain, blame or justify actions and events as externalities, nature, gods, demons, anything that shifts blame, shame or responsibility away from itself, religion can be a strength or a weakness depending on the situation, but faith in a greater plan, in higher intervention, has historically be demonstrated as a force that permits us to go further and cope with unbearable events, for better or worst.

Faith is a type of self suggestion, mind over matter, it can be used like self-hypnosis to suppress pain, increase motivation and indeed enable oneself to perform, focus, act and cope in any situation.

Most mainstream religious beliefs will hopefully also come with a heightened sense of morality and will include a degree of self responsibility for behaviors in relation to the divine. But ultimately religion is not the guarantee or generator of good morals, but a way to share a common ground and a choice on how to cope with reality and part of ones identity.

== Morals ==
Let us start by defining what morals are, for instance in regards to ethics, that sometimes is considered a synonym. In a emergency situation there are no ethical dilemmas, in regards to the sense of impropriety, all is superseded by survival, but that does not mean that one should become amoral.

Morals have and will continue to have importance in any situational of human existence, at least in any situation that is not death threatening. Of course that those that put morals aside could have a better chance of survival, but morals, ultimately have value and is are an intrinsic part of what makes us human. Since the field of moral choices that can occur is so vast, this section should be dedicated to hypothetical situations and as a reflection on the value and cost of maintaining the high moral ground.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Primm, Nevada''' is a small unincorporated town located where Interstate 15 crosses the California-Nevada border.  The community is home to Terrible's Primm Valley Casino and Resorts, which consists of three hotels: Buffalo Bill's, Whiskey Pete's, and Primm Valley.

==Hotels==
All three hotels are currently owned by Herbst Gaming.  The entire facility operates as Terrible's Primm Valley Casino and Resorts.

===Whiskey Pete's===
This was the first hotel built in Primm, which gradually grew to its current size of 36,400 square feet.  Amenities include a large swimming pool, a gift shop, four restaurants, and 777 rooms and suites.

===Primm Valley===
Primm Valley Resort was built after Whiskey Pete's, and offers 624 rooms and suites as well as over 1,500 slot machines.  Both trams depart from this hotel.

===Buffalo Bill's===
Buffalo Bill's is 46,000 square feet large and is home to the Desperado roller coaster, one of the world's fastest and tallest roller coasters.  The resort also offers 1,242 guest rooms and suites, a buffalo-shaped swimming pool, and the Star of the Desert Arena, which has 6,500 seats for concerts.

==Trams==
[[File:Trams in Primm.jpg|thumb|alt=A map of the trams in Primm.|A map of the trams in Primm (click to enlarge) .]]

Primm has two free trams that, together, connect each of the three hotels:
*[[Primm Valley-Whiskey Pete's Tram]]
*[[Primm Valley-Buffalo Bill's Tram]]

== Mechanics ==
[[ Image:Sir Isaac Newton (1643-1727).jpg|thumb|Sir Isaac Newton developed his [[Newton's laws of motion|three laws of motion]], which form the basis of mechanical analysis. ]]

Mechanics is the branch of physics concerned with the behavior of physical bodies when subjected to forces or displacements, and the subsequent effects of the bodies on their environment. There are few principles in mechanics, but they have wide applications in engineering. These principles form the basis for advanced research in vibrations, stability and strength of structures, fluid dynamics, and so on. Thus, a thorough understanding of mechanics is essential to progress in these fields of research, or to simply become a good engineer.

Mechanics is the oldest physical science. The main theory of mechanics in antiquity was Aristotelian mechanics. In the Middle Ages, Aristotle's theories were criticized and modified by a number of figures, beginning with John Philoponus in the 6th century. A central problem was that of projectile motion, which was discussed by Hipparchus and Philoponus. This led to the development of the theory of impetus by 14th century French Jean Buridan, which developed into the modern theories of inertia, velocity, acceleration and momentum. This work and others was developed in 14th century England by the Oxford Calculators such as Thomas Bradwardine, who studied and formulated various laws regarding falling bodies. On the question of a body subject to a constant (uniform) force, the 12th century Jewish-Muslim Hibat Allah Abu'l-Barakat al-Baghdaadi stated that constant force imparts constant acceleration, while the main properties are uniformly accelerated motion (as of falling bodies) was worked out by the 14th century Oxford Calculators. Two central figures in the early modern age are Galileo Galilei and Isaac Newton. Galileo's final statement of his mechanics, particularly of falling bodies, is his ''Two New Sciences'' (1638). Newton's 1687 ''Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica'' provided a detailed mathematical account of mechanics, using the newly developed mathematics of calculus and providing the basis of Newtonian mechanics.

In this book, we will not give a mostly theoretical study — as we would in a physics book; the content will be balanced with the applications of mechanical principles. The principles of mechanics are best described mathematically, and thus we shall begin by describing the mathematical principles of statics.

[[ Image:Mechanics Overview Table.jpg|thumb|branches of mechanics (green) and their relative place in the Island of &quot;Physics of Mechanics&quot; and &quot;Mechanical engineering&quot; ]]
The topic of mechanics is divided in two parts: statics and dynamics; then it is further divided into topics we will not cover in this book.

== Basic Concepts ==

;Definitions for:
: '''Space''' is the boundless, three-dimensional extent in which objects and events occur and have relative position and direction. Two-dimensional space is described with two coordinates (&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;), while three-dimensional space (physical reality) is described in three coordinates (&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;).
: '''Time''' is a part of the measuring system used to sequence events, to compare the durations of events and the intervals between them, and to quantify rates of change such as the motions of object (not related to analysis of statics problems).
: '''Mass''' commonly refers to any of the following three properties of matter, which have been shown experimentally to be equivalent: inertial mass, active gravitational mass, and passive gravitational mass. The latter being dealt with frequently in statics.
: '''Force''' is any influence that causes an object to undergone a change in speed, a change in direction, or in a change in shape. Force can also be described by intuitive concepts such as a push or pull that can cause an object with mass to change its velocity, i.e. accelerate. A force has both magnitude and direction, which is a vector quantity (discussed in Chapter 2).
: '''Particle''' is a small localized object to which can be ascribed several physical properties such as volume or mass. Whether objects can be considered particles depends on the scale of the context; if an object's own size is small or negligible, or if geometrical properties and structure are irrelevant, then it can be considered a particle.
: '''Rigid body''' is an idealization of a solid body of finite size in which deformation is neglected. In other words, the distance between any two given points of a rigid body remains constant in time regardless of external forces exerted on it. If the deformations on the material are negligible in affecting the solution, then a suitable problem model may be made using rigid bodies.

== Scalars and Vectors ==
There are two types of quantities in physics: scalars and vectors. Scalars have only a magnitude, e.g. time, volume, speed, energy, mass, and density. Vector quantities are described by both a magnitude and direction; examples include displacement, velocity, acceleration, force, moment, and momentum. Speed is velocity with its direction component.
;Types of vectors
: '''Free vectors''' have magnitude and direction, as any vector, but the initial point is not important, i.e. a vector floating in space. A free vector is convenient, as we'll see, in describing displacement of a moving body.
: '''Sliding vectors''' have a line of action in space but no particular point of application. An example of this is a force – no matter the point of application of a force on a body, the result is the same.
: '''Fixed vectors''' has a specific point of application. This type of vector becomes important when describing forces acting on non-rigid (deformable) bodies.

=== Conventions for Diagrams and Equations ===

[[Image:Vector-conventions.svg|thumb|Figure 1.1: Vector drawing and labeling conventions]]

A vector quantity, &lt;math&gt;\textbf{V}&lt;/math&gt; is drawn as in Figure 1.1, a line segment with an arrow head to indicate direction. The length of the line segment indicates the vector magnitude, &lt;math&gt;|V|&lt;/math&gt; (printed as &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;), using a convenient scale, e.g. 1 centimeter is equal to 10 newtons.

Since boldening letters is difficult/time-consuming for handwritten work, a line or arrow over the letter as in &lt;math&gt;\overline{V}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\vec{V}&lt;/math&gt;. Others might use a caret symbol, or underline &lt;math&gt;\underline{V}&lt;/math&gt;. Maintaining the mathematical distinction between vector and scalar is very important in arriving at the correct answer, so use what you're comfortable with.

=== Using Vectors ===

A vector's direction may be described by an angle, given from a known origin and line of reference, as in Figure 1.1. Since magnitude is always positive, &lt;math&gt;-\textbf{V}&lt;/math&gt; has the same length as &lt;math&gt;\textbf{V}&lt;/math&gt; but in the opposite direction (&lt;math&gt;180^{\circ}&lt;/math&gt;).

{{multiple image

   | caption2  = ''(b)''
   | image3    = Vector-triangle-law.svg
   | alt3      =  triangle law
   | caption3  = ''(c)''
}}

Vectors obey the parallelogram law of combination. This law states that the free vectors, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{V_1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{V_2}&lt;/math&gt;, can be replaced by &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{V}&lt;/math&gt;, which is the diagonal of the parallelogram formed by the two free vectors as its sides, as in Figure 1.2a. This is known as the ''vector sum'', which can be expressed mathematically as below.

&lt;center&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{V} = \mathbf{V_1} + \mathbf{V_2}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

Notationally, the ''vector sum'' is indicated by the addition sign between bold-faced vectors. This should not be confused with the ''scalar sum'' of the two vectors, &lt;math&gt;V_1 + V_2&lt;/math&gt;. Because of the geometry of the parallelogram, clearly &lt;math&gt;V \neq V_1 + V_2&lt;/math&gt;.

Alternatively, the vectors &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{V_1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{V_2}&lt;/math&gt;, treated again as free vectors, may be summed using the triangle rule, as in Figure 1.2c, to result in the vector sum &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{V}&lt;/math&gt;. Use the method you feel most comfortable with — they are equivalent. Vector sums obey the commutative property, i.e. &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{V_1} + \mathbf{V_2} = \mathbf{V_2} + \mathbf{V_1}&lt;/math&gt;.

[[Image:Vector-subtraction.svg|thumb|right|300px|Figure 1.3: Vector subtraction methods]]

The vector difference of our two example vectors, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{V_2} - \mathbf{V_1}&lt;/math&gt;, can be obtained using either the parallelogram law or the triangle law (see Figure 1.3) by adding &lt;math&gt;-\mathbf{V_1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{V_2}&lt;/math&gt;, to obtain the vector difference &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{V^\prime}&lt;/math&gt; The equation which represents ''vector subtraction'' is as follows:

&lt;center&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{V^\prime} = \mathbf{V_2} - \mathbf{V_1}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

The foregoing vector operations may be applied to more than two vectors by successively adding or subtracting in pairs. The free vectors involved in these equations are called the ''vector components''. To illustrate this, see Figure 1.4a: the vectors &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{V_1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{V_2}&lt;/math&gt; form the component vectors of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{V}&lt;/math&gt; in the direction of &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;2&lt;/math&gt;, respectively. Typically we use ''rectangular components'' to take advantage of convenient trigonometric functions, as shown in Figure 1.4b. As another mathematical convenience, the Cartesian coordinate system is used to describe physical systems, as evidenced use of the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; as subscripts and coordinates. Figure 1.4c illustrates the use of an alternate rectangular coordinate system, which may be treated as relative coordinates to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;. Relative coordinate systems will become useful when you encounter complex mechanics problems.

&lt;/center&gt;

A vector can be separated into its magnitude and direction. Determining the vector's direction can readily be done by using the inverse tangent function as in the equation below; &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is taken to be the direction, when measured from the positive x-axis in the Cartesian coordinate system.

&lt;center&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;\theta = \tan^{-1}\frac{V_y}{V_x}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

Taking &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; as the vector magnitude, a vector may be described as its magnitude multiplied by its unit vector. The value of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{V}&lt;/math&gt; does not change as a result, because the ''unit vector'' indicates the proper direction and has a magnitude of one.

&lt;center&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;\textbf{V} = V\textbf{n}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

In order to describe a vector in 2 or 3 (orthogonal) dimensions, we use the unit vectors, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{i}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{j}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{k}&lt;/math&gt; to indicate a vector's direction towards &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;, respectively (as seen in Figure 1.5).

&lt;math style=&quot;text-align:center;padding:10px;background:#fff297;border:2px solid #eecf00&quot;&gt;\textbf{V} = V_x\textbf{i} + V_y\textbf{j} + V_z\textbf{k}&lt;/math&gt;

== Newton's Laws ==

Newton's laws of motion are three physical laws that form the basic laws for classical mechanics. They describe the relationship between the forces acting on a body and its motion due to those forces.

# Law 1: The velocity of a body remains constant unless the body is acted upon by an external force.
# Law 2: The acceleration &lt;math&gt;\textbf{a}&lt;/math&gt; of a body is parallel and directly proportional to the vector sum of forces, &lt;math&gt;\textbf{F}&lt;/math&gt;, and inversely proportional to the mass &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;.
# Law 3: The mutual forces of action and reaction between two bodies are equal, opposite and collinear.

These laws are easily verifiable by accurate physical measurements – as you might have done in high school physics. Newton's second law is most useful in the analysis of dynamics, since it describes a direct mathematical relationship for quantities we can measure (and others we cannot). As applied to a particle mass (having no dimension), &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;, Newton's second law may be stated as

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math style=&quot;text-align:center;padding:10px;background:#fff297;border:2px solid #eecf00&quot;&gt;\textbf{F} = m\textbf{a}&lt;/math&gt; (Eqn 1.1)
&lt;/center&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\textbf{F}&lt;/math&gt; is the vector sum of forces acting on the particle mass and &lt;math&gt;\textbf{a}&lt;/math&gt; is the resulting acceleration of the particle mass. Equation 1.1 is a ''vector equation'' because the direction of &lt;math&gt;\textbf{F}&lt;/math&gt; must be colinear with that of &lt;math&gt;\textbf{a}&lt;/math&gt;, and the magnitude of the vector sum of forces, &lt;math&gt;|\textbf{F}|&lt;/math&gt;, must equal the other side's, &lt;math&gt;|m\textbf{a}|&lt;/math&gt;.

Restating Newton's first law, a body stays at rest unless acted upon by an unbalanced sum of forces. This statement is a consequence of the velocity remaining the same  in this situation (a body with a velocity of &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; is at rest). Therefore, '''the first law is of prime importance in our analysis of statics'''. This law is a consequence of Newton's second law, that is, the acceleration is zero when the force vector sum is zero.

Newton's third law is essential to our solution method of statics problems. When a force is acted on a body, the resulting force on the body is equal, and opposite in sign and direction. This law holds for all forces, whether they are variable or constant, from all sources for all time instants. '''For systems with gravity present, two bodies contacting each other will have equal and opposite forces unless their tangent of contact is colinear with the acceleration of gravity.'''

During the analysis of systems of bodies and forces, it is critical to notate the pairs of forces so as to avoid becoming confused. To simplify your analysis, it is best to ''isolate'' the system, considering one body with the forces acting ''on'' it.

== Units ==

In mechanics we use four fundamental quantities called ''dimensions'': length, mass, force, and time. The units used to measure these quantities must be consistent with each other in the equations we use, e.g. Newton's second law, Eq. 1.1; that is, you may not mix SI and U.S. Customary units in the same equation. There are a number of unit systems, but this text will use the ones commonly used in science and engineering. See the table below for the four fundamental dimensions and their units and symbols.

=== SI Units ===
The International System of Units (abbreviated SI from French: Système international d'unités) is the modern form of the metric system and is generally a system of units of measurement devised around seven base units and the convenience of the number ten. SI is the world's most widely used system of measurement, which is used both in everyday commerce and in science. The system has been nearly globally adopted with the United States being the only industrialised nation that does not mainly use the metric system in its commercial and standards activities. As shown in the table, the SI base units are kilogram (kg) for mass, meter (m) for length, and second (s) for time. The unit for force, the newton (N), is derived from the base units by Eq. 1.1.

&lt;center&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;\text{N} = \text{kg} \cdot \text{m}/\text{s}^2&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

Thus, 1 newton is the force required to accelerate a 1 kg mass to 1 m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

Consider a mass, &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;, which is free-falling toward the earth. Simply speaking, this mass only has the force of gravity acting on it; therefore it is falling with the acceleration of gravity, &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;. This gravitational force is called the ''weight'' &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; of the body, and is found with Eq. 1.1:

&lt;center&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;W \text{ (N)} = m \text{ (kg)} \times g \text{ (m}/\text{s}^2\text{)}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

=== U.S. Customary Units ===
United States customary units, also called the foot-pound-second (FPS) system, are a system of measurements commonly used in the United States. Many U.S. units are virtually identical to their imperial counterparts, but the U.S. customary system developed from English units used in the British Empire before the system of imperial units was standardized in 1824. Several numerical differences from the imperial system are present. Engineers must be able to work in SI and U.S. Customary Units, and both systems are used freely in this text.

Similar to the derivation of the newton from the metric base units, we can derive the U.S. Customary unit of mass, the slug, using Eq. 1.1.

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\text{slug} = \frac{\text{lb}\cdot\text{ft}}{\text{sec}^2}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

Therefore, 1 slug is the mass which is accelerated to 1 ft/sec&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; when acted on by a force of 1 lb. The slug may also be expressed in terms of the mass's gravitational force, or weight, using Eq. 1.1:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;m\text{(slugs)} = \frac{W\text{ (lb)}}{g\text{ (ft/sec}^2\text{)}}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

In U.S. units the pound is also used to denote mass, especially to specify thermal properties of liquids and gases. The abbreviations are then lbm for pound-mass and lbf for pound-force. In this text, we will use the pound (lb) only for force. Other useful units of force in engineering and science is the ''kilopound'' (kip) which is equal to 1000 lbs, and the ''ton'' which is equal to 2000 lbs.

The International System of Units is an ''absolute'' system because its base units are not dependent on the environment. Conversely, the U.S. system (FPS) is a ''gravitational'' system because its base quantity force is defined as the gravitational force (weight) of a standard mass at sea level, 45° latitude. A standard pound is also the force required to accelerate a one-pound mass to 32.1740 ft/sec&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

=== Primary Standards ===
International standards have been established for the measurements of mass, length, and time. 

[[File:Standard kilogram, 2.jpg|thumb|The ''international prototype kilogram'' (IPK) ''is'' the kilogram. The IPK, which is roughly the size of a golf ball, is made of a platinum–iridium alloy.]]
==== Mass ====
The kilogram (kg) is the base unit of mass in the SI and is defined as being equal to the mass of the International Prototype Kilogram (IPK), which is almost exactly equal to the mass of one liter of water. An accurate copy of the IPK is kept at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in the United States. The physical standards do not have constant mass; no plausible mechanism has been proposed to explain either a steady decrease in the mass of the IPK, or an increase in that of its replicas dispersed throughout the world. The long-term solution to this problem, however, is to liberate the SI system’s dependency on the IPK by developing a practical realization of the kilogram that can be reproduced in different laboratories by following a written specification. The international pound, used in both the Imperial system and U.S. customary units, is defined as exactly 0.45359237 kg, making ''one kilogram approximately equal to 2.2046 pounds''.

==== Length ====
The meter (m) is the base unit of length in the SI. Originally intended to be one ten-millionth of the distance from the Earth's equator to the North Pole (at sea level), its definition has been periodically refined to reflect growing knowledge of metrology. Since 1983, it has been defined as ''the length of the path travelled by light in vacuum during a time interval of &lt;math&gt;^1/_{299,792,458}&lt;/math&gt; of a second''.

==== Time ====
The second (s) is the base unit of time and in SI and other systems. Between 1000 (when al-Biruni used seconds) and 1960 the second was defined as 1/86,400 of a mean solar day (that definition still applies in some astronomical and legal contexts). Between 1960 and 1967, it was defined in terms of the period of the Earth's orbit around the Sun, but it is now defined more precisely in atomic terms. Since 1967, the second has been defined to be: ''the duration of 9,192,631,770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the caesium 133 atom''.

==== Gravity ====
Standard gravity, or standard acceleration due to free fall, &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;, is the nominal acceleration of an object in a vacuum near the surface of the Earth. The value of &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is a nominal midrange value on Earth, originally based on the acceleration of a body in free fall at sea level at a geodetic latitude of 45°. Although the actual acceleration of free fall on Earth varies according to location, the above standard figure is always used for metrological purposes. It is defined as 

; SI Units : &lt;math&gt;9.80665\text{ m/s}^2&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;\approx35.30394\text{ (km/h)/s}&lt;/math&gt;.
; U.S. Units : &lt;math&gt;32.1740\text{ ft/s}^2&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\approx21.937\text{ mph/s}&lt;/math&gt;.

For most engineering work, the accuracy of these standards is more than is necessary.

== Law of Gravitation ==
Often in mechanics we need to calculate the weight of a body. We can compute this force with Newton's ''law of gravitation'':

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math style=&quot;text-align:center;padding:10px;background:#fff297;border:2px solid #eecf00&quot;&gt;F = G\frac{m_1m_2}{r^2}&lt;/math&gt; (Eqn 1.2)

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{rcl}
\text{where } F &amp; = &amp; \text{the force between the masses}\\
G &amp; = &amp; \text{the gravitational constant } (=6.67384 \times 10^{-11}\frac{\text{ m}^3}{\text{kg}\cdot\text{s}^2}) \\
m_1, m_2 &amp; = &amp; \text{two particle masses} \\
r &amp; = &amp; \text{the distance between the centers of the masses}
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

Of course, the mutual force obeys Newton's laws of action and reaction. These forces act along &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;, as shown in Fig. 1.7.

==History merges==
Hi, if you move a page then the history moves with it. The problem only occurs if you copy material from one page to another. I'm not sure why you are doing this rather than moving the pages, is there a reason to have the material on both the old and the new page? Once the copy / paste has been done the only way to merge the history is for an administrator to do it, and that can be complicated. The alternative is to add a template to the Talk page of both the source page and the destination page providing an &quot;attribution link&quot; so that people can see where the material as copied from. If you look at these two pages [[Talk:Biological Machines/Sensory Systems/Visual System/Signal Processing]] [[Talk:Sensory Systems/Visual Signal Processing]] you see a pair of attribution link templates. So, in summary, if possible move pages rather than copying text. If you can't move them then please add the attribution link templates or at least make a comment on the talk page explaining what you've done so someone else can fix it. Thanks &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 21:19, 11 February 2012 (UTC)

== Your PDF ==
I made a new PDF of your book overwriting your PDF. I hope you like that. Its done with LaTeX and since you are doing science that might be ok to you. The LaTeX source code is attached to the PDF file so you can make your own changes if you want. I will also send you this message by Email. --[[User:Dirk Hünniger|Dirk Hünniger]] ([[User talk:Dirk Hünniger|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Dirk Hünniger|contribs]]) 17:38, 21 March 2013 (UTC)</text>

The following is a list of notable easy to learn Holiday songs to be played on the guitar. Some of the items link to the different informal chords to specific songs which represent many different authors' own interpretations of the original songs. Most of the chords on the list are relatively easy to learn, and would be a great start for novice guitar players whom are interested in improving their playing abilities.

The technical difficulty and skill level required to play each of the songs is defined with a star rating system:

== Too much inline methods ==

There is too much inline methods in examples.
Method declaration in not the same in header file (*.h) and in implementation file (*.cpp):
* do I need to let const in method implementation declaration like in prototype ?
* same question for all keywords like virtual, ...

:I don't fully understand the questions, you should check inline and const keywords and how the compiler will most of the time optimize them (and even assume some default automation making the programmer use of them become simply an auto-documenting option). The virtual keyword is more specific to purpose...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 10:18, 12 June 2013 (UTC)</text>

* Try to find out which texture formats your card supports. -&gt; no idea :)

* Should we use &quot;x / 2 + 0.5&quot; instead of &quot;x * 2 + 0.5&quot; in the vertex shader?
 float y = (texture2D(mytexture, vec2(x / 2.0 + 0.5, 0)).r - 0.5) * 2.0;
Similarly, to do a full [-1,+1]-&gt;[0,1] conversion, and a smoother gradient, the color could be /2:
 f_color = vec4(x/2 + 0.5, y/2 + 0.5, 1.0, 1.0);

* Maybe add a few explanations on the scaling/offset algorithm. Between tut01 and tut02, not only the formula is reversed for x, but also the offset has not the same meaning (scaling-independent in tut01 and scaling-dependent in tut02).

I have been cooking this risotto for years. I would suggest that 350 ml per 100 gr of rice is sufficient. Which would get you at 850 mls for 250gr of risotto rice. This is assuming you want the risotto to indeed simmer traditionally for a long time in a covered wide pan.</text>

Cosmogenic nuclides (or cosmogenic isotopes) are rare [[w:isotope|isotope]]s created when a high-energy [[w:cosmic ray|cosmic ray]] interacts with the [[w:atomic nucleus|nucleus]] of an atom, causing [[w:cosmic ray spallation|cosmic ray spallation]]. These isotopes are produced within earth materials such as [[w:rock (geology)|rock]]s, [[w:soil|soil]] or [[w:Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]].  By measuring cosmogenic isotopes, we are able to gain insight into a range of [[w:geology|geologic]]  processes. 

Cosmogenic isotopes display different physical and chemical properties that make it possible to apply surface exposure dating methods on rock surfaces of varying lithology at any latitude and altitude, for exposures ranging from 10&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; years. The primary cosmogenic isotopes of interest are: 
;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;He
The reaction &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;N (n, &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C)³H produces tritium (³H), which has a 12.32 year half life. Tritium decays to ³He, which is stable. Since ³He is found in nature, the ratios must correct for this to separate that which is cosmogenic, and that which was captured during the original magmatic formation of the rock.

At depths greater than 2-3 meters, &lt;sup&gt;36&lt;/sup&gt;Cl production in rocks such as calcite is primarily the result of cosmic ray muon interactions: a) direct negative muon capture by Calcium-40 (&lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;Ca) with subsequent alpha decay to produce &lt;sup&gt;36&lt;/sup&gt;Cl, and (2) radiative capture of secondary neutrons by &lt;sup&gt;35&lt;/sup&gt;Cl (secondary neutrons are produced by muon capture and muon-induced photo-disintegration reactions). Rates from these reactions are calculated based on the specific materials involved.  The &lt;sup&gt;36&lt;/sup&gt;Cl found in the sample can be compared directly with the stable &lt;sup&gt;35&lt;/sup&gt;Cl and &lt;sup&gt;37&lt;/sup&gt;Cl isotopic concentrations.

&lt;br&gt;

===III.D - Application of radioactivity to geologic processes=== 
Radioactivity contributes both to geological processes and to our ability to date these processes. The decay of uranium, thorium and potassium in earth’s interior provides a continuing heat source.  Further, geochronology often uses one of several decay systems that are found in several different types of minerals and deposits:
:# The (U–Th)/He system, primarily involves measuring accumulation of helium-4 from the alpha decay of uranium-238, uranium-235, thorium-232, and associated daughter isotopes. 
:#  Fission tracks are produced by spontaneous fission of &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;U, leaving microscopically visible crystallographic damage zones in the crystal. 
:# K–Ar system, yields argon-40 by electron capture from potassium-40. Only about 11% of &lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;K decays to &lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;Ar by electron capture; the majority decays to calcium-40 by β&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; emission.


====Uranium-Thorium geochronology ====
Uranium-Thorium geochronology involves the measurement of daughter products such as Thorium isotopes and comparison with the parent nuclides such as Uranium isotopes which generated them by decaying. 
[[Image:Radioactive decay chains diagram.svg|thumb|right|350px| This diagram illustrates the four decay chains which are relevant to this discussion: thorium (in blue), radium (in red), actinium (in green), and neptunium (in purple).]]

Parent and daughter  abundances are related to time by the radioactive decay equation:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dN(t)}{dt} = -\lambda N(t)&lt;/math&gt;
or, by rearranging,
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dN(t)}{N(t)} = -\lambda dt.&lt;/math&gt;

Integrating, we have
:&lt;math&gt;\ln N(t) = -\lambda t + C \,&lt;/math&gt;
where C is the [[w:constant of integration|constant of integration]], and hence
:&lt;math&gt;N(t) = e^C e^{-\lambda t} = N_0 e^{-\lambda t} \,&lt;/math&gt;
where the final substitution, &lt;math&gt;N_0 = e^C&lt;/math&gt;, is obtained by evaluating the equation at &lt;math&gt;t=0&lt;/math&gt;, as &lt;math&gt;N_0&lt;/math&gt; is defined as being the quantity at &lt;math&gt;t=0&lt;/math&gt;.

Using this relationship, the number of daughter nuclides (or alternately the number of decay or fission related damage tracks) can be calculated.  For geochronological applications the abundance of daughter nuclides reflects nuclear decay which takes place after the mineral crystalizes and the daughter products can be captured. 

===== .=====
The 4n+2 chain of U-238 is commonly called the &quot;radium series&quot; (sometimes &quot;uranium series&quot;).  Beginning with naturally occurring [[w:uranium-238]], this series includes the following elements:  [[w: astatine |astatine]], [[w:bismuth|bismuth]], [[w:lead|lead]], [[w:polonium|polonium]], [[w:protactinium|protactinium]], [[w:radium|radium]], [[w:radon|radon]], [[w:thallium|thallium]], and [[w:thorium|thorium]].  All are present, at least transiently, in any natural uranium-containing sample, whether metal, compound, or mineral. The series terminates with lead-206.

====Cosmogenic isotopes ====

Cosmogenic radionuclide dating relies on cosmogenic [[w:radionuclide|radionuclide]]s to date how long a particular surface has been exposed, how long a certain piece of material has been buried, or how quickly a location or [[w: drainage basin |drainage basin]] is eroding. The basic principle is that these radionuclides are produced at a known rate, and also decay at a known rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Dunai, T.|title=Cosmogenic Nuclides: Principles, Concepts and Applications in the Earth Surface Sciences|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2010|isbn=9780521873802}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===== .=====
[[w:Cosmogenic nuclide|Cosmogenic nuclide]]s are produced by chains of [[w:spallation|spallation]] reactions from cosmic rays indicent upon the earth. The production rate for a particular nuclide is a function of latitude, the amount of sky that can be seen from the point that is sampled, elevation, sample depth, and density of the material in which the sample is embedded. Decay rates are given by the decay constants of the nuclides. These equations can be combined to give the total concentration of cosmogenic radionuclides in a sample as a function of age.

Common radionuclides used in [[w:geomorphology|geomorphology]] include [[w:beryllium-10|beryllium-10]],&lt;ref name=Nishiizumi&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nishiizumi|first1=K.|last2=Kohl|first2=C.

=====Geochronology using {{chem|10|Be}} - {{chem|26|Al}} dating =====
The cosmogenic radioisotopes {{chem|26|Al}} (half life &lt;math&gt;\tau_{Al-26}&lt;/math&gt; = 1.02 ± 0.02 x10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; years) and {{chem|10|Be}} (&lt;math&gt;\tau_{Be-10}&lt;/math&gt;  = 1.93 ± 0.10 x10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; years) are produced when [[w:quartz|quartz]] crystals (SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) are bombarded by secondary cosmic-ray nucleons and muons near the ground surface. Quartz grains near the surface accumulate an inventory of these radionuclides, whose concentrations depend on the mineral's exposure time to cosmic rays, which in turn depends on the erosion rate of the host rock. Some of the oxygen found in the quartz is transformed into &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;Be and the silicon is transformed into &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;Al. Although each of these nuclides is produced at a different rate, they can be used individually to date how long the material has been exposed at the surface. Because there are two radionuclides both being produced and decaying, the ratio of [[w:concentration|concentration]]s of these two nuclides can be used in combination with other knowledge to determine an age. Because cosmic rays are significantly attenuated as tehy pass through several meters of soil, this is also useful in identifying the date at which a sample was buried below the production depth (typically 2–10 meters).&lt;ref name=A&gt;{{Cite journal  | last = Balco  | first = Greg  | authorlink =   | coauthors =   John O.H. Stone and Carrie Jennings   | title = Dating Plio-Pleistocene glacial sediments using the cosmic-ray-produced radionuclides 10Be and 26Al   | journal = American Journal of Science    | volume = 305  | issue = 1   | pages = 1-41   | publisher =   | location =   | date = January 2005  | url =   | issn =   | doi = 10.2475/ajs.305.1.1   | id =   | accessdate = Nov 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

At the Earth’s surface, {{chem|26|Al}} and {{chem|10|Be}}  production in quartz is mostly by cosmic ray spallation reactions with Oxygen and Silicon, with some supplemental production through negative muon capture and fast muon interactions. The total surface production rates of these nuclides in quartz at sea level and high latitude are approximately 5.1 atoms per gram per year for {{chem|10|Be}} and 31.1 atoms per gram per year {{chem|26|Al}}. Although the production rates vary predictably with latitude, altitude, and magnetic field variation, the ratio of {{chem|26|Al}} to {{chem|10|Be}} production rate is fixed at 6.1.&lt;ref name=A/&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Nishiizumi K., Winterer, E. L., Kohl, C. P., Klein, J., Middleton, R., Lal, D., and Arnold, J. R., 1989, Cosmic ray production rates of 26Al and 10Be in quartz from glacially polished rocks: Journal of Geophysical Research, v. 94, p. 17,907–17,915.&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, for short exposure times (&lt; 50,000 year) or for high erosion rates (&gt;2 meters in 50,000 years or &gt;0.02-0.04 kilograms per square meter per year) the radioactive decay rate is negligible. This initial ratio provides a valuable benchmark for determining both the exposure duration and time of burial after initial exposure.

;Appreciation of the physics behind &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;Be - &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;Al dating

Let N be the general symbol for atomic concentration expressed in atoms per cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. Using this formulation, we specify &lt;math&gt;{N_0}^{Al-26}&lt;/math&gt; as the initial atomic concentration of {{chem|26|Al}} and &lt;math&gt;{N_0}^{Be-10}&lt;/math&gt; as the initial atomic concentration of {{chem|10|Be}}, while &lt;math&gt;{N_1}^{Al-26}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{N_1}^{Be-10}&lt;/math&gt; represent the concentrations at a later time.

The decay constants for {{chem|26|Al}} and {{chem|10|Be}} can be found by the general relationship &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \lambda = {0.693/\tau  }&lt;/math&gt;, or  &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \lambda_{Al-26} = {0.693/ \tau_{Al-26} }&lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle  \lambda_{Be-10}= {0.693/  \tau_{Be-10} }&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
We know that after exposure to cosmic rays for periods relatively short compared to the decay constants, the ratio of the atomic concentrations, which we will symbolize by &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;,  is 6.1.

::&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle {\beta_0}  = {{{N_0}^{Al-26}} \over {{N_0}^{Be-10}} } = 6.1 &lt;/math&gt;

We know that should the sample be covered over by 10s of meters of sediment, it will no longer be exposed to cosmic rays. As a result the {{chem|10|Be}} and {{chem|26|Al}} will decay, but at different rates. Hence the ratio will change. 

::&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle {\beta} =  {{{N_0}^{Al-26}e^{-{\lambda_{Al-26}}t}} \over {{N_0}^{Be-10}}e^{-{\lambda_{Be-10}}t} }  &lt;/math&gt;

Which simplifies to: 

::&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle {\beta}  = {\beta_0} e^{({\lambda_{Be-10}}-{\lambda_{Al-26}})t}  &lt;/math&gt;

Solving for the time, t, yields: 

::&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle
t = {1 \over {\lambda_{Be-10}}-{\lambda_{Al-26}}} ln({{\beta} \over {\beta_0}}) 
&lt;/math&gt;

=====Carbon-14 dating=====
[[File:Carbon 14 formation and decay.svg|right|thumb| 280px| 1: Formation of Carbon-14 &lt;br&gt;2: Decay of Carbon-14 &lt;br&gt;3: The equation is for living organisms, and the inequality is for dead organisms, in which the C-14 then decays.]]

[[w:Carbon|Carbon]] has two stable, nonradioactive isotopes: [[w:carbon-12|carbon-12]] ({{chem|12|C}}), and [[w:carbon-13|carbon-13]] ({{chem|13|C}}). In addition, there are trace amounts of the unstable isotope carbon-14 ({{chem|14|C}}) on Earth. Carbon-14 has a relatively short [[w:half-life|half-life]] of 5730 years, meaning that the amount of carbon-14 in a sample is halved over the course of 5730 years due to radioactive decay. Carbon-14 would have long ago vanished from Earth were it not for [[w:cosmic ray|cosmic ray]] flux interactions with the [[w:Earth's atmosphere|Earth's atmosphere]], which create more of the isotope. The [[w:neutron|neutron]]s resulting from the cosmic ray interactions participate in the following [[w:nuclear reaction |nuclear reaction]] on the atoms of nitrogen molecules ({{chem|N|2}}) in the atmosphere:

:&lt;math&gt;n + \mathrm{^{14}_{7}N} \rightarrow \mathrm{^{14}_{6}C} + p&lt;/math&gt;

===== .=====
The highest rate of carbon-14 production takes place at altitudes of 9 to 15&amp;nbsp;km (30,000 to 50,000&amp;nbsp;ft), and at high [[w: geomagnetic |geomagnetic]] latitudes, but the carbon-14 spreads evenly throughout the atmosphere and reacts with oxygen to form carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide also permeates the oceans, dissolving in the water. For approximate analysis it is assumed that the cosmic ray flux is constant over long periods of time; thus carbon-14 is produced at a constant rate and the proportion of radioactive to non-radioactive carbon is constant: ca. 1 [[w:parts per trillion|part per trillion]] (600 billion atoms/mole). In 1958 [[w: Hessel de Vries |Hessel de Vries]] showed that the concentration of carbon-14 in the atmosphere varies with time and locality.&lt;ref name=de/&gt; For the most accurate work, these variations are compensated by means of [[w: calibration curve |calibration curve]]s. When these curves are used, their accuracy and shape are the factors that determine the accuracy of the age obtained for a given sample.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=McFadgen, B G ''et al.'' |year=1994 |title=Radiocarbon calibration curve variations and their implications for the interpretation of New Zealand prehistory |journal=Radiocarbon |volume=36 |issue=2 |pages=221–236  |url=http://digitalcommons.arizona.edu/objectviewer?o=http%3A%2F%2Fradiocarbon.library.arizona.edu%2FVolume36%2FNumber2%2Fazu_radiocarbon_v36_n2_221_236_v.pdf }} ''&quot;The shape of a distribution of calibrated {{chem|14|C}} dates displays spurious peaks and troughs, brought about by changes in the slope of the calibration curve interacting with the spreading effect of the stochastic distribution of counting errors&quot;''&lt;/ref&gt; {{chem|14|C}} can also be produced at ground level at a rate of 1 x 10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt; g&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, which is not significant enough to impact dating calculations.&lt;ref name=Ramsay/&gt;

Plants take up atmospheric carbon dioxide by [[w:photosynthesis|photosynthesis]], and are ingested by animals, so every living thing is constantly exchanging carbon-14 with its environment as long as it lives. Once it dies, however, this exchange stops, and the amount of carbon-14 gradually decreases through radioactive [[w: beta decay |beta decay]] with a half-life of 5,730 ± 40 years &lt;ref&gt; http://hypertextbook.com/facts/1997/MargaretKong.shtml &lt;/ref&gt;.  Carbon-14 is stored in different amounts in different reservoirs because there is a [[w: dynamic equilibrium |dynamic equilibrium]] between {{chem|14|C}} production and decay.&lt;ref name=Ramsay&gt;{{cite doi|10.1111/j.1475-4754.2008.00394.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== .=====
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{~^{14}_{6}C}\rightarrow\mathrm{~^{14}_{7}N}+ e^{-} + \bar{\nu}_e&lt;/math&gt;

Once organic material is dead and has been captured by a geologic process, decay will decrease the {{chem|14|6|C}} fraction. For relatively recent events {{chem|14|6|C}} can provide meaningful age data.

====Thermoluminescence dating====
Thermoluminescence dating dating of geological materials  are useful  for dating volcanic and related materials and events over timescales ranging from 10&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; years. Thermoluminescence methods are less precise than &lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;Ar/&lt;sup&gt;39&lt;/sup&gt;Ar and &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C methods, they offer a useful alternative approach with advantages in terms of age range and scope of material.

When quartz, feldspar and other minerals are exposed to ionizing radiation the decelerating particle detaches electrons from nuclei in the crystal lattice. Some fraction of these electrons are captured in defects in the lattice. For a given type of radiation, The trapped electrons density increases proportionally with the radiation exposure fluence.  Heating, illumination or shock of a crystal can free these trapped electrons.  Some fraction of these freed electrons return to a vacant position (a ‘hole’) left from a previously displaced electron, with concurrent emission of energy as a photon. 
===== .=====
As an example of this use for dating, Feldspars contain a radioactive isotope of potassium (&lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;K). &lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;K decays by β&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;  (i.e., electron) decay and has a half-life of 1.248{{e|9}} years, or about 39.38{{e|15}} seconds.  When formed during solidification of basalt, the feldspar has no detached electrons. As the feldspar is exposed to the β&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; decay, it accumulates electrons essentially linearly with time for times significantly shorter than 1.248{{e|9}} years. 
&lt;br&gt;

====Neutrino measurement ====
Radiogenic heating due to decay can be estimated from the flux of neutrinos that routinely accompany beta decay which accompanies uranium, thorium and potassium decays. These electrically neutral particles are emitted during beta decay and pass through the Earth virtually unaffected until detected by specially designed detectors. Current estimates of heat production from radiogenic sources are 20±9  TerraWatts. This makes up approximately half or the 44.2±1 TerraWatt heat flux which has been measured as earth's emission to space.&lt;ref&gt;Partial radiogenic heat model for Earth revealed by geoneutrino measurements

      <text xml:space="preserve">* ''The problem now is that we lose the automatic coordinate transformation of before, so we can no longer draw a box with corners (-1, -1) and (1, 1). Unfortunately, there is no easy function (TODO: or is there?) to get the same transformation as glViewport() applies,''

=&gt; would glm::ortho do the trick? It should be equivalent to http://www.opengl.org/sdk/docs/man/xhtml/gluOrtho2D.xml
: Well, you could use an orthographic projection to simulate a viewport transformation, but it works the wrong way around, so it would still require you to do most of the maths manually.

* The box-drawing code need to be updated in the tutorial (you switched to vbo in the code repository graph03/graph.cpp)
: Ok.

* The section about drawing the graph and the box could be reordered, to group all graph-related actions (namely: the scissors), then all box related actions.
: Ok.

* Not sure I got the exercise about big points - when you say &quot;right outside&quot;, for a 100x100 window, do you mean 101x101 or rather 200x200?
: 101x101 and -1x-1, yes. The idea is that according to the standard, after the vertex processing stage, primitives get clipped to the viewport range, and if you draw GL_POINTS each vertex is its own primitive, so any point outside the viewport is completely culled, even though you would be able to see part of it if you have a pointsize &gt; 1.

* Drawing major ticks every 2.54 units means that the first major unit is out of the (2.0x2.0) screen.
: That's correct :)</text>

==Lesson Objectives==
* Explain what is meant by the spin quantum number, ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;.
* Explain how the spin quantum number affects the number of electrons in an orbital.
* Explain the difference between diamagnetic atoms and paramagnetic atoms.

==Introduction==
In the [[../Quantum Mechanics Model of the Atom/]] chapter, you learned about quantum numbers. Remember, quantum numbers actually come from the wave function. Even though you've never seen a mathematical equation for a wave function (and you'd probably think it was pretty scary if you did!) you can still understand what the different quantum numbers mean, because they all control different aspects of what the electron standing wave looks like. The principal quantum number, ''n'', determines the &quot;size&quot; and the number of nodes in the electron wave, the azimuthal quantum number, ''ℓ'', determines the &quot;shape&quot; of the electron wave, and the magnetic quantum number, ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt;, determines the &quot;orientation&quot; of the electron wave. Now suppose that you were told the exact size, the exact shape and the exact orientation of an electron orbital. Could you draw that object without being told anything else? You should be able to – what could you possibly need to know about an electron wave other than its size, shape and orientation? It seems as if the first three quantum numbers tell us all the information necessary to picture what an electron's probability pattern looks like – but it turns out that there's ''fourth'' quantum number! What! How could there be another quantum number? What property could it possibly describe? There's nothing left after size, shape, and orientation. That’s exactly what scientists thought until they discovered ''spin''.

In the early days, when scientists were just beginning to learn about ''quantum'' physics, most of what they knew about ''quantization'' involved atomic spectra. Remember, in [[../The Bohr Model of the Atom/]] chapter, you learned that atomic spectra were discontinuous, and that this led Bohr to propose the existence of ''quantized energy levels''. To explain these quantized energy levels, Bohr suggested that electrons in an atom were restricted to specific orbits and that they moved around the nucleus in these orbits just like the planets move around the sun. It turned out that Bohr's model wasn't entirely correct because electrons don't orbit the nucleus. In fact, based on what scientists know of the wave-particle duality and the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, scientists now think that electrons can be anywhere inside the atom, although the probability of finding them at any one particular location over another depends on the relative amount of electron density at those locations. Even though Bohr's model had some problems, Bohr was right in his prediction that electrons could only exist at specific &quot;allowed&quot; energy levels, and that all other energies were &quot;forbidden&quot;.

In the [[../Quantum Mechanics Model of the Atom/]] chapter, you learned how the &quot;allowed&quot; and &quot;forbidden&quot; energy levels could be explained in terms of electron standing waves. Only certain electron standing waves will fit perfectly inside the atom without &quot;doubling over&quot; on themselves, or containing discontinuous jumps. Therefore, just like the Bohr Theory of the Atom, the wave function theory of the electron explains the existence of ''discontinuous'' atomic spectra. Actually, wave functions themselves are pretty good at predicting exactly what the atomic spectra of different atoms will look like (In other words, at which wavelengths lines of light will appear – if you have forgotten about atomic spectra, go back and read [[../The Atomic Theory/]] chapter!) Remember, Bohr's model could only predict the atomic spectrum of hydrogen. With a little bit of work, though, scientists could get electron wave functions to predict many different atomic spectra for many different types of atoms. It seemed perfect… but there was a still a slight problem. Every so often when scientists looked carefully at atomic spectra, they would find ''two'' separate lines of light at a wavelength where the wave function had only predicted one. The two separate lines were always really close together, so if you didn't look carefully, you'd think it was just one line and you'd think that the wave function was doing a great job. But the fact remained that frequently the wave function was missing some of the finer details of the atomic spectra.

Now if you think back to what we discussed in [[../The Bohr Model of the Atom/]] chapter, you'll remember that the lines of light in an atomic spectrum result when an electron &quot;falls&quot; from one energy level to another and releases its extra energy in the form of light. Even though we learned about this process in terms of the Bohr model, the same principle applies to the wave function theory as well. Remember, in terms of wave functions, the energy level of an electron is determined by the principal quantum number, ''n'', while the azimuthal quantum number, ''ℓ'', defines the sublevel and also affects electron energy in atoms with more than one electron.

Electrons don't circle the nucleus like planets in a solar system as pictured in the figure below on the left. Nevertheless, when they fall from a higher energy level electron standing wave to a lower energy electron standing wave they release light in much the same way as shown in the figure below on the right.

When an electron begins at one energy (one value of ''n'' and ''ℓ'') and then falls to a lower energy (with a different value of ''n'' and ''ℓ''), it releases its extra energy in the form of light. Therefore, if there are two very closely spaced lines of light in an atomic spectrum, it must mean that there are two very closely spaced energy states from which (or to which) an electron can &quot;fall&quot;. In terms of predicting the finer details of an atomic spectrum, then, it's clear that the problem with the wave function was that in certain situations it would only find one allowed energy state where there should have been two!

The story got even stranger when scientists put magnets around different atoms and looked at what happened to their atomic spectra as a result. All of those pairs of closely spaced spectral lines that the wave function couldn't predict actually split apart ''even further''! In other words, magnetic fields affected the two different energy levels differently. It made the low energy level drop even lower, and it made the high energy level rise even higher. After the magnet experiments, scientists came to the realization that their wave function description was not as complete as they had hoped. There was some other property that had to be included – but what?

In 1925, two scientists by the names of Samuel Goudsmit and George Uhlenbeck (Figure 7.1) suggested extending the wave function equation so that it included a fourth quantum number, called the &quot;spin&quot; quantum number. When any charged object (like, for example, a negatively charged electron) spins in a magnetic field, its energy is determined by the direction in which it rotates. In other words, if the object rotates clockwise, it will have a different amount of energy than it would have if it had rotated counterclockwise. Goudsmit and Uhlenbeck argued that if the electron was spinning, then it was easy to explain why those two closely spaced spectral lines split further apart in the presence of a magnetic field.

[[File:UhlenbeckKramersGoudsmit.jpg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 7.1''': George Uhlenbeck (on the far left) and Samuel Goudsmit (on the far right), the two scientists who first proposed the existence of the spin quantum number.]]

One line corresponded to the energy level for the electron spinning clockwise, and the other corresponded to the energy level for the electron spinning counterclockwise. (If you're really clever, you might wonder why these two energy levels were different and could be seen in atomic spectra even when there weren't any external magnets around. It turns out that there are always tiny internal magnetic fields created by matter itself. Usually, though, these internal magnetic fields are very small, so their effect is very small as well.)

Pictured below are two negatively charged particles spinning in a magnetic field. The left particle will have a different energy than the right particle, because they are spinning in different directions.

[[File:Two negatively charged particles spinning in a magnetic field.png|500px|center]]

By incorporating electron spin into the electron wave function, scientists found that the fourth quantum number, also known as the spin quantum number, ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;, could take on two different values – they were ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;+1/2 and ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;−1/2. Notice that unlike ''n'', ''ℓ'' and ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt;, which can only be integers, ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; can be ''half-integers''. The value of ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; will never be some crazy decimal like ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.943895, but it can be the decimal ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.5, because that corresponds to ''one-half'', or a ''half-integer''.

Now it's tempting to think of ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;+1/2 as the electron spinning in one direction, and ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;−1/2 as the electron spinning in the other direction. When you do that, though, how are you picturing the electron? You're picturing it as a particle, aren't you? And how do you explain the wave-like nature of an electron in terms of rotation clockwise or counterclockwise? Well, you can't. So despite the fact that the idea for including electron spin in the wave function came from picturing electrons as tiny little spinning objects, scientists try not to make any direct comparisons between the spin quantum number and a particle rotating clockwise or counterclockwise. Instead, scientists usually make vague statements like &quot;spin can only ''truly'' be understood as a ''quantum'' property. There is no directly comparable macroscopic (large scale) property&quot;. Rather than saying anything about a clockwise rotation, or a counterclockwise rotation, scientists call electrons with ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;+1/2 &quot;'''spin-up'''&quot; and electrons with ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;−1/2 &quot;'''spin down'''&quot;.

==When Two Electrons Occupy the Same Orbital, They Will Have Opposite Spins==
Do you remember what an orbital is? An orbital is a wave function for an electron with a specific set of quantum numbers, ''n'', ''ℓ'', and ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt;. For example, the numbers ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, ''ℓ''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, and ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 define one particular orbital, while the numbers ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2, ''ℓ''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, and ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;−1 define another orbital, and the numbers ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2, ''ℓ''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 and ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 define a different orbital again. Orbitals are very important because any time you know the values of the first three quantum numbers ''n'', ''ℓ'' and ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt;, you know the region in space where there is a high probability of finding the electron. In other words, if you know which orbital an electron is in, you know exactly what its &quot;box&quot;, or &quot;territory&quot; looks. The orbital is really just a description of ''where'' the electron spends most of its time.

For example, if you're told that the electron is in an orbital with ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, ''ℓ''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, you automatically know that the electron is probably going to be found in a spherical shaped &quot;territory&quot; that's pretty close to the nucleus of the atom. On the other hand, if you're told that the electron is in an orbital with ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;5, ''ℓ''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 and ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 you know that the electron is probably going to be found in a dumb-bell shaped &quot;territory&quot; that extends quite far from the nucleus of the atom, along the ''y''-axis (technically speaking ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 could be the orbital along the ''x''-axis, the orbital along the ''y''-axis or the orbital along the ''z''-axis, but whichever axis you choose for the ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 orbital, the ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 and ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;−1 orbitals will automatically point along the other two axes).

The spin quantum number doesn't tell you anything about the region in space where you're likely to find the electron. Therefore, if you want to know which orbital an electron is in, ''all'' you need to know is the values of the first three quantum numbers – you don't need to know the value of the fourth. So why is the value of the fourth quantum number important? Well, the spin quantum number determines whether or not an electron is ''allowed'' to share an orbital with another electron that's already there. It turns out that each region of the atom (or each orbital) can actually be shared by ''two'' electrons.

Two electrons can share their territory, or their orbital, provided each electron does something different. This means that sharing an orbital is ''only'' possible for electrons which have ''different spin quantum numbers''. An electron that has a spin quantum number of ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;+1/2 can share an orbital with an electron that has a spin quantum number of ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;−1/2. However, an electron that has a spin quantum number of ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;+1/2 ''cannot'' share an orbital with another electron that also has a spin quantum number of ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;+1/2. Similarly, an electron that has a spin quantum number of ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;−1/2 ''cannot'' share an orbital with another electron that has a spin quantum number of ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;−1/2.

==When Electrons are Paired, They are Diamagnetic (i.e. No Magnetic Attraction)==
In the last section, you learned that any time two electrons share the same orbital, their spin quantum numbers have to be different. In other words, one of the electrons has to be &quot;spin-up&quot;, with ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;+1/2, while the other electron is &quot;spin-down&quot;, with ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;−1/2. This is important when it comes to determining the ''total spin'' in an electron orbital. Technically speaking, an electron's ''spin'' isn't exactly the same as its ''spin quantum number'', but the difference isn't important when it comes to figuring out whether or not two electron spins cancel out. In order to decide whether or not electron spins cancel all you need to do is add their spin quantum numbers together. If the ''total is'' 0, then the ''spins cancel'' each other out. If the ''total is greater than'' 0, or ''less than'' 0, then the ''spins do not cancel'' each other out. Let's take a look at two examples:
{{High School Chemistry/Example|Example 1}}
Electron ''A'' has ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;+1/2 while electron ''B'' has ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;−1/2. Do the spins of these two electrons cancel each other out?
----
'''Solution''':

:''m''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; for ''A'' = +1/2
:''m''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; for ''B'' = −1/2

:Total ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; for ''A'' + ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; for ''B''
:Total ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; = (+1/2) + (−1/2)
:Total ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; = 1/2 − 1/2
:Total ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; = 0

In this case, the spins of electron ''A'' and electron ''B do'' cancel each other out.

{{High School Chemistry/Example|Example 2}}
Electron ''A'' has ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;−1/2 while electron ''B'' has ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;−1/2. Do the spins of these two electrons cancel each other out?
----
'''Solution''':

:''m''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; for ''A'' = −1/2
:''m''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; for ''B'' = −1/2

:Total ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; for ''A'' + ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; for ''B''
:Total ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; = (−1/2) + (−1/2)
:Total ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; = −1/2 − 1/2
:Total ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; = −1

In this case, the spins of electron ''A'' and electron ''B do not'' cancel each other out.

The idea of &quot;canceling out&quot; should make sense to you. If one spin is &quot;up&quot;, and the other is &quot;down&quot;, then the &quot;up&quot; spin cancels the &quot;down&quot; spin and there is no leftover spin at all. The same logic applies if we think of spins as &quot;clockwise&quot; and &quot;counterclockwise&quot;. If one spin is &quot;clockwise&quot; and the other is &quot;counterclockwise&quot;, then the two spin directions balance each other out and there is no leftover rotation at all. Notice what all of this means in terms of electrons sharing an orbital. Since electrons in the same orbital ''always'' have opposite values for their spin quantum numbers, ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;, they will ''always'' end up canceling each other out! In other words, there is no leftover (or &quot;net&quot;) spin in an orbital that contains two electrons. Whenever two ''electrons are paired'' together in an orbital, we call them '''diamagnetic electrons'''. On the other hand, an orbital containing only one electron will have a total spin equal to the spin of the electron that it contains.

Even though electron spin can only be ''truly'' understood using quantum physics, it does produces effects that we can actually see in our everyday lives. Electron spin is very important in determining the magnetic properties of an atom. If all of the electrons in an atom are paired up and share their orbital with another electron, then the total spin in each orbital is zero and, by extension, the total spin in the ''entire atom'' is zero as well! When this happens, we say that the atom is diamagnetic because it contains ''only'' diamagnetic electrons. '''Diamagnetic atoms''' are ''not'' attracted to a magnetic field. In fact, diamagnetic atoms are slightly repelled by magnetic fields.

Since diamagnetic atoms are slightly repelled by a magnetic field, it is actually possible to make certain diamagnetic materials float! To the right you can see a thin black sheet of pyrolytic graphite floating above the gold colored magnets.

==When an Electron is Unpaired, Paramagnetism will be Observed==
If atoms that contain ''only paired electrons'' are slightly ''repelled'' by a magnetic field, what do you think is true of atoms that contain ''unpaired electrons''? If you guessed that atoms with unpaired electrons are slightly attracted to a magnetic field, then you guessed right! Whenever ''electrons are alone'' in an orbital, we call them '''paramagnetic electrons'''. Remember, if an electron is all by itself in an orbital, the orbital has a &quot;net&quot; spin, because the spin of the lone electron doesn't get canceled out. If even one orbital has a &quot;net&quot; spin, the entire atom will have a &quot;net&quot; spin as well. Therefore, we say an ''atom is paramagnetic'' when it ''contains at least one paramagnetic electron''. Notice that the definition of diamagnetism and the definition of paramagnetism are subtly different. This can be confusing if you aren't careful. Be sure to note: In order for an atom to be diamagnetic, ''all'' of its electrons must be paired up in orbitals. In order for an atom to be paramagnetic, ''at least one'' of its electrons must be unpaired.

In other words, an atom could have 10 paired (diamagnetic) electrons, but as long as it also has 1 unpaired (paramagnetic) electron, it's still considered a &quot;paramagnetic atom&quot;. In order to be a &quot;diamagnetic atom&quot;, the atom would have to have 10 paired (diamagnetic) electrons and no unpaired (paramagnetic) electrons. Just as '''diamagnetic atoms''' are slightly ''repelled from'' a magnetic field, ''paramagnetic atoms'' are slightly ''attracted to'' a magnetic field.

==Lesson Summary==
* If you only consider the first three quantum numbers, the wave function model for the electron will sometimes predict one spectral line where there are actually two closely spaced spectral lines.
* This led to the proposal of a fourth quantum number, the spin quantum number ms.
* ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; can have two possible values for an electron. It can be &quot;spin-up&quot; with ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; = +1/2 or &quot;spin-down&quot; with ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; = −1/2
* When two electrons occupy the same orbital, they must have different spin quantum numbers.
* An orbital containing two electrons will have no net spin. When this is the case, the two electrons are called diamagnetic electrons.
* An orbital containing only one electron will have a total spin equal to the spin of the electron that it contains. When this is the case, the electron is called a paramagnetic electron.
* Electron spin helps to determine the magnetic properties of an atom.
* If all electrons in an atom are diamagnetic, the entire atom has no net spin, and is termed a &quot;diamagnetic atom&quot;. Diamagnetic atoms are slightly repelled from a magnetic field.
* If an atom contains even one paramagnetic electron, the entire atom has a net spin and is termed a paramagnetic atom. Paramagnetic atoms are slightly attracted to a magnetic field.

==Who am I?==
I am '''Pkkao''', an avid train fan.  &lt;small&gt;I'm very bad at writing about myself, so read on.&lt;/small&gt;

==Where am I?==
On the Internet, I am:
*On [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Pkkao2| Wikipedia] &lt;small&gt;Darn [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Pkkao| pkkao] for stealing my username.&lt;/small&gt;
*On [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Pkkao| Wikimedia Commons]
*On [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/User:Pkkao| Wikibooks]
*On...um, well, that's it.

Otherwise, I live in Los Angeles &lt;small&gt;(Come and find me!)&lt;/small&gt;.

==What do I do?==
On Wikibooks:
*I am the (currently, sole) writer of the [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Getting_around_Los_Angeles_by_Rail| Getting around Los Angeles by Rail] and [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Rail_Transport_in_Las_Vegas| Rail Transport in Las Vegas] books.

On Wikimedia Commons:
*I've donated quite a few pictures and am planning to do more.  I categorize and organize train files here.  See [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Pkkao| my contributions].

On Wikipedia:
*Um, there's already lots of stuff here, so mainly I try to help out here and there wherever I can.  Most of the articles I help are, of course, on trains.

==More about Me==

I haven't been on here for what, a year now?  Well, it's been a really busy year, but I guess I'm here to finish up the WikiBooks I started.  So wish me luck!

I considered &quot;Train of the Day&quot; or &quot;Train of the Week,&quot; but I'm afraid that I will miss a day (or week).  I don't spend much here...

Team Strategy:

Utilizing the three focus groups (text groups) was was a great idea. The Mean scores varied great possibly suggesting that fatigue and interest seem to play a pivotal role in having an accurate base for which to gauge.[http://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/User:Jeffreycarllloyd/enes100-550/poppit Jeffreycarllloyd] 21:15, 18 September 2011 (UTC)


Tehreem comes up with great ideas on the fly. She suggested that we split the class up into 2 groups since the number of attempts at the game was different throughout the entire class.

(Note- what follows is a mix of reading notes and lecture notes. It is messy.)

===Relation to Welch===

For class, I wanted to contrast two different readings of Isocrates. Welch acknowledges the racial and cultural shortcomings of Isocrates' project. However, she more values Isocrates' ability to articulate a metaphysical/ethical system (judgment) opposed to the Ideal unity of Platonic rhetoric (Reason). The fallible elements of judgment (such that we can never claim to universally know, but rather only--within the confines of a specific time--decide) form the basis for an ethical system that sustains, rather than synthesizes, difference. In simplest terms, we might say that, while Welch recognizes Isocrates' faults, she is not going to throw out the baby with the bathwater. 

Vitanza, however, would argue that Welch under-appreciates the fundamental significance of Isocrates' Greek/barbarian binary. That is, while Welch hopes to construct a new form of paideia sensitive to the margins, Vitanza would argue that the very act of social construction always, already negates the &quot;outside.&quot; This, for Vitanza, is caught up in the term &quot;negative essentializing.&quot; Whatever &quot;we&quot; come together and build, it is always built on the back of another. For Vitanza, Isocrates' cultural warfare represents the first step in the long, historic chain of Western oppression and violence. [Vitanza sees the philosophical cultivation of this synthetic oppression in Heidegger; despite all of the post-structuralist themes running through the later Heigedder, the early Heidegger, author of Being and Time, is searching for the one, true Being behind all being. Vitanza is extremely suspicious of this kind of searching (telos).  

Of course, where Welch and Vitanza disagree sharply is on Isocrates' relationship to democracy. Welch sees Isocrates' rhetoric in direct opposition to the elitist-autocratic Socratic/Platonic philosophy. But Vitanza sees Isocrates' rhetoric, built off the cultural notion of ''paideia'', as itself quite elitist and exclusionary (especially when compared to his achronological, inventive, &lt;s&gt;re&lt;/s&gt;presentation of Gorgias. 

===Quick Primer on Nietzsche===

From his earliest work, The Birth of Tragedy, Nietzsche has been highly critical of what he calls the &quot;Apollonian&quot; spirit (which we would call, via Socrates, rationalism). The Apollonian rationalist-morality, which Nietzsche argues enters Greek culture through its contact with Jewish/Christian culture, stifles the Greeks' Dionysian spirit, which follows our natural instincts. Think:

Apollonian -&gt; nomos -&gt; sex is wrong
Dionysian -&gt; physis -&gt; sex is pleasure

Why, Nietzsche would ask, would we ever adopt a moral system that leads us away from natural pleasure? In his pivotal essay, &quot;Truth and Lie in an Extra-Moral Sense,&quot; Nietzsche makes clear that a word like &quot;wrong&quot; is a strictly human conception, designed by the weak to tame the natural power and impulses of the strong. His concept of the ubermench, then, represents one who escapes the shackles of &quot;civility&quot; and embraces his natural instincts. 

For a brief second this might sound like Plato, [http://www.handprint.com/SC/NIE/GotDamer.html but... Plato is boring].

===Vitanza's Purpose===

In some ways I am resistant to spell out exactly what it is Vitanza is attempting to accomplish. Why? Because Vitanza's project is connected to learning how to write and read otherwise. Think, for instance, of Vitanza's critique of traditional historic chronological protocols (140) or his intentionally unclear clarification (or, a la Derrida, his repeated interruptions and postponements). I do feel it is safe to say: &quot;Vitanza's post-structuralist, historiographical project is more interested in promoting in(ter)vention than (re)producing (disciplined/ary) knowledge. &quot;Today in(ter)ventions! Tomorrow the whirl&quot; (142). (See [http://books.google.com/books?id=7udeYKCQNSAC&amp;pg=PA80&amp;lpg=PA80&amp;dq=Nietzsche+whirl&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=5xSGwqIiQG&amp;sig=shERnm3VBuNxWmh7OoFOs9ISL8o&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=TWV3ToCQGYndgQfv_43mDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Nietzsche%20whirl&amp;f=false Rüdiger Safranski, Nietzsche: A Philosophical Biography p. 80]; see also, again, Burke, closing paragraph to Permanence and Chance). 
What does it mean to be a post-structuralist historiographer? 
To keep your I in the present(ation of history). See Vitanza's discussion of Momigliano.

Toward the end of chapter 3, after depicting Isocrates' elitism as a will to control, Vitanza writes:

:Instead of centering historiography and education around Dante or Goethe or Leavis's Blake, or possibly the so-called common human being, I would decenter them around such an uncanny character as a deoedipalized Oedipus, the so-called &quot;criminal&quot; and excluded element. (157)

&quot;Oedipalization&quot; doesn't refer to a pscyhological-medical issue, but a cultural one. The term is used by the philosophers Deleuze and Guattari to focus on the ways in which culture teaches us what to desire. [http://www.jstor.org/stable/3683970?seq=2 Mark Seem has a concise discussion of the term published in the journal Substance]; he writes: &quot;Oedipus is the Family-Church-State in each of us, a belief injected into our unconscious through the application of the dominant system of signs and subjugation, it is what gives us faith as it robs us of power, it is what teaches us to desire our own repression.&quot;

===Vitanza's Resistance to Isocrates===

A cluster of terms: Hegemon, Paideia, Geschlect (147); Geschlecht is the truly troubling term, because it essentializes a higher, natural culture to which all subjects should aspire (the resonances to the Enlightenment are clear here). 

What's up with the [http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/49840?rskey=HarGcA&amp;result=5&amp;isAdvanced=false# de-monster]? [http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/121738?rskey=OSkly8&amp;result=1&amp;isAdvanced=false#eid Also monster]. Rationalism can be thought cowardly, since its dedication to make apparent lies in opposition to the monstrous whirl (or, put in more familiar theoretical lingo, it prefers the stability of signifiers to the abyss of signifieds). Vitanza believes classical philology, and following it--almost all Western intellectualism, is dedicated to taming the wild signified (this, in turn, is inherited from Aristotelian metaphysics and ontology) (see 162). Remember Sir Ken Robinson: &quot;there's one right answer. And its in the back of the book. But don't look.&quot; Except we don't have ''the'' book, so we make one(s). Vitanza writes: &quot;in talking about ''logos,'' I am talking about the sun&quot;(x). At first glance--as with Nietzsche--this might sound Platonic or Enlightenment (in terms of escaping the cave, etc). But Vitanza invokes a non-Platonic, non-rational, non-philogical sun, one that would melt all distinct/shuns (since every distinction is a distinct shunning of Other possibilities). This would be a poetry that &quot;would make words burn, not simply destroying them, but destroying constructing them, turning over the various, heretofore, fixed or decorous meanings&quot; (162). Hear Burke, &quot;A Grammar of Motives,&quot; on the vocabularies we invent:
:Men seek for vocabularies that will be faithful reflections of reality. To this end, they must develop vocabularies that are selections of reality. And any selection of reality must, in certain circumstances, function as a deflection of reality. (59)
And, Vitanza:
:&quot;My position is [...] that we are not at home in our world/whirl of language. Any and every attempt to assume that we are has or will have created for human beings dangerous situations.&quot; (157)
And, Vitanza, on our paradoxical home:
:Our home is not the earth [nomos]. Our home is the sun. The philological sun. [...] Our home, rather unhome, cannot be nationalism (race, gender, class), cannot be ''Geist,'' cannot be the earth only. These are all based on a restrictive economy. Our un/home is the sun. Our general-libidinal  economy. The earth (as the locus of philology-as-&quot;necessity&quot;) is Capital, the worst decadence; the sun (as the radical ''loci'' of ''logos''-as-&quot;luxury&quot;) is our future-anterior beyond Capital. (161)

===A Few Other Notes for Discussion===

:What Heidegger attempts ''to account for'' is what ''logos'' meant for the pre-Socratics and Plato and others. It is the Platonic view of ''logos'' that, according to Heidegger, inaugurates &quot;The History of Being.&quot; (Which is really a series of histories of Being; for each new age redefines ''logos'' for its own ends and thereby constructs a Being.) My point is that when we study The History of Rhetoric, we simultaneously are studying The History of Being. What we have, however, in this joint study is the postmodern conditions of the possibilities for rhetorics unconstrained by Platonic or Aristotelian Being(s). After all, there are others' Beings, of which we have no histories/hysteries. To historicize is to place these Others' Beings under negation. Hence, my earlier calls for hystericizing and histories of Desire. (172)

(On Isocrates and ''logos'' as home, see 174; logos as speech or writing, 176)

      <text xml:space="preserve">''Antidosis'' is not the rambling, disjointed plea for vindication of an old man, but rather a skillfully designed, unified speech modeled upon Plato’s Apology. Isocrates uses the word ''miktos'' (mixed) to refer to the speech. ''Miktos'' does not occur frequently in Greek texts of this era. Papillon interprets it as &quot;appropriate mixture.&quot; Papillon believes that Isocrates designed the Antidosis to have two contrasting sections; the first relates Isocrates’ effects on the state and the second explores the means by which Isocrates produced these accomplishments. These two sections roughly correspond to Isocrates’ public life and to his private life.

Papillon identifies two genres which comprise the speech; parts of the speech resemble nothing more than a judicial defense; “it has a proem, a partition and proof…, an ethical digression, and a peroration” (57). The second genre “consists of making the speech, which is in response to questions about his teaching, an example of his teaching” (57). Isocrates’ public and private lives inhered so closely that he could not help but see an attack on the one as a call to defense of the other. “Thus the private issue of the antidosis became for him the public issue of his value to Athens” (58), because “he saw no real distinction between the public and the private” (58) in his own life and thought.

You have probably used a lot of software over the years, here we are going to study the different classifications (types) of software that are out there.
&lt;center&gt;&lt;gallery caption=&quot;Software can perform many different tasks&quot; widths=&quot;60px&quot; heights=&quot;65px&quot; perrow=&quot;5&quot;&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

[[File:CPT-Classification_of_Software_-_relationships.svg|thumb|center|250px]]
Without software, most hardware would sit there doing nothing or perform specific tasks.  To make most hardware run we need to use software, and your task here is to select the correct type of software for each job.
=== System software ===
{{Dbox|[[w:System software|System software]]|software designed to operate the computer hardware and to provide a platform for running application software}}
[[File:Ubuntu_12.04_Final_Live_CD_Screenshot.png|thumb|center|An example of a modern GUI as used in [[w:Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]]]]
Modern computers are complex machines involving many different parts.  To keep it running well you will need system software.  System software will handle the smooth running of all the components of the computer as well as providing general functionality for other programs to use, tools to speed up the computer, tools to develop new software and programs to keep you safe from attacks.  There are several different types of system software that we will look at in more detail very shortly:


* '''Operating Systems''' are a collection of programs that ''make the computer hardware conveniently available to the user'' and also ''hide the complexities of the computer's operation''. The Operating System (such as Windows 7 or Linux) interprets commands issued by application software (e.g. word processor and spreadsheets). The Operating System is also ''an interface between the application software and computer''. Without the operating system, the application programs would be unable to communicate with the computer.

* '''Utility programs''' are small, powerful programs with a limited capability, they are usually operated by the user to maintain a smooth running of the computer system. Various examples include file management, diagnosing problems and finding out information about the computer etc. Notable examples of utility programs include copy, paste, delete, file searching, disk defragmenter, disk cleanup. However, there are also other types that can be separately installable from the Operating System.

* '''Library programs''' are a compiled collection of subroutines

* '''Translator software''' (Compiler, Assembler, Interpreter)

=== Application software ===
{{Dbox|[[w:Application software|Application software]]|software designed to help the user to perform specific tasks}}
[[File:GIMP 2.6 Anleitung Abs. 3 Ergebnis beschneiden.png|thumb|center|[[w:GIMP|GIMP]] is an example of photo editing general purpose application software]]
Application software is designed for people like me and you to perform tasks that we consider useful.  This might be the ability of a scientist to work out statistical information using a set of results, or someone who wants to play the latest computer game.  There are several categories of Application software that we'll look into shortly:

* General purpose application software.
* Special purpose application software.
* Bespoke application software

{{CPTExample|title=Example: Software categories}}
Place the following software into its correct category:
* Computer Game - This is built for a human user, therefore it is application software
* Virus Scanner - This is built to make the computer run better, therefore it is system software

There are many types of programming languages out there and you might already have heard of a few of them, for example: C++, VB.NET, Java, Python, Assembly.  We will now look at the history of how these languages came about and what they are still useful for.  In all cases keep in mind that the only thing a computer will execute is machine code or '''object code''' when it has been converted from a language to run on a processor.

=== First generation ===
[[File:Colossus.jpg|thumb|center|The [[w:Colossus computer|Colossus]] Mark 2 was the world's first electronic digital programmable computer.  Operators had to write the machine code directly by setting switches.]]

The [[w:First-generation programming language|first generation]] program language is pure machine code, that is just ones and zeros, e.g.&lt;math&gt;0010010010101111101010110&lt;/math&gt;.  Programmers have to design their code by hand then transfer it to a computer by using a punch card, punch tape or flicking switches.  There is no need to translate the code and it will run straight away.  This may sound rather archaic, but there are benefits:
{{Plus|Code can be fast and efficient}}
{{Plus|Code can make use of specific processor features such as special registers}}

And of course drawbacks

{{Minus|Code cannot be ported to other systems and has to be rewritten}}
{{Minus|Code is difficult to edit and update}}

=== Second generation programming ===
As you can imagine, writing in 1s and 0s all day will leave you prone to mistakes.  [[w:Second-generation programming language|Second-generation]] programming languages are a way of describing Assembly code which you may have already met.

By using codes resembling English, programming becomes much easier.  The usage of these [[w:Mnemonic|mnemonic]] codes such as &lt;code&gt;LDA&lt;/code&gt; for load and &lt;code&gt;STA&lt;/code&gt; for store means the code is easier to to read and write. To convert an assembly code program into object code to run on a computer requires an '''Assembler''' and each line of assembly can be replaced by the equivalent one line of object (machine) code:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;margin: 1em auto 1em auto&quot;
|-
! Assembly Code !!  !! Object Code
|-
| 
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
LDA A
ADD #5
STA A
JMP #3
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
||
-&gt; Assembler -&gt;
||
000100110100&lt;br /&gt;
001000000101&lt;br /&gt;
001100110100&lt;br /&gt;
010000000011
|}
Assembly code has similar benefits to writing in machine code, it is a one to one relationship after all.  This means that assembly code is often used when writing low level fast code for specific hardware.  Until recently machine code was used to program things such as mobile phones, but with the speed and performance of languages such as [[w:C (programming language)|C]] being very close to Assembly, and with C's ability to talk to processor registers, Assembly's use is declining.

As you can hopefully see there are benefits to using Second-Generation Languages over First-Generation, plus a few other things that makes Assembly great:
{{Plus|Code can be fast and efficient}}
{{Plus|Code can make use of specific processor features such as special registers}}
{{Plus|As it is closer to plain English, it is easier to read and write when compared to machine code}}

And of course drawbacks

{{Minus|Code cannot be ported to other systems and has to be rewritten}}

=== Third generation (High Level Languages) ===
Even though Assembly code is easier to read than machine code, it is still not straightforward to perform loops and conditionals and writing large programs can be a slow process creating a mish-mash of [[w:Goto|goto]] statements and jumps.  [[w:Third-generation programming language|Third-generation]] programming languages brought many programmer-friendly features to code such as loops, conditionals, classes etc.  This means that one line of third generation code can produce many lines of object (machine) code, saving a lot of time when writing programs.
{{Dbox|Imperative languages|code is executed line by line, in a programmer defined sequence}}
Third generation (High Level Languages) codes are imperative.  Imperative means that code is executed line by line, in sequence.  For example:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;vbnet&quot; line&gt;
dim x as integer
x = 3
dim y as integer
y = 5
x = x + y
console.writeline(x)
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
Would output: &lt;samp&gt;8&lt;/samp&gt;

Third generation languages can be platform independent, meaning that code written for one system will work on another.  To convert a 3rd generation program into object code requires a '''Compiler''' or an '''Interpreter'''.

To summarise:
{{Plus|Hardware independence, can be easily ported to other systems and processors}}
{{Plus|Time saving programmer friendly, one line of 3rd gen is the equivalent of many lines of 1st and 2nd gen}}

However

{{Minus|Code produced might not make the best use of processor specific features unlike 1st and 2nd gen}}
{{ExampleRobox|theme=6|title=Extension: Programming Paradigms}}
There are several types of Third-generation languages that you will cover in more detail at A2. They include:
* [[w:Object oriented programming|Object Orientated]]
* [[w:Event-driven programming|Event driven]]
{{Robox/Close}}

=== Fourth generation ===
[[w:Fourth-generation programming language|Fourth-generation]] languages are designed to reduce programming effort and the time it takes to develop software, resulting in a reduction in the cost of software development. They are not always successful in this task, sometimes resulting in inelegant and hard to maintain code.  Languages have been designed with a specific purpose in mind and this might include languages to query databases ([[w:SQL|SQL]]), languages to make reports ([[w:Oracle Reports|Oracle Reports]]) and languages to construct user interface ([[w:XUL|XUL]]).  An example of 4th generation programming type is the declarative language

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;SQL&quot;&gt;
--an example of a Structured Query Language (SQL) to select criminal details from a database
SELECT name, height, DoB FROM criminals WHERE numScars = 7;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

{{Dbox|Declarative languages|describe what computation should be performed and not how to perform it. Not imperative!}}

An example of a declarative language is [[w:CSS|CSS]] which you might learn more about when completing any web design unit
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;CSS&quot;&gt;
/*code to change the headings on a page to green and the paragraphs to red and italic*/

p { color : #FF0000; font-style : italic }
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

{{displaytitle|title=Fundamentals of Computer Systems: Types of program translator}}
&lt;/NOINCLUDE&gt;
=== Assembler ===
An '''assembler''' translates assembly language into machine code. Assembly language consists of mnemonics for machine opcodes so assemblers perform a 1:1 translation from mnemonic to a direct instruction.  For example:

&lt;code&gt;LDA #4&lt;/code&gt; converts to &lt;code&gt;0001001000100100&lt;/code&gt;

Conversely, one instruction in a high level language will translate to one or more instructions at machine level.

'''Advantages of using an Assembler:'''
{{Plus|Very fast in translating assembly language to machine code as 1 to 1 relationship}}
{{Plus|Assembly code is often very efficient (and therefore fast) because it is a low level language}}
{{Plus|Assembly code is fairly easy to understand due to the use of English-like mnemonics}}

'''Disadvantages of using Assembler:'''
{{Minus|Assembly language is written for a certain instruction set and/or processor}}
{{Minus|Assembly tends to be optimised for the hardware it's designed for, meaning it is often incompatible with different hardware}}
{{Minus|Lots of assembly code is needed to do relatively simple tasks, and complex programs require lots of programming time}}

=== Compiler ===
A '''Compiler''' is a computer program that '''translates code''' written in a high level language to a lower level language, object/machine code. The most common reason for translating source code is to create an executable program (converting from a high level language into machine language).  

'''Advantages of using a compiler'''
{{Plus|Source code is not included, therefore compiled code is more secure than interpreted code}}
{{Plus|Tends to produce faster code than interpreting source code}}
{{Plus|Produces an executable file, and therefore the program can be run without need of the source code}}

'''Disadvantages of using a compiler'''
{{Minus|Object code needs to be produced before a final executable file, this can be a slow process}}
{{Minus|The source code must be 100% correct for the executable file to be produced}}

=== Interpreter ===
An interpreter program executes other programs directly, running through program code and executing it line-by-line. As it analyses every line, an interpreter is slower than running compiled code but it can take less time to interpret program code than to compile and then run it — this is very useful when prototyping and testing code.  Interpreters are written for multiple platforms, this means code written once can be run immediately on different systems without having to recompile for each.  Examples of this include flash based web programs that will run on your PC, MAC, games console and Mobile phone.

'''Advantages of using an Interpreter'''
{{Plus|Easier to debug(check errors) than a compiler}}
{{Plus|Easier to create multi-platform code, as each different platform would have an interpreter to run the same code}}
{{Plus|Useful for prototyping software and testing basic program logic}}

'''Disadvantages of using an Interpreter'''
{{Minus|Source code is required for the program to be executed, and this source code can be read making it insecure}}
{{Minus|Interpreters are generally slower than compiled programs due to the per-line translation method}}
{{CPTExercise|title=Types of program translator}}
{{CPTQuestion|Name the three types of program translator and describe what level of language each translates}}
{{CPTAnswer|
* Assembler - Low Level (Assembly)
* Compiler - High Level
* Interpreter - High Level
}}
{{CPTQuestion|Why might you want to use a compiler instead of an interpreter?}}
{{CPTAnswer|A compiler makes faster, more secure code}}
{{CPTQuestion|Why might you want to use an interpreter instead of a compiler?}}
{{CPTAnswer|Interpreters allow for code to run on multiple platforms, it allows you to debug and test code without having to re-compile the entire source code}}
{{CPTQuestion|For a computer game running on a home console, would you use a compiler or an interpreter? Explain why.}}
{{CPTAnswer|
Compiler: as it produces faster code.  Also object code that is produced is difficult to read, meaning competitors won't easily be able to steal or users hack the code.

OR:

Interpreter (harder to get marks for this): As more and more developers create games for multiple platforms, an interpreted language would allow for code written once to be run on different consoles and even phone platforms
}}
{{CPTQuestion|For a simple learning tool that will be released on the web for school children to use at home, what would be the best choice of translator? Explain why.}}
{{CPTAnswer|'''Interpreter''' : Students will be using different operating systems and hardware at home, so it is necessary to create code that is multi-platform.  As it is an educational tool, it probably wouldn't need the speed boost that a compiler would provide.

&lt;/NOINCLUDE&gt;
We should know by now that system software is software that helps a computer to run. We will now look at the different types of system software out there and why each is needed:

=== Operating system software ===
An [[w:operating system|operating system]] (OS) is a set of programs that manage computer hardware resources and provide common services for application software. The operating system is the most important type of system software in a computer system. Without an operating system, a user cannot run an application program on their computer (unless the application program is self booting).

[[File:Xfce-4.4.png|thumb|center|[[w:Xfce|Xfce]] [[w:gui|Graphical User Interface]] to a [[w:linux|Linux]] operating system]]

Time-sharing operating systems schedule tasks for efficient use of the system and may also include accounting for cost allocation of processor time, mass storage, printing, and other resources.

For hardware functions such as input/output and main memory management, the operating system acts as a middleman between application programs and the computer hardware, although the application code is usually executed directly by the hardware it will frequently call the OS or be interrupted by it. Operating systems can be found on almost any device that contains a computer, from mobile phones and video game consoles to supercomputers and web servers.

Examples of popular modern operating systems include Android, iOS, Linux, Mac OS X and Microsoft Windows, but don't use these names in the exam!
{{ExampleRobox|theme=6|title=Extension: Open vs Closed Source operating systems}}
You might hear the words Open Source when you read about operating systems.  [[w:Linux|Linux]] is the most well known Open Source OS and [[w:Microsoft_Windows|Windows]] is the most well known Closed Source OS.  So what does this mean?

Open Source programs are programs where you can see the code (the source), you can edit it, copy it and use as you wish within the confines of an [[w:Open-source_license|open source license]].  You can even sell it, but the person would be welcome to acquire the code for free if they wanted.  As a result of this Linux is not developed by one person or one company but uses code developed by thousands of people, working for different organisations all over the world.  And as a result there are many different versions (known as [[w:Linux_distribution|distributions]]) of Linux out there including Ubuntu, Slackware and Fedora.  Android is built using Linux code.

Closed Source software doesn't allow people to look at the code or adapt it. Companies normally sell closed source products and you'll have to pay for a copy of Windows. Currently about 83% of desktops run the Windows OS.
{{Robox/Close}}

=== Utility programs ===
[[w:Utility software|Utility software]] is a type of system software designed to help analyse, configure, optimize and maintain the computer. A single piece of utility software is usually called a utility or tool.

Utility software should not be confused with application software, which allows users to do things like creating text documents, playing games, listening to music or surfing the web. Rather than providing these kinds of user-oriented or output-oriented functionality, utility software usually focuses on how the computer infrastructure (including the computer hardware, operating system, application software and data storage) operates. Due to this focus, utilities are often rather technical and targeted at people with an advanced level of computer knowledge.

[[File:KDEsystemguard screenshot.png|thumb|center|[[w:KDE System Guard|KDE System Guard]] monitoring the CPU usage, processes and memory usage]]

Examples of utility software include:
* [[w:Virus scanner|Virus scanner]] - to protect your system from trojans and viruses
* [[w:Disk defragmenter|Disk defragmenter]] - to speed up your hard disk
* [[w:System monitor|System monitor]] - to look at your current system resources
* [[w:File managers|File managers]] - to add, delete, rename and move files and folders

=== Library programs ===
[[w:Library (computing)|Library programs]] are collections of resources used to develop software. These include pre-written code and subroutines.

[[Image:Ogg vorbis libs and application dia.svg|thumb|center|Illustration of an application which uses libvorbisfile to play an [[w:Ogg Vorbis|Ogg Vorbis]] media file]]

Library programs contain code and data that provide services to other programs such as interface (look and feel), printing, network code and even the graphic engines of computer games.  If you have ever wondered why all Microsoft Office programs have the same look and feel, that is because they are using the same graphical user interface libraries.  For computer games a developer might not have the time and budget to write a new graphics engine so they often buy graphical libraries to speed up development, this will allow them to quickly develop a good looking game that runs on the desired hardware.  For example Battlefield 3 and Need for Speed both use the same [[w:Frostbite_(game_engine)|Frostbite]] engine.
[[File:Fpsengine.svg|thumb|center|500px|The history of game engine development]]
Most programming languages have a standard set of libraries that can be used, offering code to handle input/output, graphics and specialist maths functions. You can also create your own custom libraries and when you start to write lots of programs with similar functionality you'll find them very useful.  Below is an example of how you might import libraries into VB.NET:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
'imports the libraries allowing a program to send emails
Imports System.Net.Mail

'imports the libraries allowing a program to draw in 2D
Imports System.Drawing.Drawing2D
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

=== Translator software ===
The final type of system software that you need to know is translator software.  This is software that allows new programs to be written and run on computers, by converting source code into machine code.  There are three types that we'll cover in a lot more detail shortly:
* Assembler - converts assembly code into machine code
* Interpreter - converts 3rd generation languages such as javascript into machine code one line at a time
* Compiler - converts 3rd generation languages such as C++ into machine code all at once

&lt;/NOINCLUDE&gt;
=== General purpose application software ===
General purpose application software is a type of software that can be used for a variety of tasks.  It is not limited to one particular function.  For example a word processor could be classed as general purpose software as it would allow a user to write a novel, create a restaurant menu or even make a poster.

[[File:LibreOffice Impress 3.3.png|thumb|center|Impress presentation software in [[w:LibreOffice|LibreOffice]] 3.3.0]]

Examples of General purpose application software include: Word processors, Spreadsheet and Presentation software.  Whatever you do, do not use brand names!

=== Special purpose application software ===
Special purpose application software is a type of software created to execute one specific task.  For example a camera application on your phone will only allow you to take and share pictures.  Another example would be a chess game, it would only allow you to play chess.

[[File:Chromium_(web_browser).png|thumb|center|[[w:Chromium_(web_browser)|Chromium]] web browser]]

Other examples of special purpose application software are web browsers, calculators, media players, calendar programs etc. Again, make sure that you don't use brand names!

=== Bespoke application software ===
Bespoke application software is tailor made for a specific user and purpose. For example a factory may require software to run a robot to make cars, however, it is the only factory making that car in the world, so the software required would have to be specially built for the task.

Other examples might include software for the military, missile/UAV operations, software for hospitals and medical equipment, software being written inside banks and other financial institutions.

There are several things to consider before purchasing bespoke software, on the plus side:
{{Plus|Software is built for and will meet your precise needs}}

However, you must also consider

{{Minus|Software will be expensive as you have to cover all of the production costs}}
{{Minus|It may take some time to develop the software, when special purpose software could be brought straight away}}
{{Minus|The software is more likely to be buggy as it probably won't have thousands of clients using and testing it}}

{{CPTExercise|title=Exercise: Application Software}}
{{CPTQuestion|List and describe the three types of application software:}}
{{CPTAnswer|
* General purpose software - software that can be used for multiple purposes
* Special purpose software - software built for a specific purpose
* Bespoke application software - software built for a specific user and purpose
}}
{{CPTQuestion|Give an example of each:}}
{{CPTAnswer|
(Don't let the examiner catch you using product names!)
* General purpose software - word processor / presentation software / spreadsheet
* Special purpose software - Web browser / media players / calender programs
* Bespoke application software - car robot control software / military control software
}}
{{CPTQuestion|Why might you choose to use general purpose software instead of bespoke software, why might it not be suitable?}}
{{CPTAnswer|
general purpose software is:
* cheaper than bespoke
* readily available, whilst bespoke may take some time to write
* able to perform multiple tasks
* probably less buggy
However,
* it might not perform all the tasks needed by the user

      <text xml:space="preserve">* Jacob asks his readers for a more generous reading of Aristotle: noting that many Greek philosophers and rhetoricians wrote against the sophists (including Isocrates, seemingly the chief sophist), Jacob suggests that Aristotle and Plato “at least some of the time, reflected an understanding and respect for the work of the sophists and rhetors similar to the one now emerging” (237). 
* Jacob examines, for example, Aristotle’s treatment of Protagoras: Jacob suggests that, though many readings of Aristotle suggest that this passage is meant as a condemnation of Protagoras’ rhetorical practices, this passage could instead be read as “an approval of their use and of deception in general in rhetorical speech” (239). Jacob then draws on his previous work to suggest that Aristotle’s reflections on Socrates act as a connection (as opposed to a contrast) between Socrates and Protagoras. 
* Jacob’s extended discussion of Corax, normal, and abnormal seeks to underscore the ways in which Aristotle’s denunciation of rhetoric is inherently rhetorical and, quite possibly, meant to be ironic: “In this reading of our passage from Aristotle, Protagoras is quoted, I believe, with a delicate and wickedly effective irony” and as an attempt to present multiple voices that challenge the reader (243). 
* Even the polemics, according to Jacob’s reading are “in fact, ironic in intention” (244). Jacob notes with some interest the hyperbolic and emotional nature of the polemics and suggests that a deeper reading of these passages suggests “that Aristotle does not intend the arguments about law seriously. If he does not, then there is, in the polemics, a voice that is not Aristotle's, since Aristotle does teach that ethos and pathos have an integral role to play in rhetoric and are artful proofs within rhetoric” (246). 
* Jacob concludes that these two examples (Aristotle’s attention to the relationship between Socrates and Protagoras and the hyperbolic nature of the polemics) suggest that Aristotle’s ''On Rhetoric'' should be read a least semi-ironically, especially insofar as “speech relies on ethos and pathos even when the speaker denies that it is doing so” (250).


What If Aristotle Took Sophists Seriously? New Readings in Aristotle’s Rhetoric
Bernard E. Jacob
Rhetoric Review, Vol. 14, No. 2 (Spring, 1996), pp. 237 – 252


In his article, Jacobs posits an alternative reading of Aristotle that portrays him as sympathetic to the sophist rhetorical methodology, eventually justifying the use of fallacy in argument. Jacobs begins his article by arguing that the shift in focus that readers pick up on in Aristotle’s Rhetoric from the first book to the rest of the work (hyper logos, to more ethos/pathos) is intentional, and that Aristotle’s uses the change in tone as a rhetorical device upon his readers with the intention of more effectively plying them with emotional arguments later in the piece. He argues that “it would be very strange if a Socratic like Aristotle should be incapable of irony, that is, distortion in a good cause.” So, while he still holds that Aristotle would require the cause to be ethical (and perhaps I use that word loosely…), the methods one employs need not be held to the same standard so long as they serve the ultimate goal of good. Jacobs develops his argument along the lines that “ the core of dialectic… is coeval with the discovery of the fallacies that make the fireworks of sophistry possible.” Essentially, the two (dialectic and fallacy) develop together because they are useful together
Jacobs notes that, while the legalistic rhetoric that Aristotle calls for in book I relies heavily on ‘what is likely,’ Aristotle is also aware that that very logic that allows for discussion of the likeliness requires the acceptance of unlikely occurrence, essentially opening the doors for the use of fallacy that he quietly supports in the rest of the work.
While the argument that Jacobs puts forth is playful, it is also compelling. Essentially, his claim is that Aristotle uses the first chapter in book I to arouse audience emotion by stirring them up with a call to hyper-legalilstic rationality. Much like a magician might use sleight of hand to mislead an audience that the final reveal will work impressively, Aristotle’s priming of the audience with logo-centric arguments opens the door for a more effective use of ethos and pathos for the rest of his work. This which allows him to advocate a practical application of fallacy beyond pisteis. Rather than just being able to see what could be persuasive, Jacobs argues that Aristotle is advocating their use, as well.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Welch, Kathleen E. Electric Rhetoric / Classical Rhetoric, Oralism, and a New Literacy. Cambridge, MA: MIT P, 1999. ==

===Isocrates's Rhetoric===
:&quot;For Isocrates, rhetoric consists of language as it constitutes part of thought (that is, interior discourse) and language as it constitutes one's negotiations with the world (that is, exterior discourse). Writing, speaking, and thinking are mutually dependent for him and, I contend, heavily conditioned by the technology of writing&quot; (34). 

:&quot;[...]rhetoric works toward more complex thinking, part of which derives from the act of writing, which brings with it the ability to construct a disembodied audience&quot; (43). 

:&quot;[...] logos signifies not simply speech but rather can signify thought, reflection, a story, history, or reasoning&quot; (46). 

===Nomos or Physis / Rhetoric as Metaphysics or Ornament (Or, [the Paradox of] Sub.stance v. Sytle)===

Here's how I interpret Welch's interpretation of Isocrates (pg. 31). Welch turns the physis/nomos binary on its head. It is not that we are physis-ically perfect and then corrupted by nomos (as, say, we appear in the allegory of the cave, such that by transcending our human institutions, relations, and neighbors we reach a higher ethical/moral knowledge); rather, it is through our ability to come together as neighbors, relations, institutions that we transcend (if that is the right word), our baser human instincts. 

Another way I frame her project: instead of thinking about Isocrates in terms of style, let's think of him as articulating a metaphysic. Here's how she puts it:

:What happens to classical rhetoric when Isocrates' rhetorical theories are interpreted as a central, and not merely a decorative, part of the ideology that incorporates a traditionally received body of material? (33). 

===Rhetoric as Ethics===

Words Welch uses to describe Isocrates' logos and rhetoric: associative (pg 32) (vs. abstract), belief (32) (vs certainty), judgment (39-40) (vs. knowledge). For Welch's discussion of judgment vs. philosophy see 39-40. Important for Welch's recasting of Isocrates: he equally insists that strong external discourse equates to strong internal discourse. Fake it to you make it(?) 

Welch: &quot;Isocrates claims that rhetorical study can produce wise interior discourse, or deliberation with oneself across a range of subject areas&quot; (35). 

:&quot;Isocrates returns repeatedly to the development of judgment through the the development of language ability. Writing constitutes a central role in this agenda. Crucially, Isocrates uses the word &quot;philosophia&quot; to signify the development of judgment, not just the gathering of knowledge, so that everyday issues as well as more momentous ones can be negotiated as they develop&quot; (38)

There is a strong ethical basis for Iscorates' rhetoric (see Vitanza's discussion of Isocrates' ''logos'' (NSHoR 174). Question: do you train people how to write, or how to live? In other words, to what extent are you responsible (um, Socrates) for the moral choices of your students?

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Isocrates. Vol. II. Trans. George Norlin. Cambridge, MA: Harvard UP, 2000. 159-179.==

===Why Does Isocrates Mistrust the Sophists===

First, they claim more than they should. Be wary of anyone who claims the ability to teach everyone (168). 

:I marvel when I observe these men setting themselves up as instructors of youth who cannot see that they are applying the analogy of an art with hard and fast rules to a creative process. For, excepting these teachers, who does not know that the art of using letters remains fixed and unchanged, so that we coninually and invariably use the same letters for the same purposes, while exactly the reverse is true of the art of discourse? For what has been said by one speaker is not equally useful for the speaker who comes after him; on the contrary, he is accounted most skilled in this art who speaks in a manner worthy of his subject and yet is able to discover in it topics which are nowise the same as those used by others. But the greatest proof of the difference between these two arts is that oratory is good only if it has the qualities of fitness for the occasion, propriety of style, and the originality of treatment, while in the case of letters there is no such need whatsoever. (171)

[...]

:Formal training makes such men more skilful (sic) and more resourceful in discovering the possibilities of a subject; for it teaches them to take from a readier source the topics which they otherwise hit upon in haphazard fashion. But it cannot fully fashion men who are without natural aptitude into good debaters or writers, although it is capable of leading them on to self-improvement and to a greater degree of intelligence on many subjects. (173)

Second, they claim to do it for way too cheap. 

Third, the claim to predict the future. Note that Isocrates is wary of anyone who claims to offer &quot;exact knowledge,&quot; prefering instead those who operate from judgments (167); he dismisses this &quot;art&quot; as &quot;stuff and nonsense&quot; (167). 

Fourth, there's the problem with those who teach the rather useless art of disputation (see 177).

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Notes===

Note how Isocrates opens his ''Antidosis'' distinguishing himself from the Socrates of Plato's ''Apology'' and ''Gorgias'' (p. 189). Isocrates falls back on no existence independent of the people, culture, and history around him (unlike Socrates' transcendental court). 

On the value of poetic style: 213. On the value of Hellenistic learning (vs. instrumental learning) 229. 

Isocrates' depiction of Socrates' critical insistence: 221. For Isocrates' differentiating himself from Plato etc, 232-233. 

For what it means to be wise, to have judgment, to act ethically in accordance with Isocrates' teaching, 259-263. Rhetoric as a form of ethical choice-training, 335 (compare to Vitanza, NSHoR 153). 

Study of rhetoric brings peace and tranquility, 271. 

On the mind/body split underlying the righteousness of discourse, 289.

Returning to the question of who can learn from ''Against the Sophists'', 291. On his opposition to disputation as a career (but not as an exercise), 331-333. See 333-335 for his scathing critique of metaphysics. 

Another return to the critique of the sophist in ''Against the Sophists'' (esp, the extent of their claims to teach all comers, 337). 

Persuasion a God, 323, a savior 327. Advantage and the &quot;end&quot; of rhetoric, 337-343)

      <comment>/* Other and related topics */ mental accounting claimed</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==topics so far==
As of my last conversation, I think our areas of interest include:
* Commitment mechanisms
** These can relate to many things, but essentially the idea is that someone may understand they could be irrational in the future, and take steps in the present to make it easier to act rationally or harder to act irrationally later.
* Mental accounting
** Again, this can take a number of shapes. It's primarily about using heuristics to help make decisions. It can relate to commitment mechanisms since sometimes the accounting is forward-looking.
* Behavioral finance
** This is a very broad topic area. It certainly relates to any of the areas where probabilities and risk come into play. The &quot;endowment effect&quot; is probably also important.
* Efficiency wages / fair wages
** This is about how the wages actually paid might not come straight from the equilibrium determined by supply and demand intersecting. If workers feel that they are being paid &quot;well&quot; (which might mean above the equilibrium wage) they might work harder, and if the feel they are being paid &quot;poorly&quot; they might either not take the job at all, or take it and work inefficiently, perhaps even conducting sabotage.
* Overconfidence
** People are not very good at judging how good they are at things, and usually this takes the form of overestimating their own abilities. Sometimes it can be particularly tricky because the people who are bad at something can also be more prone to believe they're good at it.
There were other areas we talked about, feel free to add stuff below. But I believe these are the starting areas of interest, and I'll be planning on finding some references in these areas to help you along.

==Zero Price Outline==
Currently the Zero Price page is incomplete. Rather than containing a full-blown article on the zero price effect, it contains a detailed outline for an article, complete with suggested discussion topics, short descriptions for each section, and a list of helpful citations. I would love to see an article developed, either by myself at a later date or by anyone with an interest in behavioral economics. The outline should provide anyone interested with enough information to complete the article.

== some starting references ==

(''This message is aimed at the students in my economics course, anyone else is welcome to consider them however they like.)''

Here's some general thoughts on the sources here.
#I'm not requiring you to use the sources I'm posting. They are recommended places I would to start if you otherwise don't know where to start, or to continue if you've already started and are not sure where to go next.
#Some of the sources I'm posting will be &quot;heavy&quot;. There will be a lot in them, and some of that will be hard to understand. Your first time through, read it, skipping the parts you don't understand, and see if you can get the gist of it. Your second time through read more carefully, and think about the hard spots. If there's math or theory which you believe is beyond your current abilities, you can decide (and talk to me if you like) about whether that's a good point to expand your abilities or whether you can afford to skip those bits.
#Some of the sources will also be &quot;broad&quot;. You should not expect yourself to capture the entire area in your one article, but to pick out enough good points that it can start to make sense to someone who's new to the ideas.
#A lot of these references require you to be on-campus to access them. You can make yourself virtually on campus while physically elsewhere by using VPN. I'll include information on that in an email.
#I use [http://scholar.google.com/ Google Scholar] a lot. One of the ways to use it is by tracking references. For instance, if I searched for [http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;q=behavioral+economics+mental+accounting&amp;btnG=Search&amp;as_sdt=0%2C3&amp;as_ylo=&amp;as_vis= behavioral economics mental accounting], I could then go to the top thing &quot;Mental Accounting Matters&quot;, and click on &quot;Cited by 1057&quot; or &quot;Related articles&quot; to find other good stuff.

Here's another reference which is interesting, and another example of zero perhaps being a special price. I was reminded of studies like the following which suggest that under some circumstances it's better to SELL a product than to GIVE it away free, even if it's not an effort to make money, but just an effort to get people to use a product (such as in economic development aid): http://harrisschool.uchicago.edu/programs/beyond/workshops/ppepapers/commit103006.pdf  [[User:TDang|TDang]] ([[User talk:TDang|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/TDang|contribs]]) 21:18, 3 October 2011 (UTC)
:On the other hand, [http://www.bostonreview.net/BR36.2/glennerster_kremer_behavioral_economics_global_development.php this article] does a quick-and-dirty survey of results from economic development experiments, and argues that in most cases, free is better than charging (at least in terms of the demand side). [[User:TDang|TDang]] ([[User talk:TDang|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/TDang|contribs]]) 21:28, 3 October 2011 (UTC)

== Another efficiency wage reference ==

I haven't looked beyond the abstract yet, but... [http://oep.oxfordjournals.org/content/55/2/336.full.pdf This] looks at efficiency wages and backward-bending labor supply. [[User:TDang|TDang]] ([[User talk:TDang|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/TDang|contribs]])

Another good source for efficiency wages is the sorta-popular book ''Animal Spirits'' by Akerlof and Schiller. It discusses two stories behind the efficiency wage. There's particularly good stuff starting on page 104, which can be seen [http://www.vwl7.wi.tu-darmstadt.de/media/vwl7/downloads_3/ws0910_2/akerlof_shiller_on_eff_wages.pdf here]. [[User:TDang|TDang]] ([[User talk:TDang|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/TDang|contribs]]) 21:48, 21 October 2011 (UTC)

== Putting math in ==

It can be possible to edit math with just standard tools. [https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikibooks/en/w/index.php?title=Bestiary_of_Behavioral_Economics/Efficiency_Wages&amp;diff=2197399&amp;oldid=2197377 This version] of the efficiency wages page does that fine. However, there are other ways to edit math which can be very useful. See the [[Help:Formulas]] page for some tips on that, and I can help if needed.

== Topic suggestions March 2012 ==

=== Material already in the book ===
There are already pages on the following. Most likely additional, related pages could be added if you're interested:
* [[Bestiary of Behavioral Economics/Self-Interest|Self-Interest]]
** This is a very interesting area where the boundary between traditional and behavioral economics is fuzzy. In practice, most of our standard economics assumes that people are selfish--that they are only concerned about their own consumption, and don't get any utility (or harm) from others' consumption. But standard economic theory doesn't actually '''require''' that consumers are selfish, it's just the most common assumption.
* [[Bestiary_of_Behavioral_Economics/Commitment_Devices|Commitment]]
** When people make decisions for the future, standard economics assumes that they will follow through on those plans in the future. Standard rationality would say that if I know I'll want to consume a lot when I'm old, then I'll save money now. In practice, it seems like people often have a hard time managing their own behavior and following through on their plans, or resisting temptation in the present.
** Commitment devices are ways a consumer can rationally handle the belief that they'll be irrational in the future.
* [[Bestiary_of_Behavioral_Economics/Efficiency_Wages|Efficiency wages]]
** This refers to the idea that employees might get paid a bit more than the most common economic arguments predict. There is a behavioral and non-behavioral explanation for this.
** This is about how the wages actually paid might not come straight from the equilibrium determined by supply and demand intersecting. If workers feel that they are being paid &quot;well&quot; (which might mean above the equilibrium wage) they might work harder, and if the feel they are being paid &quot;poorly&quot; they might either not take the job at all, or take it and work inefficiently, perhaps even conducting sabotage.
* [[Bestiary_of_Behavioral_Economics/Zero_Price|Zero price]]
** In some sense, zero should be just another price level. IN practice, people seem to respond very differently to a &quot;price&quot; of FREE than other prices.

===Other and related topics===
* Related to [[Bestiary of Behavioral Economics/Self-Interest|Self-Interest]] and [[Bestiary_of_Behavioral_Economics/Efficiency_Wages|Efficiency wages]] is the notion of '''reciprocity''', that people may respond in ways that aren't rational (by standard economics notions of rationality) to another person's behavior, whether responding positively to positive behavior or negatively to negative behavior. (See [[w:Reciprocity_(social_psychology)|this]] and [[Reciprocity_(cultural_anthropology)|this]] at Wikipedia.)
* [[w:Mental accounting]]
** Again, this can take a number of shapes. It's primarily about using heuristics to help make decisions. It can relate to commitment mechanisms since sometimes the accounting is forward-looking.

* [[w:Overconfidence effect]]
** People are not very good at judging how good they are at things, and usually this takes the form of overestimating their own abilities. Sometimes it can be particularly tricky because the people who are bad at something can also be more prone to believe they're good at it.
There were other areas we talked about, feel free to add stuff below. But I believe these are the starting areas of interest, and I'll be planning on finding some references in these areas to help you along.
* [[w:Inequity aversion]]
** Standard economics assumes that people have preferences that they try to satisfy. Behavioral economics find places where people's utility depends on the '''relative''' amount of stuff various people have--maybe consumers feel worse about their consumption if they know it is much less or more than another consumer's.
* [[w:Dictator game]], [[w:Ultimatum game]], [[w:Trust_game]] are three games (and there are other varieties) which are often used to study how people might make decisions when concerned with inequity, fairness, other's well-being, reciprocity, or any of the other notions for why a person might not behave completely selfishly.

** I'm not providing a link here because I don't think there's a good link.
** There is a very standard way to deal with how people make choices when there is some risk (you can see it in Chapter 12 of the Varian textbook). There are also many demonstrations that the standard approach is very flawed. So there are a number of alternatives.
** This is a significant area in behavioral economics and behavioral finance, but it's also a bit specialized. If you want to persue this area, let me know and I'll provide more direction.

===Additional topic possibilities===
* [[w:Independence of irrelevant alternatives]] (IIA)
** Consumers are supposed to follow the IIA. An example is something like this: You go into a restaurant and the server sells you that there is a special on pasta and on chicken. You decide to get the chicken. The server then adds that there's also a fish special. This motivates you to change your mind and order the pasta. By our normal &quot;rational&quot; economics this doesn't make sense-it's pretty much a violation of the [[w:revealed preference|revealed preference]] idea. But things like that happen often and are used as tools in marketing.

* [[w:Money illusion]]
** Usually, in economics, we assume that people are only concerned about money because of what it can purchase. So, if there's inflation which raises someone's wages by 20% and also raises prices by 20%, that person should act as if nothing has changed. But people often do respond to the '''nominal'' prices of things as well as the '''real prices'''. This is a an individual, microeconomic phenomenon with macroeconomic implications.
* [http://www.eea-esem.com/files/papers/EEA-ESEM/2011/790/Centipede%20Oslo.pdf Activity bias]
** This is the idea that people want to take action-just sitting there dong nothing doesn't feel right, and so if the optimal decision is to sit there doing nothing, they might make a less-than-optimal decision. This is most clearly a problem for economic researchers, because in [[w:experimental economics|experimental economics]] an experiment might be designed in such a way to accidentally encourage stupid behavior. But it may also explain real-world phenomena like over-active trading of stocks.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Quandahl, Ellen. “Aristotle’s Rhetoric: Reinterpreting Invention.” Rhetoric Review 4.2 (1986): 128-137.==

Quandahl argues that Aristotle's Rhetoric has been being misread by scholars as a philosophy of invention and should be re-understood instead as a philosophy of interpretation, where the importance of a composition can be found through a contextual reading and interpretation rather than its importance existing through its invention. Quandahl arrives at this re-understanding of the text by analyzing Arisostle's content as it would be interpreted by readers of the time, familiar with the texts to which he refers as well as his word choice, which includes popular culture references such as metaphors to the popular practice of the theatre drama. Quandahl points out that though Aristotle's Rhetoric is a description of invention, a documentation of the construction and components of argument, rhetoric, and dialectic, Aristotle's purpose was to theorize and document the traditions and rhetorical constructions of the time, which was novel and desperately needed, since no such theory had yet been documented, rather than to provide a taxonomy of discourse for all time. Quandahl furthers her analysis of Aristotle's Rhetoric to show, through a careful examination of what she finds as the five key terms of the Rhetoric (dialectic, proof, demonstration, enthymeme, and topic) that Aristotle himself saw rhetoric as the &quot;contextual study of language&quot; since his investigations of rhetoric examine how they occur within discourse, which requires, again, not just invention but interpretation within the discourse itself. Quahdahl finds this re-reading of the Rhetoric to be useful for modern pedagogy, which she believes should likewise take a turn away from invention as the focus of composition toward an emphasis on reading and interpretation.

Quandahl argues that understanding Aristotle as a literary/rhetorical critic approaching composition with a theoretical lens aimed at its construction/invention offers richer opportunities for Aristotelian study and for pedagogy. Does understanding Aristotle in this way, as approaching rhetoric through a particular lens rather than systematically documenting means of invention in any way devalue modern use and understanding of his work?

Aristotle makes distinct arguments about the way rhetorical argumentation should be carried out. For example, that appeals to emotion and credibility should not be used to gain rhetorical persuasion. Does this create a difficulty for Quandahl's point of view that Aristotle's Rhetoric is not a theory of invention?


'''Summary'''

Quandahl calls for a reexamining of Aristotle's On Rhetoric, specifically the topics, and considers them (the topics)  as a theory of interpretation rather than a cataloging of specific inventive practices. She notes that modern readings of the topics have generally viewed them as commonsensical and constrained by their historic period. However, she calls for a rereading of On Rhetoric in the context of  other works of the time like Plato's Gorgias. When viewed as a response to these texts and common practices in Greek instruction in oratory, Quandahl sees Aristotle's topics as interpreting language and viewing it philosophically, not as a “collection of devices for invention” (128). In this light, Quandahl considers Aristotle's topics as an early example of “meta-discourse” (132), being concerned with how to interpret language and move from “taxonomy to theory” (135), not the other way around.

'''Modern Readings of the Topics'''

“But Rhetoric is difficult to read, full of discrepancies, gaps, and repetitions” (128).

“If the text itself is exigent, scholarship makes it more so. We have to read the Rhetoric against a tradition that has interpreted it as a philosophical rhetoric, but often reduced that philosophy to a logic of argument or to taxonomies of discourse, and separated it from questions of language and style” (128).

'''Viewed in Context'''

Quandahl views On Rhetoric as a response to other works, specifically Plato's. The cataloging of topics is considered a way of viewing concepts in relation to one another. Furthermore, in typical Aristotelian fashion, they are also viewed in hierarchies and categories.

“Aristotle simply collected and theorized about the linguistic moves that were typical of philosophical discussions, especially those of Plato's dialogues. He wanted not only to reason but to look at how reasoning is represented in language” (130).

'''Topics as “Interpretation,” Not “Invention'''

Instead of viewing the topics as a superficial list of subjects, Quandahl sees them as “meta-discourse” on “relational principals” (132).

“Opposition is, for Aristotle, a very powerful topic, resembling reasoning. Given Aristotle's methods, we can assume he had observed uses of opposition in speeches, as well as in philosophical discussions and eristic debates... Following this line of thought, Aristotle began to study language in its own right and saw the importance of relations themselves... it shows that Aristotle saw how one could introduce a relational principle, like opposition, into a context to make useful statements about the context” (132).

“One could say, then, that topics are tropes that Aristotle examined in a new way. He saw that patterns—in the list of arguments Geek boys were memorizing—could be examined philosophically. The topical relations are not in themselves rules of inference. But they are ways of putting sentences together in order to make inferences” (134).

=== The mystery of diode AND gate ===

[[Image:Diode_AND_logic_idea_1000.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Revealing the basic idea behind the diode AND logic gate by applying De Morgan's laws on the whiteboard]]

Diode logic gates were introduced in 50's; I met them for the first time in the late 60's when I went to technical school. I remember I understood the explicit diode OR gate but I was in a maze by this so odd, exotic and absurd diode AND gate... I asked myself many questions as: &quot;Why the diodes were back to front? Why the resistor was connected to +V instead to ground? Why there was no input current when the input voltage was high? And why there was input current when the input voltage was low? But why the current went out of the diodes and went in the input source? What was this absurd? Why it was impossible to make inverting diode gate? Why AND gate was supplied by an additional voltage source while OR gate had not such a source?...and so on...and so on...

It is interesting fact that many years later I continued to not understand what the basic idea behind diode AND was. I perfectly knew the circuit but I didn't understand it... I &quot;saw the trees but I didn't see the forest for them&quot;... And what is more interesting I didn't see any reasonable explanations of this humble circuit somewhere to answer my childhood questions... instead I was seeing thousands of &quot;not seeing the forest&quot; explanations...

Finally (imagine it was this autumn, only three months ago), during the laboratory exercises with my students on ''Digital circuits'', I began realizing the great idea behind these legendary diode circuits. I was amazed how simple it was. I shared and considered my insights with these young people and they approved of them; they admired this &quot;elegant simplicity&quot;. We decided to share the truth about diode AND gates with wikipedians and Wikipedia readers. That is why, I have written these explanations in the article. In addition, I have listed (in '''bold''') and explained (in ''italic'') below the key points of understanding diode AND gates extracted from the main article. 

Is it an original research? I have already explained it in the article about Miller theorem. Yes, it is... but in the common sense of this term, not in the specific Wikipedia [[Wikipedia:No original research|OR]] sense. Really, I have exposed my insights about this circuit solution but I have managed to reduce them to extremely clear, evident and simple explanations  that should not be treated as original research in the Wikipedia [[Wikipedia:No original research|OR]] sense; they do not need to be referenced. If you do not agree with me, please insert your comments below the items.

=== Key points of explaining diode AND gate ===

* '''In logic gates, logical functions are performed by parallel or series connected switches controlled by input logical variables.''' ''It is well-known truth, see also [http://www.cs.indiana.edu/classes/b441-sjoh/notes/ADD/1.pdf], [http://mysite.du.edu/~etuttle/electron/elect49.htm], [http://www.ibiblio.org/kuphaldt/electricCircuits/Digital/DIGI_7.html], [http://www.asic-world.com/digital/gates1.html], etc.

* '''In diode logic, the switches are implemented by diodes: when forward biased, a diode switch is closed; when backward biased, the switch is open.''' ''It is well-known truth, see also [http://www.google.bg/search?q=%22diode+switch%22+logic&amp;hl=en&amp;prmd=ivns&amp;ei=PkYxTayoCcHtsgbCyuWgCg&amp;start=20&amp;sa=N], [http://www.electronicspoint.com/diode-switching-circuits-t222872.html], [http://www.neazoi.com/technology/logic.htm], etc.

* '''OR logic gates are implemented by parallel connected switches.''' ''It is well-known truth, see the sources above.''

* '''In a diode OR logic gate, diode switches are connected so that they act as ''normally open switches'': if the input voltage is high (input logical ''1''), the according diode switch is closed; if the input voltage is low (input logical ''0''), the diode switch is open.''' ''It is obvious, there is no problem to understand it in the case of a diode OR gate.''

* '''Diode OR logic gates consume current from input sources with high voltages and they do not inject current to input sources with low voltages; so, they belong to so-called ''current-sourcing logic''.''' ''We will discuss this phenomenon thoroughly below; for now see [http://www.edaboard.com/thread24993.html]. See also the text I have extracted from this forum (we will use it when explaining diode AND gate):''

:&quot;...If you take one of the simple power source, a battery. If the battery is 9V, and you put a load across the two poles, then the current flows through the load. The current will go in one direction. One pole could be referenced as GND, the other as Vcc. Now, take two batteries - one is the above 9V battery, the other is a 12V battery. You connect the negative poles together, let it be the GND reference. Then, if you connect a load between the two positive poles (one pin on 9V battery + pole, the other pin on the 12V battery + pole), then, current will flow, but will go in the *other* direction, in the 9V battery, than in the first case. When the 9V battery provides current, which goes out of 9V (using conventional current), the battery is said to *source* current. When the battery is absorbing current, it is said to *sink* current. Source and Sink really only does tell in which direction the conventional current flow...&quot; ''(I have corrected only some spelling mistakes)''

* '''AND logic gates should be implemented by series connected switching elements.''' ''It is a well-known truth, see the sources above.''

* '''In contrast to transistors, diodes are two-terminal switching elements, in which the input and output are not separated; they are the same. As a result, series connected diode switches cannot be driven by grounded input voltage sources.''' ''The 4-terminal relays are the most suitable electrically-controlled switches since their input and output circuits are completely separated. The 3-terminal transistors can still be used as 4-terminal switches by grounding the emitter (source); thus, the input and output circuits have a common point (the ground) but they do not interfere in each other's operation. The situation with 2-terminal diodes is the worst - here the input source and the load are connected in the same circuit and there is no way to connect the diodes in series and to drive them by grounded voltage sources.''

*  '''To solve this problem, diode AND logic gates are constructed in the same manner as OR diode gates - by parallel connected diode switches (the same idea is used in the input stage of [[Wikipedia:Transistor–transistor logic|TTL]] logic gates where base-emitter junctions are connected in parallel).''' ''If you find it difficult to see the parallel connection, imagine that all the input voltages are low (i.e., all the inputs are connected to ground).''

* '''In a diode AND logic gate, diode switches are connected so that they act as ''normally closed switches'' in respect to the input voltage: if the input voltage is high, the switch is open; if the input voltage is low, the switch is closed... To realize this idea,  the diodes are ''reverse connected'' and ''forward biased'' by an additional voltage source +V (a power supply) through the pull-up resistor R1.''' ''This is a key concept in understanding the diode AND logic gate; so, I will explain it thoroughly.''

:''The name of this circuit technique is '''biasing''' (it is not only electrical; it is a general idea that can be seen around us in this world). To be more precise, this is &quot;biasing with the same but opposite to the input quantity&quot; with the purpose to reverse the behavior of some element. In this arrangement, we apply not the genuine input voltage across the element; we apply the difference between the input and biasing (offset) voltage, i.e., we apply the inverted input voltage. As a result, the current flowing through the element is inverted as well.''

:''First, see the extracted forum text above that explains the same concept. Or imagine another problem: we have a relay with normally open contact but we need a relay with normally closed contact. What do we do? We can invert the relay behavior by connecting the one coil terminal to +V instead to ground. This means that we have inserted an additional voltage that is equal but opposite to the input voltage (traveling along the loop +V -&gt; VIN -&gt; coil). As a result of this biasing, when applying +V to the other coil terminal, the resulting voltage drop across the coil will be zero and no current will flow trough it; and v.v., when applying 0 to the coil terminal, the resulting voltage drop across the coil will be -V and current will flow trough it in opposite direction (+V -&gt; coil -&gt; input source -&gt; ground). The relay with normally open contact has become a relay with normally closed contact. 

:''We may see the same trick in a [[Wikipedia:CMOS]] logic gate, in a PNP transistor stage or in any complementary transistor stage that are driven and supplied by positive voltages. In these circuits, the upper PMOS or PNP transistor is actually driven by negative input voltage (with respect to +V), which is the inverted positive input voltage. From this viewpoint, a diode AND gate with positive input voltages is actually a diode OR gate with negative input voltages.''

* '''To obtain AND instead OR function according to De Morgan's laws, the input and output logical variables are inverted:

:'''''Y'' = NOT ((NOT (''X1'') OR NOT (''X2'')) = NOT (NOT (''X1'' AND ''X2'')) = ''X1'' AND ''X2''.'''

:''Finally, we have only to describe the diode AND structure by logical expressions and to simplify them by applying [[Wikipedia:De Morgan's laws]]. There are a lot of sources about such transformations (e.g., [http://www.rficdesign.com/logic-gate-2]).''

* '''Therefore, the diode AND logic gate is a modified diode OR logic gate: the diode AND gate is actually a diode OR gate with inverted inputs and output.''' ''This final conclusion evolves from the considerations above.''

* '''As diode AND logic gates do not consume current from input sources with high voltages and they inject current to input sources with low voltages, they belong to so-called ''current-sinking logic''.''' ''We have just explained this phenomenon above. There are also a lot of sources about current-sinking logic.''

When electrons are found inside an atom, they're restricted to specific areas, or regions within the atom which can be described by orbitals. Let's see what this means in terms of quantum numbers.

==Lesson Objectives==
* Explain the meaning of the Pauli Exclusion Principle.
* Determine whether or not two electrons can coexist in the same atom based on their quantum numbers.
* State the maximum number of electrons that can be found in any orbital.

==No Two Electrons in an Atom Can Have the Same Four Quantum Numbers==
How do you know that two electrons are in the same orbital? In order to fully specify an orbital, you need to know the principal quantum number, ''n'', the azimuthal quantum number, ''ℓ'', and the magnetic quantum number, ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt;. The values of first three quantum numbers for an electron determine exactly which orbital the electron in. Clearly, then, in order to be in the same orbital, two electrons have to have exactly the same values for ''n'', ''ℓ'', and ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt;. Now when two electrons have exactly the same values for ''n'', ''ℓ'', and ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt;, they share the same region of space within the atom, and in the last lesson, you learned that that had important consequences in terms of their spins. If you remember back to an earlier section, electrons in the same orbital, sharing the same region of space, had to have different values of ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;. If one electron had ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;+1/2, then the other had to have ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;−1/2 and vice versa. Let's take a look at several examples.
{{High School Chemistry/Example|Example 1}}
An electron with ''n'' = 2, ''ℓ'' = 1, ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;−1, and ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;+1/2 is found in the same atom as a second electron with ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2, ''ℓ''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, and ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;−1. What is the spin quantum number for the second electron?
----
'''Solution''':

First electron: ''n'' = 1, ''ℓ'' = 1, ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt; = −1, ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; = +1/2

Second electron: ''n'' = 1, ''ℓ'' = 1, ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt; = −1, ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; = ?

Since the first three quantum numbers are identical for these two electrons, we know that they are in the same orbital. As a result, the spin quantum number for the second electron cannot be the same as the spin quantum number for the first electron. This means that the spin quantum number for the second electron must be ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;−1/2.

{{High School Chemistry/Example|Example 2}}
.An electron with ''n'' = 5, ''ℓ'' = 4, ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3, and ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;−1/2 is found in the same atom as a second electron with ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;5, ''ℓ''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4, and ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3. What is the spin quantum number for the second electron?
----
'''Solution''':

First electron: ''n'' = 5, ''ℓ'' = 4, ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt; = 3, ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; = −1/2

Second electron: ''n'' = 5, ''ℓ'' = 4, ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt; = 3, ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; = ?

Since the first three quantum numbers are identical for these two electrons, we know that they are in the same orbital. As a result, the spin quantum number for the second electron cannot be the same as the spin quantum number for the first electron. This means that the spin quantum number for the second electron must be ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;+1/2.

Notice that whenever the two electrons' first three quantum numbers are the same, the fourth is different. Let's take a look at a few more examples…
{{High School Chemistry/Example|Example 3}}
Can an electron with ''n'' = 1, ''ℓ'' = 0, ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt; = 0, and ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; = +1/2 exist in the same atom as a second electron with ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2, ''ℓ''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, and ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;+1/2?
----
'''Solution''':

First electron: ''n'' = 1, ''ℓ'' = 0, ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt; = 0, ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; = +1/2

Second electron: ''n'' = 2, ''ℓ'' = 0, ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt; = 0, ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; = +1/2

Since these two electrons are in different orbitals, they occupy different regions of space within the atom. As a result, their spin quantum numbers ''can'' be the same, and thus these two electrons ''can'' exist in the same atom.

{{High School Chemistry/Example|Example 4}}
Can an electron with ''n'' = 3, ''ℓ'' = 1, ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt; = −1, and ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; = −1/2 exist in the same atom as a second electron with ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3, ''ℓ''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2, ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;−1, and ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;−1/2?

Let's take a look at one final example.
{{High School Chemistry/Example|Example 6}}

[[File:Wolfgang Pauli young.jpg|225px|thumb|'''Figure 7.2''': Wolfgang Pauli, the scientist who first proposed the Pauli Exclusion Principle.]]

Hopefully after having looked at six different examples, it should be obvious to you that electrons in the same atom with the same spin must be in different orbitals, while electrons in the same orbital of the same atom must have different spins. As a result, no two electrons in the same atom can have exactly the same four quantum numbers. If two electrons have the same ''n'', the same ''ℓ'', and the same ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt;, then they are in the same orbital. If they also have the same ms, then they also have the same spin, and that is impossible.

The first scientist to realize that two electrons in the same atom couldn’t have the same four quantum numbers was a man name Wolfgang Pauli (Figure 7.2). In 1925, Pauli stated what has come to be known as the '''Pauli Exclusion Principle'''. The Pauli Exclusion Principle states that no two identical fermions (a fancy word for electrons and other subatomic particles like electrons) may occupy the same quantum state in an atom simultaneously. In other words, no two electrons in the same atom can have the same four quantum numbers. If ''n'', ''ℓ'', and ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt; are the same, ms must be different such that the electrons have opposite spins.

==No Atomic Orbital Can Contain More than Two Electrons==
An electron can share its territory, or its orbital, with another electron, but ''only'' if the other electron is slightly different – in other words, only if the other electron has a different spin.

There’s a limit to the number of different electrons that can share an orbital, because there's a limit to the number of different spins that those electrons can have. When it comes to spins, though, there are ''only two'' possibilities. An electron can either be &quot;spin-up&quot;, with ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;+1/2, or &quot;spin-down&quot;, with ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;−1/2. Therefore, if an orbital has one electron that is &quot;spin-up&quot;, and a second electron that is &quot;spin-down&quot;, the orbital is full. What if a third electron tried to enter the orbital? Well, if the third electron was &quot;spin-up&quot; it would have trouble sharing the orbital, with the &quot;spin-up&quot; electron that's already there. Similarly, if the third electron was &quot;spin-down&quot;, it would have trouble sharing the orbital with the &quot;spin-down&quot; electron that's already there. Since the only two options for the third electron are &quot;spin-up&quot; and &quot;spin-down&quot;, there's really nothing that third electron can do – it just has to move on and find a new orbital! To summarize, then, because there are only two possibilities for the spin quantum number of an electron, ''no atomic orbital can contain more than two electrons''.

==Lesson Summary==
* The Pauli Exclusion Principle states that &quot;no two identical fermions may occupy the same quantum state in an atom simultaneously&quot;. That is, no two electrons in an atom can have ''n'', ''ℓ'', ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; all the same.
* No atomic orbital can contain more than two electrons.

''Everything'' in the universe is driven to ''minimize'' its potential energy. Previously we learned that heavy objects fall when they're dropped, because their total potential energy is lower on the ground than it is when they're hovering in the air. That's why Wile E. Coyote could drop an anvil on Road Runner – he knew that the anvil would fall, because falling would lower its potential energy. It's the same with a bowling ball placed on a hill. At the top of the hill, the bowling ball has more potential energy than it does at the bottom, so you can always bet on the bowling ball rolling down the hill rather than up the hill, because the bowling ball will always try to minimize its energy. In this lesson, we won't look at heavy objects like bowling balls and anvils. Instead, we'll look at tiny objects – we'll look
at electrons. Even though electrons are much, much smaller than anvils and bowling balls, the same principle applies. An electron will do anything that it can to lower its potential
energy.

==Lesson Objectives==
* Explain the Aufbau Principle.
* Given two different orbitals, predict which the electron will ''choose'' to go into.

==Electrons are Found in Energy Levels with Increasingly Higher Energy==
Whenever an electron is found inside an atom, it exists in what’s known as an orbital. By now, you should know what an orbital is. An orbital describes a particular region of space within the atom where the electron is most likely to be found. While orbitals are important when it comes to figuring out an electron's probable location, they are equally important when it comes to figuring out an electron's energy. Electrons in different orbitals frequently have different energies. Of course, an electron is ''never'' going to &quot;choose&quot; to be in an orbital that has a higher energy if there's space available in an orbital that has a lower energy. It's a lot like you riding the bus. You would ''never'' choose to waste energy walking 20 miles to school provided there was space for you on the bus. If there wasn't any space on the bus, though, you may be ''forced'' to walk. It's the same with electrons.

As pictured below, if there's no room on the bus, you may be forced to walk. It's the same with electrons. If there's no room in a low energy orbital, they may be forced into a higher energy orbital.

[[File:HDaumierOmnibus.JPG|500px|center]]

The fact that electrons always fill up lower energy orbitals first has important consequences when it comes to determining ''which'' orbitals contain electrons in any given atom.

Remember that the principal quantum number, ''n'', is associated with the &quot;energy level&quot; of the electron. Electrons with standing waves described by bigger values of ''n'' had higher energies, while electrons with standing waves described by smaller values of ''n'' had lower energies. If you were an electron, then, and you had the choice of being in an orbital with ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 or an orbital with ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2, which would you choose? Obviously you'd choose to be in the orbital with ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, because it has a smaller value of ''n'', and thus a lower energy (remember, both people and electrons prefer to be in states with lower energy).

Naturally, there is a limit to the total number of electrons that can exist in the same atom at the ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 energy level. In fact, it turns out that there can be at most two electrons with ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 in any given atom. That's because there is only one ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 orbital per atom. Of course, there are many atoms with more than two electrons. Lithium, for instance, has three. What happens to the electrons in an atom like lithium? Obviously, the first two electrons are going to occupy the single orbital that exists at the ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 energy level. Since this orbital only has room for two electrons, though, the third electron has to move up to the ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2 energy level. In other words, electrons will fill up orbitals in order of increasing energy. If there's space at the ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 energy level, that space will be filled before any electrons move into the ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2 energy level. Similarly, if there's space at the ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2 energy level, that space will be filled before any electrons move into the ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3 energy level.

==In an Energy Level Electrons are Assigned to Sublevels with Increasingly Higher Energy==
So far you know that an electron will always be found occupying the orbital in the first energy level, rather than the second energy level, provided that there is space available. Similarly, an electron will be found occupying the second energy level, rather than the third energy level, provided that there is space available. But what about electron sublevels? Among the orbitals with the same value of ''n'', the ''s'' orbital will always be filled first, followed by the ''p'' orbitals (and then the ''d'' orbitals).

We can summarize these rules with the following statement: Electrons will fill available orbitals starting with those at the lowest energies before moving to those at higher energies. This statement is known as the '''Aufbau Principle'''. That may sound like a funny name, but &quot;aufbau&quot; is actually the German word for &quot;construction&quot;, and the Aufbau Principle describes how the orbitals are &quot;constructed&quot; by progressively adding electrons to higher and higher energy levels.

Before we move on and consider exactly how many electrons go into each energy level, and sublevel, it's important to point out how the energies of the electrons in an atom relate to the energy of the entire atom itself. If each electron tries to minimize its energy by going into the lowest energy orbital available, then the ''total'' energy of ''all'' the electrons in the atom is also as low as possible.

Let's compare electrons minimizing their energy in an atom to your relatives minimizing their energy consumption in your family. If you do your best to turn off the lights and save as much energy as possible, and your brother does his best to turn off the lights and save as much energy as possible, and your sister does her best to turn off the lights and save as much energy as possible, and your parents also do their best to turn off the lights and save as much energy as possible, then collectively, your entire family is saving as much energy as possible as well. It's the same with electrons. If the first electron fills the lowest energy orbital available to it, and the second electron fills the lowest energy orbital available to it, and the third electron fills the lowest energy orbital available to it, and the fourth electron also fills the lowest energy orbital available to it, then collectively, the entire atom is in the lowest energy state possible as well.

Just as you would prefer to minimize your energy by sleeping, or riding a bus, electrons minimize their energy by occupying the lowest energy orbital available to them and atoms minimize their energy by having all of their electrons in the lowest energy &quot;configuration&quot; (arrangement) possible. Later, you will learn that practically all chemical processes rely on this same principle of energy minimization.

==Lesson Summary==
* In an atom, electrons will fill up orbitals in order of increasing energy.
* The principle quantum number determines the &quot;energy level&quot; of the orbital. Orbitals with lower values of ''n'' are usually associated with lower energy and will be filled first. 
* The azimuthal quantum number determines the &quot;sublevel&quot; of the orbital.
* Orbitals with lower values of ''ℓ'' (but the same value of ''n'') are always associated with lower energy and will be filled first.
* The Aufbau Principle states that electrons will fill available orbitals starting with those at the lowest energies before moving to those at higher energies.
* Since each electron in an atom minimizes its energy, the energy of the entire atom is a minimum as well.

==Review Questions==
# While we have talked about emission spectra, another type of spectra is known as absorption spectra. In emission spectra, the atom emits lines of light like those you saw in the examples of atomic spectra. In absorption spectra, the atom absorbs lines of light, rather than emitting them. Can you explain this in terms of electrons and orbitals? What do you think the relationship between absorption spectra and emission spectra might be?
# If an electron has a &quot;choice&quot; between going into an orbital in the ''n'' = 1 energy level or an orbital in the ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2 energy level, which do you think it chooses?
# If an electron in the ''n'' = 3 energy level has a &quot;choice&quot; between going into an orbital with ''ℓ''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 or an orbital with ''ℓ''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, which do you think it chooses?

#: (a) ___ electrons in the ''s'' orbital
#: (b) ___ electrons in ''p'' orbitals
#: (c) ___ electrons in ''d'' orbitals
# Fill in the blanks. There is one ''s'' orbital, three ''p'' orbitals, five ''d'' orbitals and 7 ''f'' orbitals in the ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4 energy level of an atom. If a particular atom has a total of 7 electrons in the ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4 energy level, then there are…
#: (a) ___ electrons in the ''s'' orbital
#: (b) ___ electrons in ''p'' orbitals
#: (c) ___ electrons in ''d'' orbitals
#: (d) ___ electrons in ''f'' orbitals
# According to the Aufbau rule, which of the following atoms has a sub-shell that is exactly half-filled?
#: (a) Ba
#: (b) Al
#: (c) C
#: (d) As
#: (e) O

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Berlin, James A. &quot;Aristotle's Rhetoric in Context: Interpreting Historically.&quot; A Rhetoric of Doing: Essays on Written Discourse in Honor of James L. Kinneavy. Eds. Stephen P. Witte, Neil Nakadate and Roger D. Cherry. Carbondale, IL: Southern Illinois UP, 1992. 55-65==

In order to explain why there are so many differing, even contradictory, readings of Aristotle’s Rhetoric, Berlin attempts to historically locate Rhetoric and to provide it with a more accurate context in which it was created. Berlin’s aim is not to contest the importance of Rhetoric, but instead to offer up Aristotle’s contemporary sociopolitical context as an explanation for its divergent modern interpretations.

Basically Berlin makes the argument that so many different perspectives are able to make a claim on Rhetoric as a source document because it represents Aristotle’s own “attempts to address the political conflicts of his own divided age” (55). As far as historical context (the title for the second section of the article), Berlin offers a portrait of Athens in the 4th Century as a nation-state in the midst of “continuous turbulence” (57) dominated by social inequity, numerous military defeats, multiple attempted oligarchian revolts, and finally the conquering of Athens by the Macedonians. These intense social conflicts were almost exclusively fought out in the assembly, “unquestionably the centers of political power” in Athens where “rhetorical accomplishment the first requirement for success” (57).

Writing to these conditions of social conflict, Berlin sees Rhetoric as Aristotle’s attempt to walk a middle ground between his own elitist tendencies and a more open democratic vision embraced by the disenfranchised majority.  Of course, Berlin is quick to acknowledge that this effort is largely a failure and that, ““This mediation, however, is not achieved, so that Aristotle remains committed to an elitist politics while offering enough contradictory concessions to the democratic polis to give support to those who later appropriate him in the service of an egalitarian rhetoric” (56). As proof Berlin offers an examination of the relationship between the definitions of rhetoric and the supporting “proofs” where rhetoric’s definition (“invention – discovering – is made the center of rhetoric” [Berlin 60]) represents Aristotle’s privileging of the elite and educated classes while the “proofs” on ethos and pathos represent a sort of appeasement (or pandering to) towards the lower classes. Aristotle’s seemingly constant flip-flopping between the importance of logic or ethos/pathos is thus seen as “Aristotle’s attempt to address the class conflicts of his time, conflicts that represent important ideological differences” (62).

Because of Aristotle’s own contemporary “bi-polar” historical context, it should be expected (Berlin supposes) that Rhetoric should be utilized in such a “bi-polar” fashion today.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In this chapter, you will get some codes that you can use to make your program user-friendly. We see many programs daily. Can we make such programs using the 16 bit DOS environment? No, we cannot. But we can try to go as near to it as possible. With that in mind, there are certain functions that have been provided below that you may like to include in your program.

==Boxes==

In the programs we encounter everyday, we see that the output is in selected parts of the screen and not from the extreme left corner as in the programs we have seen so far. So how to construct such a box in DOS? Here is the code to do so:

===Double line box===

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
void drawbox(int boxa,int boxb,int boxc,int boxd)
{
	int i,j;
	char s=205,c=201,q=186,d=187,e=200,f=188;
	gotoxy(boxa,boxb);
	cout&lt;&lt;c;
	gotoxy(boxa,boxd-1);
	cout&lt;&lt;e;
	gotoxy(boxc-1,boxb);
	cout&lt;&lt;d;
	gotoxy(boxc-1,boxd-1);
	cout&lt;&lt;f;
	for(i=boxa+1;i&lt;boxc-1;i++)
	{
		for(j=boxb;j&lt;boxd;j++)
		{
			gotoxy(i,j);
			cout&lt;&lt;s;
		}
	}
	for(i=boxa;i&lt;boxc;i++)
	{
		for(j=boxb+1;j&lt;boxd-1;j++)
		{
			gotoxy(i,j);
			cout&lt;&lt;q;
		}
	}
	for(i=boxa+1;i&lt;boxc-1;i++)
	{
		for(j=boxb+1;j&lt;boxd-1;j++)
		{
			gotoxy(i,j);
			cout&lt;&lt;&quot; &quot;;
		}
	}
	gotoxy(boxa+1,boxb+1);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

The coordinates passed to this function are the x and y coordinates of the top-left and the bottom-right corner of the box that we want to print. Then special characters for each corner are printed on the specified points on the screen. Then the horizontal and vertical lines are printed using the for loops. The space within them is then cleared using for loops and printing the ' ' character on the coordinates.You can try experimenting with the values that are passed on to drawbox() and see the result.The function call of this function can be like:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
        drawbox(7,2,37,24);
	drawbox(45,2,75,24);
&lt;/source&gt;
These two calls will create two boxes on the screen. Even if you are not able to go into the depth of this function, you can use it with ease by pasting the code before the &lt;i&gt;main()&lt;/i&gt; function.

Usage:  {{nowrap|{{tlx|{{PAGENAME}}|Prevpage|Nextpage}}}} produces a horizontal bar with links to {{nowrap|ConTeXt/Prevpage}} and {{nowrap|ConTeXt/Nextpage}}, that looks like this:

{{{{PAGENAME}}|Prevpage|Nextpage}}

Either parameter can be empty, in which case that element is omitted from the bar (so that this template can be used on the first and last sections of the book).  {{nowrap|{{tlx|{{PAGENAME}}||Nextpage}}}} would look like

{{{{PAGENAME}}||Nextpage}}

while {{nowrap|{{tlx|{{PAGENAME}}|Prevpage}}}} would look like

{{{{PAGENAME}}|Prevpage}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">==The Basics==

ConTeXt is a lot simpler than LaTeX especially when you want to achieve custom look for your documents. The examples from now on expect you to use a text editor which is UTF-8 compatible. Start by entering the following into your favourite text editor:

  &lt;code&gt;\starttext
  \ConTeXt is so easy!
  \stoptext&lt;/code&gt;

And compile it by typing:

  &lt;code&gt;context yourfile.tex&lt;/code&gt;

As you can see, no document class or anything need to be defined to produce valid ConTeXt output. By default, ConTeXt produces PDF output. Now, let's try something more complicated:

  &lt;code&gt;\mainlanguage[fi]
  \starttext
  \completecontent
  \part{Something}
  Lorem ipsum
  \chapter{Something else}
  Dolor sit amet
  \stoptext&lt;/code&gt;

Now we've set the language to Finnish both on hyphenation and the auto generated element names (such as Table of Contents). We've also defined a part and a chapter, and generated a ToC with the &lt;tt&gt;\completecontent&lt;tt&gt; command.

&lt;noinclude&gt;{{ConTeXt/Bottom||}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Linearization in order to do linear regression is a poor (and antiquated) approach to data interpretation.  Relative errors are distorted in ways that can give very bad fits to the equation in the pre-linearized form.  The most extreme example is when the inverse is taken, as is often recommended with &quot;hyperbolic&quot; forms such as Michaelis-Menten.  Students should be advised, at least, to plot the model equations vs. data in their original form and axes, to check for this.  Better still is to learn non-linear regression, which is simple to do on any spreadsheet with Solver capability.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Many origami books begin with a description of basic origami techniques which are used to construct the models.  The folds are normally described using the Yoshizawa-Randlett diagramming system.  There are two main types of origami symbol, lines and arrows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Origami from Anglefish to Zen |author=Peter Engel |publisher=Dover |isbn=978-0486-28138-4 |year=1989 |page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The arrows show how the paper is bent or moved. Lines show various types of edges:
* A thick line for the edge of the paper
* A dashed line for a valley fold
* A dashed and dotted line for mountain folds (there may be one or two dots per dash depending on the author)
* A thin line for a previous fold
* A dotted line for a previous fold that's hidden, or sometimes a fold that's not yet made.

There are some symbols that have been used by some authors but are not accepted into the Yoshizawa-Randlett system.  Robert Lang has introduced a “view from here” symbol that looks like an eye which has proven to be very useful, especially with his signature three-dimensional models.

Several different methods have been introduced to point out to the folder to pay attention to a certain spot; these range from a letter or number to a circle, dot, or other geometric symbol.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Variation of Conditions (incl. Undertaking)==
This is an example variation of conditions to permit an accused to be in contact with an alleged victim.

The alleged victim should be put on the stand by defence counsel and the following should be covered:
* biographical information of V (age, employment, education, etc.)
* relationship with accused
* whether V knows about the charges against D
* whether V knows about the conditions on D
* whether V knows ''why'' the conditions exist
* whether V wants the terms to change
* whether V is voluntarily testifying and no one is pressuring them
* whether V fears D
* whether V is aware that the police can be of assistance

      <comment>/* How does it work? */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Who invented it?==
The first transistor was invented by a person called Julius Edgar Lilienfield, but he didn't build one or write any papers on it, so everybody ignored it. The transistor as we know it today was invented by two scientists, called William Shockley and John Bardeen. The transistor was named by John Pierce, who joined the words transfer and varistor.

==How does it get power?==
The transistor gets power from electricity, which it gets through its 'legs'.

==How does it work?==
The very first transistor used a crystal made of Germanium, a metal-like substance.
The Germanium crystal usually stops power from going through it, however an interesting property was found if it had three 'legs'. These three legs are called the 'gate' (or 'base'), the 'source' (or 'collector') and the 'drain' (or 'emitter').
When electricity is sent through the gate, it lets electricity flow between the source and the drain. This happens because the gate can 'inject' some electrons into the Germanium, allowing electricity to go through it.

Modern transistors use silicon. Silicon works better than Germanium crystals, but it has to be very pure to work at all. Any semiconductor (a substance which can be 'injected' with electrons, like Germanium or Silicon) will work, but Silicon is the best one we can use.

==How dangerous is it?==
Because transistors don't need much power, a single one cannot electrocute you much.

==What does it do?==
Transistors are very useful. They can be used as switches, or a lot of them can be linked together to make a microchip, which controls your computer.

==How has it changed the world?==
Transistors have changed the world a lot. Without transistors, we wouldn't have small computers (only giant computers, the size of a room), and you wouldn't be able to read this. Computers control almost everything today, and we owe all that to the transistor.

==What idea(s) and/or inventions had to be developed before it could be created==
Before transistors were invented, Surface Physics, which explains why transistors work, had to be discovered. Germanium crystals and electricity also had to be invented.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In statistics, the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient (sometimes referred to as the PPMCC or PCCs, and typically denoted by r) is a measure of the correlation (linear dependence) between two variables X and Y, giving a value between +1 and −1 inclusive. It is widely used in the sciences as a measure of the strength of linear dependence between two variables. It was developed by Karl Pearson from a similar but slightly different idea introduced by Francis Galton in the 1880s. The correlation coefficient is sometimes called &quot;Pearson's r.&quot;

Pearson's is the sum of each observation minus its mean squared over the product of the standard deviation of each variable.

It's pretty easy to say &quot;electrons will fill the lowest available energy orbital&quot;. Figuring out what that lowest available energy orbital is, though, can be quite a challenge. In this lesson, we're going to try to decide ''exactly which'' orbitals get filled, and when. Most people who are just beginning to learn about quantum chemistry tend to find orbital filling problems very confusing, so we'll take it slowly, and show you how diagrams and rules can help you to remember the ways in which different orbitals are organized and filled.

==Lesson Objectives==
* Figure out how many electrons can exist at any given sublevel.
* Figure out how many different sublevels can exist at any given energy level.
* Be able to write electron configuration of any element given the total number of electrons in that element.
* Be able to write either orbital representations or electron configuration codes.

==Electron Configurations==
How do electrons fill the different energy levels, energy sublevels, and orbitals? To understand that question, it helps a lot to look at a diagram. Figure 7.3 shows the first three energy levels (marked by the large differently colored blocks), and the sublevels (separated by dotted lines) that are present in any atom. In Figure 7.3, each of the circles represents an orbital and, of course, each can hold a total of two electrons. Notice the red ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 block contains only an ''s'' orbital. That orbital will hold the first two electrons in the atom. Once the red ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 block is entirely filled, electrons will start filling the orange ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2 block. In the orange ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2 block, there are four different orbitals. The first orbital is an s orbital and the other three are ''p'' orbitals. Once all four orbitals in the orange ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2 block have been filled, electrons will start filling the yellow ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3 block. In the yellow ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3 block, there are nine different orbitals. The first orbital is an s orbital, the next three are ''p'' orbitals, and the last five are ''d'' orbitals. When filling the ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3 block, the ''s'' sublevel will always be filled first, since it is lowest in energy. Again, it can hold at most 2 electrons. After that, the next six will fill the three ''p'' orbitals.

[[File:First three atomic energy levels.svg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 7.3''': These are the first three energy levels with their sub-levels.]]

So far we've talked about filling the orbitals in Figure 7.3 up to the 3''p'' orbitals. That's a total of 18 electrons. The first 18 electrons are &quot;nice and easy&quot;, because they fill the orbitals in order. First, all of the ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 orbitals get filled, then all of the ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2 orbitals get filled, then the ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3 orbitals get filled. From the 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; electron on, though, things get a little crazy! Before we move on to the that region beyond 18 electrons, let's take a brief look at a shorthand notation that scientists use to signify the electron orbital filling of a given atom.

Since orbitals are filled in order of increasing ''n'' and, within each energy level, in order of increasing ''ℓ'', scientists can use a short hand, known as the '''electron configuration''' code, to represent filled orbitals. To write the electron configuration code for an atom, you write the symbol for the type of orbital present at a particular sublevel (1''s'', 2''s'', 2''p'', etc.) followed by a superscript to indicate how many electrons are actually in that sublevel in the atom you are describing. Let's take a look at a few examples.
{{High School Chemistry/Example|Example 1}}
Nitrogen has 7 electrons. Write the electron configuration for nitrogen.
----
'''Solution''':

Take a close look at Figure 7.3, and use it to figure out how many electrons go into each sublevel, and also the order in which the different sublevels get filled.

1. Begin by filling up the 1''s'' sublevel. This gives 1''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Now all of the orbitals in the red ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 block are filled.
:Since we used 2 electrons, there are 7 − 2 = 5 electrons left

2. Next, fill the 2''s'' sublevel. This gives 1''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Now all of the orbitals in the ''s'' sublevel of the orange ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2 block are filled.
:Since we used another 2 electrons, there are 5 − 2 = 3 electrons left

3. Notice that we haven't filled the entire ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2 block yet… there are still the ''p'' orbitals!
:The final 3 electrons go into the 2''p'' sublevel. This gives 1''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2''p''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;

The overall electron configuration is: 1''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2''p''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.

==Overlapping Energy Levels==
If you had to guess, which orbital do you think would be filled after the 3''p'' orbitals? Most likely you'd guess that the 3''d'' orbitals would come next – and that guess makes a lot of sense. Unfortunately, that guess is also wrong! It turns out that the '''4''s'' orbitals are filled ''before'' the 3''d'' orbitals''', even though the 4''s'' orbitals have ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4 and the 3''d'' orbitals only have ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3.

How is that possible? Does it mean that electrons go into higher energy orbitals before completely filling the lower energy orbitals? Is there something wrong with those electrons? Are certain electrons prevented from entering low energy orbitals? What's going on?

It turns out that there's nothing wrong with those 4''s'' electrons at all. They're still behaving like normal electrons and they’re still going into the lowest energy orbital available. The only difference is that '''the 4''s'' orbital is ''lower in energy'' than the 3''d'' orbitals'''. Sometimes, we get tricked into thinking that the principal quantum number determines which orbitals will get filled first. When it comes to the order in which orbitals are filled, though, the principal quantum number isn't the only factor – what also matters is the energy of the orbital. Usually orbitals with lower principal quantum numbers have lower energies, but that isn't the case when you compare the energies of the 3''d'' orbitals and the energies of the 4''s'' orbitals. In this case, the 4''s'' orbitals are lower in energy than the 3''d'' orbitals ''even though'' they have higher principal quantum numbers. Figure 7.4 shows a modified version of Figure 7.3, which shows the ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4 orbital positions. Let's take a look at an example of an atom where some ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4 orbitals are filled.

[[File:Atomic orbital energy levels.svg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 7.4''': Notice that the ''s'' orbital from the next higher energy level has slightly lower energy than the ''d'' orbitals in the lower energy level.]]
{{High School Chemistry/Example|Example 2}}
Potassium has 19 electrons. Write the electron configuration code for potassium.
----
'''Solution''':

This time, take a close look at Figure 7.4.

1. Begin by filling up the 1''s'' sublevel. This gives 1''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Now the ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 level is filled.
:Since we used 2 electrons, there are 19 − 2 = 17 electrons left

2. Next, fill the 2''s'' sublevel. This gives 1''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
:Since we used another 2 electrons, there are 17 − 2 = 15 electrons left

3. Next, fill the 2''p'' sublevel. This gives 1''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2''p''&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;. Now the ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2 level is filled.
:Since we used another 6 electrons, there are 15 − 6 = 9 electrons left

4. Next, fill the 3''s'' sublevel. This gives 1''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2''p''&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;3''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
:Since we used another 2 electrons, there are 9 − 2 = 7 electrons left

5. Next, fill the 3''p'' sublevel. This gives 1''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2''p''&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;3''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;3''p''&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;
:Since we used another 6 electrons, there are 7 − 6 = 1 electron left

'''Here's where we have to be careful – right after 3''p''&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;!!'''
:'''Remember, 4''s'' comes before 3''d''!'''

6. The final electron goes into the 4''s'' sublevel. This gives 1''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2''p''&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;3''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;3''p''&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;4''s''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

The overall electron configuration code is: 1''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2''p''&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;3''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;3''p''&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;4''s''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.
{{Robox/Close}}

==The Diagonal Rule==
Unfortunately,4''s'' orbitals aren't the only ones that get filled earlier than you'd expect based on their principal quantum number. The same turns out to be true of the 5''s'' orbitals as well. Even though 5''s'' orbitals have a higher principal quantum number than 4''d'' orbitals, (''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;5 compared to ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4), they're actually ''lower'' in energy. As a result, 5''s'' orbitals are always filled ''before'' 4''d'' orbitals. Similarly, 6''s'' orbitals are lower in energy than 5''d'' orbitals, so 6''s'' orbitals are always filled first. The story gets even stranger when you consider ''f'' orbitals. 5''s'', 5''p'', ''and'' 6''s'' orbitals are ''all'' lower than 4''f'' orbitals. In other words, before you can get an electron into a 4''f'' orbital, you must first fill up the 5''s'' orbitals, ''and'' the 5''p'' orbitals, ''and'' the 6''s'' orbitals!

Filling up orbitals and writing electron configurations was so easy for atoms with less than 18 electrons! But for atoms with more than 18 electrons, it seems hopeless to memorize all of the different rules. How will you ever get straight whether the 5''s'' orbital is higher or lower than the 4''d'' orbital or the 4''f'' orbital? Thankfully, there's a simple rule known as the '''diagonal rule'''. The diagonal rule states that: Electrons fill orbitals in order of increasing &quot;'''quantum number sum'''&quot; (''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''ℓ''). When two orbitals share the same quantum number sum, they will be filled in order of increasing ''n''.

Luckily, the diagonal rule also has a diagram that's easy to remember, and that allows you to easily figure out the order in which electron orbitals are filled. The below figure shows the diagram. In order to use it, you must follow the arrows from tail-to-tip, starting with the first arrow in the upper left-hand corner, and working your way down through the arrows to the lower right-hand corner of the diagram. To see how this works, let's take a look at an example.

[[File:Atomic orbital diagonal rule.svg|400px|center|Diagonal rule]]
{{High School Chemistry/Example|Example 3}}
Hafnium has 72 electrons. Write the electron configuration for hafnium.
----
'''Solution''':

We can follow the arrows in the diagram (as shown below), until we have assigned all 72 electrons. Notice how you fill orbitals as you progress along the arrows, starting from the top arrow and moving down. Remember to stop once you hit 72. At that point, you have finished writing the electron configuration for Hafnium.

Now that we know how electrons are assigned to orbitals, we can start to talk about how different orbitals, and different electron configurations actually affect the chemical properties of different atoms. In other words, we can actually start to talk about chemistry! Sometimes it seems that quantum physics and quantum chemistry are very far removed from the real world chemistry that we see and use in every day life. How are orbitals important when it comes to developing new drugs to treat cancer? How are energy levels important when it comes to inventing different kinds of superconductors or plastics? How are electron standing waves important when it comes to testing for toxins in your food? All of these processes are determined by chemical properties which are, themselves, a direct result of how electrons are arranged, and interact within different atoms and molecules. Sometimes it is easy to forget about the electrons, and some of the strange quantum properties of subatomic particles. Nevertheless, we will never be able to fully understand chemistry, if we don't understand its smallest components – components like electrons, protons, neutrons and, of course, the atom.

==Lesson Summary==
* For any atom with less than 18 electrons, orbitals are filled in order of increasing ''n'' and, for any given ''n'', in order of increasing ''ℓ''.
* Electron configurations are a shorthand notation for representing the filled orbitals in a given atom. They are written using the principal quantum number, ''n'', for the energy level, the letter (''s'', ''p'', ''d'', or ''f'') for the sublevel, and a superscript for the number of electrons in that sublevel.
* For atoms with more than 18 electrons, the orbitals are filled in order of increasing ''n'' (and in order of increasing ''ℓ'' for a given ''n'') up to the 18&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; electron; however after the 18&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; electron the 4''s'' orbital are filled before the 3''d'' orbitals. This is because the 4''s'' orbital has lower energy than the 3''d'' orbital.
* The diagonal rule states that electrons fill orbitals in order of increasing &quot;quantum number sum&quot; (''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''ℓ''). When two orbitals share the same &quot;quantum number sum&quot;, they will be filled in order of increasing ''n''.

The Vulnerability Index, as used with respect to homeless issues,  is a survey and analysis methodology for &quot;identifying and prioritizing the street homeless population for housing according to the fragility of their health.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;www.endhomelessness.org/files/2061_file_Kanis_handout_vi101.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://www.health.medicbd.com/wiki/Homeless%20Vulnerability%20Index&lt;/ref&gt;It is a pragmatic methodology based on concern and inquiry into the reasons for recurring fatalities of homeless living in the outdoor urban context.  It was developed by Dr. Jim O'Connell of  Boston’s
Healthcare for the Homeless organization.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid''&lt;/ref&gt;

According to its proponents, his work succeeded in pinpointing the health problems that led to homeless persons being &quot;most at risk for dying on the street&quot;. He lists eight conditions, in medical terminology called &quot;markers&quot;. According to Common Ground, a national organization to house the homeless, 40% of the Boston mortality was attributable to those factors.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid''&lt;/ref&gt;

In its formulation as currently promulgated by Common Ground, the index includes these factors:
hospitalizations/emergency room visits in a year, age, HIV-AIDS, liver disease or kidney disease, history of frostbite, immersion foot, or hypothermia, and tri-morbidity. Tri-morbidity is co-occurring disorder (psychiatric, substance abuse) with a chronic medical condition.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nmha.org/go/co-occurring-disorders&lt;/ref&gt;

A national drive is underway by Common Ground to piggy back data collection for the VI onto the bi-annual homeless enumeration count mandated for communities participating in the Continuum of Care grant program of the US Department of Housing and Urban Development.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.commonground.org/?page_id=789&lt;/ref&gt; Its proponents contend that such demand side data will assist in placements and getting needy individuals off the street, whereas critics argue that it is intrusive and not likely to lead to increased supply of housing.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hud.gov/offices/cpd/homeless/programs/coc/&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vulnerability Index has been used outside of the north eastern United States. Cities include Charlotte, North Carolina,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.urbanministrycenter.org/resources/vulnerability-index-fact-sheet&lt;/ref&gt; Albuquerque,New Mexico,  Santa Monica, California.&lt;ref&gt;http://vulnerabilityindex.blogspot.com/&lt;/ref&gt; Los Angeles, California, Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.homelessinsb.org/articles.cfm?id=151 A Brief Preview of Registry Week]
&lt;/ref&gt; California and New Orleans, Louisiana.&lt;ref&gt;www.endhomelessness.org/files/2061_file_Kanis_handout_vi101.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;By June of 2011, it had also been deployed in various cities in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Common Ground Au Cited in Vulnerability index on English Wikipedia&lt;/ref&gt;

== Antecedent use of the concept ==


A vulnerability index for the environmental concerns was developed by the South Pacific Applied Geoscience Commission (SOPAC) with the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.health.medicbd.com/wiki/Homeless%20Vulnerability%20Index&lt;/ref&gt;. They noted that the concept of vulnerability could be applied at to various &quot;levels or issues.&quot; They specifically noted that it could be applied to &quot;a single issue... or to assess a complex entity such as a country.&quot;  In sociological research, a distinction is made between indexes and scales. The former often weights variables equally but in any case does not register patterns of data. A scale on the other hand presents a structure in which certain patterns of the variables tend to aggregate at one end of the scale and go together in ascending order. {{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vulnerabilityindex.net/Intro_vulnerability.htm&lt;/ref&gt;


=== Earliest use ===
Papers associated with Small independent developing societies research used the term &quot;vulnerability index&quot; long before its adoption by Dr. O'Connor. United Nations – DPCSD (1997). This took two forms; the term was used in combination with a qualifier. Examples are &quot;environmental vulnerability index&quot; and &quot;Economic Vulnerability Index&quot;. However, the raw term &quot;Vulnerability Index&quot; appeared in an epinonymous background paper cited by Professor Lino Briguglio&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unep.org/ourplanet/imgversn/103/17_mea2.htm&lt;/ref&gt;, University of Malta, an expert on &quot;the development of indices for measuring the economic and environmental vulnerability of small island developing states&quot;. &lt;ref&gt; Vulnerability Index (Revised Background Paper). SD-SIDS Unit. &lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Preface'''

The Internet is a many things to many people.  Some people use it for socializing, some people use it for communicating, some people use it for learning, some people use it for remotely controlling equipment, while others just use it for fun.  The Internet has served many purposes beyond its original intention of providing reliable communication infrastructure in the face of a disaster such as a nuclear attack.   Most of the users of the Internet are not technology savvy and cannot even differentiate between bits and bytes or between PCs and servers.  Yet amazingly, without knowing a thing about how it works, they use the Internet to complete their tasks efficiently and effectively.  It is our hope that by writing this book, we may shed some light on the history of the Internet in fun, intuitive, and informative ways.  

The title chosen for this book is “A Bit History of Internet”. If you can imagine how many exabytes of information are available on the Internet (one exabyte is equivalent to 1000 000 000 000 000 000 bits), you'll see that this book only covers a small fraction of the history of the Internet.  We as the users -- or citizens -- of the Internet nevertheless try our best to contribute to information about the Internet as we've come to understand it from many online and offline sources. The term &quot;collective intelligence&quot; describes a major underpinning of the Internet phenomenon; now we are using the same technique to produce this book. By writing this book we hope that current and future generations of Internet users can appreciate the Internet as it is, use it to its maximum potential, and above all leverage it for the benefit of mankind.  

Chapter 1 introduces the new concept of the Internet and how it came into existence. We cover the key players and the separation of the Internet (as we know it today) from the original ARPAnet.

Chapter 2  lays the foundation of  circuit switching vs packet switching. It describes how the limits of circuit switching were apparent to the early Internet pioneers, and how the conventional circuit switching community originally dismissed the possibility of a wide scale deployment of the new packet switching technology.

Chapter 3 introduces the Internet edges.  Unlike a dumb circuit switching node, the edge nodes are intelligent, performing most of the processing for running end users' specific tasks on the network.

Chapter 4 introduces the simple Internet core architecture that enables easy maintenance, and the Internet's highly reliable/efficient infrastructure which distributes the routing of information packets.

Chapter 5 introduces the fundamentals of networked nodes on the Internet. One of the key building blocks that form the basis of communication on the Internet is the client-server concept.  Due to the proliferation of computer power to the end node (i.e. PC), the PC can become the server while simultaneously acting as a client.  This relatively new phenomenon, covered in Chapter 6, has been made popular by Napster and other peer-to-peer (P2P) file-sharing networks, and has taken the entertainment industry by surprise since it make it easy for the users to share their music collections.  This remains an unresolved issue until today.

Chapter 7 introduces the new service model based on the Internet's global and high-speed characteristics.  Accessing remote servers across the continent is as simple as accessing local resources.  This has created a new cloud-computing industry that is championed by Amazon and Google.  The argument for the cloud proponents is that it is easier and cheaper for a larger, specialized company to host the software and data on behalf of smaller businesses, rather than each end-user setting up and maintaining their own server farm.

Chapter 8  introduces the new concept of Internet-of-Things.  With the introduction of IPv6 address it is theoretically possible for every item on Earth to be connected to the Internet. Useful ideas have come out of this, like having a multitude of Internet-connected sensors that can monitor critical information such as air or sea pollution.  Last but not least, the conclusion will provide some insights into the history of the Internet and what is awaiting us in the future, as all humans, and indeed all things, are connected to the global and universal Internet.

While these are interesting examples, they all appear to use a simplistic method of pivot selection, which results in extremely poor performance when the input is already sorted (or nearly sorted).

==What does it look, feel, taste, or smell like?==
Ununoctium doesn't exist in nature on Earth. Three atoms have been made so far by scientists in a laboratory. This isn't enough to see with the naked eye or even an optical microscope so we don't know what it looks like. What they do know is that it is very dangerous and radioactive, and that it is probably a gas at room temperature.
bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh

==How was it discovered?==
Ununoctium was discovered in 2006 by JINR and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, when they fused together californium and calcium, creating an element with an atomic number of 118 and an atomic weight of 294. Because it is so difficult to create ununoctium, the researchers had to shoot 25 million million million calcium atoms at the californium target before it was produced.

==Where did its name come from?==
Its name is only temporary and it comes from un-, meaning 'one', and oct-, meaning 'eight'. It will most likely be named after a person, for example the person who discovered it or a famous scientist from history.


&lt;div style=&quot;float:right; border:2px solid #000000; width:250px; margin-left:0.2em; padding:0.4em; background-color:#f0f0ff&quot;&gt;
'''Did You Know?'''
* Ununoctium is so unstable that due to radioactive decay half of it will have changed into a different element in less than &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;1000&lt;/sub&gt; of a second.
* Ununoctium is sometimes called ekaradon, because it is below radon in the periodic table.
&lt;/div&gt;


THIS IS A FAKE WEBSITE

==Where is it found?==
Ununoctium doesn't occur naturally. If it did, it would be extremely radioactive and so quickly decay almost as soon as it was produced. Instead, it can only be found in laboratories.

==What are its uses?==
Because ununoctium is so radioactive and extremely difficult to produce, it has no practical uses. The only use it can have is for scientists to research it and improve their theories about atoms and elements.

== What to do? ==

Hi everyone,

If I make a suggestion to merge a page and no one else replies after say, a month, what should I do?  --[[User:JamesNZ|JamesNZ]] ([[User talk:JamesNZ|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JamesNZ|contribs]]) 02:58, 27 August 2011 (UTC)

:Merge it yourself (I would suggest) as if nobody has commented it is unlikely anyone has a strong opinion. If it needs an edit history merge you should also tag it with {{tlx|now merged|destination page}} so an administrator can perform the merge. Thanks. &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 09:53, 27 August 2011 (UTC)

:Can't only admins merge pages? And what do you mean by a history merge? Thanks --[[User:JamesNZ|JamesNZ]] ([[User talk:JamesNZ|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JamesNZ|contribs]]) 06:43, 31 August 2011 (UTC)

:: The process of ''merging'' two pages has two parts:  ''content merge'', followed by ''history merge''.  Content merge is often called just &quot;merge&quot;.  History merge is often called just &quot;merge&quot;.  Hence the confusion.

:: Content merge doesn't require admin tools.  It is the more difficult operation because it requires understanding the material, and thinking about how to combine the contents of the two pages into a single page.

:: History merge is a mechanical process, in which the revision histories of both pages are sorted into a single revision history.  It can only be done by someone with admin tools.

:: Once you've done the &quot;merge&quot; (the content merge), you use template {{tl|now merged}} to request that an admin do the &quot;merge&quot; (the history merge).  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 11:42, 31 August 2011 (UTC)

::: I think I got it, thanks very much! --[[User:JamesNZ|JamesNZ]] ([[User talk:JamesNZ|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JamesNZ|contribs]]) 08:14, 1 September 2011 (UTC)
== Put image outside of text ==

Hi everyone,

I want to update Figure 1 on this page: http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Blender_3D:_Noob_to_Pro/Quickie_Material. My problem is that the picture I want to replace it with is very narrow and that means that there is a lot of whitespace between the paragraphs. I want the picture to lie outside of the text (so there won't be so much whitespace) but I don't know how to do it. Any ideas? --[[User:JamesNZ|JamesNZ]] ([[User talk:JamesNZ|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JamesNZ|contribs]]) 07:30, 31 August 2011 (UTC)

: The reason there is so much whitespace there is that at the end of that paragraph there is a call to template {{tl|clear}}, which forces everything after it to go below the picture.  If you remove the call to {{tl|clear}}, that will allow later text to go next to the picture.  (Having a section heading next to a picture does strange things to the positioning of the &lt;code&gt;[edit]&lt;/code&gt; link for the section, though.)

: (Btw, the preferred way to link to a page is with wiki markup,&amp;nbsp; {{nowrap|&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Quickie Material]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp; rather than giving a full url.  Thus &amp;mdash; {{nowrap|[[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Quickie Material]]}}.  Among other things, the wiki markup works better for anyone who's using the [[w:WP:Secure server|secure server]].)  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 12:06, 31 August 2011 (UTC)

== Boston ==

i would like to start a wikibook on Boston please. How do i do this? --[[User:Fdena|Fdena]] ([[User talk:Fdena|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Fdena|contribs]]) 18:44, 9 September 2011 (UTC)

:Hello and welcome. First I suggest you read [[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks]] to ensure you understand the scope of this project. In summary Wikibooks is for instructional textbooks and guides rather than, for example, encyclopaedic articles. This will help you define the content of structure of what you want to create and help ensure it doesn't accidentally fall outside of the scope here. Then, depending on what you are trying to create (a guide to Boston architecture? a guide to the history or geography? etc.) it might be useful to read a similar book here if there is one. Technically how to create the book is covered by the links provided on your talk page. If this doesn't provide enough help, please ask again. Enjoy. &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 18:49, 9 September 2011 (UTC)
== how to get a subject page to mention a book ==

How do I get a book into a subject page?
Is there a page on Wikibooks somewhere that describes how to get a subject page to mention a book?

In particular, how do I get the [[Subject: Electrical engineering]] page to mention the book [[Electronics Communication]]?

As far as I can tell, I've done everything suggested by [[Wikibooks:Categories]] and [[Using Wikibooks/Subjects, Categories, and Classifications]].
In particular, I added that &quot;Electrical engineering&quot; subject to the &quot;{{tl|subject}}&quot; template on the root page of the &quot;Electronics Communication&quot; book, but that only seems to add it to [[:Category: Electrical engineering]], which is not the same as [[Subject: Electrical engineering]].

I still don't see the book [[Electronics Communication]] on the list at [[Subject: Electrical engineering]].

Hello, I don't have the [[Wikibooks:REDIRECT#Edit_toolbar]] in Monobook, would it be possible to allow it by default please? [[User:JackPotte|JackPotte]] ([[User talk:JackPotte|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JackPotte|contribs]]) 17:58, 26 August 2011 (UTC)

: I think it is enabled by default. I can only think of a few reasons why you might not have it. You disabled &quot;show edit toolbar&quot; or &quot;Enable enhanced editing toolbar&quot; from your preferences, or you have JavaScript disabled. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 21:33, 26 August 2011 (UTC)

::Yes I had unticked ''[[special:preferences#preftab-3|Enable enhanced editing toolbar]]'' because it's not compatible with the older buttons I use. However, on the other wikis people with my settings have at least:
&lt;source lang=javascript&gt;
addCustomButtonWpCm('c/c8/Button_redirect.png','Redirection',&quot;#REDIRECT [[&quot;,&quot;]]&quot;,'destination page');
&lt;/source&gt;
:Also this one: [[Image:Button_references_alt.png]] which seems to be installed by Bugzilla.
:And if possible:
&lt;source lang=javascript&gt;
addCustomButtonWpCm('e/ea/Button_easy_cite.png','References',&quot;\\n==References==\\n&lt;references\\&gt;\\n&quot;,&quot;&quot;,'');

:: Wikibooks doesn't make use of redirects and the references tag as much, though both are in the enhanced toolbar by default. I have added a Gadget called &quot;[[Special:Preferences#preftab-9|Toolbox Compatibility Layer]]&quot; under &quot;Editors&quot; to allow the old interface to be used for adding buttons to the enhanced toolbar. Does that help any? I think the developers intend to move the old toolbar into an extension and possibly phase it out at some point, so we probably shouldn't do much to support the old toolbar. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 18:27, 28 August 2011 (UTC)

== Referrers ==

Hi,

I'm trying to promote the OpenGL wikibook using various ways.

We already have Henrik's stats, and that's quite nice.

I find that access to the referrers is an invaluable tool to check for backlinks, check for most common search engine keywords or phrases that pointed to our book, and possibly touch potential contributors.  Is there a way to see where wikibooks reader come from (HTTP referrer)?

Thanks! &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Beuc|Beuc]] ([[User talk:Beuc|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Beuc|contribs]]) 19:20, 20 September 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;
:Only with access to the web server's logs, and that won't happen as it's private information because it includes IP addresses.

== Is the review system mandatory? ==

I recently promoted Guus'
[[OpenGL_Programming/Scientific_OpenGL_Tutorial_03]] on the blogosphere, and I just saw that it displays a prominent &quot;This page may need to be reviewed for quality.&quot; warning - which is a potential turn-off for newcomers.

Since we currently do not use the review system in this wikibook, I wonder if this is a feature we must have, or if it is customisable.

I understand that using my account I could review all such pages and make the warning disappear, but I'd like to know nonetheless.

Cheers! [[User:Beuc|Beuc]] ([[User talk:Beuc|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Beuc|contribs]]) 22:25, 21 September 2011 (UTC)
:You could review it to remove it.
:: Yes, I explicitely wrote that I knew this :)
Keep in mind that if someone makes an edit that isn't reviewed, the bar will appear again.  We could set up a per-book CSS to hide the bar for the book.  I think we could adjust the flagged revisions configuration to not show such a bar.
:: That would be nice.  Is there a plan to do so?
Regardless, you may wish to view the [[Help:Revision_review#Edit review interface|gallery]] showcasing all the elements of the system and also how they can change based on yet another preference (besides the one where you determine whether you see the latest reviewed or latest draft). &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|discuss]]&lt;/small&gt; 00:39, 22 September 2011 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">== History ==
Comics as an art form established itself in the late 19th and early 20th century, alongside the similar forms of film and animation. The three forms share certain conventions, most noticeably the mixing of words and pictures, and all three owe parts of their conventions to the technological leaps made through the industrial revolution. Though newspapers and magazines first established and popularized comics in the late 1890s, narrative illustration has existed for many centuries.

===Early narratives in art===
[[Image:Relief Kolumna Trajana.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Sequential depictions on Trajan's Column]]
[[Image:Adam and Eve by Lucas Cranach (I).jpg|250px|thumb|In Lucas Cranach the Elder's &quot;Adam and Eve&quot; different scenes of the Biblical story are shown in the same painting: on the front, God is admonishing the couple for their sin; in the background to the right are shown the earlier scenes of Eve's creation from Adam's rib and of their being tempted to eat the forbidden fruit; on the left is the later scene of their expulsion from Paradise.]]

Early precursors of comic as they are known today include Trajan's Column and the work of William Hogarth.
Rome's Trajan's Column, dedicated in 113 AD, is an early surviving example of a narrative told through sequential pictures, while Egyptian hieroglyphs, Greek friezes, medieval tapestries such as the Bayeux Tapestry and illustrated manuscripts also combine sequential images and words to tell a story. In medieval paintings, many sequential scenes of the same story (usually a Biblical one) appear simultaneously in the same painting ''(see illustration to left)''.

However, these works did not travel to the reader; it took the invention of modern printing techniques to bring the form to a wide audience and become a mass medium.&lt;ref name=&quot;ref9&quot;&gt;Perry &amp; Aldridge, 1989. p.11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ref10&quot;&gt;McCloud, 1993. pp.11-14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ref25&quot;&gt;Sabin, 1993. pp.13-14&lt;/ref&gt;

===The 15th&amp;ndash;18th centuries and printing advances===
[[Image:The Rake's Progress 8.jpg|thumb|left|''The Rake's Progress'' final image|200px|right|Last image in William Hogarth's ''A Rake's Progress'']]

The invention of the printing press, allowing movable type, established a separation between images and words, the two requiring different methods in order to be reproduced. Early printed material concentrated on religious subjects, but through the 17th and 18th centuries they began to tackle aspects of political and social life, and also started to satirize and caricature. It was also during this period that the speech bubble was developed as a means of attributing dialogue.

William Hogarth is often identified in histories of the comics form. His work, ''A Rake's Progress'', was composed of a number of canvases, each reproduced as a print, and the eight prints together created a narrative. As printing techniques developed, due to the technological advances of the industrial revolution, magazines and newspapers were established. These publications utilized illustrations as a means of commenting on political and social issues, such illustrations becoming known as cartoons in the 1840s. Soon, artists were experimenting with establishing a sequence of images to create a narrative.

[[Image:French-Liberty-British-Slavery-Gillray.jpeg|thumb|''French Liberty. British Slavery'', James Gillray's 1792 caricature poking fun at the French Revolution, anticipates the modern comic strip in having both separate panels and characters speaking via speech balloons.]]
While surviving works of these periods such as Francis Barlow's ''A True Narrative of the Horrid Hellish Popish Plot'' (c.1682) as well as ''The Punishments of Lemuel Gulliver'' and ''A Rake's Progress'' by William Hogarth (1726), can be seen to establish a narrative over a number of images, it wasn't until the 19th century that the elements of such works began to crystallise into the comic strip.

The speech balloon also evolved during this period, from the medieval origins of the ''phylacter'', a label, usually in the form of a scroll, which identified a character either through naming them or using a short text to explain their purpose. Artists such as George Cruikshank helped codify such ''phylacters'' as ''balloons'' rather than ''scrolls'', though at this time they were still called ''labels''. They now represented narrative, but for identification purposes rather than dialogue within the work, and artists soon discarded them in favour of running dialogue underneath the panels. Speech balloons weren't reintroduced to the form until Richard F. Outcault used them for dialogue.&lt;ref name=&quot;Speech&quot;&gt;Smolderen, Thierry (Summer, 2006) &quot;Of Labels, Loops, and Bubbles: Solving the Historical Puzzle of the Speech Balloon&quot;. ''Comic Art'' 8. pp.90-112&lt;/ref&gt;

===The 19th century: a form established===
[[File:Toepffer Cryptogame 13.png|right|thumb|A page by Rodolphe Töpffer, whose work is considered influential in shaping the comics form.]] Rodolphe Töpffer, a Francophone Swiss artist, is seen as the key figure of the early part of the 19th century. Though speech balloons fell from favour during the middle 19th century, Töpffer's sequentially illustrated stories, with text compartmentalized below images, were reprinted throughout Europe and the United States. The lack of copyright laws at the time allowed these pirated editions, and translated versions created a market on both continents for similar works.&lt;ref name=&quot;ref17&quot;&gt;Beerbohm, Robert (2003) {{cite web | title=The Adventures of Obadiah Oldbuck Part III | work=The Search For Töpffer In America | url=http://scoop.diamondgalleries.com/scoop_article.asp?ai=2808&amp;si=124 | accessdate=May 30, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1843 Töpffer formalised his thoughts on the ''picture story'' in his ''Essay on Physiognomics'': &quot;To construct a picture-story does not mean you must set yourself up as a master craftsman, to draw out every potential from your material—often down to the dregs! It does not mean you just devise caricatures with a pencil naturally frivolous. Nor is it simply to dramatize a proverb or illustrate a [[w:pun|pun]]. You must actually invent some kind of play, where the parts are arranged by plan and form a satisfactory whole. You do not merely pen a joke or put a refrain in couplets. You make a book: good or bad, sober or silly, crazy or sound in sense.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ref18&quot;&gt;Translated by Weiss, E. in ''Enter: The Comics'', University of Nebraska Press, Lincoln, pp.4. (1969)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ref18a&quot;&gt;[http://www.amazon.fr/dp/2841620751 Original French, extract]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ref18b&quot;&gt;[http://www.lekti-ecriture.com/editeurs/Essai-de-physiognomonie.html Original French, extract]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1845 the satirical drawings, which regularly appeared in newspapers and magazines, gained a name: cartoons. (In art, a cartoon is a pencil or charcoal sketch to be overpainted.) The British magazine ''Punch'', launched in 1841, referred to its 'humorous pencilings' as cartoons in a satirical reference to the Parliament of the day, who were themselves organising an exhibition of cartoons or preparatory drawings, at the time. This usage became common parlance, lasting to the present day.&lt;ref name=&quot;ref21&quot;&gt;Varnum &amp; Gibbons, 2001. pp.77-78&lt;/ref&gt; Similar magazines containing cartoons in continental Europe included ''Fliegende Blätter'' and ''Le Charivari'', while in the U.S. ''Judge'' and ''Puck'' were popular.&lt;ref name=&quot;ref22&quot;&gt;{{cite news | title=Comics | work=St James Encyclopedia of pop culture (2002) | url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_g1epc/is_tov/ai_2419100313 | accessdate=May 30, 2005 | first=Ian | last=Gordon | year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1865 saw the publication of ''Max and Moritz'' by Wilhelm Busch by a German newspaper. Busch refined the conventions of sequential art, and his work was a key influence within the form, Rudolph Dirks was inspired by the strip to create ''The Katzenjammer Kids'' in 1897.&lt;ref name=&quot;ref23&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=comic strip | work=The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition. 2001 | url=http://www.bartleby.com/65/co/comicstr.html | accessdate=June 22, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:YellowKid.jpeg|thumbnail|left|150px|''Yellow Kid'', created by Richard F. Outcault.]]
It is around this time that Manhua, the Chinese form of comics, started to formalize, a process that lasted up until 1927.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wendy&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author=Wong, Wendy Siuyi | title=Hong Kong Comics: A History of Manhua | publisher=Princeton Architectural Press | year=2002 | isbn=1-56898-269-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of lithographic printing methods derived from the West was a critical step in expanding the form within China during the early 20th century. Like Europe and the United States, satirical drawings were appearing in newspapers and periodicals, initially based on works from those countries. One of the first magazines of satirical cartoons was based on the United Kingdom's ''Punch'', snappily re-branded as ''&quot;The China Punch&quot;''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wendy&quot; /&gt; The first piece drawn by a person of Chinese nationality was ''&quot;The Situation in the Far East&quot;'' from Tse Tsan-Tai, printed 1899 in Japan. By the 1920s, a market was established for palm-sized picture books like Lianhuanhua.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lent&quot;&gt;Lent, John A. [2001] (2001) Illustrating Asia: Comics, Humor Magazines, and Picture Books. University of Hawaii Press. ISBN 0824824717&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1884, ''Ally Sloper's Half Holiday'' was published, a magazine whose selling point was a strip featuring the titular character, and widely regarded as the first comic strip magazine to feature a recurring character. In 1890, two more comic magazines debuted to the British public, ''Comic Cuts'' and ''Illustrated Chips'', establishing the tradition of the British comic as an anthology periodical containing comic strips.&lt;ref name=&quot;ref25&quot;&gt;Sabin, 1993. pp.17-21&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, R.F. Outcault's work in combining speech balloons and images on ''Hogan's Alley'' and The Yellow Kid has been credited as establishing the form and conventions of the comic strip,&lt;ref name=&quot;ref27&quot;&gt;Sabin, 1993. pp.133-134&lt;/ref&gt; though academics have uncovered earlier works that combine speech bubbles and a multi image narrative. However, the popularity of Outcalt's work and the position of the strip in a newspaper retains credit as a driving force of the form.&lt;ref name=&quot;ref26&quot;&gt;Marschall, Richard (February, 1989). &quot;Oh You Kid&quot;. ''The Comics Journal'' 127, p. 72-7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Walker&quot;&gt;Walker, Brian (2004) ''the comics: Before 1945''. Harry N. Abrams, Inc. (United States). ISBN 9780810949706&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1920s and 1930s saw further booms within the industry. In China, a market was established for palm-sized picture books like Lianhuanhua,&lt;ref name=&quot;Lent&quot;/&gt; while the market for comic anthologies in Britain had turned to targeting children through juvenile humor, with ''The Dandy'' and ''The Beano'' launched. In Belgium, Hergé created the ''Tintin'' newspaper strip for a comic supplement; this was successfully collected in a bound album and created a market for further such works. The same period in the United States had seen newspaper strips expand their subject matter beyond humour, with action, adventure and mystery strips launched. The collection of such material also began, with ''The Funnies'', a reprint collection of newspaper strips, published in tabloid size in 1929.

A market for such comic books soon followed, and by 1938 publishers were printing original material in the format. It was at this point that ''Action Comics#1'' launched, with ''Superman'' as the cover feature. The popularity of the character swiftly enshrined the superhero as the defining genre of American comics. The genre lost popularity in the 1950s but re-established its domination of the form from the 1960s until the late 20th century.

In Japan, a country with a long tradition for illustration and whose writing system evolved from pictures, comics were hugely popular. Referred to as [[w:manga|manga]], the Japanese form was established after World War II by Osamu Tezuka, who expanded the page count of a work to number in the hundreds, and who developed a filmic style, heavily influenced by the Disney animations of the time. The Japanese market expanded its range to cover works in many genres, from juvenile fantasy through romance to adult fantasies. Japanese manga is typically published in large anthologies, containing several hundred pages, and the stories told have long been used as sources for adaptation into animated film. In Japan, such films are referred to as anime, and many creators work in both forms simultaneously, leading to an intrinsic linking of the two forms.

During the latter half of the 20th century comics have become a very popular item for collectors and from the 1970s American comics publishers have actively encouraged collecting and shifted a large portion of comics publishing and production to appeal directly to the collector's community.

Writing in 1972, Sir Ernst Gombrich felt Töpffer had evolved a new pictorial language, that of an abbreviated art style, which allowed the audience to fill in gaps with their imagination.&lt;ref name=&quot;ref19&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author=Gombrich, E.H. | title=Art and illusion: A study in the psychology of pictorial representation | location=London | publisher=Phaidon Press | year=1972 | isbn=0-691-01750-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern double use of the term ''comic'', as an adjective describing a genre, and a noun designating an entire medium, has been criticised as confusing and misleading. In the 1960s and 1970s, underground cartoonists used the spelling ''comix'' to distinguish their work from mainstream newspaper strips and juvenile comic books. Their work was written for an adult audience but was usually comedic, so the &quot;comic&quot; label was still appropriate.&lt;ref name=&quot;ref37&quot;&gt;Arnold, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''graphic novel'' was popularized in the late 1970s, having been coined at least two decades previous, to distance the material from this confusion.&lt;ref name=&quot;ref38&quot;&gt;''Var.'' (2003-4) {{cite web | title=The history of the term 'graphic novel' ... | work=As Archived At http://www.geocities.com/rucervine/ | url=http://www.geocities.com/rucervine/ | accessdate=June 26, 2005|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080323155517/http://www.geocities.com/rucervine/|archivedate=2008-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, comics scholarship started to blossom in the U.S.,&lt;ref name=&quot;ref39&quot;&gt;Taylor, Laurie; Martin, Cathlena; &amp; Houp, Trena (2004) {{cite web | title=Introduction | work=ImageTexT Exhibit 1 (Fall 2004) | url=http://www.english.ufl.edu/imagetext/archives/exhibit1/introduction.shtml | accessdate=June 26, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a resurgence in the popularity of comics was seen, with Alan Moore and Frank Miller producing notable superhero works and Bill Watterson's ''Calvin &amp; Hobbes'' being syndicated.

In 2005, Robert Crumb's work was exhibited in galleries both sides of the Atlantic, and ''The Guardian'' newspaper devoted its tabloid supplement to a week long exploration of his work and idioms.&lt;ref name=&quot;ref40&quot;&gt;''Var.'' (March 7–11, 2005) {{cite news | title=G2 in Crumbland | work=The Guardian Newspaper Special Report | url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/arts/crumb/0,15829,1430764,00.html | accessdate=June 26, 2005 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Although most people think of superheroes when they think of comic books, there are many other genres for collectors to enjoy. Aside from superhero, the main genres of comic books are: alternative/esoteric, manga, science fiction, fantasy, action/adventure, horror, humor, romance, children's, and adult. Superhero comics are most popular in the United States. Superhero comic books are similar to modern day mythology, with fantastical settings and characters with superhuman powers and abilities. Examples of superhero comics include Wonder Woman, X-Men, Superman, Spiderman, and Batman.

==Alternative Comic books==
Alternative/esoteric comic books are more realistic than superhero comic books, but they do not necessarily have to be real to life. Readers who want to think a bit more about what they are reading enjoy these comic books. Some are about fictional events, while others are educational or based on history. These comic books tend to receive more critical recognition and acclaim. Examples include American Splendor, Strangers in Paradise, Ghost World, and Sandman.

==Manga==
Manga comic books are Japanese. In the United States, these books are translated into English. With the popularity of these comic books, the style is often also produced in countries other than in Japan.

==Science Fiction/Fantasy==
Science fiction comic books tell futuristic stories that incorporate advanced technology and, usually, travel through space. Many superhero comic books also fall under the science fiction category because of the superpowers and weapons they include. Nonetheless, superhero comic books belong to a category of their own.

Fantasy comic books involve fantasy creatures, swords, sorcery, and mythological figures. Some of the most successful fantasy comic books are also turned into very successful fantasy novels. An example of a fantasy comic book that has had widespread success is the Conan the Barbarian series.

==Action Comic Books==
Action/adventure comic books usually involve characters that do not have special powers. Rather, they are everyday people experiencing a conflict. Most of the characters, however, are detectives or police, and the story focuses on their battles against criminals.

==Horror Comic Books==
Horror comic books feature characters such as zombies, monsters, and vampires. These comic books tend to be gruesome and often include nudity and profanity. Humor comic books also generally contain dark themes. They are not strictly funny, as a comic strip found in the Sunday newspaper would be. Humor comic books often cross over into many different genres of comic books.

==Romance/Adult Comic Books==
Romance comic books involve stories about love and relationships. Many times, these comic books also cross over to other genres. In fact, comic books that are strictly about romance are no longer very common. Children’s comic books are also not that common, as most comic books are geared towards an adult audience. Comic books that are geared toward children are generally whimsical and humorous. 

Adult comic books are considered the underground publications of the comic book genre. Nonetheless, there are numerous adult comic books to choose from. Many mainstream bookstores and even comic book shops do not carry this genre. Rather, most are downloaded from the Internet.

To change the cell formatting based on content, handle the CellFormatting event. Other methods (e.g. setting the RowDefaultCellStyle) can lose the formatting if the user clicks on a column header to sort the grid.

To link other controls to the grid, use the SelectionChanged event. The RowEnter event can give the wrong behaviour, as it only fires when the focus box enters a row. Again, sorting by clicking on a column header can cause unpredictable behaviour.

To retrieve a DataRow from a databound grid, use:&lt;BR /&gt; &lt;code&gt;DirectCast(''mydatagridview''.Rows(''i'').DataBoundItem, DataRowView).Row&lt;/code&gt;

==Introduction==

Android-hosted port is a new, progressing development. Currently a number of issues exist, they are in the process of fixing.

Android OS can be viewed as a subset of Linux, so functionality of this port is the same as of generic UNIX-hosted port.

DOWNLOAD aros sources and others [http://aros.sourceforge.net/download.php from here]

==Installation==

In order to install AROS to your Android device, do the following:
# Extract the archive.
# Inside the archive you'll see AROS directory. Copy its whole contents to the SD card (or whatever else removable media your device uses.)
# Install the supplied AROSBootstrap.apk in your device.

Please note that minimum required Android version is 2.2.

==Configuration==

Since Android OS has no command line, you can't watch debug output in real time without any external tools. However, you can redirect it to a file using bootstrap's own functionality.
In order to to this you'll need to edit AROS/boot/AROSBootstrap.conf file and add 'logfile &lt;file_pathname&gt; option to it.

In a similar manner you may pass command line options using &quot;arguments &lt;your-options&gt;&quot; option in AROSBootstrap.conf.

==Support==

Android OS currently supports i386 and ARM processors. AROS can be built for both these architectures, however currently only ARM build is in production. i386 version was not tested because
no test environment was available.

A vast majority of modern ARM devices has ARMv6 or better processor with VFP floating-point unit. This configuration is currently the minimum requirement to run AROS. However, some Android devices are available on the market, whose processors are below this requirements. Known non-working processors are:
* Qualcomm MSM7225 (ARMv6 but no VFP at all)
* VIA 8650 (ARMv5)

This is a list of test results on various hardware and Android OS versions:

Status of bugfixing:
* LG (and possibly other dual-core devices): The problem has not been confirmed on all dual-core devices. In october, 2011, a bug has been discovered in icon generation tool, used in AROS build process, which caused trashing icon tooltypes. Corrupted icons caused system-wide memory trashing, which could be a reason for this problem. Icon generator was fixed, but there were no test reports. 
* HTC Sensation: installation problem (MacOS X created accompanying dot-underscope files when the system was copied to phone's flash. The issue has been reproduced and addressed since 09.11.2011, but there is no confirmation (yet).

For '''Siegel disc''' &lt;ref&gt;[[w:Siegel disc|wikipedia : siegel disc]]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php/Siegel_disc encyclopedia of math : Siegel disc ( see discrete case )]&lt;/ref&gt;parameter c :
* should be on boundary of hyperbolic component  of Mandelbrot set ( internal radius = 1)
* internal angle should be [[Fractals/Mathematics/Numbers|irrational number]] between 0 and 1 . &lt;ref&gt;[https://sites.google.com/site/fabstellar84/fractals/irrational More Fun With Irrational Internal Angles by Faber McMullen]&lt;/ref&gt;

Because set of irrationals is uncountable&lt;ref&gt;[[w:Irrational number|wikipedia : Irrational number]]&lt;/ref&gt; so the number of Julia sets with Siegel disc is infinite.

==Center==
Center of Siegel disc is a irrationally indifferent periodic point.

Mane's theorem : 

&quot;... appart from its center, a Siegel disk cannot contain any periodic point, critical point, nor any iterated preimage of a critical or periodic point. On the other hand it can contain an iterated image of a critical point.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.math.univ-toulouse.fr/~cheritat/Exposes/Rome.pdf Siegel disks by Xavier Buff and Arnaud Ch ́ritat e Univ. Toulouse Roma, April 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;



==Center component of Julia set==
In case of c on boundary of main cardioid center component of Julia set is a component containing Siegel disc ( and its center). Critical orbit is a boundary of Siegel disc and center component. All other components are preimages of this component ( see animated image using inverse iterations ).
==Radius==

===Conformal radius===

Conformal radius &lt;ref&gt;[[w:Conformal radius|wikipedia : Conformal radius]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Siegel_disks/Quadratic_Siegel_disks scholarpedia : Quadratic Siegel disks]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inner radius===
Inner radius of Siegel Disc = 
* radius of inner circle, where inner circle with center at fixed point is the biggest circle inside Siegel Disc.
* minimal distance between center of Siel Disc and critical orbit

Code for computing internal radius :

     if (MinDistance&gt;Distance) MinDistance=Distance; /* smallest distance */
    }
  return MinDistance;

&lt;/source&gt;

===Outer radius===
Outer radius of Siegel Disc =  radius of outer circle.
 
Outer circle with center at fixed point is minimal circle containing Siegel disc.

==Siegel disk implosion==

&quot; ... an arbitrary small change of [[Fractals/Iterations_in_the_complex_plane/def_cqp#Multiplier|the multiplier]] of the Siegel point may lead to an implosion of the Siegel disk - its [[Fractals/Iterations_in_the_complex_plane/siegel#Inner_radius|inner radius]] collapses to zero &quot; &lt;ref&gt;[http://arxiv.org/abs/math.DS/0610340 Computability of Julia sets by Mark Braverman, Michael Yampolsky]&lt;/ref&gt;

=Types=

for c :
* on boundary of main cardioid are siegel discs around fixed point alfa
* on boundary of period n component are periodic Siegel discs around n-periodic points

These Siegel Discs are :
* bounded (because the Julia set is bounded)
* not smooth (differentiable) in general


==Around fixed point ==

* Julia set consist of infinitely many curves bounding open regions
* &lt;math&gt;f_c\,&lt;/math&gt; maps each region into &quot;larger&quot; one, until the region containing the fixed point is reached 
* inside component containing Siegel disc  &lt;math&gt;f_c\,&lt;/math&gt; rotates points on invariant loops around the fixed point&lt;ref&gt;Fractal Geometry
Mathematical Foundations and Applications, 2nd Edition Kenneth Falconer&lt;/ref&gt; 

so in other words : 

&quot;&lt;math&gt;K_c&lt;/math&gt; has infinitely many components. One of these contains the alpha fixed point. It is mapped to itself by &lt;math&gt;f_c&lt;/math&gt;. This is the Siegel disk.&quot; 

&quot;The Siegel disk is one component and it has infinitely many preimages. If you zoom in to z = 0 with large nmax, you shall see that there are two
components touching at z=0&quot;. ( Wolf Jung )

===Trick 1===
If point ( z0 or its forward image zn) is inside inner circle then it is interior point.

== Boundary of main cardioid == 
* examples by Jay Hill&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nahee.com/spanky/www/fractint/jayrhill/JuliaSetsOrbitsSiegelDisks.txt Jay Hill : JuliaSetsOrbitsSiegelDisks.txt]&lt;/ref&gt;
===Parametrization===
The boundary of main cardioid is described by [[Fractals/Iterations_in_the_complex_plane/Mandelbrot_set#Boundaries_of_hyperbolic_components|2 simultaneous equations]] :
* describing fixed point ( period 1 )  under f  
* describing multiplier&lt;ref&gt;[[w:Periodic_points_of_complex_quadratic_mappings#Stability_of_periodic_points_.28orbit.29_-_multiplier|multiplier in wikipedia]]&lt;/ref&gt; ( stability ) of fixed point ( it should be indifferent)

&lt;math&gt; \begin{cases}
z_1^2 + c = z_1  \\
abs(\lambda (z_1)) = 1
\end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;

where :
 
&lt;math&gt;z_1 = \left\{ z : f_c(z) = z \right\} \,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \lambda (z_1) = 2*z_1 \,&lt;/math&gt;  


First equation : 

&lt;math&gt; z_1^2 + c = z_1   &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;  c = - z_1^2 + z_1 &lt;/math&gt;

Second equation : 

&lt;math&gt; \lambda (z_1) = 1 \,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; Abs(2z_1) = 1\,&lt;/math&gt;  

&lt;math&gt; 2z_1 = e^{2*\Pi*t*i} \,&lt;/math&gt;  

&lt;math&gt; z_1 = e^{\Pi*t*i} = cos(t) + i*sin(t)\,&lt;/math&gt;

As a result one gets function describing relation between parameter c and internal angle t :

&lt;math&gt;c = c(t) = \frac\lambda2\left(1-\frac\lambda2\right)=  \frac{e^{\Pi*t*i}}{2} - \frac{e^{2*\Pi*t*i}}{4} &lt;/math&gt;
 
It is used for computing :

* c point of boundary of main cardioid
* when t is irrational number then filled Julia set has Siegel disc

One can compute boundary point c

&lt;math&gt; c = c_x + c_y*i &lt;/math&gt;

of period 1 hyperbolic component ( main cardioid) for given internal angle ( rotation number) t using this code by Wolf Jung&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mndynamics.com/indexp.html Mandel: software for real and complex dynamics by Wolf Jung]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;code lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
 t *= (2*PI); // from turns to radians
 cx = 0.5*cos(t) - 0.25*cos(2*t); 
 cy = 0.5*sin(t) - 0.25*sin(2*t); 
&lt;/code&gt;

How one can find '''limit'''  of [3,2,1000,1,...] ?

Here is explanation of  Bill Wood

&quot;I don't know if Maxima knows much about the algebra of continued
fractions, but it can be of some help hacking out the manipulation
details of a derivation.  A most useful fact is that

    [a1, a2, a3, ...] = a1 + 1/[a2, a3, ...]

provided the continued fraction converges.  If we apply that three
times by hand to [3, 2, 1000, 1, 1, ...] we obtain

    3 + 1/(2 + 1/(1000 + 1/[1, 1, ...]))

Now it is known that [1, 1, ...] converges to the Golden Ratio = (1+sqrt(5))/2.  So  now we can use Maxima as follows:

&lt;pre&gt;
 (%i20) 3+(1/(2+(1/(1000+(1/((1+sqrt(5))/2))))));
                                    1
 (%o20)                    ---------------------- + 3
                                  1
                          ------------------ + 2
                               2
                          ----------- + 1000
                          sqrt(5) + 1
 (%i21) factor(%o13);
                              7003 sqrt(5) + 7017
 (%o21)                        -------------------
                              2001 sqrt(5) + 2005
 (%i22) %o21,numer;
 (%o22)                         3.499750279196346
&lt;/pre&gt;
You set a to [0, 3, 2, 1000, 1, 1, ...], which by our useful fact must be the reciprocal of [3, 2, 1000, 1, 1, ...], and indeed the
reciprocal of 3.499750279196346 is 0.2857346725405882, which is what your float(t) evaluates to, so we seem to get consistent results.

If all of the continued fractions for the rotation numbers exhibited on the link you provided do end up repeating 1 forever then the method
I used above can be used to determine their limits as ratios of linear expressions in sqrt(5).&quot; Bill Wood

== Comment ==
I've read your edits since I'm watching this page and I would like to make a few comments. I think that focusing only on the benefits may be dangerous and could even be damaging not because of the exercise, even if I don't agree with all the observations you make especially regarding long term benefits, but facing most of today's sedentary life and lack of freedom most children have I can't object to the concept. One thing that I see lacking is the necessity to state that the children must not be obligated beyond a certain degree to conform with the training, that the training should not replace or reduce sociability and life enrichment experiences and that special attention must be given to how well the child is fed, that should be the top priority, as you know even in what we expect to see as first world countries have severe problems regarding nutrition, this allied with a training exercise may indeed cause damage.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 06:57, 23 October 2011 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">At some events, the organizers might provide a &quot;demo&quot; option.  This allows you to plug in the jumpstart drive and launch a complete, patched RAC Attack cluster much more quickly than jumpstart 6.

To activate this demo mode on your own laptop:
# Follow all labs in first chapter, {{RA/A|Hardware and Windows Preparation}}.  When you create the datastore called &quot;RAC11g&quot;, point it to the &quot;RAC11g.DEMO&quot; directory on the jumpstart disk.
# Run &quot;JUMPSTART-DEMO&quot; script from the Jumpstart Drive.  Do not change the RAC11g drive, however you can choose any disk for RAC11g-shared.

'''Current Guidelines Resistance Training in Children'''
Brief background-
Resistance Training for children has long had a reputation of being unsafe, potentially harmful and seen for mature, elite athletes only. Fears of injury and growth problems plagued it's popularity. For the purposes of this article children are defined as those that have not yet developed secondary sex characteristics, usually boys up to 13 years and girls up to 11 years. This is a period of rapid growth and preceeds the adolescence stage of life. A growing body of evidence and position stands, now support the notion that resistance training is indeed safe and beneficial for children. 

Current recommendations suggest that school-aged youth should participate daily in 60 minutes or more of moderate to vigorous physical activity that is developmentally appropriate, enjoyable, and involves a variety of activities.

Resistance training is defined as controlled, specific movements performed with resistive loads and may comprise of free weights, machine based exercises, resistance bands, medicine balls and body weight exercises. Resistance training may be performed for a variety of reasons however, the individual and their specific goals must be taken into account when designing a resistance training program.

'''Benefits of Resistance Training for Children'''

1. Increase muscle strength &amp; Endurance    2. Increase bone mass 
3. Improve body composition                4. Improve blood lipid profile
5. Increase injury resistance              6. Improve motor skills
7. Enhance mental health and wellbeing     8. Encourage lifestyle changes early
 
'''Common Resistance Training Misconceptions'''

1. Resistance training will stunt the growth of children.
Fact: Current observations indicate no evidence of a decrease in stature in children who regularly perform resistance exercise in a controlled environment. Furthermore, a growth plate fracture has not been reported in any youth resistance training study.
2: Youth resistance training is unsafe.
Fact: Risks associated with youth resistance training are not greater than other activities in which children and adolescents regularly participate. Consider the forces applied to the musculoskeletal system in a controlled progressive fashion compared to uncontrolled contact sport.
3 : The sport of weightlifting is inappropriate for children.
Fact: Current findings suggest that youth can successfully perform these lifts and benefit from participating in this sport provided that the focus remains on proper form and technique and appropriate weights are used in practice and competition 
 
'''Recommendations'''TABLE 1. General youth resistance training guidelines.
1) Provide qualified instruction and supervision. 2) Ensure the exercise environment is safe and free of hazard.
3) Start each training session with a 10 minute dynamic warm-up period. 4) Begin with relatively light loads and focus on the correct exercise technique. 5) Perform 1–3 sets of 6–15 repetitions on a variety of upper and lower-body strength exercises.      6) Focus on symmetrical muscular development and appropriate muscle balance around joints. 7) Include specific exercises that strengthen the abdominal and lower back region. 8) Sensibly progress the training program depending on needs, goals, and abilities.
9) Increase the resistance gradually (5–10%) as strength improves. 10) Cool down with less intense exercise and static stretching. 
11) Listen to individual needs and concerns throughout each session. 12) Begin resistance training 2–3 times per week on nonconsecutive days. 13) Use individualized workout logs to monitor progress. 14) Keep the program fresh and challenging by systematically varying the training program. 15) Support and encouragement from instructors and parents will help maintain interest

 &quot;The function is computing the preperiod and period (of n/d under doubling map)
 and setting the denominator to  2^preperiod*(2^period - 1) if possible.
 So 1/5 becomes 3/15 and 2/10 becomes 3/15 as well.
 The period is returned as the value of the function, 
 n and d are changed ( Arguments passed to function by reference)
 and the preperiod is returned in k.&quot; (Wolf Jung)
 Question : if result is &gt;=0 why do not use unsigneg char or unsigned int for type of result ???

=====Finding equations for periodic points =====

======Standard equations======
[[Fractals/Iterations_in_the_complex_plane/def_cqp | Equation for periodic point]] for period &lt;math&gt;p \,&lt;/math&gt; is :

&lt;math&gt; \  F_p(z,c) = 0 \,&lt;/math&gt;

so in Maxima :

 for i:1 thru 4 step 1 do disp(i,expand(Fn(i,z,c)=0));
 1
 z^2-z+c=0
 2
 z^4+2*c*z^2-z+c^2+c=0
 3
 z^8+4*c*z^6+6*c^2*z^4+2*c*z^4+4*c^3*z^2+4*c^2*z^2-z+c^4+2*c^3+c^2+c=0
 4
 z^16+8*c*z^14+28*c^2*z^12+4*c*z^12+56*c^3*z^10+24*c^2*z^10+70*c^4*z^8+60*c^3*z^8+6*c^2*z^8+2*c*z^8+56*c^5*z^6+80*c^4*z^6+
 24*c^3*z^6+8*c^2*z^6+28*c^6*z^4+60*c^5*z^4+36*c^4*z^4+16*c^3*z^4+4*c^2*z^4+8*c^7*z^2+24*c^6*z^2+24*c^5*z^2+16*c^4*z^2+
 8*c^3*z^2- z+c^8+4*c^7+6*c^6+6*c^5+5*c^4+2*c^3+c^2+c=0

Degree of standard equations is &lt;math&gt;2^p \,&lt;/math&gt;

These equations give periodic points for period p and its divisors. It is because these polynomials are product of lower period polynomials &lt;math&gt;G_p\,&lt;/math&gt;:

 for i:1 thru 4 step 1 do disp(i,factor(Fz(i,z,c)));
 1
 z^2-z+c
 2
 (z^2-z+c)*(z^2+z+c+1)
 3
 (z^2-z+c)*(z^6+z^5+3*c*z^4+z^4+2*c*z^3+z^3+3*c^2*z^2+3*c*z^2+z^2+c^2*z+2*c*z+z+c^3+2*c^2+c+1)
 4
 (z^2-z+c)*(z^2+z+c+1)(z^12+6*c*z^10+z^9+15*c^2*z^8+3*c*z^8+4*c*z^7+20*c^3*z^6+12*c^2*z^6+z^6+6*c^2*z^5+2*c*z^5+15*c^4*z^4+18*c^3*z^4+3*
 c^2*z^4+4*c*z^4+4*c^3*z^3+4*c^2*z^3+z^3+6*c^5*z^2+12*c^4*z^2+6*c^3*z^2+5*c^2*z^2+c*z^2+c^4*z+2*c^3*z+c^2*z+2*c*z+c^6+
 3*c^5+3*c^4+3*c^3+2*c^2+1)

so

&lt;math&gt; \  F_1(z,c) = z^2-z+c = G_1 \,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \  F_2(z,c) = (z^2-z+c)*(z^2+z+c+1) = G_1 * G_2\,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \  F_3(z,c) =  (z^2-z+c)*(z^6+z^5+3*c*z^4+z^4+2*c*z^3+z^3+3*c^2*z^2+3*c*z^2+z^2+c^2*z+2*c*z+z+c^3+2*c^2+c+1) = G_1 * G_3\,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \  F_4(z,c) =  G_1 * G_2 * G_4 \,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \  F_4(z,c) =  G_1 * G_5 \,&lt;/math&gt;
 
Standard equations can be reduced to equations &lt;math&gt;G_p\,&lt;/math&gt; giving periodic points for period p without its divisors.

======Reduced equations======

[[Fractals/Iterations in the complex plane/def cqp | Reduced equation]] is 

&lt;math&gt;G_p(z,c) = 0 \,&lt;/math&gt;

so in Maxima gives :

 for i:1 thru 5 step 1 do disp(i,expand(G[i,z,c]=0));
 1
 z^2-z+c=0
 2
 z^2+z+c+1=0
 3
 z^6+z^5+3*c*z^4+z^4+2*c*z^3+z^3+3*c^2*z^2+3*c*z^2+z^2+c^2*z+2*c*z+z+c^3+2*c^2+c+1=0
 4

======Fixed points ( period = 1 )======
in [[Maxima]] :

===Write problem statement===
Above all, my group was trying to pursue a solar panel project, but the designed will take a whole period of time and we are working within a time frame. Also, putting all the components together we realized that the solar energy will be too cost effective despites the various chanllenges that are involved in the project.
===Assign Task1===
Dominic Samura and Pattern in my group decided to dropped the solar energy project.  However, we are currently trying to work on a new  hovercraft project which will be less cost expensive and we are planning of finishing the project within the stipulated time frame.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Here one can find examples of relation between fractals and groups.&lt;ref&gt;[[w:Group theory|Group theory at wikipedia]]&lt;/ref&gt; 

=Introduction=

&quot;Group theory is very useful in that it finds commonalities among disparate things through the power of abstraction.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.learner.org/courses/mathilluminated/units/6/textbook/02.php mathilluminated :  Unit 6 The Beauty of Symmetry]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are important connections between the algebraic structure of self-similar groups and the dynamical properties of the polynomials .

=Definitions=

==Alphabet==

'''Alphabet''' &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; it is a finite set of symbols x :

&lt;math&gt;X = \left \{ x_1, x_2, .. , x_n \right \}&lt;/math&gt;

==Automaton==

Automaton is the basic abstract mathematical model of sequential machine. Different types of automata :
* recognition automata, 
* Turing machines
* Moore machines
* Mealy machines, 
* cellular automata
* pushdown automata

Automaton has two visual presentations: 
* a flow table, which describes the transitions to the next states and the outputs, 
* a state diagram.

==Class==
'''equivalence class''' of an element a in the set X is the subset of all elements x of the set X which are equivalent to a

:&lt;math&gt;[a]_X = \{ x \in X | x \sim a \}.&lt;/math&gt;


==Expansion==

p-adic digit a natural number between 0 and p − 1 (inclusive).

A p-adic integer is a sequence of p-adic digits :
:&lt;math&gt; .. a_i ..a_1a_0&lt;/math&gt;


n-adic expansion of number &lt;ref&gt;[[w:p-adic number|wikipedia : p-adic number]]&lt;/ref&gt;

binary integer  or dyadic integer or 2-adic integer :
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=0}^n a_i 2^i&lt;/math&gt;

where a is an element of binary alphabet X ={0,1} = {0, .. ,2-1)

==Graph ==
'''The Schreier graphs '''

'''Moore diagram of the automaton''' ( or the state diagram for a Moore machine)  it is a directed labeled graph with :
* the vertices ( nodes) identified with the states of automaton / generators of the fundamental group
* the edges (lines with arrows) show the state transition,
* labels : (input,output) are a directed pair of elements in X

==Group==

&quot;A group is a collection of objects that obey a strict set of rules when acted upon by an operation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.learner.org/courses/mathilluminated/units/6/textbook/02.php learner.org course : mathilluminated - symmetry]&lt;/ref&gt;


A''' group''' &lt;math&gt;G &lt;/math&gt; is the algebraic structure :
:&lt;math&gt;G = \{A,\perp\}&lt;/math&gt;


, where :
* &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a non-empty set
* &lt;math&gt;\perp&lt;/math&gt; denotes a binary operation  called the ''group operation'':
:&lt;math&gt;\perp:A\times{}A\rightarrow{}A,&lt;/math&gt;

which must obey the following rules (or axioms) : 
* Closure,
* Associativity
* Identity
* Inverse
* Commutativity&lt;ref&gt;[[w:Elementary group theory|Elementary group theory]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Identity''' : 
&quot; the group must have an element that serves as the Identity. The characteristic feature of the Identity is that when it is combined with any other member under the group operation, it leaves that member unchanged.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.learner.org/courses/mathilluminated/units/6/textbook/02.php learner.org course : mathilluminated - symmetry]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Inverse''' :
&quot; each member or element of the group must have an inverse. When a member is combined with its inverse under the group operation, the result is the Identity &quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.learner.org/courses/mathilluminated/units/6/textbook/02.php learner.org course : mathilluminated - symmetry]&lt;/ref&gt;
'''Closure''' :
&quot;This means that whenever two group members are combined under the group operation, the result is another member of the group&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.learner.org/courses/mathilluminated/units/6/textbook/02.php learner.org course : mathilluminated - symmetry]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Associativity''' :
&quot;if we take a list of three or more group members and combine them two at a time, it doesn’t matter which end of the list we start with&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.learner.org/courses/mathilluminated/units/6/textbook/02.php learner.org course : mathilluminated - symmetry]&lt;/ref&gt;



'''Automaton group''' = Group generated by automaton


'''FR = Functionally Recursive Group'''

'''IMG = Iterated Monodromy Group''' &lt;ref&gt;[[w:Iterated monodromy group|Iterated monodromy group at wikipedia]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.0899 Introduction to Iterated Monodromy Groups  by Sébastien Godillon]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Self-similar''' group

==Machine==

Finite State Machines&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~bh/v3-toc2.html Computer Science Logo Style Volume 3: Beyond Programming Brian Harvey]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Mealy machine&lt;ref&gt;[[w:Mealy_machine|wikipedia : Mealy_machine]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Moore machine

== Polynomial==
'''postcritically finite''' polynomial : the orbit of the critical point is finite. It is when critical point is periodic or preperiodic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arxiv.org/abs/math/9305207 Alfredo Poirier : On Post Critically Finite Polynomials Part One: Critical Portraits ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation==
'''Equivalence relation''' ~ over/on the set X  
* it is a binary relation relation on X which is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive
* it induces partition P of a set X&lt;ref&gt;[[w:Equivalence relation|wikipedia : Equivalence relation]]&lt;/ref&gt; into several disjoint subsets, called equivalence classes

==Sequence==
'''
ks = kneading sequence(s)'''

==Viewer==
'''applet viewer''' is a standalone, command line program from Sun to run Java applets. It should be available in a standard executable path of your computer.

Examples : 
* firefox 
* appletviewer &lt;ref&gt;[http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.3/docs/tooldocs/win32/appletviewer.html appletviewer]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Word==

Word w over alphabet X is any sequence of symbols from alphabet X. Word can be :

=Software=
==GAP==

GAP&lt;ref&gt;[[w:GAP_computer_algebra_system|GAP software at wikipedia]]&lt;/ref&gt; is a CAS software &lt;ref&gt;[[w:Computer_algebra_system|CAS at wikipedia]]&lt;/ref&gt;. 
To run : 
 /usr/share/gap/bin/gap.sh

If the system failed to load packages install libraries, packages and compile them ( nq, pargap, fr). Run test :
  Read( Filename( DirectoriesLibrary( &quot;tst&quot; ), &quot;testinstall.g&quot; ) );

Load package fr by Laurent Bartholdi &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uni-math.gwdg.de/laurent/FR/ FR package by Laurent Bartholdi  for GAP CAS ]&lt;/ref&gt;
 LoadPackage(&quot;fr&quot;);
Run fr test : 
 Read( Filename( DirectoriesLibrary( &quot;pkg/fr/tst&quot; ), &quot;testall.g&quot; ) );

GAP and fr package can use external programs like Mandel, ImageMagic, graphviz or rsvg-view to draw and display images. 

===Draw===

Draw&lt;ref&gt;Draw function from fr package by Laurent Bartholdi &lt;/ref&gt;  
  Draw(NucleusMachine(BasilicaGroup));
* creates graph description of the m (Mealy machine or element m ).It is converted to Postscript using the program dot from the graphviz package&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.graphviz.org graphviz - - Graph Visualization Software]&lt;/ref&gt; 
* displays image in a separate X window using the command lin program display ( from ImageMagic)   or rsvg-view&lt;ref&gt;[http://librsvg.sourceforge.net/ librsvg - free, open source SVG rendering library]&lt;/ref&gt;. This works on UNIX systems.
One can right click on image to see local menu of display program. 

If a second argument of Draw function ( filename)  is present, the graph is saved, in dot format, under that filename :
 Draw(NucleusMachine(BasilicaGroup),&quot;a.dot&quot;);
Saves output to a.dot file. Dot file is a text file describing graph in dot language. 
 digraph MealyMachine {
 a [shape=circle]
 b [shape=circle]
 c [shape=circle]
 d [shape=circle]
 e [shape=circle]

=== Machine ===

====PolynomialIMGMachine====

 PolynomialIMGMachine(d, per[, pre[, formal]])
This function creates a IMG machine that describes a topological polynomial. The polynomial is described symbolically in the language of external angles.

d is the degree of the polynomial. 

per is the list of angles

pre is the list of preangles. 

angles are rational numbers, considered modulo 1. 
Each entry in per or pre is either a rational (interpreted as an angle), or a list of angles [a1 , . . . , ai ] such that da1 = . . . = dai . 
The angles in per are angles landing at the root of a Fatou component, and the angles in pre land at the other points of Julia set.

In other words it gives angles in turns of external rays landing on root points of period n hyperbolic components of Mandelbrot set.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fraktal.republika.pl/mset_external_ray.html Parameter rays of root points of period p components of Mandelbrot set]&lt;/ref&gt; 

For complex quadratic polynomials ( degree = 2) and period 3 : 
 ExternalAnglesRelation(2,3);
 &lt;equivalence relation on Rationals &gt;

It needs one more command :

This list has 4 elements : 
* 3 pairs of period 3 angles  i/7
* 1 pair of period 2 angles i/3

===Internal Adress===

&quot;This function returns internal addresses for all periodic points of period up to n under angle doubling. These internal addresses describe the prominent hyperbolic components along the path from the landing point to the main cardioid in the Mandelbrot set.&quot; (from fr doc )

Compare it with '''angled internall adresses''' &lt;ref&gt;[http://arxiv.org/abs/math/9411238 Internal addresses in the Mandelbrot set and irreducibility of polynomials by Dierk Schleicher]&lt;/ref&gt;

Note that angle  is a fraction with denominator ( odd number ) :

It has 3 elements ( sublists). 

First element : 
 [ 1/7, 2/7, 3 ] 
describes period 3 hyberbolic component with rays 1/7 and 2/7 landing on its root c=0.64951905283833*%i-0.125,
which lays on the boundary of main cardioid with internal angle = 1/3



Second element : 
 [ 3/7, 4/7, 3, 1/3, 2/3, 2 ]
describes period 3 component with rays 3/7 and 4/7 landing on its root point. To find it one must go thru period 2 component.

Because for c in wake (3/7, 4/7) dynamic rays 3/7 and 4/7 land together at a repelling periodic point then it also describes the airplane Julia set &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibiblio.org/e-notes/MSet/Scaling.htm The Julia midgets scaling.

      <text xml:space="preserve">It is popularly imagined that Special Relativity forbids travel faster than the speed of light or the propagation of signals faster than the speed of light. However, the actual theory does not contain this assumption. The original theory, framed by Einstein in 1905, states that the speed of light in free space is constant in all inertial frames of reference so how did people in general come to believe that this implies a speed limit?  The idea of a speed limit comes from two predictions of the theory, that inertia increases towards infinite as velocity approaches light speed and that causality, the succession of cause and effect, is violated if we could signal at speeds above the speed of light.

The inertial constraint does not apply to particles without a rest mass, such as the photon, or to particles that might oscillate between massless and massive forms. The possibility that causality would be violated if signals could travel faster than the speed of light is a more interesting problem however.  The relationship between Faster than Light  signal speeds and causality will be considered and it will be shown that if a Faster than Light signal were ever discovered then either Special Relativity or Causality will be false.

==Special Relativity, faster than light signals and causality==

Prior to the twentieth century physicists believed that sending signals from one observer to another was straightforward. They believed that light was always transmitted from a transmitter to a receiver where the transmitter was earlier than the receiver (the red line in the diagram below) and that signals might be transmitted instantaneously (the blue and purple lines in the diagram). In this pre-relativistic scenario the two observers in the diagram, Bill and Bertha, have total freedom to transmit signals at any rate up to an infinite velocity. Prior to Special Relativity there was no theory for how signals might be sent backwards in time and such a possibility was discounted.

[[Image:Fasterthanlight1.png|frame|center|Signals sent at light speed and instantaneously]]

Special Relativity leads to different predictions about the behaviour of signals. In the section of this book on simultaneity it was shown that Special Relativity predicts that clocks on two relatively moving observers will go progressively out of phase with distance along a common x-axis. This effect is shown in the diagram below.

[[Image:Fasterthanlight2.png|frame|center|Observers in relative motion find that clocks go out of synchronisation with distance]]

The x' axis on the diagram is all those points that Jim considers to be NOW, events that exist at the present moment.  Jim's NOW differs from Bill's NOW. The two observers read the same time at the origin of the graph but clocks differ with distance from the origin. This means that if Jim were able to send a message instantaneously from one place to another, so that it was transmitted and received at the same time, Bill would see the signal to be spanning two different times. The signal would appear to go backwards or forwards in time. This is shown in the diagram below in which Bertha sees the signal begin at one time (point B) and end at another time (point A).

[[Image:Fasterthanlight3.png|frame|center|Instantaneous signals can travel back through time]]

Notice that if Bertha asks Jane to send an instantaneous signal to Jim then Bill, who is right next to Jim when the signal arrives, will register this signal as arriving at an earlier time than the time it was started by Bertha.  If it is possible to signal instantaneously then it is possible to transmit messages backwards through time!  This transfer of information back through time would apply to any signal that could be sent at a speed faster than the speed of light.

If signals could be sent at faster than light speed then Bertha and Bill could work together to become rich. Bertha could ask Jane and Jim to signal the result of a race or the price of a stock back to Bill then Bill could send this result back to Bertha at a time before the race. Bertha could then place a bet to win a fortune.. This sequence of events is shown in the diagram below, Bertha sees the result of the race at point B, signals this back to Bill at point A, using Jane and Jim to send the signal, then Bill signals back to Bertha how she should bet before the race begins. 

[[Image:Fasterthanlight4.png|frame|center|Instantaneous signals could be used to provide foreknowledge of events]]

This sequence of events might be held to be impossible in physics because it violates the principle of '''Causality'''.  Causes precede effects according to the principle of Causality but if faster than light signals are possible then effects could precede causes.  Notice that the violation of causality would actually be quite limited and would only apply to &quot;space-like&quot; separated events, these are events that are so recent that it would require a signal travelling faster than the speed of light to observe them now.  Even if Bill and Jim were as far away as the moon they would only be able to peek a little over a second into Bertha's future if instantaneous signals were possible (the moon is less than 2 light seconds away).

It is well known that weakly interacting, free particles which cannot be observed because they are &quot;space-like&quot; separated from observation are described by the probabilistic predictions of Quantum Theory so it would not be altogether shocking, though certainly surprising, if causality were violated in these circumstances.

It probably seems like all we've been spending a lot of time learning about protons… and neutrons… and electrons… and electrons… and more electrons… so you might be wondering – when do we actually get to study ''chemistry''? When do we get to study ''reactions''? When do we get to study ''explosions''? When do we get to study plastics, and medicines that can be made by combining different kinds of ''chemicals''? The answer is ''now''. We're finally ready to discuss the '''chemical properties''' of the simplest chemicals out there – we're finally ready to discuss the elements. Remember, you have learned that there were 118 different kinds of atoms, and that each was known as an element. And you have learned that atoms of different elements have different numbers of protons. Hydrogen has 1 proton (and 1 electron if it's neutral), helium has 2 protons (and 2 electrons, if it's neutral), and lithium has 3 protons (and 3 electrons, if it's neutral). Finally, you have seen examples of the Periodic Table. Scientists use the Periodic Table to summarize information about all of the known elements that exist in our world.

In this lesson, you will learn why the Periodic Table (as shown below) has such an unusual shape.

[[File:Tableau periodique base.svg|600px|center]]

Now, what’'s the first thing you thought when you saw the Periodic Table? If you're like most people, the first thing you thought was probably something like, &quot;Wow – that's a funny shape! Why is the Periodic Table shaped like that? Why is it lower in the middle? Why is it higher on either end? Why is there that odd-looking disconnected piece at the bottom? The Periodic ''Table'' doesn't look like a ''table'' at all!&quot; In this chapter, you'll begin to see why the Periodic Table has such a funny shape. It turns out that the shape of the Periodic Table actually helps to tell us about the chemical properties of the different elements that exist in our world. In this section, for example, you'll learn that elements in the same column of the Periodic Table have similar chemical properties. Later we'll take a look at how elements in the same row are related.

==Group 1A (IA) Elements Have One ''s'' Electron==
Remember that according to the ''Aufbau principle'' electrons are added to low energy orbitals first and then, as the low energy orbitals are filled up, electrons go into higher and higher energy orbitals. When one atom reacts with another atom in a chemical reaction, it's the high-energy electrons that are involved.

Since it's only the high-energy electrons that participate in a chemical reaction, it's only the high-energy electrons that we will concern us when we want to determine the chemical properties of a particular element. Just how &quot;high&quot; in energy does an electron need to be to participate in a chemical reaction? Well, in most chemical reactions, the only electrons involved are the electrons in the ''highest energy level''. In other words, the electrons with the highest value of ''n'' (the principal quantum number), participate in chemical reactions, while the electrons with lower values of ''n'' are called &quot;core electrons&quot;, are closer to the nucleus and, as a result, don't get involved. The electrons with the highest value of ''n'' are known as '''valence electrons'''. Core electrons are also referred as '''non-valence electrons'''. Two ''different elements'' have ''similar chemical properties'' when they have the ''same number of valence electrons'' in their outermost energy level.

Elements in the same ''column'' of the Periodic Table have similar chemical properties. So what does that mean about their valence electrons? You guessed it! Elements in the same ''column'' of the Periodic Table have the same number of valence electrons – that's ''why'' they have similar chemical properties. Let's see if this is true for some of the elements in the first column of the Periodic Table.
{{High School Chemistry/Example|Example 1 – Hydrogen}}
Write the electron configuration for hydrogen (H).
----
'''Solution''':

First, you need to find hydrogen on the Periodic Table. Take a look at the Periodic Table above. You know that hydrogen is in the first column, and if you look carefully, you'll see that hydrogen also happens to be at the top of the first column. The Periodic Table tells you that the atomic number for hydrogen is ''Z''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, thus hydrogen has 1 proton. Neutral hydrogen will also have 1 electron. You need to write the electron configuration for an atom with 1 electron.

As shown in the figure below, the diagonal rule applied to hydrogen (H).

[[File:Hydrogen diagonal rule.svg|500px]]

Therefore, we write the electron configuration for H: 1''s''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

Remember, when you write electron configurations, the number out in front always indicates the principal quantum number, ''n'', of a particular orbital, thus 1''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; has ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, while 3''s''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; has ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3. What is the ''highest'' principal quantum number that you see in hydrogen's electron configuration? It's ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, so all electrons with ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 are valence electrons. '''Hydrogen has 1 valence electron in an ''s'' orbital'''.
{{Robox/Close}}
{{High School Chemistry/Example|Example 2 – Lithium}}
Write the electron configuration for lithium (Li).
----
'''Solution''':
First, you find lithium on the Periodic Table. The Periodic Table tells you that the atomic number for lithium is ''Z''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3, thus lithium has 3 protons. Neutral lithium will also have 3 electrons. You need to write the electron configuration for an atom with 3 electrons.

As illustrated in the figure below, the diagonal rule applied to lithium (Li). Non-valence electrons: 1''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

[[File:Lithium diagonal rule.svg|500px]]

Therefore, we write the electron configuration for Li: 1''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2''s''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

What is the ''highest'' principal quantum number that you see in lithium's electron configuration?

It's ''n'' = 2, so all electrons with ''n'' = 2 are valence electrons, and all electrons with ''n''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;2 are non-valence electrons. '''Lithium has 1 valence electron in an ''s'' orbital'''.
{{Robox/Close}}
{{High School Chemistry/Example|Example 3 – Sodium}}
Write the electron configuration for sodium (Na).
----
'''Solution''':

First, you find sodium on the Periodic Table. The Periodic Table tells you that the atomic number for sodium is ''Z''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;11, thus sodium has 11 protons. Neutral sodium will also have 11 electrons. You need to write the electron configuration for an atom with 11 electrons.

As shown below, the diagonal rule applied to sodium (Na). Non-valence electrons: 1''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2''p''&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;.

[[File:Sodium diagonal rule.svg|500px]]

Therefore, we write the electron configuration for Na: 1''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2''p''&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;3''s''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

What is the ''highest'' principal quantum number that you see in sodium's electron configuration?

It's ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3, so all electrons with ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3 are valence electrons, and all electrons with ''n''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;3 are non-valence electrons. (Don't be fooled by the 2''p''&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; orbitals. Even though they are ''p'' orbitals, not ''s'' orbitals, they have ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2, so they are non-valence electrons!) '''Sodium has 1 valence electron in an ''s'' orbital'''.
{{Robox/Close}}

If you look at the last line in Example 1, Example 2, and Example 3 you should notice a pattern.

*Hydrogen has 1 valence electron in an ''s'' orbital
*Lithium has 1 valence electron in an ''s'' orbital
*Sodium has 1 valence electron in an ''s'' orbital

In fact, all elements in the first column of the Periodic Table have ''1 valence electron'' in an ''s'' orbital. Therefore, we would expect all of these elements to have similar chemical properties – and they do. (Hydrogen is special because it is the ''first'' element in the Periodic Table. As a result, hydrogen has only ''one'' proton and ''one'' electron, which give it special chemical properties. Sometimes scientists don't include hydrogen in the first column of the Periodic Table, but instead give it its own &quot;special&quot; column to reflect its special properties – we won't do that here, but you should realize that hydrogen does ''not'' have all the same chemical properties as the rest of the elements in its column.)

The elements in the first column of the Periodic Table (other than hydrogen) are known as Group 1A metals, or '''alkali metals'''. When you compare the chemical properties of these elements (lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium, cesium, and francium), what you'll notice is that they are all remarkably similar. Group 1A elements are metals, silver-colored, and soft. These elements are ''extremely'' reactive. Several of them explode if you put them in water.

As pictured below, notice how the elements lithium (Li), sodium (Na), and potassium (K) all look alike. They are all soft, silver metals. Since Li, Na, and K are all Group 1A metals, they all share similar chemical properties.

{{multiple image

| direction = horizontal

| alt2      = Sodium
| caption2  = Sodium (Na)
| image3    = Potassium.JPG
| alt3      = Potassium
| caption3  = Potassium (K)
}}

And finally, because they are so reactive, Group 1A elements are not found in their elemental form in nature – in other words, you don't find ''pure'' sodium or ''pure'' potassium in nature.

==Group 2A (IIA) Elements Have Two ''s'' Electrons==
All of the elements in the first column of the periodic table have 1 valence electron in an ''s'' sublevel. How do you think the elements in the second column of the periodic table differ? Let's find out by taking a look at a few examples.
{{High School Chemistry/Example|Example 4 – Beryllium}}
Write the electron configuration for beryllium (Be).
----
'''Solution''':

First, you find beryllium on the Periodic Table. The Periodic Table tells you that the atomic number for beryllium is ''Z''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4, thus beryllium has 4 protons. Neutral beryllium will also have 4 electrons. You need to write the electron configuration for an atom with 4 electrons.

As shown below, the diagonal rule applied to beryllium (Be). Non-valence electrons: 1''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

[[File:Beryllium diagonal rule.svg|500px]]

Therefore, we write the electron configuration for Be: 1''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

What is the ''highest'' principal quantum number that you see in beryllium’s electron configuration?

It's ''n'' = 2, so all electrons with ''n'' = 2 are valence electrons, and all electrons with ''n''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;2 are non-valence electrons. '''Beryllium has 2 valence electrons in an ''s'' orbital'''.
{{Robox/Close}}
{{High School Chemistry/Example|Example 5 – Magnesium}}
Write the electron configuration for magnesium (Mg).
----
'''Solution''':

First, you find magnesium on the Periodic Table. The Periodic Table tells you that the atomic number for magnesium is ''Z''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;12, thus magnesium has 12 protons. Neutral magnesium will also have 12 electrons. You need to write the electron configuration for an atom with 12 electrons.

Therefore, the electron configuration for Mg: 1''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2''p''&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;3''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

What is the ''highest'' principal quantum number that you see in magnesium's electron configuration?

It's ''n'' = 3, so all electrons with ''n'' = 3 are valence electrons, and all electrons with ''n''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;3 are non-valence electrons. '''Magnesium has 2 valence electrons in an ''s'' orbital'''.
{{Robox/Close}}

Notice that:

*Beryllium has 2 valence electrons in an ''s'' orbital.
*Magnesium has 2 valence electrons in an ''s'' orbital.

You can probably guess the number and type of valence electrons in an atom of calcium (Ca), strontium (Sr), barium (Ba), or radium (Ra). If you guessed 2 electrons in an ''s'' orbital, then you guessed right! All elements in the second column of the Periodic Table have 2 valence electrons in an ''s'' orbital.

The elements in the second column of the Periodic Table are known as Group 2A metals, or '''alkaline earth metals'''. As you might expect, because ''all'' Group 2A metals have ''2 valence electrons'' in an ''s'' orbital, they all share similar chemical properties. Group 2A elements are metals, silver colored, and are quite reactive though they are not nearly as reactive as the Group 1A elements.

==Group 3A (IIIA) Elements Have ''s'' and 1''p'' Electrons==
All of the elements in the first column of the Periodic Table have 1 valence electron in an ''s'' sublevel and all of the elements in the second column of the Periodic Table have 2 valence electrons in an ''s'' sublevel. Can you make any prediction about the valence electrons in the third column of the Periodic Table? Where is the third column of the Periodic Table? It turns out that there are really two different &quot;third columns&quot; in the Periodic Table. Take a close look at the figure of the Period Table (the first figure of this lesson). Can you spot the column labeled &quot;3A&quot;? Can you spot the column labeled &quot;3B&quot;? Notice that the smallest atom in the &quot;3B&quot; column has Z = 21 (Scandium, Sc), while the smallest atom in the &quot;3A&quot; column has ''Z'' = 5 (Boron, B). (You need to note that there is an alternate way to name 3A elements; they can also be referred to as group 13 since these elements are in the 13&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; column of the Periodic Table.) Therefore, it obviously makes sense to discuss the 3A column first. Let's figure out how many valence electrons atoms in the 3A column have.
{{High School Chemistry/Example|Example 6 – Boron}}
Write the electron configuration for boron (B).
----
'''Solution''':

The Periodic Table tells you that the atomic number for boron is ''Z''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;5, thus boron has 5 protons. Neutral boron will also have 5 electrons. You need to write the electron configuration for an atom with 5 electrons.

As pictured below, the diagonal rule applied to boron (B).  Non-valence electrons: 1''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

[[File:Boron diagonal rule.svg|500px]]

Therefore, the electron configuration for B: 1''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2''p''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

What is the ''highest'' principal quantum number that you see in boron's electron configuration?

It's ''n'' = 2, so all electrons with ''n'' = 2 are valence electrons, and all electrons with ''n''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;2 are non-valence electrons. Both the electron in the 2''p'' orbital and the electrons in the 2''s'' orbital are valence electrons. '''Boron has 2 valence electrons in an ''s'' orbital, and 1 valence electron in a ''p'' orbital, for a total of 3 valence electrons'''.
{{Robox/Close}}
{{High School Chemistry/Example|Example 7 – Aluminum}}
Write the electron configuration for aluminum (Al).
----
'''Solution''':

The Periodic Table tells you that the atomic number for aluminum is ''Z''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;13; thus neutral aluminum has 13 protons and 13 electrons. You need to write the electron configuration for an atom with 13 electrons.

Therefore, the electron configuration for Al: 1''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2''p''&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;3''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;3''p''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

What is the ''highest'' principal quantum number that you see in aluminum's electron configuration?

It's ''n'' = 3, so all electrons with ''n'' = 3 are valence electrons, and all electrons with ''n''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;3 are non-valence electrons. Both the electron in the 3''p'' orbital and the electrons in the 3''s'' orbital are valence electrons. '''Aluminum has 2 valence electrons in an ''s'' orbital, and 1 valence electron in a ''p'' orbital, for a total of 3 valence electrons'''.
{{Robox/Close}}

From Example 6 and Example 7, we have:

*Boron has 2 valence electrons in an ''s'' orbital and 1 valence electron in a ''p'' orbital
*Aluminum has 2 valence electrons in an ''s'' orbital and 1 valence electron in a ''p'' orbital

In fact, ''all'' elements in the 3A column of the Periodic Table have ''2 valence electrons'' in an ''s'' orbital and ''1 valence electron'' in a ''p'' orbital. That's a total of ''3 valence electrons'' for atoms in the 3A column. Again, the chemical properties of 3A elements are similar, because they have the same number and type of valence electrons.

==Group 4A-8A Continue to Add ''p'' Electrons to the Outermost Energy Level==
By now, you may have noticed a pattern relating the number of valence electrons to the column number. Group 1A elements have 1 valence electron. Group 2A elements have 2 valence electrons. Group 3A elements have 3 valence electrons. Group 4A elements have… well, we haven't looked at them yet, but what would you guess? It's pretty obvious. Group 4A elements have 4 valence electrons. Similarly, Group 5A elements have 5 valence electrons. In fact, the pattern continues all the way up to Group 8A elements, which have 8 valence electrons. Let's take a look at a few examples in order to figure out exactly what types of valence electrons are involved. First, we'll consider a Group 4A element.
{{High School Chemistry/Example|Example 8 – Carbon}}
Write the electron configuration for carbon (C).
----
'''Solution''':

The Periodic Table tells you that the atomic number for carbon is ''Z''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;6, thus neutral carbon has 6 protons and 6 electrons. You need to write the electron configuration for an atom with 6 electrons.

Illustrated below, the diagonal rule applied to carbon (C). Non-valence electrons: 1''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

[[File:Carbon diagonal rule.svg|500px]]

Therefore, the electron configuration for C: 1''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2''p''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

What is the ''highest'' principal quantum number that you see in carbon's electron configuration?

It's ''n'' = 2, so all electrons with ''n'' = 2 are valence electrons, and all electrons with ''n''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;2 are non-valence electrons. Both the electrons in the 2''p'' orbitals and the electrons in the 2''s'' orbital are valence electrons. '''Carbon has 2 valence electrons in an ''s'' orbital, and 2 valences electron in ''p'' orbitals, for a total of 4 valence electrons'''.
{{Robox/Close}}

Now let's consider a Group 5A element.
{{High School Chemistry/Example|Example 9 – Nitrogen}}
Write the electron configuration for nitrogen (N).
----
'''Solution''':

The Periodic Table tells you that the atomic number for nitrogen is ''Z''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;7, neutral nitrogen has 7 protons and 7 electrons. You need to write the electron configuration for an atom with 7 electrons.

Therefore, the electron configuration for N: 1''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2''p''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.

What is the ''highest'' principal quantum number that you see in nitrogen's electron configuration?

It's ''n'' = 2, so all electrons with ''n'' = 2 are valence electrons, and all electrons with ''n''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;2 are non-valence electrons. Both the electrons in the 2''p'' orbitals and the electrons in the 2''s'' orbital are valence electrons. '''Nitrogen has 2 valence electrons in an ''s'' orbital, and 3 valence electrons in ''p'' orbitals for a total of 5 valence electrons'''.
{{Robox/Close}}

As a final example, let's take a look at a Group 6A element (or Group 16).
{{High School Chemistry/Example|Example 10 – Oxygen}}
Write the electron configuration for oxygen (O).
----
'''Solution''':

The Periodic Table tells you that the atomic number for oxygen is ''Z''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;8; neutral oxygen has 8 protons and 8 electrons. You need to write the electron configuration for an atom with 8 electrons.

Therefore, the electron configuration for O: 1''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2''p''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;.

What is the ''highest'' principal quantum number that you see in oxygen's electron configuration?

It's ''n'' = 2, so all electrons with ''n'' = 2 are valence electrons, and all electrons with ''n''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;2 are non-valence electrons. Both the electrons in the 2''p'' orbitals and the electrons in the 2''s'' orbital are valence electrons. '''Oxygen has 2 valence electrons in an ''s'' orbital, and 4 valence electrons in ''p'' orbitals, for a total of 6 valence electrons'''.
{{Robox/Close}}

So let's summarize what we know so far:

*Group 1A elements have 1 valence electron in an ''s'' orbital
*Group 2A elements have 2 valence electrons in an ''s'' orbital
*Group 3A elements have 2 valence electrons in an ''s'' orbital and 1 valence electron in a ''p'' orbital
*Group 4A elements have 2 valence electrons in an ''s'' orbital and 2 valence electrons in ''p'' orbitals
*Group 5A elements have 2 valence electrons in an ''s'' orbital and 3 valence electrons in ''p'' orbitals
*Group 6A elements have 2 valence electrons in an ''s'' orbital and 4 valence electrons in ''p'' orbitals
*Group 7A elements have 2 valence electrons in an ''s'' orbital and 5 valence electrons in ''p'' orbitals
*Group 8A elements have 2 valence electrons in an ''s'' orbital and 6 valence electrons in ''p'' orbitals

Notice that, after column 3A, each column one step further to the right has one additional valence ''p'' electron. Group 4A elements have one more valence ''p'' electron than Group 3A elements. Similarly, Group 5A elements have one more valence ''p'' electron than Group 4A elements. But what happens when you reach Group 8A elements? Why does the Periodic Table end at column 8A? Let's think about that carefully. Group 8A elements have 6 valence electrons in ''p'' orbitals. In the last chapter, you learned that the ''maximum number'' of ''p'' electrons at any energy level is 6. Therefore, there couldn't be a &quot;9A&quot; column, because a &quot;9A&quot; column would have 7 ''p'' electrons in the valence energy level, which is ''impossible''.

The fact that Group 8A elements have completely filled valence ''s'' sublevel and ''p'' sublevel is important in terms of their chemical properties. Group 8A elements are called '''noble gases'''.  They are all gases, and they are not very reactive at all.

==Lesson Summary==
* All known elements are organized into the Periodic Table in such a way that elements in the same column have similar chemical properties.
* Only the highest energy electrons (valence electrons) are involved in chemical reactions. Therefore, it is only these high-energy electrons that are important in determining an elements chemical properties.
* Two different elements are likely to have similar chemical properties when they have the same number of valence electrons.
* Elements with the same number of valence electrons are found in the same column of the Periodic Table.
* All elements in the first column of the Periodic Table have 1 valence electron in an ''s'' orbital. These elements are known as Group 1A metals or alkali metals.
* All elements in the second column of the Periodic Table have 2 valence electrons in an ''s'' orbital. These elements are known as Group 2A metals or alkaline earth metals.
* All elements in column 3A of the Periodic Table have 2 valence electrons in an ''s'' orbital and 1 valence electron in a ''p'' orbital.
* All elements in column 4A of the Periodic Table have 2 valence electrons in an ''s'' orbital and 2 valence electrons in ''p'' orbitals… etc.
* Column 8A has 2 valence electrons in an ''s'' orbital and 6 valence in ''p'' orbitals. Since any given energy level can have at most 6 ''p'' electrons, column 8A elements have a filled ''p'' sublevel. Therefore, they are inert (non-reactive), because they are unlikely to either gain or lose electrons. Group 8A elements are called noble gases.

; alkali metals
: Group 1A metals. These are elements found in the first column of the Periodic Table, excluding hydrogen.
; alkaline earth metals
: Group 2A metals. These are elements found in the second column of the Periodic Table.
; chemical properties
: The ways in which an element reacts with another element or compound.
; noble gases
: Group 8A elements. These are elements found in the eight column of the Periodic Table. They are inert, which means that they are very non-reactive.
; non-valence electrons
: All electrons in atom which are not valence electrons. Non-valence electrons are not important in determining an element's chemical properties because they rarely get involved in chemical reactions.
; valence electrons
: The electrons in an atom with the highest value of ''n'' (the electrons in the highest energy level).

      <text xml:space="preserve">The arcball is a tool to rotate objects with the mouse naturally.

== The concept ==

[[File:OpenGL Tutorial Arcball.png|thumb|Arcball angle during a rotation]]

Imagine a virtual ball that is just behind the screen.  By clicking it with your mouse, you would pinch it, and by moving your mouse  you would make the ball spin around its center.  And the same rotation would be applied to an object in the OpenGL scene!

The diagram on the right shows the virtual ball in top view.  The black line at the bottom is the screen, and x1 and x2 are two successive mouse positions during the drag.  This is shown in 2D but the same principle applies in 3D.

The goal is to compute the α angle and the rotation axis.  This is the point where you understand that maths are really necessary as soon as you get serious with OpenGL ;)  In particular we'll need the Pythagorean theorem, the vector dot product and cross product.

We'll:
{{wikipedia|Pythagorean theorem}}
# Convert the screen coordinates (in pixels) to camera coordinates (in [-1, 1])
# Compute the vectors OP1 and OP2, the points at the surface of the ball that match our mouse click
#* x and y coordinates are directly taken from the click in camera coordinates
#* z coordinate is computed using the classical Pythagorean theorem &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle b \;=\; \sqrt{c^2 \,-\, a^2}. \,&lt;/math&gt;
#* If P1 or P2 is too far away from the sphere (&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \left|\mathbf{OP}\right| \;&gt;\; 1&lt;/math&gt;), we normalize it to get the nearest point on the surface of the ball
# We have &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} \;=\; \left\|\mathbf{a}\right\| \, \left\|\mathbf{b}\right\| \cos (\theta) &lt;/math&gt;, and the ball's size is 1 (&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \left\|\mathbf{a}\right\| \;=\; \left\|\mathbf{b}\right\| \;=\; 1&lt;/math&gt;), so we get the angle using &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \arccos\left(\mathbf{OP1}\cdot\mathbf{OP2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;.
# Get the rotation axis in 3D, we compute &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\mathbf{OP1}\times\mathbf{OP2}&lt;/math&gt;, which will give a unit perpendicular vector

== The code ==

=== Capturing mouse events ===

GLUT offers a way to get the mouse clicks and drag events:

&lt;code&gt;glutMouseFunc(onMouse)&lt;/code&gt; will call &lt;code&gt;onMouse(int button, int state, int x, int y)&lt;/code&gt; for each mouse click, where:
* button is GLUT_LEFT_BUTTON, GLUT_MIDDLE_BUTTON or GLUT_RIGHT_BUTTON
* state is GLUT_DOWN or GLUT_UP
* x and y are the screen coordinates, starting from the top-left corner (y is reversed compared to OpenGL coordinates!)

&lt;code&gt;glutMotionFunc(onMotion)&lt;/code&gt; will call &lt;code&gt;onMotion(int x, int y)&lt;/code&gt; for each mouse move when any button is pressed down, where x and y are the screen coordinates.

You also have &lt;code&gt;glutPassiveMotionFunc(...)&lt;/code&gt; which works similarly for mouse moves when no button is pressed at all.

So we add two functions to keep track of the mouse moves when the left button is pressed:
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
/* Global */
int last_mx = 0, last_my = 0, cur_mx = 0, cur_my = 0;
int arcball_on = false;
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
/* main() */
    glutMouseFunc(onMouse);
    glutMotionFunc(onMotion);
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
void onMouse(int button, int state, int x, int y) {
  if (button == GLUT_LEFT_BUTTON &amp;&amp; state == GLUT_DOWN) {
    arcball_on = true;
    last_mx = cur_mx = x;
    last_my = cur_my = y;
  } else {
    arcball_on = false;
  }
}

void onMotion(int x, int y) {
  if (arcball_on) {  // if left button is pressed
    cur_mx = x;
    cur_my = y;
  }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Compute OP1 and OP2 ===

We add a new function to compute the arcball surface point:
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
/**
 * Get a normalized vector from the center of the virtual ball O to a
 * point P on the virtual ball surface, such that P is aligned on
 * screen's (X,Y) coordinates.  If (X,Y) is too far away from the
 * sphere, return the nearest point on the virtual ball surface.
 */
glm::vec3 get_arcball_vector(int x, int y) {
  glm::vec3 P = glm::vec3(1.0*x/screen_width*2 - 1.0,
			  1.0*y/screen_height*2 - 1.0,
			  0);
  P.y = -P.y;
  float OP_squared = P.x * P.x + P.y * P.y;
  if (OP_squared &lt;= 1*1)
    P.z = sqrt(1*1 - OP_squared);  // Pythagore
  else
    P = glm::normalize(P);  // nearest point
  return P;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

We first convert the x,y screen coordinates to [-1,1] coordinates (and reverse y coordinates).
Then we use the Pythagorean theorem to check the length of the OP vector and compute the z coordinate, as explained above.

=== Compute the angle and axis ===

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
  /* onIdle() */
  if (cur_mx != last_mx || cur_my != last_my) {
    glm::vec3 va = get_arcball_vector(last_mx, last_my);
    glm::vec3 vb = get_arcball_vector( cur_mx,  cur_my);
    float angle = acos(min(1.0f, glm::dot(va, vb)));
    glm::vec3 axis_in_camera_coord = glm::cross(va, vb);
    glm::mat3 camera2object = glm::inverse(glm::mat3(transforms[MODE_CAMERA]) * glm::mat3(mesh.object2world));
    glm::vec3 axis_in_object_coord = camera2object * axis_in_camera_coord;
    mesh.object2world = glm::rotate(mesh.object2world, glm::degrees(angle), axis_in_object_coord);
    last_mx = cur_mx;
    last_my = cur_my;
  }
&lt;/source&gt;

Once we have OP1 and OP2 (here named &lt;code&gt;va&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;vb&lt;/code&gt;), we can compute the angle with &lt;code&gt;acos(dot(va,vb))&lt;/code&gt;.

Since we're using &lt;code&gt;float&lt;/code&gt; variables, there may be precision issues: &lt;code&gt;dot&lt;/code&gt; may return a value slightly greater than 1, and &lt;code&gt;acos&lt;/code&gt; will return &lt;code&gt;nan&lt;/code&gt;, which means an invalid float.  The consequence is that our rotation matrix will be all messed, and usually our object will just disappear from the screen!  To remedy this, we cap the value with a maximum of &lt;code&gt;1.0&lt;/code&gt;.

An extra trick is converting the rotation axis from camera coordinates to object coordinates.  It's useful when the camera and object are placed differently.  For instace, if you rotate the object by 90° on the Y axis (&quot;turn its head&quot; to the right), then perform a vertical move with your mouse, you make a rotation on the camera X axis, but it should become a rotation on the Z axis (plane barrel roll) for the object.  By converting the axis in object coordinates, the rotation will respect that the user work in camera coordinates (WYSIWYG).  To transform from camera to object coordinates, we take the inverse of the MV matrix (from the MVP matrix triplet).

And last we can apply our transformation using &lt;code&gt;glm::rotate&lt;/code&gt; as usual :)

== Exercises ==

* Is the rotation angle proportional to the mouse move?  Try to make a move near the border of the virtual ball.
* The virtual ball will stop rolling when the mouse is too far away.  Other mouse controls are possible.  For instance, study how dragging with the middle button works in the Blender 3D modeler.
* Try different roll speeds, by multiplying the rotation angle.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This book is aimed at beginners who are discovering OpenGL!

It will assume knowledge of basic C and C++. (If you're rusty on these subjects, consider reading a [[Subject:C++|C++ book]] first.) If you know nothing about 3D graphics, we'll try to familiarize you along the way. In addition, certain parts of the book will require mathematics. We'll provide basic explanations as much as possible, as well as point you to the appropriate Wikipedia subject pages.

OpenGL 2 is a bit hard at the beginning, because of all the new shaders and buffer object concepts, so we took every possibly measure to start *very* basic, but functional, and add features progressively. Often, we wrote the tutorials as we learned OpenGL, so we believe we saw by ourselves where beginners needed explanations first. As a consequence, there may be better ways than what we documented, in which case feel free to contribute.

We start straight with shaders, and replace all legacy 1.x functions with 2.x replacements (we also have a section on upgrade tips). We stick to OpenGL 2.1 core profile / OpenGL ES 2, which is now widely available in mobile, desktop and web (WebGL) platforms.
We also have a section on non-gaming topics such as Scientific visualization.

Since the tutorials are pretty new, this wikibook's contributors keep improving them - if you feel some areas are still obscure, feel free to let a comment, or even contribute your own explanations :)

* First exercice: chances are that the user will get a segfault probably due to exploding the stack (especially if not under a GNU/Linux desktop), before she get to the graphic card's memory limit.  I get a segfault at N=2901, though a few values display strangely distorted graphs (N=2882, N=2883, N=2891...).
: Possibly the distorted values are due to mod(N, 4) != 0 - cf. glPixelStore(GL_UNPACK_ALIGNMENT, 1). [[User:Beuc|Beuc]] ([[User talk:Beuc|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Beuc|contribs]]) 20:38, 25 September 2011 (UTC)

* In the vertex shader, maybe we could change the projection matrix so that
 graph_coord.z = texture2D(mytexture, graph_coord.xy / 2.0 + 0.5).r;
could be simplified as:
 graph_coord.z = texture2D(mytexture, graph_coord.xy).r;
(and same for gl_FragColor)

* In &lt;code&gt;glm::mat4 vertex_transform = projection * view * model * glm::mat4(1.0f)&lt;/code&gt; I find that &lt;code&gt; * glm::mat4(1.0f)&lt;/code&gt; is confusing.</text>

The [http://developer.android.com/sdk/ndk/index.html Android NDK] supports GLSL for OpenGL ES 2.0 in C/C++ native code via the usual Mesa3D library libGLESv2. An [http://developer.android.com/sdk/ndk/overview.html#samples example program] is included in the Android NDK. 

You can follow the [[../GLUT|GLUT]] section on Android using the [[OpenGL_Programming/Installation/Android_NDK|GLUT wrapper]] for Android.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Android SDK?===

Does this info belong just merged with the android sdk info?

:As far as I know, the Android SDK uses Java with a Java library for OpenGL ES access while the NDK uses C/C++ with a C library for OpenGL ES access. I think that's reason enough to keep the two separate. --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Martin Kraus|contribs]]) 19:48, 25 March 2013 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Relevant Users on Wikibooks ==

Please edit this section with the '''name of the Users with whom I might be able to discuss things and work on a proposal''' that is not far from the reality. It'll be very useful, since submitting Meta content ANYWHERE on Mediawiki projects till now has not got much of a notice for me. '''This list is required for me to be proactive.'''

*[[User:QuiteUnusual|QuiteUnusual]]
*[[User:Thenub314|Thenub]][[Special:Contributions/Thenub314|314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]])

== Summary of the Original Proposal ==
* Create Roadmaps for a book
* Define Learning Outcomes
* Annotate and Discuss new content available from around the web.
* Minor tweaks and fixes which concentrate on crowdsourcing.
* Identifying Small Contribution that advance a book and designing good UIs and triggers according to B.J. Fogg's Behavior Change Model, 8 Step Design Process. The paper can be found here at [http://www.bjfogg.com/design_files/page8_1.pdf Persuasive Design : Eight Step Process by B. J. Fogg]


== Text of the original Proposal ==

This text can still be found at http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/WikiConference_India_2011/Submissions/Accelerating_WikiBooks

=== Background ===
It was a logical step to expand the collaborative process behind Wikipedia to give birth to sister projects that dealt with more complicated things than a standalone encyclopaedic article. However, the sluggish development of materials on the Sister Projects drops anvil sized hints on us that the collaborative approach needs much more tinkering and adaptation to best serve the purposes that they were built for.

=== Proposal ===
I have been toying around with certain ideas in my head and from this time to the conference, I'll be discussing them in detail with the wikibooks community for feasibility and possible adaptations. The ideas can be summarized as follows:

1. &quot;Begin With An End in Mind&quot;
Textbooks differ from A collection of encyclopaedic articles on the same topics in one very simple manner : Textbooks have a learning progression and every chapter has a few learning outcomes. The one key adaptation of Media Wiki software for Wikibooks is to support creating pages that Map Learning Outcomes, derive associated case studies, examples and anecdotes and connect learning outcomes through different chapters.

I will further analyse the processes through which this '''Map can then be translated into more actions and meaningful edits''' : using the work of Stanford's Persuasive Technology Lab and [http://www.bjfogg.com B. J. Fogg] [http://www.bjfogg.com/design_files/page8_1.pdf Persuasive Design : Eight Step Process by B. J. Fogg]

2. Build up a reference material section, separate from the Discussions Page
Internet based portals are publishing information at a faster rate then ever before. Even filtering through the best ones and adding annotations and suggestions using these select sources - including magazine articles and newspapers - can build up a large repository of material which could then be fed to the different wikimedia projects.

The proposal here has not been worded to do the idea enough justice. However, the outcomes if such a project comes to fruition are numerous!

These could be...
* Consider the current stream of articles on Governance and corruption in the Indian media. Using the best of these news items as sources of ideas for different projects can be a very big move for creating meaningful, more accessible textbooks on Civis, Administration; adapting already existing textbooks in a manner which is easier to create (thanks to what has been deposited in the repository).
* Comments on articles on Popular Science, or technical articles in newspapers regarding scientific inventions can trigger discussions on relevant topics, building up examples for the respective topics.

It has to be kept in mind that such a project does not involve using newspaper and media articles as a basis. It uses their content as a trigger to create more reference items, discussions and alternative projects (for let us say  Wikiversity) through annotations and debates. 

Apart from these major changes, I will be delving deeper into very minor tweaks and fixes that are all geared towards accelrating the iteration of content on larger projects like books and additional learning resources on Wikiversity.
== Discussion ==
Please use these space to ask questions and discuss the proposal. It can be thought of a Talk page instead of a Mainspace page. When the edits become large, I'll organize and split the page.

== Ideas I am tinkering with ==
=== A system for finding project mates ===
These could be for a portal, new book project or a simple proposal. Very often, we cannot find enough people to talk to about our submissions and proposals at the right time. Any mechanism through which a submission find its way to relevant people? How about using categories?

:Mediawiki has a mechanism for enabling Talkbacks. This could be useful for the spread of messages through the system. People could opt in for information on projects that are taking place. To keep the quality of the messages high, you could have layers in between, where in only those people who review new proposals get a message, and after their approval, the message passes onto other users. Somewhat like the &quot;Like a page and receive updates&quot; system of Facebook.

=== Making a google Doc spreadsheet ===
For taking opinions on very simple details that are relevant to this proposal.

=== A positive experience for a new user ===

As I said, I want to use B.J. Fogg's Persuasive Technology Design Process on Wikibooks problems. One such problem that we can address is that after a high level of motivation initially, user interest declines.

You can read up his material on how exactly Facebook involves all of its new users directly into the process, thereby promoting new users to become active users, achieving the goals of being making FB a habit as well as increasing the Network Effect.</text>

Could one of the CU's please check the IP who continues to create accounts named ILubeMyCucumbers''NN'' where ''NN'' is a number?

:Yes, 64.184.36.191.  This was sent on the mailing list but I overlooked it. I also altered the block of the other IP used to be for all users and not anonymous only with account creation blocked, in case they're registering at another wiki and SULing over to here.  They recently blocked 50 sockpuppets at en.wiki.  So we're getting a sampling of the &quot;fun&quot; Wikipedia has long known. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|discuss]]&lt;/small&gt; 16:43, 21 September 2011 (UTC)

== Opt-out of &quot;see last reviewed version&quot; ==

Hi,

I'd like to opt-out of the &quot;see last reviewed version and not the latest draft&quot; for the MySQL wikibook. (I had asked a while ago on IRC but didn't get an answer).
:You should be able to select that for yourself.  Go to [[Special:Preferences#preftab-8|My preferences]] and select the &quot;Edit Review&quot; tab. You should find a checkbox for &quot;Always show the latest reviewed revision (if there is one) of a page by default.&quot;  --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Jomegat|contribs]]) 19:50, 20 September 2011 (UTC)
:However you cannot opt-out for just one book. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 20:56, 20 September 2011 (UTC)
:: Do you mean somebody opt'd in for this wikibook, but that I now cannot opt out?  I object! :)
:: I ask, because I wrote a significant portion of this wikibook in the past, and I don't see any more recent significant contributor who would have been entitled to opt in.
:: Or maybe I'm missing something about the way this &quot;default == last reviewed&quot; feature work? [[User:Beuc|Beuc]] ([[User talk:Beuc|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Beuc|contribs]]) 05:47, 21 September 2011 (UTC)
::: What I means is if you follow the steps Jomegat gave, you will see the latest draft for every book. You asked how to opt-out for one book and I thought you might want to know there is no per book option like that in user preferences. The only options in user preferences are to see the latest draft for all books or the last reviewed version for all books. A preference on a per-page level that can be changed by Administrators exists as well, but that option either shows the latest draft for all users or depends on what the user set in their preferences. Basically the question you asked is ambiguous enough to be interpreted in a number of ways. I hope I've given you enough information to answer your question or at the very least for you to be able to clarify what you are asking for. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 07:33, 21 September 2011 (UTC)
:::: OK, what I'm asking is to opt-out for all users for the MySQL wikibook. [[User:Beuc|Beuc]] ([[User talk:Beuc|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Beuc|contribs]]) 10:25, 21 September 2011 (UTC)
::::[[Wikibooks:FlaggedRevs Extension|Flagged revisions]] was reconfigured at Wikibooks.  All users are shown the latest edit to a page unless they change their preferences, regardless of reviewing status.  The only exception to this is for pages where the default was changed, which is limited to Wikijunior pages at this point.  So in summary, only Wikijunior pages show the latest reviewed version and not the latest draft. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|discuss]]&lt;/small&gt; 16:36, 21 September 2011 (UTC)
::::: People that had an account before Wikibooks was reconfigured might still have the last reviewed revision shown option enabled by default in their preferences due to how the preference system works, but for the majority of books that doesn't matter because the default for pages is to show the latest revision. There are [{{fullurl:Special:ConfiguredPages|namespace=0}} some pages] lingering around where the latest draft isn't the default outside of Wikijunior as well. MySQL might be one. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 17:05, 21 September 2011 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">KENTSEL ULAŞIM PROBLEMLERİ: MAKRO VE MİKRO YAKLAŞIM

1. GİRİŞ

Şehirleşmenin hızla büyüdüğü ülkemizde, yolları kullanan araç sayısındaki hızlı artışlar şehir merkezlerinde trafik tıkanıklığının artmasına ve mevcut trafik hacmine ve çeşidine göre tasarlanmamış yollarda trafik kazalarının artmasına neden olmuştur.
Gelişmekte olan kentlerde gelişim planları ya mevcut değil veya mevcut planlar ulaşım kriterleri hesaba katılarak yapılmış planlar değil. Aynı zamanda yapılmakta olan plan tadilatları veya mevzi uygulamaları kent merkezinde meydana getirecek trafik artışlarını öngörmemektedir. Planlanmamış kent büyümesi yüksek düzeyde araç-yaya karmaşasına neden olan uygun olmayan arazi kullanımına yol açmıştır. 
Mevcut uygulanan yol projelendirme uygulamaları, modası geçmiş veya mevcut duruma ve ihtiyaca cevap veremeyen yeni gelişmelere karşı kendini yenileyememiş uygulamalardır. Uygulamalar genellikle yayaları, motorsuz taşıtları ve motosikletleri ihmal etmiştir. Bu durumda vurgu daha çok iyileştirme çalışmaları yerine yeniden inşa üzerinde odaklanmıştır. Mühendisler örneğin; &quot;kavşak geometrisinin yol güvenliğini nasıl etkileyebilir?&quot; düşüncesi yerine daha çok geometrinin inşaat detayları üzerinde durmaktadır. Yol işaretleri ve yaya imkanları gibi önemli operasyon elemanları daha sonraya bırakılmaktadır.

Kırsal bölgelerden şehir merkezlerine kaymalar, mevcut trafik düzeyine alışık olmayan büyük sayıdaki yeni şehirli nüfusunu doğurmuştur. Buna ilaveten, asıl tehlikeyi, yetersiz yol bakım işlemleri, iyi tasarlanmamış kavşaklar ve yetersiz yaya imkanları meydana getirmiştir. Bütün bunlar, mevcut bulunan ciddi yol güvenliği sorunlarının büyümesine katkıda bulunmuştur. 
Kentsel ulaşım problemlerini makro ve mikro olarak iki ana kategoride inceleyebiliriz.</text>

In the [[../Electron Configurations of Main Group Elements/]] lesson, you learned a little bit about valence electrons. You saw how the number and type of valence electrons are important in determining the chemical properties of a particular element. Group 1A metals were highly reactive, because they have a strong tendency to lose their single valence ''s'' electrons. Group 2A metals are reactive as well, but less so, because they had 2 valence s electrons. Finally, Group 8A elements were ''inert'' (not reactive at all), because they had completely filled valences and ''p'' sublevels, meaning they could neither lose nor gain electrons very easily. Now you might be wondering why we didn't talk much about the chemical properties of the elements in columns 4A-7A. It turns out that understanding the behavior of these elements requires a bit more information. Specifically, we need to know ''how'' the electrons fill up the ''p'' orbitals. Carbon, for instance, is a Group 4A element, so it has 2 valence ''s'' electrons, and 2 valence ''p'' electrons. Obviously, the 2 valence ''s'' electrons are paired together in the s orbital, but what about the 2 valence ''p'' electrons? Are the valence ''p'' electrons paired in a single ''p'' orbital, or are they each in their own ''p'' orbital (remember, there are a total of three ''p'' orbitals that the valence ''p'' electrons could be found in). What about nitrogen? Nitrogen is a Group 5A element, so it has 2 valence ''s'' electrons, and 3 valence ''p'' electrons. Again, the 2 valence ''s'' electrons must be paired in the ''s'' orbital, but what about the 3 valence ''p'' electrons? Are two of them paired in a single ''p'' orbital, or do all three have their own ''p'' orbitals?

== Lesson Objectives ==
* Draw orbital diagrams.
* Define Hund's Rule.
* Use Hund's Rule to decide how electrons fill sublevels with more than one orbital.

== Orbital Representation ==
Before we discuss the order and manner in which the orbitals in a ''p'' sublevel are filled, we have to introduce a symbolic notation that scientists use to show orbital filling. Frequently, scientists will use boxes to represent orbitals.

The figure below shows a set of boxes for orbitals up to the ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2 energy level. The boxes are depicting electron orbitals for the ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 and ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2 energy levels. Notice that for ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, there is a single ''s'' orbital, while for ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2 there is one ''s'' orbital and three ''p'' orbitals.

:[[File:Orbital diagram empty - n=1 and n=2.svg|200px]]

When a &quot;spin-up&quot; electron is present in an orbital, scientists draw an upward pointing arrow in that orbital's box. This leads to what is known as an '''orbital diagram'''. For example, hydrogen has a single electron in the 1''s'' orbital. If that single electron were a spin-up (''m''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; = +1/2), the orbital diagram for hydrogen would be as illustrated below:

:[[File:Orbital diagram hydrogen.svg|200px]]

When a &quot;spin-down&quot; electron is present in an orbital, scientists draw a downward pointing arrow in that orbital's box. Helium, for instance, has two electrons in the 1''s'' orbital. We know that one of these electrons must be &quot;spin-up&quot; and the other must be &quot;spin-down&quot;, so the orbital diagram for helium would be as shown below:

:[[File:Orbital diagram helium.svg|200px]]

By comparing the first two orbital representation figures, it should be fairly obvious to you which electrons are paired and which are unpaired. That is one of the advantages of an orbital diagram. An orbital diagram is a clear way of showing ''exactly'' how many paired and unpaired electrons there are in a particular atom's electronic configuration.

Now you might be wondering about the unpaired electrons – how do you know whether to draw them as &quot;spin-up&quot;, or &quot;spin-down&quot;. Technically speaking, the ''first'' electron in a sublevel (1''s'', 2''s'', 2''p'', etc) could be either &quot;spin-up&quot; ''or'' &quot;spin-down&quot;. In other words, for hydrogen (1''s''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;), you could draw the arrow in the 1''s'' orbital box pointing either up or down. Similarly, for boron (1''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2''p''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;), you could draw the arrow in the 2''p'' orbital box pointing either up or down. Once you've chosen the spin of the first electron ''in a sublevel'', though, the spins of all of the other electrons in that sublevel depend on the spin you chose for the first. To avoid confusion, scientists &quot;always draw the first electron in an orbital as 'spin-up'&quot;. If you stick with this rule, you'll never get into trouble.

If you insist on breaking this rule, you might draw an orbital diagram that is incorrect, as shown in the figure below. By convention, scientists usually draw all unpaired electrons as &quot;spin-up&quot;. This prevents them from drawing incorrect orbital diagrams like the one shown in (c). In the next section, you'll learn that the orbital diagram in (c) is incorrect because it does not obey Hund's Rule.

:[[File:Hund's Rule.svg|600px]]

Notice that by drawing the first electron in each orbital as &quot;spin-up&quot;, all of the unpaired electrons in the sublevel have the same spin, even if they are in different orbitals! This is due to a principle known as Hund's Rule. We'll discuss Hund's Rule in more detail in the next section.

== Orbitals in ''p'' Sublevel Fill Individually Before Pairing ==
Previously we learned that the energy of an electron in any given orbital depends on the energy level of the orbital (which is determined by the principal quantum number, ''n'') and the sublevel of the orbital (''s'', ''p'', ''d'', etc. which is determined by the azimuthal quantum number: ''ℓ''). We also learned that according to the ''Aufbau principle'', electrons will fill the lowest energy orbitals first, and then move up to higher energy orbitals only after the lower energy orbitals are full. If you think carefully, though, you'll realize that there's still a problem. Certainly, 1''s'' orbitals should be filled before 2''s'' orbitals, because the 1''s'' orbitals have a lower value of ''n'', and thus a lower energy. Similarly, 2''s'' orbitals should be filled before 2p orbitals, because 2''s'' orbitals have a lower value of ''ℓ'' (''ℓ'' = 0), and thus a lower energy. What about the three different 2''p'' orbitals? In what order do electrons fill the 2''p'' orbitals? To answer this question, we need to turn to a principle known as Hund's Rule. '''Hund's Rule''' states that: (1) Every orbital in a sublevel is singly occupied before any orbital is doubly occupied. (2) All of the electrons in singly occupied orbitals have the same spin.

According to the first rule, electrons will always occupy an empty orbital before they pair up. This should make sense given what you know about electrons. Electrons are negatively charged and, as a result, they repel each other. Since electron-electron repulsion raises the energy of the electrons involved, electrons tend to minimize repulsion (and thus minimize their energies) by occupying their own orbital, rather than sharing an orbital with another electron. Take a look at the figure below.

:[[File:Orbital diagram carbon - Hund's Rule.svg|500px]]

Notice how the two 2''p'' electrons in the orbital diagram on the left are in separate orbitals, while the two 2''p'' electrons in the orbital diagram on the right are sharing a single orbital. The orbital diagram on the left is the correct orbital diagram, because it obeys Hund's Rule, meaning that there is less electron-electron repulsion and, as a result, the electrons have lower energies (remember, electrons ''always'' minimize their energies).

The figure below illustrating orbital diagrams for nitrogen is similar to the orbital diagram for carbon in the first figure. Notice how all three 2''p'' electrons in the orbital diagram on the left are in separate orbitals, while two of the three 2''p'' electrons in the diagram on the right are sharing a single orbital. The orbital diagram on the left is the correct orbital diagram, because it obeys Hund's Rule. Again, this means that there is less electron-electron repulsion and, as a result, the electrons have lower energies.

:[[File:Orbital diagram nitrogen - Hund's Rule.svg|500px]]

The figure below shows possible electron configurations for an atom with four 2''p'' electrons. This time, two of the electrons have no choice – they must pair up. The other two electrons, however, could either pair up, as shown in the orbital diagram on the right, or occupy their own orbitals, as shown in the orbital diagram on the left. Which do you think is correct? Obviously, the orbital diagram on the left, because it minimizes electron-electron repulsion. The orbital diagram on the left is also the orbital diagram, which follows Hund's Rule, since all orbitals are singly occupied ''before'' any are doubly occupied. The orbital diagram on the right ''does not'' follow Hund’s Rule, since the first two orbitals are doubly occupied before the third is singly occupied.

:[[File:Orbital diagram four 2p - Hund's Rule.svg|520px]]

While it's easy to understand why electrons would occupy empty orbitals before pairing up, it’s a lot harder to understand why unpaired electrons in different orbitals must all have the same spin. Electron spins in different orbitals align (all point in the same direction), because spins, which are aligned have lower energy than spins which are not aligned. Notice that as long as you ''always draw the first electron in an orbital as &quot;spin-up&quot;'' you will always draw spins which are aligned. Refer back to the figure illustrating unpaired electrons as &quot;spin-up&quot;. Now that you know Hund's Rule, it should be obvious why the orbital diagram (c) is incorrect – the two electrons in the singly occupied 2''p'' orbitals have ''different'' spins, and thus this orbital diagram does ''not'' obey Hund's Rule. Compare the orbital diagram (c) to the orbital diagram (d). The orbital diagram in 4.d does obey Hund's Rule, because the two electrons in the singly occupied 2''p'' orbitals have ''the same'' spin.

== Nitrogen Has Three Unpaired Electrons ==
Now that we know about orbital diagrams and Hund's rule, we can begin to explain the chemistry of the elements in Groups 4A through 7A. Let's take a look at nitrogen as an example.
{{High School Chemistry/Example|Example 1}}
Draw the orbital diagram for nitrogen.
----
'''Solution''':

First, we need to write the electron configuration for nitrogen just as we did previously, which gives 1''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2''p''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. To draw the orbital diagram we will write the following: the first two electrons will pair up in the 1''s'' orbital; the next two electrons will pair up in the 2''s'' orbital. That leaves 3 electrons, which must be placed in the 2''p'' orbitals. According to Hund’s Rule, all orbitals will be singly occupied before any is doubly occupied. Therefore, we know that each ''p'' orbital gets one electron. Hund's Rule also tells us that all of the unpaired electrons must have the same spin. Keeping with convention, we draw all of these electrons as &quot;spin-up&quot;, which gives:

Orbital diagrams can help you to make predictions about the ways in which certain elements will react, and the chemical &quot;compounds&quot; or &quot;molecules&quot; that different elements will form. We aren't ready to discuss compounds or molecules yet. The principles that you're learning now will help you to understand the behavior of all chemicals, from the most basic elements like hydrogen and helium, to the most complex proteins (huge biological chemicals made of thousands of different atoms bound together) found in your body.

== Lesson Summary ==
* Orbital diagrams are drawn by representing each orbital as a box, each &quot;spin-up&quot; electron in an orbital as an upward pointing arrow in the box, and each &quot;spin-down&quot; electron in an orbital as a downward pointing arrow in the box. You can only have two arrows in each box, and they must be pointing in opposite directions.
* Scientists use the convention that the first electron in any orbital is &quot;spin-up&quot;, therefore, the first arrow in an orbital &quot;box&quot; should point up. Hund's Rule states:
*# Every orbital in a sublevel is singly occupied before any orbital is doubly occupied.
*# All of the electrons in singly occupied orbitals have the same spin.
* Electrons will occupy separate orbitals rather than pairing up, since this minimizes electron-electron repulsions, thereby minimizing energy. Electron spins in different orbitals within the same sublevel align because aligned spins have lower energy.

      <text xml:space="preserve">OpenSCAD includes convenience scripts to cross-build Windows installer binaries using the MXE system (http://mxe.cc). If you wish to use them, you can first install the [http://mxe.cc/#requirements MXE Requirements such as cmake, perl, scons, using your system's package manager (click to view a complete list of requirements)]. Then you can perform the following commands to download OpenSCAD source and build a windows installer:

    git clone https://github.com/openscad/openscad.git
    cd openscad
    source ./scripts/setenv-mingw-xbuild.sh
    ./scripts/mingw-x-build-dependencies.sh
    ./scripts/release-common.sh mingw32

The x-build-dependencies process takes several hours, mostly to cross-build QT. It also requires several gigabytes of disk space. If you have multiple CPUs you can speed up things by running &lt;b&gt;export NUMCPU=x&lt;/b&gt; before running the dependency build script. By default it builds the dependencies in $HOME/openscad_deps/mxe. You can override the mxe installation path by setting the BASEDIR environment variable before running the scripts. The OpenSCAD binaries are built into a separate build path, openscad/mingw32.

Note that if you want to then build linux binaries, you should log out of your shell, and log back in. The 'setenv' scripts, as of early 2013, required a 'clean' shell environment to work. 

If you wish to cross-build manually, please follow the steps below and/or consult the release-common.sh source code. 

==Setup==

The easiest way to cross-compile OpenSCAD for Windows on Linux or Mac is to use mxe (M cross environment). You will need to install git to get it. Once you have git, navigate to where you want to keep the mxe files in a terminal window and run:
 git clone git://github.com/mxe/mxe.git
Add the following line to your &lt;code&gt;~/.bashrc&lt;/code&gt; file:
 export PATH=/&lt;where mxe is installed&gt;/usr/bin:$PATH
replacing &lt;code&gt;&lt;where mxe is installed&gt;&lt;/code&gt; with the appropriate path.

==Requirements==
The requirements to cross-compile for Windows are just the requirements of mxe. They are listed, along with a command for installing them [http://mxe.cc/#requirements here]. You don't need to type 'make'; this will make everything and take up &gt;10 GB of diskspace. You can instead follow the next step to compile only what's needed for openscad. 


Now that you have the requirements for mxe installed, you can build OpenSCAD's dependencies (CGAL, Opencsg, MPFR, and Eigen2). Just open a terminal window, navigate to your mxe installation and run:
 make mpfr eigen opencsg cgal qt


This will take a few hours, because it has to build things like gcc, qt, and boost. Just go calibrate your printer or something while you wait. To speed things up, you might want do something like &quot;make -j 4 JOBS=2&quot; for parallel building. See the [http://mxe.cc/#tutorial mxe tutorial] for more details.


Optional: If you want to build an installer, you need to install the nullsoft installer system. It should be in your package manager, called &quot;nsis&quot;.

==Build OpenSCAD==
Now that all the requirements have been met, all that remains is to build OpenSCAD itself. Open a terminal window and enter:
 git clone git://github.com/openscad/openscad.git
 cd openscad

Then get MCAD:

 git submodule init
 git submodule update

You need to create a symbolic link here for the build system to find the libraries:
 ln -s /&lt;where mxe is installed&gt;/usr/i686-pc-mingw32/ mingw-cross-env
again replacing &lt;code&gt;&lt;where mxe is installed&gt;&lt;/code&gt; with the appropriate path

Now to build OpenSCAD run:
 i686-pc-mingw32-qmake CONFIG+=mingw-cross-env openscad.pro
 make
When that is finished, you will have openscad.exe in ./release and you can build an installer with it as described in the instructions for building with Microsoft Visual C++, [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/Building_on_Windows#Building_an_installer described here]. 

The difference is that instead of right-clicking on the *.nsi file you will run:
 makensis installer.nsis

Note that as of early 2013, OpenSCAD's 'scripts/release-common.sh' automatically uses the version of nsis that comes with the MXE cross build system, so you may wish to investigate the release-common.sh source code to see how it works, if you have troubles.

      <comment>/* Some more ideas for this book */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Good web resources:'''
* Permanent (http://permanent.com/), an online resource introducing various concepts for space colonization.
* The National Space Society's space settlement archives (http://www.nss.org/settlement/index.html) claim to be a &quot;reference library of over 30,000 pages&quot;.

'''Some key papers:'''
* Jurist, J et. al. When Physics, Economics, and Reality Collide: The Challenge of Cheap Orbital Access. http://www.colonyfund.com/Reading/papers/phys_econ_leo.html
Nicknamed &quot;rocket science meets the dismal science&quot;, the paper examines what is holding back cheap orbital launch capability. It concludes that there is significant inertia and barrier to entry, that overhead costs (insurance, pad costs) dominate launch costs, and that certain government policy changes are crucial.
* Hickman, J. The Political Economy of Very Large Space Projects. http://www.transhumanist.com/volume4/space.htm
Paper arguing that capitalization is the major obstacle to very large space projects, e.g. a lunar mining colony or an O'Neil cylinder. Very large amounts of money are thrown around in the private sector (e.g. to build an offshore oil platform), but the lack of certainty in the space market means that initially, government is going to have to finance very large projects.

'''Some key players currently in private space colonization:'''
In my humble opinion, of course. The first three and the GLXP are easy to argue, however. I chose these companies either because they are shaking up an industry (e.g. SpaceX), creating one (e.g. Virgina Galactic, the suborbital launch firms), pioneering a concept (e.g. Reaction Engines or JP Aerospace), or attempting a historical mission. These are all &quot;New Space&quot; companies, because the old defense-aerospace sector is quite comfortable with expensive contracts and low launch rates and is unwilling to lead in changing that 1960's paradigm. They have demonstrated, however, a willingness to follow.
* SpaceX, whose stated mission is to bring space to the masses and eventually offer transit to Mars. Has successfully launched the Falcon 1 and Falcon 9 rockets, and orbited and recovered the Dragon capsule, all self-funded designs - a first for the aerospace industry. Has a contract with NASA to deliver cargo to the ISS. http://www.spacex.com
* Bigelow Aerospace is commercializing NASA's Transhab concept for inflatable space station modules. Successfully launched two prototypes and are currently expanding their facility for production. They have created concepts for Lunar colonies using their modules.
* Virgin Galactic, aiming to be the world's first commercial spaceline. While short-term plans are only suborbital, they intend to offer orbital flights in the near future.
* Orbital Sciences, Inc. The other company to hold a NASA contract to deliver cargo to the ISS.
* Shackleton Energy, led by renowned engineer and explorer Bill Stone, intends to conduct the first water mining mission on the Moon.
:* Stone's TED talk, announcing the venture to a standing ovation. http://www.ted.com/talks/bill_stone_explores_the_earth_and_space.html
:* Shackleton Energy's website. http://www.stoneaerospace.com/news-/news-mining-moon.php
:* Recent (Jan 2011) interview with Stone. http://www.space.com/10619-mining-moon-water-bill-stone-110114.html
* Paragon space development. Life support experts who are aiming to grow the first plant on another world.
* Google Lunar X Prize (GLXP). Contest in the spirit of the Ansari X Prize to conduct the first privately-funded robotic lunar mission. Currently, 20 teams are enrolled.
* Astrobotics. One of the front-runners in the GLXP, and a company with the stated mission of private robotic space exploration.
* Sierra Nevada Corporation (SpaceDev) with their Dreamchaser orbital spaceplane, which received NASA CCDev funding.
* Armadillo and Masten aerospace, winners of the NG Lunar Lander Challenge. Both are developing suborbital vehicles.
* Reaction Engines Ltd. Are designing an air-breathing, single-stage-to-orbit spaceplane. Plan to begin operation by 2020.
* JP Aerospace. Hardly an influential player, but their concept is intriguing: a two stage airship to orbit. The second stage is a hybrid airship/aircraft/spacecraft that gets lift from buoyancy, aerodynamically, and finally from reaching orbital velocity, and thrust from a high-altitude propeller and then an ion engine.

== Some more ideas for this book ==

Excellent adventure. I think this book has the potential to go the extra mile.

I would like to list some ideas:

1) Can we look at early colonization of regions on earth and infer from those what the potential problems may be. Many early colonizations on Earth failed through lack of planning, disease and sometimes for the simple reason that colonists don't always get on. 

2) Is there anyway we can bring in some of the ideas proposed in sci-fi. I particularly like Outland with Sean Connery. Another area of interest may be the Eden project and their experiences in an enclosed isolated area.

3) Can we discuss building materials. Will colonization of the moon require buildings to be made of certain materials. It would also be interesting to review the power supply needed to run a small research station. Carbon fuels would not be suitable. 

4) All of man's colonization on Earth involved a search for something exploitable or useful to man. I can't see any colonization of any body in our Solar system going ahead in a sustainable way without something beneficial or exploitable. If the moon is rich in ores that are useful to man then how do we mine, process and transport them. 

5) We also have the extended stays on Mir. Didn't astronauts on Mir lose some muscle conditioning. Obviously this was in zero-gravity but exercise would be fundamental to healthy colonists on any planet without Earth's gravity. Serious medical problems would need to be considered. If someone needs major life-saving surgery immediately then obviously the right equipment and doctor would be needed.

Should be an interesting book.

:Since early this year I have been working on another Wikibook: '''[[Space_Transport_and_Engineering_Methods]]''' which will cover the technical engineering side of space projects.  Rather than duplicating content, I suggest making this book (Colonizing Outer Space) address the history of human settlement as enabled by technology (your item 1), the history of the idea of space colonies (your item 2), and the motivations for it (your item 4).  Construction materials (item 3) and human factors (item 5) more properly belong to engineering and I would place them in the other book.  &quot;Human Factors&quot; includes all of the requirements that humans impose on a design.  For a space colony that would include atmosphere composition and pressure, temperature, water, food, gravity, and radiation levels as absolute requirements, then health maintenance, living space, entertainment, and other things as variable requirements.  For example, the Space Station (which I helped build, by the way), has &quot;Crew Health&quot; equipment at about the level of a doctor's outpatient office - they can measure heart rate and blood pressure, bandage wounds, and dispense drugs, but they are not set up for major surgery.  How they expect to deal with surgery is to evacuate the crew back to Earth.  So the issue was considered, but the choice made not to attempt to deal with it in orbit.

:If there is a consensus that this is a good way to divide the content of the two books, I can start making edits along those lines, but I will wait a bit to hear from others.

::I have been cleaning this project for sometime, I'm not the initiator and even if I'm interested in the subject I have my plate full at present to get into yet another project full time. Danielravennest has done a marvelous job at [[Space_Transport_and_Engineering_Methods]] and I think I first posted there about the collision of content and we had a bit of a dialog about it.
::My view is that this project subject is more strictly defined (less abridgment, and should be more accessible to readers), that is, when a reader comes here there is the expectation to find some content that should not be the same that is present on a [[Space_Transport_and_Engineering_Methods]] (and vice-versa). I can see some benefit in [[Space_Transport_and_Engineering_Methods]] covering historical and existing propulsion and construction technologies but I would prefer that it remained focused more on science facts and moved all the futurology and speculation and considerations (social, legal and economical) here where the scope is dedicated to it if regarding this project subject. I do not see as a rational choice to have a section regarding colonization on [[Space_Transport_and_Engineering_Methods]] but I would accept that past and near future space habitats (in realistic planing stage) should be clearly covered there in more detail especially the technical side of it.
::I see the books benefiting from a cross-linking of the information and reducing duplication by sticking to their declared subject, for consistency of the works and the benefit of the readers.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 19:45, 29 August 2012 (UTC)

::: Thanks for the information. If you don't mind I'm going to proof read this. Just mainly looking for minor corrections. I'll detail each edit for others to review. so feel free to reverse any edits I do. Not an expert proof reader but from doing the book on guitar I've learnt a few things about when to hyphenate, capitalization, etc. I won't add any content and basically will restrict myself to structure and corrections.

:::: Thanks for any help you can give to this project. Since you are not interested in providing content but you will be reading it, you could easily use the transwiki function and repurpose some of the content already present on Wikipedia were relevant and needed (not a direct copy of the encyclopedic articles but of the bits that make sense in to support the subject in the book). In case you do not want to do that you can use the TODO box and tag the articles that you see as beneficial to the work.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 09:56, 1 September 2012 (UTC)

:: My main interests are history and music. It was reading history books about the Ancient Greeks and Romans that led to me developing a small interest in astronomy. This book is about modern astronomy and I don't think I'm that &quot;up&quot; on the subject. Didn't even realise there was so many studies and sites dedicated to space colonization. Will investigate some of the links provided. I like reading about early astronomers like Kepler and Ptolemy. I have messed around with Kepler's law of planetary motion:

&quot;the square of the sidereal period is proportional to a planet's mean distance from the Sun&quot;

::from which you can work out the distance of any planet from the Sun. So I sat down with a piece of paper and tried to work out Kepler's law which was made easier by knowing that the sidereal period of the Earth is 365 days and the distance is 93 million miles. Took the ratio from this Earth to Sun calculation and then applied that to Mar's sidereal period to get the Mars - Sun distance. I suppose I just wanted to get into Kepler's way of thinking being a history buff and that's about as far as I can go with maths. I'll leave the new stuff and maths to guys who are better acquainted with modern technology and maths and with that in mind I don't imagine I'll be able to add anything to this book. Reading this book has been an eye-opener and I've never heard of the term &quot;generational&quot; space ship or even thought about what it would mean to be born on a space ship that's attempting travel longer than the human life span.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Your are the person most responsible for your safety. You can prevent a dangerous or harmful situation more easily than can someone rescue you from your blunder.   This being said the following points may shed some light on your responsibilities:

# Know the required PPE (Personal Protective Equipment) to use and use them properly.
# Never use unlabeled bottles or containers and always label Containers.
# Use Material safety data sheets to understand the chemicals you deal with (are they strongly acidic, alkaline, flammable, oxidizing, or  capable of creating toxic fumes when they react with other materials) in addition with what their effects on your body are. These sheets will also inform you of what to do when exposed to such chemicals accidentally.
# Follow procedures. You are not the first person to have done the experiment.
# Never eat, drink, or smoke anything while in the laboratory. Never touch any chemical reagent.
# Never return unused material to reagent bottle. This may contaminate the entire bottle. Ask neighbors if they need it and throw away any leftovers in the proper waste container
# When getting any extra chemical reagent from the storage room, always make sure to have a secondary container in case of a spill.
# When the waste container is about 75 percent full, alert the TA to get a new waste container. Do not ever fill it up all the way.
# Locate emergency equipments before starting work (eye wash stations or fire extinguishers for example).
# Locate the safest routes to leave through the emergency exit doors.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In origami, a model base is the structural skeleton of an origami model in its simplest form. The usage of a base has many benefits; the folding sequence will be easier to remember and create diagrams for, and further models can be developed from the same base, or from slight modifications thereof. However, the use of a base does, to a certain extent, limit what can be done with the model.

Traditional origami models were often developed from similar patterns. While some of them are rarely used, there are six that are used quite frequently: the waterbomb base, preliminary fold, kite base, fish base, bird base and frog base. Most recently published books only assume the knowledge of these bases; however, some authors still use unconventional bases.

These bases are referred to as the classic bases, and were used as the primary design technique until the 1960s. They all share the same symmetry, and certain structural properties. In the 1960s, paperfolders started trying to find new bases to create more complex models. One of the new techniques they developed was to fold the corners into the center (a blintz base), fold the base, and then unwrap the extra layers of paper. This technique allowed folders to multiply the number of points on the base, and is referred to as &quot;blintzing&quot; the base.

The windmill base, helmet base, umbrella base and pig base are found in traditional models, but not used or accepted as widely.

Models are typically classified by the number of simultaneous folds to realize. The more the number of folds is high, the more the techniques involved in the construction is complex.

== One fold ==

* The '''book fold''' is a valley fold that folds the paper by the middle and entirely covers the side up.
[[Image:Book fold origami diagram.svg|center|thumb|200px|Book fold]]
&lt;br/&gt;
* The '''cupboard fold''' is two valley folds that push the edges of the paper to the middle.
[[Image:Cupboard fold origami diagram.svg|center|thumb|300px|Cupboard fold]]
&lt;br/&gt;
* The '''pleat fold''' is several evenly-spaced parallel mountain and valley folds. It is also called an &quot;accordion fold.&quot;
[[Image:Accordion-fold.jpg|center|thumb|200px|Accordion or pleat fold]]
&lt;br/&gt;
* The '''radial pleat fold''' is an angled pleat fold, usually with a focus point on an edge or corner.
&lt;br/&gt;
* The '''kite base''' is merely two valley folds that bring two adjacent edges of the square together to lie on the square's diagonal.
[[Image:Origami kite base.svg|center|thumb|300px|Kite base]]
&lt;br/&gt;
* The '''helmet base''' consists of a diagonal valley fold that bisects two corners of the square and two perpendicular valley folds that push two corners of the triangle to the third one.
[[Image:Origami helmet base.svg|center|thumb|300px|Helmet base]]
&lt;br/&gt;
* The '''blintz fold''' is made by folding the corners of a square into the center. This can be achieved with higher accuracy by folding and unfolding two reference creases through the center.
[[Image:Origami blintz base.svg|center|thumb|300px|Blintz fold]]

Origamis that are done by creating only one fold at a time are called pureland origami. Because of these restrictions, proponents of the theory have devised alternate methods of folding more complicated steps that have very similar results.

== Two folds ==
* The '''preliminary fold''' or '''square base''' consists of a diagonal mountain fold that bisects two corners of the square and two perpendicular valley folds that bisect the edges of the square. The paper is then collapsed to form a square shape with four isosceles-right triangular flaps.
[[Image:Origami preliminary base.svg|center|thumb|400px|Preliminary fold or Square Base]]
&lt;br/&gt;
* The '''waterbomb base''' consists of two perpendicular valley folds down the diagonals of the square and a mountain fold down the center of the square. This crease pattern is then compressed to form the waterbomb base, which is an isosceles-right triangle with four isosceles-right triangular flaps. The waterbomb base is an inside-out square base.

&lt;br/&gt;
* The '''pig base''' consists of a cupboard fold with all the paper corner squash folded to the center of the paper. All the paper edge is along the middle line.

&lt;br/&gt;
* The '''umbrella base''' consists of a square base with all the flaps squash folded and the isosceles-right triangular flaps valley folded on the big isosceles triangle.

&lt;br/&gt;
* The '''windmill base''' consists of four square bases on a single square.

&lt;br/&gt;

== Three folds ==
* The '''fish base''' consists of two radial folds against a diagonal reference crease on each of two opposite corners. The flaps that result on the other two corners are carefully folded downwards in the same direction.  In other words, it consists of two side-by-side rabbit ears.

&lt;br/&gt;
* The '''bird base''', or '''crane base''', consists of a square base with both the front and the back sides petal folded upward.

&lt;br/&gt;
* The '''frog base''' starts with a waterbomb base or square base. All four flaps are squash-folded (the result is the same in either case), and then the corners are petal folded upward.
[[Image:Origami frog base.svg|center|thumb|500px|Frog base constructed on a preliminary fold]]
&lt;br/&gt;
* Most of the creases in a '''stretched bird base''' are present in the regular bird base.  When forming this bird base, make sure to crease the triangle at the center corner through all layers.  (If you unfold completely, you will see a small square at the center of the paper.)  After forming the bird base, either partially unfold the paper, and/or &quot;stretch&quot; two opposite corners of the bird base.  These two corners, their associated flaps, and the central square will all lie flat.  The other two flaps will form a pyramid.  Rabbit ear each flap that is in the pyramid, so that the model lies flat.  All of the raw edges will lie along the centerline of the model.  The stretched bird base is used in Lang's ''Bald Eagle'', [http://www.folds.net/tutorial/models/eeyore/eeyore_diagrams.html Greenberg's ''Eeyore''], and some other high-intermediate and complex models.
&lt;br/&gt;

If a square is blintz folded, then a kite/fish/bird/frog base is folded, and the blintzed edges teased out and collapsed n a certain fashion, this is called a blintzed kite/fish/bird/frog/base, which doubles the complexity and adds more points and edges to the original kite/fish/bird/frog base, for a more complex model that requires more points. It's possible to double blintz for a double blintzed kite/fish/bird/frog base if needed. Theoretically an infinite number of blintzes could be performed to yield an infinitely complex multipointed base, but paper thickness restricts this to generally two blintzes.

With what we have already discussed, you might realize that just as electron configurations can be used to explain the shape and organization of the Periodic Table, the shape and organization of the Periodic Table can, in turn, be used to predict electron configurations. In fact, if you can locate an element on the Periodic Table, you can use the element's position to figure out the energy level of the element's valence electrons. Furthermore, an element's position on the Periodic Table tells you the sublevel of the element's ''highest'' energy valence electrons. In this lesson, we'll take a close look at how the Periodic Table relates to the electron configurations.

==Lesson Objectives==
* Relate an element's position in the Periodic Table to the energy level of its valence electrons (excluding transition metals, lanthanides, and actinides).
* Relate an element's position in the Periodic Table to the sublevel of its highest energy valence electrons.
* Explain why there are only two elements in the first row of the Periodic Table.

==Rows Across on the PT are Consistent With the Energy Level in An Atom==
First, let's try to figure out what we can learn from an element's row or period in the Periodic Table.

The figure below shows how the different rows in the Periodic Table are numbered. The transition metals and the lanthanides and actinides have been omitted.

[[File:Periodic Table and electron configurations.svg|550px|center]]

To understand what this means in terms of an element's electron configuration, let's consider the Group 1A metals. If we write the electron configuration for the Group 1A metal from each row of the Periodic Table, we have:

:{| 
|style=&quot;vertical-align:bottom; padding-right:15px;&quot;|row 2||style=&quot;vertical-align:bottom;&quot;|Li:||&lt;math&gt;1s^22s^1&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|style=&quot;vertical-align:bottom;&quot;|row 3||style=&quot;vertical-align:bottom;&quot;|Na:||&lt;math&gt;1s^22s^22p^63s^1&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|style=&quot;vertical-align:bottom;&quot;|row 4||style=&quot;vertical-align:bottom;&quot;|K:||&lt;math&gt;1s^22s^22p^63s^23p^64s^1&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|style=&quot;vertical-align:bottom;&quot;|row 5||style=&quot;vertical-align:bottom;&quot;|Rb:||&lt;math&gt;1s^22s^22p^63s^23p^64s^23d^{10}4p^65s^1&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|style=&quot;vertical-align:bottom;&quot;|row 6||style=&quot;vertical-align:bottom;&quot;|Cs:||&lt;math&gt;1s^22s^22p^63s^23p^64s^23d^{10}4p^65s^24d^{10}5p^66s^1&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|style=&quot;vertical-align:bottom;&quot;|row 7||style=&quot;vertical-align:bottom;&quot;|Fr:||&lt;math&gt;1s^22s^22p^63s^23p^64s^23d^{10}4p^65s^24d^{10}5p^66s^24f^{14}5d^{10}6p^67s^1&lt;/math&gt;
|}

Do you see any pattern? For Group 1A metals, it seems that element's row corresponds to the energy level of that element's valence electron. Lithium (Li), for instance, is found in row 2 of the Periodic Table, and its valence electron is found in the ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2 energy level. Cesium (Cs) is found in row 6 of the Periodic Table, and its valence electron is found in the ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;6 energy level. Let's see if this same pattern holds for Group 2A metals:

:{| 
|style=&quot;vertical-align:bottom; padding-right:15px;&quot;|row 2||style=&quot;vertical-align:bottom;&quot;|Be:||&lt;math&gt;1s^22s^2&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|style=&quot;vertical-align:bottom;&quot;|row 3||style=&quot;vertical-align:bottom;&quot;|Mg:||&lt;math&gt;1s^22s^22p^63s^2&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|style=&quot;vertical-align:bottom;&quot;|row 4||style=&quot;vertical-align:bottom;&quot;|Ca:||&lt;math&gt;1s^22s^22p^63s^23p^64s^2&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|style=&quot;vertical-align:bottom;&quot;|row 5||style=&quot;vertical-align:bottom;&quot;|Sr:||&lt;math&gt;1s^22s^22p^63s^23p^64s^23d^{10}4p^65s^2&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|style=&quot;vertical-align:bottom;&quot;|row 6||style=&quot;vertical-align:bottom;&quot;|Ba:||&lt;math&gt;1s^22s^22p^63s^23p^64s^23d^{10}4p^65s^24d^{10}5p^66s^2&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|style=&quot;vertical-align:bottom;&quot;|row 7||style=&quot;vertical-align:bottom;&quot;|Ra:||&lt;math&gt;1s^22s^22p^63s^23p^64s^23d^{10}4p^65s^24d^{10}5p^66s^24f^{14}5d^{10}6p^67s^2&lt;/math&gt;
|}

For Group 2A metals, the same rule applies! Magnesium (Mg) is found in row 3 of the Periodic Table, and its valence electrons are found in the ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3 energy level. Similarly, Radium (Ra) is found in row 7 of the Periodic Table, and its valence electrons are found in the ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;7 energy level.

So far so good – but does the same pattern apply to the Group 3A–8A elements (also known as Groups 13–18). Let's find out by writing the electron configuration for the Group 3A element in each row.

:{| 
|style=&quot;vertical-align:bottom; padding-right:15px;&quot;|row 2||style=&quot;vertical-align:bottom;&quot;|B:||&lt;math&gt;1s^22s^22p^1&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|style=&quot;vertical-align:bottom;&quot;|row 3||style=&quot;vertical-align:bottom;&quot;|Al:||&lt;math&gt;1s^22s^22p^63s^23p^1&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|style=&quot;vertical-align:bottom;&quot;|row 4||style=&quot;vertical-align:bottom;&quot;|Ga:||&lt;math&gt;1s^22s^22p^63s^23p^64s^23d^{10}4p^1&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|style=&quot;vertical-align:bottom;&quot;|row 5||style=&quot;vertical-align:bottom;&quot;|In:||&lt;math&gt;1s^22s^22p^63s^23p^64s^23d^{10}4p^65s^24d^{10}5p^1&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|style=&quot;vertical-align:bottom;&quot;|row 6||style=&quot;vertical-align:bottom;&quot;|Tl:||&lt;math&gt;1s^22s^22p^63s^23p^64s^23d^{10}4p^65s^24d^{10}5p^66s^25d^{10}6p^1&lt;/math&gt;
|}

Even though the valence electrons in Group 3A elements are found in both ''s'' and ''p'' orbitals, it turns out that an element's row still corresponds to the energy level of that element's valence electrons. For example, Gallium (Ga) is found in row 4 of the Periodic Table, and its valence electrons are found in the ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4 energy level. Likewise, Thallium (Tl) is found in row 6 of the Periodic Table, and its valence electrons are found in the ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;6 energy level.

It really does seem as if we can predict the energy level of an element's valence electrons using the row number for that element in the Periodic Table. Let's try one last example, though, just to be sure by writing the electron configuration for the Group 7A element in each row.

:{| 
|style=&quot;vertical-align:bottom; padding-right:15px;&quot;|row 2||style=&quot;vertical-align:bottom;&quot;|F:||&lt;math&gt;1s^22s^22p^5&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|style=&quot;vertical-align:bottom;&quot;|row 3||style=&quot;vertical-align:bottom;&quot;|Cl:||&lt;math&gt;1s^22s^22p^63s^23p^5&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|style=&quot;vertical-align:bottom;&quot;|row 4||style=&quot;vertical-align:bottom;&quot;|Br:||&lt;math&gt;1s^22s^22p^63s^23p^64s^23d^{10}4p^5&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|style=&quot;vertical-align:bottom;&quot;|row 5||style=&quot;vertical-align:bottom;&quot;|I:||&lt;math&gt;1s^22s^22p^63s^23p^64s^23d^{10}4p^65s^24d^{10}5p^5&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|style=&quot;vertical-align:bottom;&quot;|row 6||style=&quot;vertical-align:bottom;&quot;|At:||&lt;math&gt;1s^22s^22p^63s^23p^64s^23d^{10}4p^65s^24d^{10}5p^66s^25d^{10}6p^5&lt;/math&gt;
|}

Once again, an element's row can be used to determine the energy level of that element's valence electrons. Chlorine (Cl), for instance, is found in row 3 of the Periodic Table, and its valence electrons are found in the ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3 energy level. Similarly, Iodine (I) is found in row 5 of the Periodic Table, and its valence electrons are found in the ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;5 energy level.

You should make note of one final point when it comes to energy levels and how they relate to the Periodic Table. Our rule for determining the energy level of an element's valence electrons using the element's row in the Periodic Table works for Group 1A–8A elements. This rule ''doesn't'' apply, however, to the Group 1B–8B (also known as Groups 3–12) elements. The elements in that lower portion of the Periodic Table (the middle portion of the Periodic Table &quot;blacked out&quot; in the first figure) are known as '''transition metals'''. They behave differently, and you can't apply the same rules to them as far as valence electrons are concerned. The same goes for the isolated lower portion of the Periodic Table (also &quot;blacked out&quot; in the figure of the Periodic Table above). This block contains elements known as ''lanthanides'' and ''actinides''. Like transition metals, '''lanthanides and actinides''' do not obey the same rules as the Group 1A–8A elements when it comes to valence electrons and valence electron energy levels.

==Hydrogen and Helium Occupy the First Period==
You probably noticed that, in the last section, we didn't mention the first row at all. Instead, we always started from row 2. The first row in the Periodic Table is a &quot;special row&quot; for several reasons. To begin with, the first row of the Periodic Table contains only two elements – hydrogen and helium. Can you figure out ''why'' there are only two elements in the first row?

According to what we learned in the last section, an element's row number corresponds to the energy level of that element's valence electrons. Therefore, the first row must contain elements with valence electrons in the ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 energy level. By now you should know that there is ''only one orbital'' in the ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 energy level. That orbital, of course, is the 1''s'' orbital. Hydrogen has one valence electron in the 1s orbital, (its electron configuration is 1''s''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;), and helium has two valence electrons in the 1''s'' orbital (its electron configuration is 1''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Since it's impossible to fit ''more'' than two electrons into the 1''s'' orbital, atoms with a total of ''three or more'' electrons ''must'' have valence electrons in an energy level with ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2 or greater. Clearly, then, atoms with a total of ''three or more'' electrons do ''not'' belong in the first row of the Periodic Table.

The first row of the Periodic Table is also special because its elements have special properties. Hydrogen, for example, is not a metal like the rest of the Group 1A elements. Instead, hydrogen atoms react with each other and form what's known as ''hydrogen gas'', H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. As was mentioned in the last lesson, some scientists will put hydrogen in a category all by itself, rather than including it at the top of the 1A column. We won't do that here, but you should always keep in mind the fact that hydrogen is &quot;different&quot;, and that you shouldn't compare the hydrogen's chemical properties with the chemical properties of the other Group 1A elements.

Helium is also a special atom. You might wonder why helium appears at the far right-hand side of the Periodic Table, rather than right next to hydrogen. Again, helium's placement in the Periodic Table reflects its special chemical properties. Earlier you learned that Group 8A elements were &quot;'''inert'''&quot; and that includes helium. Even though helium only has two valence electrons, while the rest of the Group 8A elements have eight valence electrons, helium is placed on the top of the 8A column since helium's chemical behavior is similar to the chemical behavior of the other '''noble gases''' because it has a completed outer energy level.

==The ''s'' Sublevel Block on PT==
So far we know that, with the exception of transition metals, lanthanides and actinides, we can use the row in which an element is found to determine the energy level of that element's valence electrons. Can the organization of the Periodic Table, and the placement of an element within the Periodic Table, tell us anything else about the elements electron configuration? The answer is – &quot;yes&quot;. Remember that the highest energy valence electrons in Group 1A and Group 2A elements are ''always'' in ''s'' orbitals. In fact, the ''only'' valence electrons in Group 1A and Group 2A elements are in ''s'' orbitals! Lithium, (Li) for instance, has the electron configuration 1''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2''s''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Notice that lithium's single valence electron is in an ''s'' orbital. Similarly, magnesium (Mg) has the electron configuration 1''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2''p''&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;3''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Again, notice that magnesium's two valence electrons are in an ''s'' orbital. Since all of the valence electrons in Group 1A and Group 2A elements exist in ''s'' orbitals, the first two columns of the Periodic Table (columns 1A and 2A) are known as the &quot;'''''s'' sublevel block'''&quot;. The ''s'' sublevel block is shown in the figure below. Notice that the ''s'' sublevel block consists of all of the metals from Li down to Fr in column 1A, and all of the metals from Be down to Ra in column 2A. Hydrogen is not included in the ''s'' sublevel block, again, because of its special properties.

[[File:S sublevel block.svg|600px|center|thumb|As pictured, the ''s'' sublevel block of the Periodic Table includes the Group 1A metals and the Group 2A metals.]]

==The ''p'' Sublevel Block on PT==
What can we say about the valence electrons in Group 3A – Group 8A elements? In particular, what can we say about the ''highest'' energy valence electrons? If you look carefully, you'll notice that for Group 3A – Group 8A (or if you prefer, Groups 13–18) elements, the highest energy valence electrons are always in ''p'' orbitals. Boron, (B) for instance, has the electron configuration 1''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2''p''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;. While boron has both 2''s'' and 2''p'' valence electrons, the 2''p'' valence electrons are higher in energy. Similarly, Krypton (Kr) has the electron configuration 1''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2''p''&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;3''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;3''p''&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;4''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;3''d''&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;4''p''&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;. Again, while krypton has both 4''s'' and 4''p'' valence electrons, the 4''p'' valence electrons are higher in energy. Since the highest energy valence electrons in Group 3A Group 8A elements exist in ''p'' orbitals, the final six columns of the Periodic Table (columns 3A through 8A) are known as the &quot;'''p sublevel block'''&quot;. The ''p'' sublevel block is shown in the figure below. Additionally, as illustrated in the figure below the ''p'' sublevel block consists of all of the elements from B down to Tl in column 3A, all of the elements from C down to Pb in column 4A, all of the elements from N down to Bi in column 5A, all of the elements from O down to Po in column 6A, all of the elements from F down to At in column 7A and, finally, all of the elements from Ne down to Rn in column 8A. Helium is not included in the ''p'' sublevel block, which should make sense, since helium has ''no p'' electrons!

[[File:P sublevel block.svg|600px|center|thumb|As illustrated, the ''p'' sublevel block of the Periodic Table includes the Group 3A – Group 8A elements.]]

Just as the Periodic Table has an ''s'' sublevel block and a ''p'' sublevel block, it also has a '''''d'' sublevel block''' and an '''''f'' sublevel block'''. Defining valence electrons in the ''d'' and ''f'' sublevel blocks can be more difficult but, in general, most of the high energy valence electrons in the ''d'' sublevel block are in ''d'' orbitals while most of the high energy valence electrons in the ''f'' sublevel block are in ''f'' orbitals.

[[File:Periodic Table structure.svg|600px|center|thumb|As illustrated, the Periodic Table is divided into the ''s'' sublevel block, the ''p'' sublevel block, the ''d'' sublevel block, and the ''f'' sublevel block.]]

Earlier you learned that the Periodic Table was a convenient way to summarize all of the information that scientists know about the different elements found in our world. The Periodic Table probably even looked funny to you, because you had no way of understanding what its shape and organization meant. Now that we've discussed electron orbitals and electron energy levels, though, the Periodic Table shouldn't seem so strange anymore. In fact, the shape of the Periodic Table actually reflects the way in which electrons are organized in atoms of the different elements.

==Lesson Summary==
* For Group 1A, 2A, 3A, 4A, 5A, 6A, 7A and 8A elements, the row in which an element is found corresponds to the energy level of that element's valence electrons. For example, lithium (Li) is in row 2, and its valence electrons are in the ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2 energy level.
* You can predict the energy level of an element's valence electrons using the element's row number in the Periodic Table.
* Elements in the first row have special properties.
* Hydrogen is ''not'' an alkali metal, and is usually found as a gas.
* Helium is a noble gas, and exhibits chemical properties similar to the other noble gases found in Group 8A.
* The Periodic Table can be divided into ''s'', ''d'', ''p'', and ''f'' sublevel blocks.
* For elements in the ''s'' sublevel block, all valence electrons are found in ''s'' orbitals.
* For elements in the ''p'' sublevel block, the highest energy valence electrons are found in ''p'' orbitals.

==Vocabulary==
; ''d'' sublevel block
: The elements in the Periodic Table in columns 1B through 8B (also known as transition metals).
; ''f'' sublevel block
: The elements in the lanthanide and actinide rows of the Periodic Table.
; inert
: Non-reactive.
; lanthanides and actinides
: Elements in the ''f'' sublevel block of the Periodic Table. The highest energy electrons in lanthanides and actinides are found in ''f'' orbitals.
; noble gases
: Group 8A elements. These are elements found in the eighth column of the Periodic Table. They are inert, which means that they are very non-reactive.
; ''p'' sublevel block
: The elements in the Periodic Table in columns 3A through 8A (excluding helium). The highest energy valence electrons for elements in the ''p'' sublevel block are in ''p'' orbitals.
; ''s'' sublevel block
: The elements in the Periodic Table in columns 1A and 2A (excluding hydrogen). All valence electrons for elements in the ''s'' sublevel block are in ''s'' orbitals.
; transition metals
: Elements in the ''d'' sublevel block (columns 1B through 8B) of the Periodic Table. The highest energy electrons in transition metals are found in ''d'' orbitals.

      <text xml:space="preserve">TM-database is green CAT tool, with all the most common features, seen in other CAT tools. TM-database supports Unicode and can work with a language pair without the need of external components, like .NET Framework, Java Virtual Machine or any Runtime/Redistributable modules, commonly required by other translation memory software. TM-database supports TMX import and export, and can build a translation memory from any bilingual  files.

TM-database was designed for freelance translators, who would not invest into more expensive CAT-Tools. 

More information about TM-database can be found at [http://yehongmei.narod.ru/ TM-database]

Evaluates and returns the minimum of a list of numeric values (with up to 3 parameters). The parameters can be numeric expressions that will be evaluated. Empty or missing parameters are ignored.

=== Usage ===

; Syntax&lt;nowiki&gt;:&lt;/nowiki&gt;
: &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{min | value1 | value2 | value3 }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;

; Examples&lt;nowiki&gt;:&lt;/nowiki&gt;
: &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{min}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; → {{min}}
: &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{min|}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; → {{min|}}
: &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{min|-7}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; → {{min|-7}}
: &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{min|-7|}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; → {{min|-7|}}
: &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{min|7|-5}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; → {{min|7|-5}}
: &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{min|7|-5|}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; → {{min|7|-5|}}
: &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{min|7|-5|-8}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; → {{min|7|-5|-8}}
: &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{min|40*41|300+30}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; → {{min|40*41|300+30}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Too specialized ? ==

IMO this is way to specialized for most latex users and should probably be moved to an appendix.  [[Special:Contributions/68.80.95.198|68.80.95.198]] ([[User talk:68.80.95.198|discuss]]) 15:20, 28 September 2011 (UTC)
: I take your point. But is it really more specialized than the previous page on writing a letter in LaTeX ? --[[User:PAC2|PAC2]] ([[User talk:PAC2|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/PAC2|contribs]]) 11:17, 29 September 2011 (UTC)

== Teacher's? Teachers'? ==

Shouldn't this be ''Teachers' Corner''?   [[User:Curly Turkey|Curly Turkey]] ([[User talk:Curly Turkey|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Curly Turkey|contribs]]) 03:34, 7 November 2011 (UTC)
: My opinion is that both make sense. But I'm not a native English speaker. If you think that the plural form is better than the singular, feel free to change it. --[[User:PAC2|PAC2]] ([[User talk:PAC2|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/PAC2|contribs]]) 08:24, 7 November 2011 (UTC)

蟹（かに）の握り飯を奪った猿（さる）はとうとう蟹に仇（かたき）を取られた。

蟹は臼（うす）、蜂（はち）、卵と共に、怨敵（おんてき）の猿を殺したのである。

――その話はいまさらしないでも好（よ）い。

ただ猿を仕止めた後（のち）、蟹を始め同志のものはどう云う運命に逢着（ほうちゃく）したか、それを話すことは必要である。

なぜと云えばお伽噺（とぎばなし）は全然このことは話していない。

　いや、話していないどころか、あたかも蟹は穴の中に、臼は台所の土間（どま）の隅に、蜂は軒先（のきさき）の蜂の巣に、

卵は籾殻（もみがら）の箱の中に、太平無事な生涯でも送ったかのように装（よそお）っている。

　しかしそれは偽（いつわり）である。

彼等は仇（かたき）を取った後、警官の捕縛（ほばく）するところとなり、ことごとく監獄（かんごく）に投ぜられた。

しかも裁判（さいばん）を重ねた結果、主犯（しゅはん）蟹は死刑になり、臼、蜂、卵等の共犯は無期徒刑の宣告を受けたのである。

お伽噺（とぎばなし）のみしか知らない読者はこう云う彼等の運命に、怪訝（かいが）の念を持つかも知れない。

が、これは事実である。寸毫（すんごう）も疑いのない事実である。

　蟹（かに）は蟹自身の言によれば、握り飯と柿（かき）と交換した。

が、猿は熟柿（じゅくし）を与えず、青柿（あおがき）ばかり与えたのみか、蟹に傷害を加えるように、さんざんその柿を投げつけたと云う。

しかし蟹は猿との間（あいだ）に、一通の証書も取り換（か）わしていない。

よしまたそれは不問（ふもん）に附しても、握り飯と柿と交換したと云い、熟柿とは特に断（ことわ）っていない。

最後に青柿を投げつけられたと云うのも、猿に悪意があったかどうか、その辺（へん）の証拠は不十分である。

だから蟹の弁護に立った、雄弁の名の高い某弁護士も、裁判官の同情を乞うよりほかに、策の出づるところを知らなかったらしい。

その弁護士は気の毒そうに、蟹の泡を拭ってやりながら、

「あきらめ給え」と云ったそうである。もっともこの「あきらめ給え」

は、死刑の宣告を下されたことをあきらめ給えと云ったのだか、弁護士に大金（たいきん）をとられたことをあきらめ給えと云ったのだか、

それは誰にも決定出来ない。


　その上新聞雑誌の輿論（よろん）も、蟹に同情を寄せたものはほとんど一つもなかったようである。

蟹の猿を殺したのは私憤（しふん）の結果にほかならない。

しかもその私憤たるや、己（おのれ）の無知と軽卒（けいそつ）とから猿に利益を占められたのを忌々（いまいま）しがっただけではないか？


優勝劣敗の世の中にこう云う私憤を洩（も）らすとすれば、愚者にあらずんば狂者である。

――と云う非難が多かったらしい。

現に商業会議所会頭某男爵（だんしゃく）のごときは大体上（かみ）のような意見と共に、蟹の猿を殺したのも多少は流行の危険思想にかぶれ
たのであろうと論断した。

そのせいか蟹の仇打（かたきう）ち以来、某男爵は壮士のほかにも、ブルドッグを十頭飼（か）ったそうである。


　かつまた蟹の仇打ちはいわゆる識者の間（あいだ）にも、一向（いっこう）好評を博さなかった。

大学教授某博士（はかせ）は倫理学上の見地から、蟹の猿を殺したのは復讐（ふくしゅう）の意志に出（で）たものである、復讐は善と称し難
いと云った。

それから社会主義の某首領は蟹は柿とか握り飯とか云う私有財産を難有（ありがた）がっていたから、

臼や蜂や卵なども反動的思想を持っていたのであろう、事によると尻押（しりお）しをしたのは国粋会（こくすいかい）かも知れないと云っ
た。

それから某宗（ぼうしゅう）の管長某師は蟹は仏慈悲（ぶつじひ）を知らなかったらしい、たとい青柿を投げつけられたとしても、

仏慈悲を知っていさえすれば、猿の所業を憎む代りに、反（かえ）ってそれを憐んだであろう。

ああ、思えば一度でも好（い）いから、わたしの説教を聴かせたかったと云った。

それから――また各方面にいろいろ批評する名士はあったが、いずれも蟹の仇打ちには不賛成（ふさんせい）の声ばかりだった。

そう云う中にたった一人、蟹のために気を吐いたのは酒豪（しゅごう）兼詩人の某代議士である。

代議士は蟹の仇打ちは武士道の精神と一致すると云った。

しかしこんな時代遅れの議論は誰の耳にも止（とま）るはずはない。

のみならず新聞のゴシップによると、その代議士は数年以前、動物園を見物中、猿に尿（いばり）をかけられたことを遺恨（いこん）に思って
いたそうである。


　お伽噺（とぎばなし）しか知らない読者は、悲しい蟹の運命に同情の涙を落すかも知れない。

しかし蟹の死は当然である。

それを気の毒に思いなどするのは、婦女童幼のセンティメンタリズムに過ぎない。

天下は蟹の死を是（ぜ）なりとした。現に死刑の行われた夜（よ）、判事、検事、弁護士、看守（かんしゅ）、

死刑執行人、教誨師（きょうかいし）等は四十八時間熟睡したそうである。その上皆夢の中に、天国の門を見たそうである。

天国は彼等の話によると、封建時代の城に似たデパアトメント・ストアらしい。


　ついでに蟹の死んだ後（のち）、蟹の家庭はどうしたか、それも少し書いて置きたい。

蟹の妻は売笑婦（ばいしょうふ）になった。

なった動機は貧困のためか、彼女自身の性情のためか、どちらか未（いまだ）に判然しない。

蟹の長男は父の没後、新聞雑誌の用語を使うと、「飜然（ほんぜん）と心を改めた。」

今は何でもある株屋の番頭か何かしていると云う。

この蟹はある時自分の穴へ、同類の肉を食うために、怪我（けが）をした仲間を引きずりこんだ。

クロポトキンが相互扶助論（そうごふじょろん）の中に、蟹も同類を劬（いたわ）ると云う実例を引いたのはこの蟹である。

次男の蟹は小説家になった。

勿論（もちろん）小説家のことだから、女に惚（ほ）れるほかは何もしない。

ただ父蟹の一生を例に、善は悪の異名（いみょう）であるなどと、好（い）い加減（かげん）な皮肉を並べている。

三男の蟹は愚物（ぐぶつ）だったから、蟹よりほかのものになれなかった。

それが横這（よこば）いに歩いていると、握り飯が一つ落ちていた。

握り飯は彼の好物だった。

彼は大きい鋏（はさみ）の先にこの獲物（えもの）を拾い上げた。

すると高い柿の木の梢（こずえ）に虱（しらみ）を取っていた猿が一匹、――その先は話す必要はあるまい。


　とにかく猿と戦ったが最後、蟹は必ず天下のために殺されることだけは事実である。

語を天下の読者に寄す。君たちもたいてい蟹なんですよ。

With the introduction of electron configurations, we began to get a deeper understanding of the Periodic Table. An understanding of these electron configurations will prove to be invaluable as we look at bonding and chemical reactions. The orbital representation method for representing electron configuration is shown below. The orbital representation was learned in an earlier chapter but like many of the skills you learn in chemistry, it will be used a great deal in this chapter and in several chapters later in the course.

:[[File:Orbital representation method.svg|500px]]

In this lesson, we will focus on the connection between the electron configuration and the main group elements of the Periodic Table. We will need to remember the sub-level filling groups in the Periodic Table. Keep the following figure in mind. We will use it for the next two chapters.

:[[File:Periodic Table structure.svg|500px]]

==Lesson Objectives==
* Describe the patterns that exist in the electron configurations for the main group elements.
* Identify the columns in the Periodic Table that contain 1) the alkali metals, 2) the alkaline earth metals, 3) the halogens, and 4) the noble gases, and describe the differences between each family's electron configuration.
* Given the outermost energy level electron configuration for an element, determine its family on the Periodic Table.

==Alkali Metals Have One Electron in Their Outer Energy Level==
'''Elements Ending with ''s''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; = Alkali'''

In the Periodic Table, the elements are arranged in order of increasing atomic number. In previous material we learned that the atomic number is the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom. For a neutral atom, the number of protons is equal to the number of electrons. Therefore, for neutral atoms, the Periodic Table is also arranged in order of increasing number of electrons. Take a look now at the first '''group''' or column in the Periodic Table. It is the one marked &quot;1A&quot; in the Period Table figure above. The groups or families are the vertical rows of elements. The first group has seven elements representing the seven periods of the Periodic Table. Remember that a '''period''' in the Periodic Table is a horizontal row. Group 1A is the only group with seven elements in it.

What do you notice about all of the elements in Group 1? They all have ''s''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; as the outermost energy level electron configuration. The whole number in front of the &quot;''s''&quot; tells you what period the element is in. For example sodium, Na, has the electron configuration 1''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2''p''&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;3''s''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, so it is in period 3. It is the first element of this period.

This group of elements is called the '''alkali metals'''. They get their name from ancient Arabic (al kali) because &quot;scientists&quot; of the time found that the ashes of the vegetation they were burning contained a large amount of sodium and potassium. In Arabic, ''al kali'' means ''ashes''. We know today that all alkali metals have electronic configurations ending in ''s''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;. You might want to note that while hydrogen is often placed in group 1, it is not considered an alkali metal. The reason for this will be discussed later.

==Alkaline Earth Elements Have Two Electrons in Their Outer Energy Level==
'''Elements Ending with ''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = Alkaline Earth'''

Taking a look at Group 2A in Table 9.2, we can use the same analysis we used with group 1 to see if we can find a similar trend. It is the second vertical group in the Periodic Table and it contains only six elements.

What do you notice about all of the elements in group 2A? They all have an outermost energy level electron configuration of ''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The whole number in front of the &quot;''s''&quot; tells you what period the element is in. For example, magnesium, Mg, has the electron configuration 1''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2''p''&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;3''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, so it is in period 3 and is the second element in that period. Remember that the ''s'' sublevel may hold two electrons, so in Group 2A, the ''s'' orbital has been filled.

Elements in this group are given the name '''alkaline earth metals'''. They get their name because early &quot;scientists&quot; found that all of the alkaline earths were found in the earth's crust. Alkaline earth metals, although not as reactive as the alkali metals, are still highly reactive. All alkaline earth metals have electron configurations ending in ''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

==Noble Gases Have 8 Electrons in Their Outer Energy Level==
'''Elements Ending with ''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''p''&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; = Noble Gases'''

The first person to isolate a noble gas was Henry Cavendish, who isolated argon in the late 1700s. The noble gases were actually considered inert gases until the 1960s when a compound was formed between xenon and fluorine which changed the way chemists viewed the &quot;inert&quot; gases. In the English language, inert means to be lifeless or motionless; in the chemical world, inert means ''does not react''. Later, the name &quot;'''noble gas'''&quot; replaced &quot;inert gas&quot; for the name of Group 8A.

When we write the electron configurations for these elements, we see the same general trend that was observed with groups 1A and 2A; that is, similar electron configurations within the group.

Aside from helium, He, all of the noble gases have outer energy level electron configurations that are the same, ''ns''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''np''&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''n'' is the period number. So Argon, Ar, is in period 3, is a noble gas, and would therefore have an outer energy level electron configuration of 3''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;3''p''&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;. Notice that both the ''s'' and ''p'' sublevels are filled. Helium has an electron configuration that might fit into Group 2A. However, the chemical reactivity of helium, because it has a full first energy level, is similar to that of the noble gases.

==Halogens Have 7 Electrons in Their Outer Energy Level==
'''Elements Ending with ''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''p''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; = Halogens'''

The '''halogens''' are an interesting group. Halogens are members of Group 7A, which is also referred to as 17. It is the only group in the Periodic Table that contains all of the states of matter at room temperature. Fluorine, F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, is a gas, as is chlorine, Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Bromine, Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, is a liquid and iodine, I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and astatine, At&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, are both solids. What else is neat about Group 7A is that it houses four (4) of the seven (7) diatomic compounds. Remember the diatomics are H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Notice that the latter four are Group 17 elements. The word halogen comes from the Greek meaning ''salt forming''. French chemists discovered that the majority of halogen ions will form salts when combined with metals. We all know some of these already: LiF, NaCl, KBr, and NaI.

Taking a look at Group 7A in the figure, we can find the same pattern of similar electron configurations as found with group 1A, 2A, and 8A. It is the 17&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; group in the Periodic Table and it contains only five elements.

What is the general trend for the elements in Group 7A? They all have, as the outermost energy level electron configuration, ''ns''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''np''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''n'' is the period number. You should also note that these elements are one group away from the noble gases (the ones that generally don't react!) and the outermost electron configuration of the halogens is one away from being filled. For example, chlorine (Cl) has the electron configuration [Ne] 3''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;3''p''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; so it is in period 3, the seventh element in the '''main group elements'''. The main group elements, as you recall, are equivalent to the ''s'' + ''p'' blocks of the Periodic Table (or the pink and orange groups in the diagram above).

==The Oxygen Family Has 6 Electrons in the Outer Energy Level==
'''Elements Ending with ''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''p''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; = the Oxygen Family'''

Oxygen and the other elements in Group 6A have a similar trend in their electron configurations. Oxygen is the only gas in the group; all others are in the solid state at room temperature. Oxygen was first named by Antoine Lavoisier in the late 1700s but really the planet has had oxygen around since plants were first on the earth.

Taking a look at Group 6A in the figure below, we find the same pattern in electron configurations that we found with the other groups. Oxygen and its family members are in the 16&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; group in the Periodic Table. In Group 16, there are, again, only five elements.

When we examine the electron configurations of the Group 6A elements, we see that all of these elements have the outer energy level electron configuration of ''ns''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''np''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;. We will see that this similar electron configuration gives all elements in the group similar properties for bonding.

These elements are two groups away from the noble gases and the outermost electron configuration is two away from being filled. Sulfur, for example, has the electron configuration 1''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2''p''&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;3''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;3''p''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; so it is in period 3. Sulfur is the sixth element in the main group elements. We know it is the sixth element across the period of the main group elements because there are 6 electrons in the outermost energy level.

==The Nitrogen Family Has 5 Electrons in the Outer Energy Level==
'''Elements Ending with ''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''p''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = the Nitrogen Family'''

Just as we saw with Group 6A, Group 5A has a similar oddity in its group. Nitrogen is the only gas in the group with all other members in the solid state at room temperature. Nitrogen was first discovered by the Scottish chemist Rutherford in the late 1700s. The air is mostly made of nitrogen. Nitrogen has properties that are different in some ways from its group members. As we will learn in later lessons, the electron configuration for nitrogen provides the ability to form very strong triple bonds.

Nitrogen and its family members belong in the 15&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; group in the periodic table. In Group 15, there are also only five elements.

What is the general trend for the elements in group 5A? They all have, as the electron configuration in the outermost energy level, ''ns''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''np''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''n'' is the period number. These elements are three groups away from the noble gases and the outermost energy level electron configuration is three away from having a completed outer energy level. In other words, the ''p'' sublevel in the Group 15 elements is half full. Arsenic, for example, has the electron configuration 1''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2''p''&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;3''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;3''p''&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;4''s''23''d''&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;4''p''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; so it is in period 4, the fifth element in the main group elements. We know it is the fifth element across the period of the main group elements because there are 5 electrons in the outermost energy level.

==Lesson Summary==
* Families in the periodic table are the vertical columns and are also referred to as groups.
* Group 1A elements are the alkali metals and all have one electron in the outermost energy level because their electron configuration ends in ''s''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.
* Group 2A elements are the alkaline earth metals and all have two electrons in the outermost energy level because their electron configuration ends in ''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.
* Group 5A elements all have five electrons in the outermost energy level because their electron configuration ends in ''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''p''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.
* Group 6A elements all have six electrons in the outermost energy level because their electron configuration ends in ''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''p''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;.
* Group 7A elements are the halogens and all have seven electrons in the outermost energy level because their electron configuration ends in ''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''p''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;.
* Group 8A elements are the noble gases and all have eight electrons in the outermost energy level because their electron configuration ends in ''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''p''&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;.
* Elements in group 8A have the most stable electron configuration in the outermost shell because the sublevels are completely filled with electrons.

== [[User:CommonsDelinker]] ==

This is not the first time I call attention to the collateral damage this bot does to our project. I propose that the bot needs to be carefully monitored by humans on its &quot;Removing&quot; action. From time to time I get hits on pages I watch and I attempt to fix them if possible but I believe that this should be made more transparent to the rest of the community, remove the bot flag so the edits are visible if we can't filter only the removals. What is the status of the bot in regards to revisions of pages? I would expect that edit reviews to be done by human but I'm not fully aware of how flags interact and if the bot can get automated promotion...&lt;br&gt;
The bot does an indispensable work but I would even prefer to keep red links to deleted images than let it continue to work as it has.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 02:02, 4 September 2011 (UTC)

: When a bot edits a reviewed page, I believe the page is automatically reviewed.  That happens with bots on Wikinews even though we have autoreview turned off.  Wikinews runs CommonsDelinker without the bot flag.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 04:31, 4 September 2011 (UTC)

::That is then a problem with the CommonsDelinker Removing action, it shouldn't be automatically reviewed. I don't have an issue with the other functions of the bot but how it is removing images that are sometimes replaceable is extremely damaging (this should also be an issue with the people at commons, not to delete images that are in use in other Wikimedia projects without making a minimum of effort to find a replacement (even better if the bot could do the &quot;redirect&quot; for them).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 05:25, 4 September 2011 (UTC)
::Note also that this silent removal of &quot;dependencies&quot; of sister projects downgrades the usefulness of the Commons project in itself and preventing the categorization of images by relevancy.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 05:28, 4 September 2011 (UTC)

:::Agreed, and I've raised this before (when it removed the title image used for a Featured Book). However, I didn't think it auto-reviewed pages. If it does, then we should remove the &quot;reviewer&quot; right so that it can't &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 09:22, 4 September 2011 (UTC)

::::The only right it has is &quot;IP Block Exempt&quot;. I've checked the last ten edits to reviewed pages and they were all manually approved by a human reviewer... &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 09:28, 4 September 2011 (UTC)

:::::Indeed.  I removed reviewer from it in May ''2010'' for the reasons above.  For a few weeks the delinker wasn't even working.  That's worse, in that deletions at Commons just leave red links in books that you don't know about.  People should replace removed images with equivalents if possible. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|discuss]]&lt;/small&gt; 19:44, 4 September 2011 (UTC)

::::::I have been attempting to call Commons to act also better on deletions. [[http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons_talk:Deletion_policy#Consider_adding_as_a_requirement... Consider_adding_as_a_requirement...]] by adding as a step, to their deletion process, finding alternatives and fixing images uses. We have locally shown consideration for other projects so I don't see it why they can't reciprocate (We move deleted projects to other locations and probably by using Wikipedia links also contribute to that project evolution).
::::::My proposal still stands, &lt;s&gt;should we remove&lt;/s&gt;  the bot flag should be off (the review is relevant only when there are people active on the affected projects), since our projects tend to be extremely personal and often the topic is not accessible to every one we most of the time will not review outside of our sphere of action, except if the edit value is obvious.
::::::I also don't share Adrignola dislike for red links (I don't love them), since they are themselves informational. It would be wonderful if the CommonsDelinker could be made to act a bit differently.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 03:46, 7 September 2011 (UTC) edited --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 14:45, 7 September 2011 (UTC)

{{outdent|::::::}}

Are you proposing that CommonsDelinker be blocked indefinitely? If not, I fail to see how the proposal still stands. There are no other actions to be taken at Wikibooks. CommonsDelinker does not have the flags (bot, reviewer, autoreviewer) you propose to remove. CommonsDelinker does not auto-review any pages it edits. How CommonsDelinker deals with deleted images is something to be discussed with the bot's developers. Finding a suitable replacement instead of deleting is something to be discussed at Wikimedia Commons. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 14:19, 7 September 2011 (UTC)

:No, as I state above &quot;I propose that the bot needs to be carefully monitored by humans on its &quot;Removing&quot; action&quot; (also to determine if it is problem and define avenues to mitigate the issue). This developed into discussion of the CommonsDelinker access flags (me and others) were not aware of how the flags stood (or any changes made to them), so this also serves to express the community view on how to keep them.
:As for the later avenues you advanced, I already presented a proposal at Commons (addressing the deletion process or even to create a methodology to ease our problem, the lack of people performing corrective actions, that I myself associate with a lack of visibility/impact of the changes), and so I agree that from our side (Wikibooks) there is not much that can be done, but anyone able to participate in finding/creating a solution will benefit from this push to address what is now understood to be a real problem.
:The last solution that I proposed at Commons I'm not certain if it is technologically viable. I asked that since the bot is capable of making substitutions (the mechanics of how it is processed I do not know) if it was possible to use a boilerplate image asking users to find or contribute a substitute. Another avenue would be for the Wikimedia software to report the absence of an image in another way than by a red link.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 14:45, 7 September 2011 (UTC) edited --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 17:15, 7 September 2011 (UTC)
:Or creating a local bot/script to fix the CommonsDelinker removals (by substituting them with a local boilerplate image).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 14:48, 7 September 2011 (UTC)
::The bot is quite capable of making substitutions.  I've done it before when deleting an image that was in use but violated copyright but had equivalents.  It requires the administrator to find a replacement, then order the bot to make a replacement ''prior'' to making the deletion.  Everything the bot does is a direct result of administrator action.  (You may have seen the replacements for exact or scaled-down duplicates).  It is certainly possible that the bot could be set up to swap in a default placeholder when removing a deleted image, if you were to get enough support for that. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|discuss]]&lt;/small&gt; 15:10, 7 September 2011 (UTC)
:::I haven't seen people expressing opinion on what they see is a best method to call people into action. I think a reader will be more prone to it if he notices something missing or out of place (hence the wiki adoption of the red links). This solution could also resolve the issue with the bot access flags (since visibility would be preserved). In any case this seems one of possible solutions, a change of procedures at Commons would majorly reduce the instances that the removal negatively impacts our project, but failing that this seems to be a viable alternative, even a complement. Do you see any negatives ?  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 17:15, 7 September 2011 (UTC)
== Set $wgRestrictDisplayTitle to false ==

The script [[MediaWiki:Common.js/Displaytitle.js]] and the template [[Template:Displaytitle]] use javascript to replace the content of the top heading of a page. Rather than using javascript to change the title, I think it would be better to just set [[mw:Manual:$wgRestrictDisplayTitle|$wgRestrictDisplayTitle]] to &lt;tt&gt;false&lt;/tt&gt; and use DISPLAYTITLE: to have the content there from the start. --[[User:Yair rand|Yair rand]] ([[User talk:Yair rand|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Yair rand|contribs]]) 21:35, 8 August 2011 (UTC)
:Although wgAllowDisplayTitle could be set to false, this is not recommend by the developers, [[mw:Manual:$wgAllowDisplayTitle|as it breaks the wiki convention that a page's title is its name, and thus can be used for linking to it.]].
:For changes in titles such as [[French/Lessons/Introductory/Review]] (done through [{{fullurl:Template:French/Lessons/Header template|action=edit}} this template]), I think it is better to create ([[Special:PrefixIndex/MediaWiki:Perbook/|per book]]?) gadgets for people who want to have non-linkable, but nice, titles. Another option is to add the original title somewhere in the page as is done by [[:pt:MediaWiki:Gadget-Títulos simples.js]] (see [https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikibooks/pt/wiki/Log%C3%ADstica/Gest%C3%A3o_de_armaz%C3%A9ns/Opera%C3%A7%C3%A3o_de_um_armaz%C3%A9m/Miss%C3%B5es_de_um_armaz%C3%A9m?withJS=MediaWiki:Gadget-T%C3%ADtulos_simples.js&amp;uselang=en example]), so that we still have access to the original title for copy+paste. [[:pt:User:Helder.wiki|Helder]] 13:07, 9 August 2011 (UTC)
::PS: The part of the script which process the tab parameter doesn't seems to be working in all skins, e.g. at [{{fullurl:Cookbook:Carrot|useskin=vector}} Cookbook:Carrot?useskin=vector] and [{{fullurl:Cookbook:Carrot|useskin=nostalgia}} Cookbook:Carrot?useskin=nostalgia], so I think it should be either fixed or moved to the JS pages corresponding to the skins where it works ([[MediaWiki:monobook.js]], [[MediaWiki:modern.js]] and maybe some other skin). [[:pt:User:Helder.wiki|Helder]] 13:25, 9 August 2011 (UTC)
::: I've updated it to reflect a change that must of been made to id attribute, so the namespace tab/link should be working again in all skins that have one. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 14:43, 9 August 2011 (UTC)
::::In some skins (at least vector and chick) the first letter of the tabs is in Uppercase while on monobook (and some other?) it is in lowercase. Could you make the tab link to be consistent with the other tabs depending on the skin?
::::PS: It is [[mw:Manual:Coding_conventions#jQuery|good practice]] to prefix with &quot;$&quot; the name of a variable whose value is an instance of jQuery (such as $dt and $what). [[:pt:User:Helder.wiki|Helder]] 15:27, 9 August 2011 (UTC)
::[[Template:Displaytitle]] is already in use. How is allowing DISPLAYTITLE: to modify the title worse than using {{tl|displaytitle}} to modify it through js? --[[User:Yair rand|Yair rand]] ([[User talk:Yair rand|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Yair rand|contribs]]) 03:07, 10 August 2011 (UTC)
:::Will editing of a page still show the real page path if [[mw:Manual:$wgRestrictDisplayTitle|$wgRestrictDisplayTitle]] is set to &lt;tt&gt;false&lt;/tt&gt; ? Will it break any of our extensions ? (a change would require us to inform devs that they shouldn't continue to assume the flag as true) Has any other project altered the flag (Wikisource) ? 
:::I think that the notion that &quot;[[mw:Manual:$wgAllowDisplayTitle|it breaks the wiki convention that a page's title is its name, and thus can be used for linking to it.]]&quot; is important but to a lesser degree in Wikibooks. We often link to books, not to specific book pages, this mostly occurs inside the same book. Since  {{tl|displaytitle}} is available to modify the displayed title (and people are using it actively, I was not the first to see some benefits for Wikibooks specific needs). If the final result is the same I don't see why we shouldn't simplify the process.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 04:06, 10 August 2011 (UTC)
::::Even when displaytitle is restricted, the edit page still shows the real page path regardless of displaytitle (see for example [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=IPod&amp;action=edit]), so it probably also does when $wgRestrictDisplayTitle is set to false. --[[User:Yair rand|Yair rand]] ([[User talk:Yair rand|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Yair rand|contribs]]) 07:32, 10 August 2011 (UTC)
:::::Click that link again; the title is still set to the DISPLAYTITLE version when using built-in code updated in [[Template:Displaytitle]]. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|discuss]]&lt;/small&gt; 15:44, 15 September 2011 (UTC)

:[[File:Symbol support vote.svg|15px|alt=|link=]] '''Support'''. So we can set [[mw:Manual:$wgRestrictDisplayTitle|$wgRestrictDisplayTitle]] is set to &lt;tt&gt;false&lt;/tt&gt;, then to handle existing uses, have {{tl|displaytitle}} use DISPLAYTITLE with a parameter.  Though this would lose the tab name changing functionality, I wouldn't bemoan that and changing the basic interface is probably more objectionable than changing the title.  Changing displayed titles is consistent with pages on the Web that have titles chosen by the page's creator.  {{tl|displaytitle}} does not show the page's real title when editing; see [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Muggles%27_Guide_to_Harry_Potter/Books/Half-Blood_Prince&amp;action=edit].  So if this setting does show the real title, it could be a superior option.  I do like situations like [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince]] showing &quot;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince&quot; and having the tab changed to &quot;Book 6&quot;.  Few books change the tab, but the Cookbook changes it for all ingredients.  But special JavaScript could be used for the Cookbook, with everything else using the built-in function or the transition template.  At minimum it would open up an option for having titles altered without being dependent on JavaScript. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|discuss]]&lt;/small&gt; 14:06, 10 August 2011 (UTC)
: I support not needing JavaScript for features whenever sensible. I think this is one such case. I know {{tlx|displaytitle}} can be made backwards compatible by using the DISPLAYTITLE magic word to change the title while still using JavaScript to change the tab. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 15:50, 10 August 2011 (UTC)

== New Deletion Policy for the Transwiki Namespace ==

I have been considering working up a draft of a change to the [[Wikibooks:Deletion|deletion policy]] as it relates to the Transwiki namespace. There are a number of long ago imported items in the TW namespace that have not been adopted. Some have since been significantly changed (I would argue improved) in their donor projects while not being modified here at all by the original requester. Examples include [[Transwiki:History of homosexual people in Nazi Germany and the Holocaust]], imported from WP in 2006, and [[Transwiki:Guglielmo Marconi]] imported in 2008. I propose that after a period of time with no attempt to adopt transwiki'd content then it should be deleted. This wouldn't apply if the content had been deleted from its donor project of course. The idea is not simply good housekeeping but to avoid editors helping out by completing a TW clean-up of what is actually five year old content that nobody wants. It would be better surely to start again with the latest content should someone want it. I'd welcome your views on the principle before I start investing too much time in policy drafting - thanks &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 18:39, 22 September 2011 (UTC)

:That sounds reasonable to me.  I would support it. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Jomegat|contribs]]) 18:42, 22 September 2011 (UTC)

: I think they should qualify for speedy deletion. &quot;Any transwikied work not adopted after 30 days may be speedy deleted&quot;. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 19:11, 22 September 2011 (UTC)

::Yes, that's what I should have said ;-) At its simplest I would propose this as a new criterion for speedy deletion... &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 20:12, 22 September 2011 (UTC)

: I also agree.  Darklama's rule sounds good to me.  I also have a book in mind that consists entirely of 300 pages of transwikied content that was never edited by the person requesting it, but that may be a different issue. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|discuss]]&lt;/small&gt; 22:33, 22 September 2011 (UTC)

:: OK I understand that it's not good having stuff that was imported several years ago but which has remained untouched every since but why delete it? (waiting for people to attack me with claims that &quot;what harm is it doing&quot; and &quot;are we running out of serve space?&quot; is not allowed) But seriously, if a page/book/whatever is not completely unsuitable for Wikibooks, isn't offensive, isn't nonsense, isn't a copyright violation and isn't a duplication of something else - why delete it?--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Italy.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 23:03, 22 September 2011 (UTC)

: Some time back I suggested redirects from transwiki space, left from moving imports out of it, should be subject to speedy deletion.  Are we interested to do that too?  (Is there some drawback to it I'm not seeing?)

{{recipesummary|Indian recipes|4|50 minutes|4}}
==Ingredients==
'''For marination:'''&lt;br /&gt;

* Whole chicken: skinned and cut into medium sizes, ideally into 6 pieces if using baby chicken
* Ginger paste: 1tb spoon
* Garlic paste: 1tb spoon
* Coriander powder: 1&amp; 1/2 t spoon
* Cumin powder: 1&amp; 1/2 t spoon
* Nutmeg powder (optional): 1/2 tspoon
* Greek yogurt: 1 tb spoon&lt;br /&gt;


'''For frying:'''&lt;br /&gt;

* Onion chopped: 2 medium sized
* Cardamon pods: 6-8
* Clove: 3-5
* Cinnamon stick: 1 medium
* [[Cookbook:Pepper|Black pepper]] crushed: according to taste 
* Ghee or butter: 1 or 2 tb spoon
* Salt: according to taste
* Sugar: 1 tb spoon&lt;br /&gt;


'''To garnish:'''&lt;br /&gt;

* Coconut cream/ crushed coconut: 2 tb spoon
* Single cream: 1/2 cup
* Saffron: 4-6 threads
* Rosewater (optional): few drops
* Toasted flakes of almonds  for decoration (optional): 1 tb spoon

==Procedure==

# Marinate the chicken with all the ingredients and cover the bowel with a cling film, leave in the fridge 1-3 hours
#Fry the onions in ghee /butter until starts to turn brown but still soft. Do not fry to crispiness. Take out the onion with slotted spoon and keep it.
#Add the marinated chicken to the hot ghee and cook in medium heat.
#Dry toast the whole spices on a hot frying pan for 1 minute until they release the aroma
#Add the whole spices to the chicken as well as black paper
#Stir occasionally and cook covered.
#When water starts to separate from chicken add coconut cream, salt and sugar
#Add boiling water if chicken starts to dry up before its cooked
#Warm the single cream in microwave and add saffron to it.
#Add single cream to chicken when almost cooked and stir
#Bring back the fried onions, add optional rose water and almonds and turn down the heat.
==Tips==
* Serve with Warm Pilau rice
* Korma being mild dish can be a good introduction to South Asian cuisines especially for those who like to avoid too spicy or too hot dishes. Slicing onions may irritate eyes. Ethnic ingredient shops often sell fried onion pack.

==A Note==

Hello, I have reverted your edit to [[Computer Programming]] and tagged your copy / paste from Wikipedia in [[Software engineer]] as a copyright violation. At Wikibooks we don't create links between books like this and, if one was needed from Computer Programming it would correctly go to the existing Wikibooks book on [[Software Engineering]] instead. If you think you want to start a new book based on the article you copied, please request an import at [[WB:RFI]] to avoid copyright problems. Otherwise you might like to contribute to the existing book instead. Thanks &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 15:49, 29 September 2011 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You would like to interact with a remote FTP server running remotely directly from your XQuery program. You would like to perform operations such as list, get and put files.

== FTP Module Interfaces ==
The FTP module has the following interfaces:

   '''ftpclient:get-connection'''($host as xs:string, $username as xs:string, $password as xs:string) xs:long?
   '''ftpclient:list'''($connection-handle as xs:long, $remote-directory as xs:string) document-node()?
   '''ftpclient:get-binary-file'''($connection-handle as xs:long, $remote-directory as xs:string, $file-name as xs:string) xs:base64Binary?
   '''ftpclient:send-binary-file'''($connection-handle as xs:long, $remote-directory as xs:string, $file-name as xs:string, $data as xs:base64Binary) xs:boolean

== Sample Usage ==
In this example we will open a connection to a remote FTP server, login and list the files.

In the last section, we determined that the members of the chemical families (vertical columns on the periodic table) all have the same electron configuration in their outermost energy levels. In the next section, we will review the orbital representation for electron configuration and the electron configuration code. Then we will learn a shortcut for writing electron configuration codes.

==Lesson Objectives==
* Convert from orbital representation diagrams to electron configuration codes.
* Distinguish between outer energy level (valence) electrons and core electrons.
* Use the shortcut method for writing electron configuration codes for atoms and ions.

==Shortcut for Writing Electron Configurations==
The diagram below represents the '''orbital representation diagram''' used in earlier chapters. The orbital representation diagram has a few different variations but all are used to draw electron configurations. Most show the orbitals in groups, as lines, boxes, or circles with each orbital having its own line (or circle) within each sublevel.

:[[File:Orbital representation diagram.svg|550px]]

The sublevel 2''p'' has 3 orbitals (2''p''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;, 2''p''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;, and 2''p''&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;/sub&gt;) and each of these orbitals has its own line (or box).

:[[File:2p orbital box.svg|300px]]

Let's begin this section with the orbital box (or the orbital representation diagram) for a neutral atom. Draw the electronic configuration for potassium using the electron configuration diagram below. Remember that potassium is element number 19 so has 19 electrons. Every line in the energy diagram below holds 2 electrons of opposite spins.

:[[File:Orbital representation diagram potassium.svg|550px]]

Now we can simplify this by excluding all of the levels and sublevels that are not in use or do not hold electrons.

:[[File:Orbital representation diagram potassium - small.svg|200px]]

Writing the electron configuration code for potassium, we would get:
:&lt;math&gt;\text{K}&lt;/math&gt;: &lt;math&gt;1s^22s^22p^63s^23p^64s^1&lt;/math&gt;

Remember, the noble gases are the elements that are nearly non-reactive, partially due to the fact that the outermost energy level electron configuration was full (''ns''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''np''&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;). Look at potassium on the Periodic Table and then find the preceding noble gas. Drag your finger counting backward from potassium to the nearest noble gas. What do you get? Argon (Ar) is correct. Now, let's draw the electron configuration for argon and place the electron configuration for potassium beside it.

{{multiple image
| align     = center
| direction = horizontal
| width     = 200
| image1    = Electron configuration argon.svg
| alt1      = Electron configuration for argon
| caption1  = Electron configuration for argon
| image2    = Electron configuration potassium.svg
| alt2      = Electron configuration for potassium
| caption2  = Electron configuration for potassium
}}

What do you notice looking at the two diagrams? Potassium has the same electron configuration as an argon +1 electron. We can make this point when we write electronic configuration codes.
:{|
|&lt;math&gt;\text{K}&lt;/math&gt;:||&lt;math&gt;1s^22s^22p^63s^23p^64s^1&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\text{Ar}&lt;/math&gt;:||&lt;math&gt;1s^22s^22p^63s^23p^6&lt;/math&gt;
|}

Therefore, 
:&lt;math&gt;\text{K}&lt;/math&gt;: &lt;math&gt;[\text{Ar}]4s^1&lt;/math&gt; (This is known as the noble gas configuration code system or the &quot;short-cut&quot;)

Let's try another. Draw and write the electron configuration of gallium (Ga). Gallium is number 31 and therefore has 31 electrons. It is also in the 4&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; period, the third element in the period of main group elements. From this information, we know that the outermost electrons will be 4''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;4''p''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

Writing the electron configuration code for gallium, we get  1''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2''p''&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;3''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;3''p''&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;4''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;3''d''&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;4''p''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;. In numerical order, the electronic configuration for gallium is 1''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2''p''&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;3''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;3''p''&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;3''d''&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;4''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;4''p''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

:[[File:Electron configuration gallium.svg|350px|Electron configuration for gallium (Ga)]]

Now, go back to the previous noble gas. Again, we find the previous noble gas is argon. Remember argon has electronic configuration of 1''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2''p''&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;3''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;3''p''&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;.

:{|
|&lt;math&gt;\text{Ga}&lt;/math&gt;:||&lt;math&gt;1s^22s^22p^63s^23p^64s^23d^{10}4p^1&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\text{Ar}&lt;/math&gt;:||&lt;math&gt;1s^22s^22p^63s^23p^6&lt;/math&gt;
|}

Therefore, 
:&lt;math&gt;\text{Ga}&lt;/math&gt;: &lt;math&gt;[\text{Ar}]4s^23d^{10}4p^1&lt;/math&gt;

This seems to work well for neutral atoms, what about ions? Remember that a ''cation'' is formed when electrons are removed from a neutral atom and an ''anion'' is formed when electrons are added to a neutral atom. But where do the electrons get added to or removed from? The electrons that are involved in chemical reactions are the ones that are in the outer shell. Therefore, if electrons are to be removed or added, they get removed from or added to the shell with the highest value of ''n''.

Let's now look at an example. Draw the electron configuration for Fe. Then, write the reaction for the formation of Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;.

:[[File:Electron configuration iron.svg|350px|Electron configuration for iron (Fe)]]

The reaction for the formation of the Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ion is: Fe → Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; + 2''e''&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;. Therefore we have to remove 2 electrons. From where do we remove the two electrons? The rule is to remove from the highest ''n'' value first which, in this case, means we remove from the electrons from the 4''s'' sublevel first.

:{|
|style=&quot;text-align:right;&quot;|&lt;math&gt;\text{Fe}&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;Fe^{2+} + 2e^-&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|&lt;math&gt;1s^22s^22p^63s^23p^64s^23d^6&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;1s^22s^22p^63s^23p^63d^6 + 2e^-&lt;/math&gt;
|}

Remember that when we write electron configuration codes using noble gas configurations we use the previous noble gas. In writing the electron configuration code for Fe or Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, we would use the symbol [Ar] to substitute for 1''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2''p''&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;3''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;3''p''&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;.

:{|
|style=&quot;text-align:right;&quot;|&lt;math&gt;\text{Fe}&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;Fe^{2+} + 2e^-&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|&lt;math&gt;[\text{Ar}]3d^64s^2&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;[\text{Ar}]3d^6 + 2e^-&lt;/math&gt;
|}

In addition to forming Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions, iron atoms are also capable of forming Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ions. Extra stability is gained by electron configurations that have exactly half-filled ''d'' orbitals. The third electron that is removed from an iron atom to form the Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ion is removed from the ''d'' orbital giving this iron ion a ''d'' orbital that is exactly half-filled. The extra stability of this configuration explains why iron can form two different ions.

:{|
|style=&quot;text-align:right;&quot;|&lt;math&gt;\text{Fe}&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;Fe^{3+} + 3e^-&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|&lt;math&gt;[\text{Ar}]3d^64s^2&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;[\text{Ar}]3d^5 + 3e^-&lt;/math&gt;
|}

Now what about negative ions, the anions? Remember that negative ions are formed by the addition of electrons to the electron cloud. Look at bromine, Br. Neutral bromine has atomic number 35 and therefore, holds 35 electrons.

:[[File:Electron configuration bromine.svg|350px|Electron configuration for bromine (Br)]]

The reaction for the formation of the Br&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; ion is: Br + e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → Br&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;. The bromide ion is formed by the addition of one electron. If you look at the electron configuration for bromine, you will notice that the 4''p'' sublevel needs one more electron to fill the sublevel and if this sublevel is filled, the electron configuration for Br&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; is the same as that of the noble gas krypton (Kr). When adding electrons to form negative ions, the electrons are added to the lowest unfilled ''n'' value.

:{|
|style=&quot;text-align:right;&quot;|&lt;math&gt;\text{Br} + e^-&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;Br^-&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|&lt;math&gt;1s^22s^22p^63s^23p^64s^23d^{10}4p^5 + e^-&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;1s^22s^22p^63s^23p^64s^23d^{10}4p^6&lt;/math&gt;
|}

or

:{|
|style=&quot;text-align:right;&quot;|&lt;math&gt;\text{Br} + e^-&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;Br^-&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|&lt;math&gt;1s^22s^22p^63s^23p^64s^23d^{10}4p^5 + e^-&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;[\text{Kr}]&lt;/math&gt;
|}

Notice how Br&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; has the same electron configuration as Kr. When this happens, the two are said to be '''isoelectronic'''.

==Core Electrons==
When we look at the electron configuration for any element we can distinguish that there are two different types of electrons. There are electrons that work to do the reacting and there are those that don't. The outer shell electrons are the '''valence electrons''' and these are the electrons that are responsible for the reactions that the atoms undergo. The number of valence electrons increases as you move across the periodic table for the main group elements.

In older periodic tables, the groups were numbered using an A and B group numbering system. The representative groups (''s'' and ''p'' blocks) were numbered with A and the transition elements were numbered with B. The table below has both numbering systems. The A numbering is shown for you in the diagram in red; this is all we will be concerned with for this lesson. The number of valence electrons in the A groups increases as the group number increases. In fact, the number of the A groups is the number of valence electrons. Therefore, if an element is in group 3A, it has 3 valence electrons, if it is in group 5A, it has 5 valence electrons.

:[[File:IUPAC - CAS comparison.svg|500px]]

All electrons other than valence electrons are called '''core electrons'''. These electrons are in inner energy levels. It would take a very large amount of energy to pull an electron away from these full shells, hence, they do not normally take part in any reactions. Look at the electron configuration for gallium (Ga). It has 3 valence electrons and 28 core electrons.

:[[File:Electron configuration gallium.svg|350px|Electron configuration for gallium (Ga)]]
{{High School Chemistry/Example|Sample Question}}
How many core electrons and valence electrons are in each of the following?
: (a) V
: (b) As
: (c) Po
: (d) Xe
----
'''Solution''':
: (a) &lt;sub&gt;23&lt;/sub&gt;V core electrons = 18, valence electrons = 5
: (b) &lt;sub&gt;33&lt;/sub&gt;As: core electrons = 28, valence electrons = 5
: (c) &lt;sub&gt;84&lt;/sub&gt;Po: core electrons = 78, valence electrons = 6
: (d) &lt;sub&gt;54&lt;/sub&gt;Xe: core electrons = 46, valence electrons = 8

==Lesson Summary==
* An orbital box diagram can be used to draw electron configurations for elements.
* The noble gas configuration system is the shorthand method for representing the electron configuration of an element.
* The noble gas symbol represents all of, or most of, the core electrons.
* For cations, the electrons are removed from the outermost sublevel having the greatest ''n'' value.
* For anions, the electrons are added to the unfilled energy level having the lowest ''n'' value.
* Isoelectronic species have the same electron configurations.
* Using an orbital box diagram, the core electrons and the valence electrons can easily be visualized.
* The valence electrons are those electrons that are in the outermost shell.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== combination ==

Early text data compression techniques were divided into two very different-seeming approaches:
* fixed-to-variable decompressors that decompress fixed-size &quot;references&quot; into plaintext strings of varying length (Ziv and Lempel), and
* variable-to-fixed decompressors that decompress variable-length &quot;prefix codes&quot; or &quot;arithmetic codes&quot; into plaintext strings of some fixed length (Markov).
Researchers are searching for some way to combine them,
to get the benefits of both.
&lt;ref name=&quot;lzrw4&quot; &gt;
[http://www.ross.net/compression/download/original/old_lzrw4.txt ]
&quot;LZRW4: Ziv and Lempel meet Markov&quot;
by Ross Williams. 23-Jul-1991.
&lt;/ref&gt;

A typical paragraph of text has several different kinds of patterns.
Some archive software applies a series of different transformations,
each transformation targeting a different kind of pattern in the text.

Such a transformation is often based on
some kind of [[../Models/ | model]]
of how the file was produced.

Compression software (especially image compression software)
often sends the raw data through
one or more stages of decorrelation --
such as Karhunen–Loève transform&lt;ref name=&quot;reversible&quot; &gt;
Henrique S. Malvar, Gary J. Sullivan, and Sridhar Srinivasan.
[http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/102040/2008_colortransforms_malvarsullivansrinivasan.pdf &quot;Lifting-based reversible color transformations for image compression&quot;].
&quot;the Karhunen-Loève transform... provides maximum decorrelation.&quot;
&lt;/ref&gt;,
color space transformation,
linear filtering, DFT, transform coding,
etc. --
the &quot;precompressor&quot; stages --
before feeding the result into an entropy compressor.

Many transforms used in compression, counter-intuitively, produce an intermediate result that requires more bits of dynamic range to store.
Transforming raw 24-bit RGB pixels into 26-bit YCoCg-R pixels&lt;ref name=&quot;reversible&quot; /&gt;
or transforming raw 16-bit audio samples into 17-bit delta coded differences
may seem to &quot;waste&quot; bits,
but it improves net compression performance:
In many cases, the entropy compressor gives smaller compressed file sizes
when given such &quot;de-correlated&quot; intermediate data than when given the original raw data.
(The improvement in results resulting from such transformations is often called &quot;coding gain&quot;).

=== color transforms ===

The JPEG 2000 Reversible Color Transform (RCT) is a YUV-like color space that does not introduce quantization errors, so it is fully reversible.

The compressor converts RGB to YCbCr with:
:&lt;math&gt;
Y = \left\lfloor \frac{R+2G+B}{4} \right\rfloor ;
C_B = B - G ;
C_R = R - G ; 
&lt;/math&gt;
and then compresses the image.

The decompressor decompresses the image, then takes YCbCr pixels and restores the original RGB image with:
:&lt;math&gt;
G = Y - \left\lfloor \frac{C_b + C_r}{4} \right\rfloor ;
R = C_R + G ;
B = C_B + G.
&lt;/math&gt;

A pixel in the JPEG 2000 YCbCr format requires 26 bits to represent losslessly.

The Red, Green, and Blue layers of an image are typically highly correlated.
So compressing the R, G, and B layers independently
ends up storing much of the same data 3 times.

Even though &quot;decorrelating&quot; a 24-bit-per-pixel RGB image into a YCbCr requires *more* bits (26 bits) to hold each pixel,
decorrelating helps later stages in the compression pipeline do a better job.
So independently compressing the Y, Cb, and Cr planes
usually results in a smaller compressed file than independently compressing the R, G, and B layers of the same file.

Most (but not all!) lossless color space transforms, including the JPEG 2000 RCT, are &quot;expanding&quot;.
&quot;Expanding&quot; color space transforms convert 24 bit RGB pixels to intermediate YCbCr pixels that require *more* than 24 bits to represent losslessly.

A few lossless color space transforms are non-expanding.
&quot;Non-expanding&quot; color space transforms convert 24 bit RGB pixels to intermediate YCoCg24 pixels that require the same 24 bits to represent losslessly.

All color space transforms that convert 24 bit RGB pixels to something less than 24 bits per pixel are lossy. (Do I need to spell out why?).

==== speech ====
Speech compression often uses a relatively simple model of the human voice.
The glottis produces a buzz at some frequency.
The vocal tract resonates or dampens that frequency and its harmonics.
The tongue and lips occasional producing hissing sibilants and popping plosive sounds.
{{wikipedia | linear predictive coding }}
A fairly intelligible speech sound can be reconstructed at low bit rate,
by updating a linear predictive coding model at 30 to 50 frames per second.

There are several ways to represent the linear predictive filter coefficients.

While in principle the linear predictive filter coefficients could be transmitted directly, typically the system is set up so (after entropy decoding) the received bits represent reflection coefficients,&lt;ref&gt;

=== DEFLATE ===

DEFLATE combines LZ77 with Huffman encoding.
It is specified in RFC 1951.

It is extremely widely used to decode ZIP files and gzip files and PNG image files.

==== zlib ====

The &quot;zlib compressed data format specification&quot; is a standardized way of packaging compressed data in a file, with a simple header that indicates the type of compression and helps detect the most common kinds of data corruption.
It is often used to store data compressed with DEFLATE with a window size up to 32K.

The &quot;zlib compressed data format specification&quot; is specified in RFC 1950.

=== LZX ===

The LZX file format and compression algorithm was invented by Jonathan Forbes and Tomi Poutanen.
LZX is used in a popular stand-alone AMIGA file archiver.
Microsoft Compressed HTML Help (CHM) files use LZX compression.
Windows Imaging Format (&quot;.WIM&quot;) files support several data compression methods, including LZX.
Xbox Live Avatars use LZX compression.

LZX uses both LZ77-style sliding window compression and dynamic Huffman codes, somewhat like DEFLATE uses both.
The LZ77-style window size (WINDOW_SIZE) is some power-of-two, at least 2^15 and at most 2^21.
LZX uses several Huffman tree structures, each of them canonical.

The most important Huffman tree in LZX is the &quot;main tree&quot;,
composed of 256 elements corresponding to all possible ASCII characters,
plus 8*NUM_POSITION_SLOTS elements corresponding to matches.
(The NUM_POSITION_SLOTS is in the range of 30 slots to 50 slots).
The second most important Huffman tree in LZX is the &quot;length tree&quot;,
composed of 249 elements.
Other trees have smaller roles.

The LZX compressor arbitrarily divides up a file into one or more blocks.
Each block is one of 3 types: &quot;verbatim block&quot;, &quot;aligned offset block&quot;, &quot;uncompressed block&quot;.
The &quot;uncompressed block&quot; has a few more things in the header, and then a literal copy of the uncompressed data.

In the data portion of the &quot;verbatim block&quot; and &quot;aligned offset block&quot; blocks, LZX uses length-limited Huffman codewords; LZX limits each codeword to at most 16 bits wide.
Each &quot;verbatim block&quot; and &quot;aligned offset block&quot; has a larger header that gives the information (in a very compact differentially-compressed form) required for the decoder to regenerate the various Huffman trees used in that block.

The header is decoded to get the codeword length for each symbol, has a length of 0 to 16 bits (inclusive), where &quot;0 bits&quot; indicates the corresponding symbol never occurs in this block, and &quot;16 bits&quot; are used for symbols that occur extremely rarely.
A variety of techniques are used to compress the header into relatively few bits.

When the &quot;distance&quot; value is decoded, there are several special values.
It happens quite often that two long phrases of English text are *almost* identical, but there is a small typo or substitution in the middle of the otherwise-identical long phrase.
With the original LZ77, the result is 3 copy items: [long distance X to first part, length of first part], [distance Y to the insertion, length of insertion], [exactly the same long distance X to start of second part, length of second part].
LZX, rather than repeat exactly the same long distance X twice, uses a special &quot;distance&quot; value to indicate that we are &quot;continuing&quot; to copy a previous block after making a substitution in the middle. (The special distance value ends up occupying fewer bits than the full long distance).

* &quot;distance&quot; == 0: &quot;repeat the most recent match distance, which was not itself a repeated distance&quot;
* &quot;distance&quot; == 1: &quot;repeat the second-most-recent match distance, which was not itself a repeated distance&quot;
* &quot;distance&quot; == 2: &quot;repeat the third-most-recent match distance, which was not itself a repeated distance&quot;
* distance == 3: copy starting from 1 byte back, the most-recently-decoded byte (pseudo-RLE on bytes), the closest allowable.
* distance == 4: copy starting from 2 bytes back, the next-most-recently-decoded byte (pseudo-RLE on byte pairs)
* distance == 5: copy starting from 3 bytes back
* distance == 6: copy starting from 4 bytes back
* ...
* distance == 1000: copy starting from 998 bytes back
* ...
* distance = x+2: copy starting from x bytes back
* ...
* distance == WINDOW_SIZE-1 (all bits high): copy starting from WINDOW_SIZE-3 bytes back, the most distant copy possible.

After the decompressor uses the block header to set up all the trees, the decompressor's main loop in a verbatim block is:

* Read a codeword from the compressed text using the main tree and decode it into a &quot;main element&quot;.
* If the &quot;main element&quot; is less than 256, emit the &quot;main element&quot; as a literal plaintext byte.
* If the &quot;main element&quot; is 256 or more, we're going to have a copy item.
** Break the &quot;main element - 256&quot; into two parts: a &quot;slot&quot; and a 3 bit &quot;length&quot;.
** If the &quot;length&quot; is the special all-ones value &quot;7&quot;, read another codeword from the compressed text using the &quot;length tree&quot; and decode it into a &quot;long length&quot;; add that to the 7 already in the length.
** If the &quot;slot&quot; is in the range 0..3, then set the distance the same as the slot.
** If the &quot;slot&quot; is in the range 4..37, then extra = ((slot &gt;&gt; 1) - 1) more bits are needed to get the exact distance.
*** read those extra raw &quot;footer&quot; bits from the compressed text, (not using any Huffman tree, just the raw bits). The distance is (in binary) an implied 1 bit, followed by the (slot &amp; 1) bit, followed by the extra raw footer bits.
** If the distance is 0..2, it indicates a &quot;repeated distance&quot; (as described above) -- replace it with the actual distance we used before.
** Do a normal LZ77-style copy from the previously decoded plaintext: copy from a distance (as described above) a total of &quot;length + 2&quot; bytes into the decoded plaintext.
* repeat until we've decoded the total number of bytes that the header says the uncompressed plaintext should contain.

After the decompressor uses the block header to set up all the trees, the decompressor's main loop in an aligned block is:

* Read a codeword from the compressed text using the main tree and decode it into a &quot;main element&quot;.
* If the &quot;main element&quot; is less than 256, emit the &quot;main element&quot; as a literal plaintext byte.
* If the &quot;main element&quot; is 256 or more, we're going to have a copy item.
** Break the &quot;main element - 256&quot; into two parts: a &quot;slot&quot; and a 3 bit &quot;length&quot;.
** If the &quot;length&quot; is the special all-ones value &quot;7&quot;, read another codeword from the compressed text using the &quot;length tree&quot; and decode it into a &quot;long length&quot;; add that to the 7 already in the length.
** If the &quot;slot&quot; is in the range 0..3, then set the distance the same as the slot.
** If the &quot;slot&quot; is in the range 4..37, then extra = ((slot &gt;&gt; 1) - 1) more bits are needed to get the exact distance.
*** if extra &gt; 3, read (extra - 3) raw &quot;footer&quot; bits from the compressed text, (not using any Huffman tree, just the raw bits). Then read another codeword from the compressed text using the &quot;aligned tree&quot; and decode it to 3 bits (0 to 7). The distance is (in binary) an implied 1 bit, followed by the (slot &amp; 1) bit, followed by the (extra - 3) raw footer bits, followed by the 3 aligned bits.
*** if extra = 3, read another codeword from the compressed text using the &quot;aligned tree&quot; and decode it to 3 aligned bits (0 to 7). The distance is (in binary) an implied 1 bit, followed by the (slot &amp; 1) bit, followed by the 3 aligned bits.
*** if extra is 1 or 2 bits, read those extra raw &quot;footer&quot; bits from the compressed text, (not using any Huffman tree, just the raw bits). The distance is (in binary) an implied 1 bit, followed by the (slot &amp; 1) bit, followed by the extra raw footer bits.
** If the distance is 0..2, it indicates a &quot;repeated distance&quot; (as described above) -- replace it with the actual distance we used before.
** Do a normal LZ77-style copy from the previously decoded plaintext: copy from a distance (as described above) a total of &quot;length + 2&quot; bytes into the decoded plaintext. (The minimum copy length is 2 bytes).
* repeat until we've decoded the total number of bytes that the header says the uncompressed plaintext should contain.

The Microsoft &quot;cabinet&quot; (&quot;.CAB&quot;) compressed archive file format
supports 3 data compression methods:
DEFLATE, LZX, and Quantum compression.
The compressor that puts executable files into a &quot;.CAB&quot; archive may optionally
&quot;detect &quot;CALL&quot; instructions, converting their operands from relative addressing to absolute addressing, thus calls to the same location resulted in repeated strings that the compressor could match, improving compression of 80x86 binary code.&quot;
The &quot;.CAB&quot; decompressor, after doing LZX decompression described above, and if the &quot;preprocessing&quot; bit in the header was set to one, must convert those operands back to relative addressing.
We will discuss such preprocessor/decorrelators in general, and
[[../Executable Compression/]] specifically, in more detail in a later chapter.
{{TODO| Is this CALL-filter preprocessor used for all executable files in a cabinet, or just LZX-compressed files? }}

&lt;/ref&gt;

=== LZX DELTA ===

LZX DELTA (LZXD) is a variation of LZX modified to support efficient delta compression (patching).

A LZX DELTA decompressor takes the old version of some plaintext file (this must be exactly the same as the old version used by the compressor) and the LZXD-compressed patch file,
and uses them to generate the new version of that plaintext file.

The main difference between LZXD and LZX is that the window is pre-loaded with the reference file,
with the decompressor decoding the first byte of the output file into the window at the location immediately after the last byte of the reference file.
Normal LZX copy items have a distance that is at most the full distance back to the first byte of the output file; LZXD allows a distance that reaches much further back to allow copies from the reference file.

LZXD supports many more &quot;slots&quot;, up to 290 slots, which are encoded into the main tree.
This allows LZXD copy items to grab things much further into the past, allowing it to take advantage of very long reference files.

LZXD also supports much larger &quot;length&quot; values. Much as LZX has a &quot;short length&quot; of 0 to 7, where &quot;7&quot; is used as an escape for to get a &quot;long length&quot; from 7 to 255, LZXD uses the same &quot;short length&quot; and &quot;long length&quot; and goes one step further, using a long length of &quot;257&quot; as an escape for an &quot;extra-long length&quot; that can copy 32 KByte in a single copy.

=== LZARI ===
LZARI uses LZSS pre-processor followed by arithmetic encoding.
LZARI was developed by Haruhiko Okumura.

=== LZH ===
LZH uses LZSS pre-processor followed by Huffman coding.
LZH was developed by Haruyasu Yoshizaki for the LHA archiver, based on LZARI.

=== LZMA ===
The Lempel–Ziv–Markov chain algorithm ([[w:LZMA]])
uses a LZ77-like compression algorithm,
whose output is encoded with range coding.

LZMA is one of the compression methods used in the open-source 7-Zip file archiver.

The LZ77-like compression part of LZMA has many similarities with the corresponding LZ77-like compression part of LZX.
LZMA does not use Huffman codes -- instead, it uses context-coded binary arithmetic codes.

=== LZHAM ===
LZHAM (LZ, Huffman, Arithmetic, Markov) is a general purpose lossless data compression library.&lt;ref&gt;

== implementation tips ==

Many compressed file formats must be decompressed using an entropy decoder,
followed by a whole series of transformations -- a kind of [[Wikipedia: Pipeline (software)]].

There are 4 ways to implement such decompressors (and the corresponding compressors):


* Multi-pass compression: each inner transformation reads all the input from some temporary file, and writes all its output to some temporary file, before the next stage starts.
* Run every stage more-or-less simultaneously
** Use co-routines or threads or processes or Unix pipes. Alas, these techniques are not supported in many embedded system environments.
** Use decompression functions that call &quot;down&quot; to fetch more data. The outer application directly calls only the final transformation stage, which calls some intermediate transformation stage, which calls some other intermediate transformation stage, which calls the entropy decoder at the beginning of the pipeline, which calls the routine that fetches bytes from the file. The outer application repeatedly calls that final transformation stage until all the data is processed.
** Use decompression functions that return &quot;up&quot; to fetch more data. The outer application directly calls each stage in turn. Each stage reads data from its input buffer, updates its internal state, and writes data to its output buffer. That output buffer is the input buffer of the next stage. The outer application repeatedly cycles through all the stages until all the data is processed.

Converting software from a &quot;call down to fetch more data&quot; API to a &quot;return up to fetch more data&quot; API is difficult.&lt;ref name=&quot;mcfadden&quot; &gt;

== encryption ==

Because encrypt-then-compress doesn't make the file any smaller, many people do compress-then-encrypt.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Some researchers test encryption algorithms by trying to compress the encrypted data.
If compression produces a compressed output file that is smaller than the encrypted input file,
that tells the researcher that there is a flaw in the encryption software --
either a bug in the implementation,
or it's a correct implementation of an insecure algorithm.

== implementation tips ==

Some people using lossless compression prefer to use &quot;idempotent&quot; ''(Is there a better term for this?)'' compression software, even if it takes a little longer to compress.&lt;ref&gt;
[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/pam/+bug/871083 &quot;gzip -9n sometimes generates a different output file on different architectures&quot;]
&lt;/ref&gt;
In other words, they expect that when you compress a file with &quot;maximum compression&quot; (often &quot;-9n&quot;) to create one compressed file, then uncompress it, then re-compress it, they expect the resulting second compressed file is identical to the first compressed file.

This generally requires that each and every transformation implementation (at least when passed the &quot;-9n&quot; option) is idempotent.
Some things that are not idempotent (and so should be avoided, at least when passed the &quot;-9n&quot; option) are:
* Some compressors store the original filename and timestamp of the uncompressed file in the compressed file. To be idempotent, either the compressor must leave out the name and timestamp (that's what the &quot;-n&quot; typically does) or else the decompressor must restore the original name and timestamp.
* color transforms (if any) should be reversible (lossless)&lt;ref name=&quot;reversible&quot; /&gt;
* For any given implementation of a decompression algorithm, there are almost always many different ways for a compressor to represent the original file -- there are many compressed files that will produce identically the same output file. (The exception is &quot;bijective compression&quot;). When attempting to gain &quot;maximum compression&quot;, we select the way(s) that are the shortest -- but even then there are usually several ways that will give the same compressed filesize. To be idempotent, the implementation of the compressor must always pick the same way.

== some information theory terminology ==
(FIXME: replace &quot;idempotent&quot; above with &quot;non-drifting lossy&quot;, as defined below? Or is there an even better term?)

Some information theory people&lt;ref&gt;
https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/comp.compression/r96nB43uuLs
&lt;/ref&gt;
classify transformations into 4 categories of loss:
* bijective (ED = 1 and DE = 1)
* idempotent (lossless but not bijective: ED = 1 but DE !=1). Nearly all compression algorithms designed for text or executable code are in this category.
* non-drifting lossy (EDE = E). Most lossy compression algorithms designed for audio and video and still images are in this category. Quantization is a non-drifting lossy transform. Starting from an initial image I0, the first encode/decode cycle gives you a slightly different image I1 (hopefully different only in ways normal humans are unlikely to notice). Starting from I1 and encode/decode to produce I2, then encode/decode I2 to produce I3 doesn't give any more loss: I1 == I2 == I3 == I4 ...
* The general case: degrading. Every encode/decode cycle generally produces a slightly different image (such as a series of FAX transmissions or a multi-generational copy using physical paper copy machines).


Some transforms are known not to completely remove all redundancy.
In particular,
researchers have designed special LZ77 encoders and LZW encoders
that encode extra &quot;redundant bits&quot; in the choice of which copy was selected,
in a way that is backwards-compatible:
Standard LZ77 or LZW decoders can extract the original file.
Special LZ77 or LZW decoders can extract the original file plus these extra &quot;redundant bits&quot;.
These extra bits can be used for Reed-Solomon or other forms of error correction,
or to store metadata about the original file such as a public signature or message authentication code.&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Summary==

Crossrail is a large rail transit project in Central and Greater London that stems from decades of proposals, numerous bills submitted to Parliament, and close to £16 billion by its scheduled opening in 2018. It serves as a significant East-West connection of Central London, a missing element of heavy rail transit in the city stemming from policies in the 19th century that forbade rail lines from entering the core of the 5 boroughs of Central London.

== Narrative ==

As the largest metropolitan area in the United Kingdom and the capital city of England, London experiences a great deal of traffic entering and leaving the city on a daily basis.  It is estimated that greater London has an official population of nearly 8 million people although the number of people entering London often times is closer to 14 million people.  London has the most international visitors of any city in the world which consists of mainly tourists who come to visit the city which is incredibly rich in history.  This has led to the development of an extensive transportation network which includes modes such as above and underground rail networks, transit, light rail, tram lines and boats that run along the Thames River.  It is estimated that because of the options available for travel, almost 1/3 of London residents do not own a car.&lt;ref name=&quot;Travel&quot;&gt;London travel guide - Wikivoyage. http://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/London (accessed September 25, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;  London is looking to keep up with the transportation demands of both residents and tourists and is considering building a major new railway link under Central London.  This new project aims to eliminate some of the congestion in the city and tie a lot of the existing rail and transportation networks together to develop a more expansive transportation system which implements greater ease of travel for people wanting to experience all London has to offer.

=== History of Transit in London ===

The invention of the steam train and its railway forever changed the layout of London.  From about 1830 to 1930, London was the world’s largest city so naturally, congestion and overcrowding was a constant issue.  The first railway line opened in 1836 and connected Spa Road in Bermondsey and Deptford.&lt;ref name=&quot;RailAge&quot;&gt;The Railway Age - History of London. http://www.history.co.uk/explore-history/history-of-london/the-railway-age.html (accessed September 25, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; The trains ran along 4 miles and could take a passenger to Greenwich in just under 12 minutes.  This was at least half the time it would take by either omnibus or riverboat.  As people realized the ease of travel by rail, more and more lines were being developed.  However, to build a new railway in London, a lot of the existing buildings had to be removed to make room for the new lines.  Before a new railway was built, it needed approval and at the time, it was much easier to get approval for lines that ran through the poorer areas of the town.  Seeing as the property was much cheaper south of the Thames River, the London Bridge was chosen as the terminus for the lines and more lines were built south of the river.  Eventually, people were evicted from the more affluent parts north of the river to make way for more rail lines.  More than 20 new lines opened in the 1840s and in 1843, there were 8 different routes connecting London to Paris via rail lines.  The growth of the railways is what transformed London from a residential city to the commercial center it is now.  The railways allowed people to travel farther to and from work and as such created much greater congestion in the city.  This was eventually alleviated when the London Underground system was constructed.&lt;ref&gt;King, John.

=== London Underground ===

With the addition of more railway in London, congestion became a growing concern.  People were taking the rail system into London to get to work and then completing their journey by road once they got to the center of the city.  This is when the idea came about to build an underground railway system to link the City of London with the mainline terminals.  The Tube, as it is now referred to by the people of London, was first created in 1863.&lt;ref name=&quot;Williams&quot;&gt;Williams, Hywel. Underground History. http://underground-history.co.uk/front.php (accessed September 24, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;  This rapid transit system is the oldest underground railway in the world and serves 270 stations.  The London Underground stretches almost 250 miles, making it the second largest metro station in the world only to the Shanghai Metro system.&lt;ref name=&quot;Williams&quot; /&gt;  It is estimated that close to 3 million riders use The Underground on a daily basis.  
      
=== London Overground ===

The London Overground transports riders above ground around London via 54 miles of rail service and travels through 20 of London’s 33 boroughs.  The Overground Network was developed as a brand to bring together all the National Rail services which were being operated by many different companies.  This system was taken over in 2007 by the Transport for London and improvements were made including more accessibility, more reliable services, new trains and extended and new lines being implemented.&lt;ref name=&quot;TfL&quot;&gt;London, Transport for. London Overground. http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110928002749/http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/projectsandschemes/15359.aspx (accessed September 24, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;  To date, there is an estimated ridership of close to 200,000 people per day on the Overground system.&lt;ref name=&quot;Overground&quot;&gt;London Overground. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Overground (accessed September 24, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;  The goal is to have all the improvements in place and complete by the start of the 2012 Olympics which are set to take place in London.   

===Privatization of the British Rail System===

In the 1980s, industries such as telecommunications, electricity and gas supply, water supply and sewage services were being privatized.  At the end of 1990, John Major replaced Margaret Thatcher as the Prime Minister.  With a changing administration came changing ideas.  In the 1992 general election, John Major and his conservative party vowed to privatize the railways but were not specific on how they would do so.  Soon after his election came the Railways Bill which was published in 1993.  The bill laid out how British Rail was to be broken up into more than 100 separate businesses with most relationships between the successor companies established by contracts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Private&quot;&gt;Privatisation of British Rail. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privatisation_of_British_Rail (accessed September 25, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; In most cases, the privatization of British Rail is not seen in a favorable light.  The intention of privatization was to improve customer service, and to allow private borrowing to fund investment and remove the short–term constraints of the Treasury budgeting from the railways.&lt;ref name=&quot;Martin&quot;&gt;Martin, Brendan. &quot;British Rail Privatisation: What Went Wrong?&quot; 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; In actuality, customer service worsened, unregulated fare prices have increased as the demand levels shifted, and not enough new stock and profit was generated as expected so the new trains that privitization was supposed to bring were not funded.  The privatized railway has not shown the improvement and reliability that was hoped for and most people consider it to be a failing system. 
         
=== Chelsea-Hackney Line ===

The Chelsea-Hackney Line, sometimes referred to as Crossrail 2, is a proposal for an underground railway running from south-west London to north-east London.&lt;ref name=&quot;Williams&quot; /&gt;  Plans for this new line were called in after the National Rail showed projections of overcrowding.  The current plans for this line include linking the Wimbledon branch to the Central line‘s Epping Branch and as of right now, the line is to be built to the same standards as Crossrail will be in regards to the size of the tunnels used and other features.  It will not be built by the standards of the London Underground.

===Planning===

The 1989 Cross London Rail study was the beginning of the Crossrail's appearances in Parliament; from the study of East-West rail demand in London came the 1991 Crossrail Bill. Although it was voted down in 1994, the demand for the service still continued to grow. In 1999, the Deputy Prime Minister requested a review of current and future funding options for an east-west transit link, and the review was published in 2001 as the London East-West Study (LEWS).2005 Crossrail bill – approved by House of Lords in 2008 as Crossrail Act 2008; construction started on May 15, 2009 at Canary Wharf

After the preliminary LEWS showed a strong case for the construction of a cross-London link between Paddington and Liverpool stations, Cross London Rail Links, Ltd. (CLRL) was set up by the Government (Department for Transport and Transport for London) in 2001 to define a specific route for Crossrail, as well as the services to operate through it. CLRL used the Government’s New Approach to Appraisal (NATA) and Guidance on the Methodology for Multi-Modal Studies (GOMMMS) framework to assess and appraise transport alternatives for the project.

===='''Central London Corridor Alignment'''====

The LEWS strongly suggested that the safeguarded (protected from conflicting development) route from Paddington to Liverpool Street stations on the edges of Central London be used as a basis for analysis; the intermediate stations at Bond Street, Tottenham Court Road, and Farringdon were also strongly advised to be considered as part of this route. The alignment was largely designed and the adoption would lessen costs and conflicts related to construction or government approval, according to LEWS. Additionally, LEWS addressed the small number of existing feasible alignments for a tunnel through Central London due to Underground tunnels, building foundations, infrastructure, and other obstructions, and suggested that this information provided further justification for the Central London alignment.   


An alternative to the safeguarded route for Central London was presented by the Residents Association of Mayfair, and was first considered as an alignment route as part of the 1991 Crossrail Bill in Parliament. CLRL reassessed the route in 2002, which is also known as the “Northerly Alignment.” This proposed alignment was approximately 1 mile north of the safeguarded route, and would have followed the Marylebone, Baker Street, Euston, and King’s Cross stations, while maintaining a similar alignment to the safeguarded route east of Liverpool Street. Among other advantages, the new proximity to St. Pancras International station from King’s cross would have increased accessibility to the EuroStar service to Paris and Brussels that was relocated from Waterloo in 2007.


Although CLRL determined that the engineering of the alignment was feasible, it also determined that the route would induce less ridership, fewer passenger benefits, and higher costs compared to the safeguarded alignment. It would require more demolition of existing structures and impact significant archaeological areas, as well as reducing the time savings for passengers accessing the largest shopping, employment, and entertainment areas in the West End district of Central London. Additionally, the Northerly Alignment was not approved by the Westminster and Camden city councils, and the CLRL ultimately designated the previously safeguarded route between Paddington and Liverpool Street as its preferred Central London alignment.

===='''Eastern and Western Corridor Alternatives'''====

(See pages 12-13 for maps of corridor alternatives: [http://www.crossrail.co.uk/assets/library/document/a/original/a1developmentofthecrossrailroute.pdf Development of the Crossrail Route])


CLRL chose five separate corridors to the east and six corridors west of the safeguarded Central London alignment for review. Ultimately, it selected two of the eastern corridors and one western corridor as part its preferred Crossrail scheme to be presented to Parliament in the Crossrail Bill of 2005.
Corridor Alternatives (preferred corridors designated by asterisk):


'''Eastern:'''
*Eastern Corridor A*— Great Eastern Line
*Eastern Corridor B – Tilbury Line via Forest Gate
*Eastern Corridor C – Tilbury Line via Royal Docks
*Eastern Corridor D* – North Kent Line via Royal Docks
*Eastern Corridor E – North Kent Line via Charlton


For the selected Corridor D, which performed highly in the economic impact assessment and transport economic efficiency, CLRL considered the option of operating the Crossrail service from Abbey Wood only, rather than projecting a proportion of the service to start at Ebbsfleet. CLRL concluded that by sharing tracks with other rail services on the North Kent Line between Abbey Wood and Ebbsfleet, there was an unacceptable risk of disruption to Crossrail’s high-frequency service pattern. As a result, Abbey Wood rather than Ebbsfleet was selected as the starting point for all Crossrail services in the corridor. Corridor E, which would have followed the Greenwich Peninsula instead of the Royal Docks east of the Isle of Dogs station, performed equally well in the economic and transport assessment criteria, but selection of Corridor D avoided the need to restructure National Rail lines through Southeast Greater London and Kent, demolish a significantly larger amount of businesses and residential property, and to find a feasible site on the Greenwich peninsula for an additional station.

The Great Eastern corridor (corridor A) was also selected for inclusion in the preferred scheme. Although this corridor performed less well than the other eastern corridors against the sub-objective of beneficial wider economic impacts, Crossrail would still have a positive impact on this sub-objective by improving accessibility to Stratford, where significant development is proposed. Inclusion of this corridor also offers significant transport economic efficiency benefits by providing crowding relief to both the National Rail and London Underground networks, as well as providing additional rail capacity into the Liverpool Street station. This additional rail capacity could be used to improve services to destinations on the Lee Valley Line between London and Cambridge.


'''Western:'''

*Western Corridor A — Watford Junction Line
*Western Corridor B – Aylesbury Line via Amersham
*Western Corridor C – High Wycombe Line
*Western Corridor D – Uxbridge and Watford Metropolitan line
*Western Corridor E* – Great Western Line
*Western Corridor F – Kingston via Richmond Line


The Great Western corridor (E) was ultimately designated as the western alignment for CLRL’s preferred plan. Although it is not explicitly listed in the GOMMMS criteria, the corridor was selected largely because it met the goal of international connections by connecting to Heathrow International Airport. Airport stakeholders and limitations on service to stations along the Great Western Line pushed for an extension of the corridor past Heathrow, and CLRL ultimately determined that terminating the route at Maidenhead, which is approximately 15 miles west of Heathrow Central Station, was optimal. Additionally, the selection of this corridor also avoided significant contractual and construction related impacts, and benefited National Rail and freight rail needs in the corridor.&lt;ref&gt;(2007). Development of the Crossrail Route. Retrieved on September 22, 2011 from Crossrail:http://www.crossrail.co.uk/assets/library/document/a/original/a1developmentofthecrossrailroute.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;

The central alignment, along with the preferred eastern and western corridors was included in the bill submitted to Parliament in 2005 as a hybrid bill, which is a public bill on behalf of private organizations or interests. Ultimately, the bill was granted Royal Assent by Queen Elizabeth II in July of 2008, and groundbreaking ceremony was held at Canary Wharf in May of 2009. 

===Economic Impact===

The future economic benefits attributed to the Crossrail project can be divided into three separate categories: direct user benefits, revenues from operation, and wider economic benefits to London and the region as a whole.  Economic analysis done by Cross London Rail Links (CLR), a subsidiary of Transport for London, has attempted to predict the impact the Crossrail project will have when fully completed.


The direct user benefits are make up the largest share of the predicted economic benefits of the Crossrail, and are often cited as a primary justification for the project.  The most important of these benefits is time savings to commuters.  Time savings are achieved by providing a quicker and more direct route through London, with fewer transfer points, and less wait and walk time.  Other user benefits include the value of crowd reduction and ambience, reduction in accidents, and increased access to disabled users. The present value of the total benefit to users is estimated to be slightly over £16 billion.  This amount is estimated to accrue at a roughly 2:1 ratio between leisure/commuting users and business trips.&lt;ref name=&quot;Economic&quot;&gt;Economic Appraisal of Crossrail&lt;/ref&gt;


The second set of predicted benefits is the revenues the Crossrail will bring in.  The present value of revenues earned by the Crossrail is expected to be approximately £13.5 billion.  However, much of those revenues will come from passenger shifts from other modes of public transportation; primarily National Rail and the London Underground.  Once these passenger shifts are accounted for the present value of revenues is expected to be £6.1 billion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Economic&quot;/&gt;
CLR also expects there will be significant economic benefits to greater London as a result of the Crossrail.  These benefits primarily take the form of labor force movement to more productive jobs and the agglomeration benefits from the increase in jobs locating in the central city.  Improved access to central London through the Crossrail is assumed to increase the number of workers who are willing to work there to take advantage of the higher wages.  The tax revenues associated with the higher incomes are an external benefit to the public.  Additionally, each of these jobs will marginally increase the density of central London which can increase average productivity across workers in the area.  Average productivity in London is expected to grow by 1.75% annually.&lt;ref name=&quot;Agglomeration&quot;&gt;Buchanan Paul, P. (2006). Agglomeration benefits of crossrail. Retrieved from 	http://www.etcproceedings.org/paper/agglomeration-benefits-of-crossrail &lt;/ref&gt;  The expected GDP growth resulting from the economic benefits associated with Crossrail is approximately £15.2 billion (present value).&lt;ref name=&quot;Economic&quot;/&gt;


Total costs for the Crossrail project are expected to approach £16 billion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Implications&quot;&gt;Implications for Crossrail Funding&lt;/ref&gt;  The project is being hailed as the largest and most expensive public work for a generation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Final&quot;&gt;Final Prospectus&lt;/ref&gt;  Capital expenditures, including laying rail, digging tunnels and building stations, as well as acquiring land and property, are projected to make up approximately £13.2 billion, with the remainder attributed to depot costs and operating costs.  The total cost is estimated to have a 5% probability of being higher than what is currently projected.&lt;ref name=&quot;Final&quot;/&gt;  Cost estimates for this project have climbed slightly since the initial proposal, in 2005 CLR estimated a £13.9 billion total cost.&lt;ref name=&quot;Economic&quot;/&gt;

Given the considerable logistical and organizational complexities of the Crossrail project, funding the largest infrastructure project in England (£15.9 billion) may be an even more monumental task.&lt;ref name=&quot;Intention&quot;&gt;Greater London Authority, (2010). Intention to levy a business rate supplement to finance the Greater London Authority’s contribution to the crossrail project final prospectus (ISBN 978 1 84781 334 3). London: Greater London Authority. Retrieved from http://www.hillingdon.gov.uk/media/pdf/9/6/finalprospectus.pdf &lt;/ref&gt;   The key to sustainably funding a project of this scale, which has in the past been rejected for financial reasons, is capturing some of the value created by the project and spreading the cost out over numerous agencies and time.  Both planners, government officials, and the Crossrail Sponsors(GLA, TfL, &amp; DfT) have drafted a funding proposal which they feel sufficiently spreads the burden of funding while simultaneously capturing value added by the project.  As noted the total project cost is projected with a 95% degree of certainty to be approximately £15.9 billion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Intention&quot;/&gt;  A break down of capital expenditures for each component of the project is detailed in figure 1.  Additional costs not included in this amount are items being funded by third parties, rolling stock, and financing costs which will add an estimated £2.1 billion in additional project costs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Intention&quot;/&gt;  Other costs not included in this figure are the bulk of the cost of the Woolwich Station, which will be privately funded, and  a £0.15 billion contribution for the Canary Wharf station coming from the Canary Wharf Group.&lt;ref name=&quot;Intention&quot;/&gt;


The Crossrail project funding is coming from three primary sources: Transport for London(TfL), the Department of Transport(DfT), and the Greater London Authority(GLA). Funding for the project breaks down as follows. The Greater London Authority and Transport for London have agreed to contribute around £7.7 to 7.8 billion towards the construction costs of the Crossrail project.&lt;ref name=&quot;Intention&quot;/&gt; The Greater London Authority has put in place the Crossrail Business Rate Supplement which assesses a fee of two pence per pound to business ratepayers occupying premises where the rateable value is £55,000 or more(will be reassessed in 2015).&lt;ref name=&quot;Intention&quot;/&gt;  The BRS will fund approximately £4.1 billion of this figure with £3.5 billion of that amount coming from GLA borrowing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Intention&quot;/&gt;  This borrowing is done against the BRS and has an expected repayment date of 2036-37, although the actual data of repayment could be from 2035-2042 dependent on a range of factors.&lt;ref name=&quot;Intention&quot;/&gt;  An additional £0.6 billion in capital will come directly from BRS funds not used in servicing the GLA's debt, with a projected £219 million to be raised in the first year by the BRS.&lt;ref name=&quot;Intention&quot;/&gt;  The total amount levied by the BRS is expected to be somewhere between £7.3 billion to £8.5 billion, due in large part to the cost of financing the GLA’s borrowing (estimated at £4.0 billion), an amount not included in the overall cost of the project.&lt;ref name=&quot;Intention&quot;/&gt;  This additional £4.0 billion, plus another £2.1 billion in financing cost, and hundreds of millions in private sector station development puts the true total cost of the project closer £22.0 billion, an amount which still doesn't factor in  operating costs once the project is completed.


Additional funding of as much as £0.3 billion will come from a Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) in the City of London.&lt;ref name=&quot;Intention&quot;/&gt;  The CIL will be a sum paid by developers, and local planning authorities can choose to set to help fund infrastructure needed to support the development of their area.  Still more London funding will come from London's Section 106 (Town and Country Planning Act of 1991) with a contribution of £0.3 billion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Intention&quot;/&gt;  Section 106 is an assessment on developments involving new office space in Central London and the northern part of the Isle of Dogs, placing focus on those developments and locations which contribute most significantly to the problems of congestion that Crossrail will help relieve.&lt;ref name=&quot;Intention&quot;/&gt;


Direct contributions by Transport for London(TfL) will total close to £2.4 billion, with the bulk of this funding coming from one of three lending sources:  Public Works Loan Board (Primary), the European Investment Bank, and additional capital through three bond issues.&lt;ref name=&quot;Intention&quot;/&gt;  TfL will use any incremental operating surplus generated once Crossrail is operating to meet its debt servicing responsibilities.  Additional costs my be recouped by the TfL at the end of construction by selling surplus land and over-station development rights.  


The Department for Transportation (DfT) has promised a contribution of £5.1 billion, which will be paid to Crossrail Ltd. as a grant.&lt;ref name=&quot;Intention&quot;/&gt;  DfT will also underwrite contributions from the Common Council of the City of London and the BAA plc.  Network Rail, the surface rail provider outside London, will also contribute £2.3 billion to improvements to the National Rail network needed by the Crossrail project.&lt;ref name=&quot;Intention&quot;/&gt;  Although cost projections have been made with a 95% certainty level, there are contingency plans in place if funding needs should exceed or fall short of projections.  If costs rise above projected levels, the DfT would take over responsibility for funding the remainder of the project and if costs fall short of projections, the surplus would be shared among Crossrail Sponsors (GLA, TfL, &amp; DfT) after the 2017 project completion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Intention&quot;/&gt;

===Environmental Impact===

The massive and historic scale of the Crossrail project, in conjunction with the UK’s domestic and international commitments to meet reduced targets of greenhouse gas emissions, warrant a significant amount of attention to the potential impacts and emissions of construction and future operations. Perhaps the most evident display of these commitments in the project thus far is its Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), which was published and submitted to Parliament in 2005 alongside the Crossrail Bill.


Since the Royal Assent was granted for Crossrail in 2008, Crossrail Ltd. developed a Crossrail Construction Code that incorporates experience from other major UK transport construction projections, such as the Thameslink, Heathrow Terminal 5, and Channel Tunnel Rail Link) as well as current industry best practices. Software is actively used to report any environmental incidents throughout construction as a forum to share information, best practices, and lessons across all parties involved with the construction. Additionally, award programs have been implemented for exception environmental practices by contractors to act as a performance incentive for construction.


Ecological loss due to construction will be staggered and insignificant between the Maidenhead and Paddington stations. However, many areas along the Great Eastern Line will undergo significant loss of botanical resources and habitats due to the removal of concentrations of line-side vegetation that serve as important nesting and wildlife corridors in the suburbs. 
Approximately 8 million m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of material is expected to be produced throughout the Crossrail project, which includes waste from demolition, as well as the materials excavated from tunnel, ventilation shaft, portal, and station construction. The (2004) London Plan, which is the strategic plan created by the Mayor of London, includes an 80% target for the re-use of excavation and demolition materials in order to support the demand for materials needed for building and transport development up to 2016. The majority of the excavated materials will be suitable for use in site engineering and restoration; preliminary predictions in the EIA of the potential volumes of contaminated materials requiring treatment or disposal within the Crossrail project are approximately 7% of the total materials (530,000 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;Department of Transport.

Retrieved on September 20, 2011: http://www.crossrail.co.uk/railway/getting-approval/crossrail-bill-supporting-documents/environmental-statement.&lt;/ref&gt;


The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) is creating a new 1,500 acre nature reserve on Wallasea Island in Essex County, which is Northeast of Greater London. Tunneling for the Crossrail will produce approximately 6 million tons of materials, and close to 100% of this is expected to be uncontaminated; close to 4.5 million tons of material is expected to be used by the RSPB for the wetland project, which requires 10 million tons, and will be the largest of its type throughout Europe and the UK. The wetland conversion on the island, which intends to help mitigate the loss of tidal habitats in England from climate change and coastal flooding, is scheduled to be completed by late 2012.&lt;ref&gt;(2011). Work underway at Wallasea Island.

===Equity and Impact===

There is some concern about the impact the Crossrail project will have on various interested parties, particularly business owners and residents of the East End, London’s historically poorer side of town.  Residents and politicians from the representing the East End complain that the project will most directly benefit the City of London (downtown business district), that the negative impact of construction will disproportionately affect East End business, and that the cost is too high.  


An MP representing the East End quotes one of his constituents in speech in parliament given in July 2005 as saying the cost is equal to “40 new hospitals or more than 400 new schools”.&lt;ref name=&quot;Orders&quot;&gt;Orders of the Day&lt;/ref&gt;  Major opposition was also voiced against the original material removal process that was to take place during construction.  A large part of the operation was to take place in Spitalfields Banglatown, a neighborhood on the East End.  Impacts included three tunneling sites, with a conveyor belt operation 24 hours a day, in some cases operating very close to residential housing.  The complaints resulted in the debris to be removed via barge rather than the conveyor belt.  There have also been some conflicts between Crossrail and residential property owners over the purchase of their property for construction.  Some residents have complained that they are being offered significantly less that the market values of their homes, in some cases as much as a third less.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boris&quot;&gt;Boris Johnson takes on the ‘bullies’ evicting residents to make way for Crossrail&lt;/ref&gt;

===Similar Projects===

The Crossrail project is enormous and there are few projects that can match its scale. However, the RER A line in Paris started out similarly to Crossrail, and there are numerous similarities between these projects. The A line was the first of five that comprise the Paris RER (Réseau Express Régional – translates to Regional Express Network). It was formed by tunneling under Paris to connect two rail mainlines previously operated by SNCF (the French national railway agency) and is operated today as a type of metro/commuter rail hybrid. The trains used are long, two-level trains typical of commuter rail, while the frequency is similar to that of most metro systems with as little as 90 seconds of headway (24-30 trains per hour in peak periods).

====RER A====

'''Background'''

Similar to what happened in London, the rail companies in France built terminal stations on the outskirts of Paris in the middle of the 19th century. Metro lines were connected to all of these stations, and most notably to Line 1, which also runs east-west and connected to the Gares de Lyon, de la Bastille, and de Reuilly. In 1929, the first plan was developed to connect the heavy rail lines across the city with tunnels.&lt;ref name=&quot;Saint-Germain&quot;&gt;Brito, V. (2006, December 31). La ligne de Saint-Germain. Retrieved September 26, 2011, from Symbioz: http://www.symbioz.net/index.php?id=44&lt;/ref&gt; Two lines were proposed, one north-south and the other east west, connecting at Châtelet-Les Halles (not a train station, but a location close to the center of the city and City Hall). Both of these lines were eventually built, but the 1929 plan stalled due to the Great Depression and World War II. 


In 1956, another study proposed 8 lines cutting across Paris. Two of these were combined into the RER A project, which was approved in December 1959 and started construction in July 1961. The section through Paris was entirely new, but west of the city the line followed the Ligne de Saint-Germain, and east of the city it followed the Ligne de Vincennes. These lines strongly contrast one another: the Saint Germain line was the first passenger line built in France, in 1837, and was still very successful, while the Vincennes line was one of the most antiquated and underused in the system, still running steam trains until its last day in 1969.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vincennes&quot;&gt;Brito, V. (2006, September 9). La ligne de Vincennes. Retrieved September 26, 2011, from Symbioz: http://www.symbioz.net/index.php?id=27&lt;/ref&gt; The Saint Germain line was included because it was too successful and removing it would free capacity at the Gare Saint-Lazare. In contrast, the Vincennes line was included partly because of its geographical location opposite the Saint Germain line, but mostly because the SNCF wanted to get rid of it. The initial plan was to connect these lines by tunneling between the Gare Saint-Lazare and the Gare de la Bastille. This was changed to a tunnel through the entire city of Paris, from La Défense business district on the west side to Vincennes on the east side with connections to the Gare Saint-Lazare and the Gare de Lyon. The Gares de la Bastille and de Reuilly were then abandoned and later demolished in the 1980s. Outside of the city of Paris, the existing track was used, with signal and overhead wire upgrades paid for as a part of the project. The first segment (Nation to Boissy-Saint-Léger) opened in December 1969 and the entire tunnel through Paris opened in December 1977.

'''Similarities'''

London and Paris are comparable cities. Both have a regional population of around 12 million. Both cities developed along a large, navigable river that runs on an east-west axis and developed first on the north bank. Because the river was the best way to transport goods for hundreds of years, both cities can be said to have some natural preference for east-west travel. The RER A and Crossrail are east-west lines that connect mainline rail on either side of the city with a tunnel through it. Both are (or will be) operated with local and commuter trips in mind and have the same fare structure/smart pass as the rest of the transit network.

'''Lessons for Crossrail'''

	Perhaps one of the best lessons from this Paris example is to never underestimate the demand for an east-west transit line in a region of 12 million people. The Metro Line 1, the first east-west line built in Paris, opened in July 1900 and was already congested by December 1900 with 130,000 passengers per day. Today, the Metro Line 1 carries 725,000 passengers per day. The RER A is busiest transit line in Europe by far with its 1.2 million passengers per day, and the Metro Line 14, which was built as an attempt to relieve the previous two, carries 500,000 passengers per day and is becoming overcrowded as well. Furthermore, the RER A has been successful because it serves a historically important corridor through the city as well as large new developments outside of it. La Défense, the financial center of Paris, is comparable to Canary Wharf and was developed at the same time as the RER A. Cergy-Pointoise and Marne-la-Vallée are “new towns” developed beginning in the 1960s as anchors at either end of the line.


	Crossrail will probably have high ridership in any case due to its status as a high-speed east-west link across London that connects to Heathrow Airport, the City of London, and Canary Wharf. However, it does not link to new towns in the same way that the RER A does. The only new town served by Crossrail is Thamesmead&lt;ref name=&quot;Hidden&quot;&gt;Hidden London. (2010). Thamesmead. Retrieved September 27, 2011, from Hidden London: http://www.hidden-london.com/thamesmead.html&lt;/ref&gt; (near Woolwich station), a failed new town that never met its development goals. Crossrail is also different in that it does not directly compete with one Underground line, but has multiple interchanges with several different lines. It connects to the Central Line 5 times, the Hammersmith and City Line 4 times, and 3 times each to the District, Circle, and Jubilee Lines. This could attract more riders since there are likely to be many cases where Crossrail reduces the number of transfers required. On the other hand, people and businesses locate based on the network structure at the time of their decision and may not switch to Crossrail if their trip is already served by just one Underground line. 

====Thameslink====

Thameslink has a somewhat different history than Crossrail or the RER A but is a useful comparison nevertheless because it was the first mainline connection across central London. Thameslink is a much longer line (225km vs. 119km for Crossrail). The Snow Hill Tunnel under the Thames was completed in January 1866 and passenger trains ran across London using this tunnel until 1916. The lack of a mainline passenger connection across London between 1916 and 1988 can be seen as more of an operational decision, then, rather than a physical constraint. The tunnel was used to carry freight from 1916 to 1970, but it was abandoned and tracks were removed in 1971. The first Thameslink program paid to rebuild tracks and make station improvements in the mid 1980s and service began in May 1988. 


The primary lesson for Crosslink is that, within 10 years of opening, the Thameslink was overcrowded during peak periods. This led to the Thameslink 2000 proposal, first pitched in 1991 ,and approved in 2006. Now called the Thameslink Programme, it is a £6 billion effort to increase capacity on the Thameslink. Some of the improvements will occur before 2012, in time for the Olympics, but most will be built at the same time as Crossrail, from 2012 to 2018. The fact that Thameslink became overwhelmed so quickly suggests that the ridership was underestimated in the planning process. After this experience with the first mainline connection across central London, it would be prudent to plan for additional capacity on Crossrail. This could mean building more capacity than is needed right away, or allowing for easy capacity upgrades (such as longer or double-decker trains) in the future. News reports seem to suggest that Crossrail planners are doing this.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hyde&quot;&gt;Hyde, J. (2011, March 16). Crossrail ‘mock-ups’ for stations that will last 100 years. Docklands 24 .&lt;/ref&gt;


Two of the largest Thameslink Programme projects are Farringdon Station and London Bridge Station.&lt;ref name=&quot;FirstC&quot;&gt;First Capital Connect. (2011). About the Thameslink Programme. Retrieved September 27, 2011, from Thameslink Programme: http://www.thameslinkprogramme.co.uk/cms/pages/view/11&lt;/ref&gt; Farringdon will be the junction between Thameslink and Crossrail, and is undergoing an upgrade to handle the increased passenger traffic. London Bridge Station is the oldest of the terminal stations in London, built in 1836, and is being reconfigured to eliminate a bottleneck on the Thameslink line. The station currently has 9 terminal platforms and 6 through tracks. The reconfiguration will reverse this and dedicate 2 of the through tracks to Thameslink. It will also expand the station building. The Thameslink Programme estimates that these changes will increase the station capacity by 66%.

==Internet Concept==
The Internet is a worldwide system of interconnected computer networks. The computers and computer networks exchange information using TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) to communicate with each other. The computers are connected via the telecommunications networks, and the Internet can be used for e-mailing, transferring files and accessing information on the World Wide Web.&lt;ref&gt;lan Peter.''The beginnings of the Internet''.Retrieved 21,November,2011 from http://www.nethistory.info/History%20of%20the%20Internet/beginnings.html&lt;/ref&gt; 

The World Wide Web is a system of Internet servers that use HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) to transfer documents formatted in HTML (Hypertext Mark-up Language). These are viewed by using software for web browsers such as Netscape and Internet Explorer. Hypertext enables a document to be connected to other documents on the web through hyperlinks. It is possible to move from one document to another by using hyperlinked text found within web pages.&lt;ref&gt;Laura B. Cohen.''Understanding the World Wide Web''.Retrieved 21,November,2011 from http://www.internettutorials.net/www.asp&lt;/ref&gt; 

Nowadays, there are several ways that enable us to access the Internet. Technology is keep improving, method to access the Internet also increase. People can now access Internet services by using their cell phone, laptop and various gadgets. The numbers of Internet service providers are also keep increasing. For example in Malaysia, there are many Internet service providers such as TM Net, Maxis , Digi, Celcom, Umobile, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Zyas.''The Internet Concept''.Retrieved 22,November,2011 from http://www.zyas.com/articles/The-Internet-Concept-24.html&lt;/ref&gt; 

Communication is becoming much easier than before due to the appearance of Internet. One of the conveniences is that messages, in the forms of email, can be sent at any corner of the world within fractions of seconds. Besides that, email also facilitated mass communication which means that one sender reaches many receivers. Some of the services made available due to Internet include video conferencing, live telecast, music, news, e-commerce, etc.

==Internet History==
The rapid development of Internet started at the early 1960, paralleled with the developments of the computers. Those scientists and researcher started to realize a great vision, a future that everyone will be able to communicate by using their computers. J.C.R. Licklider of MIT, first proposed a global network of computers in 1962 and followed by Leonard Kleinrock from MIT, who  published the first paper on packet switching theory.&lt;ref&gt;Walt Howe.''A Brief History of the Internet''.Retrieved 27,November,2011 from http://www.walthowe.com/navnet/history.html&lt;/ref&gt; 

ARPANET, which is the former of Internet, was a project launched by Military Department of USA. It was brought online at Oct 29, 1969 by Charley Kline at UCLA, when he attempted to perform a remote login from UCLA to SRI. In order to get attentions from public, they made the first public demonstration of ARPANET at an international conference at October 1972.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Gromov.''Roads and Crossroads of the Internet History''.Retrieved 27,November,2011 from http://www.netvalley.com/cgi-bin/intval/net_history.pl?chapter=1&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial ARPANET was a single,closed network. In order to communicate with an ARPANET, one had to be attached to another ARPANET IMP (interface message processor). Hence, the disadvantages of single network were realized and lead the development of  open-architecture network and also different protocols of internetworking, which enable multiple networks can be joined together. E-mail was adapted for ARPANET by Ray Tomlinson of BBN in 1972. The telnet protocol, enabling logging on to a remote computer, was published as a Request for Comments (RFC) in 1972. RFC's are a means of sharing developmental work throughout community. The FTP protocol, enabling file transfers between Internet sites, was published as an RFC in 1973, and from then on RFC's were available electronically to anyone who had use of the FTP protocol. &lt;ref&gt;Kurose Ross.History of Computer Networking and the Internet.In,''Computer Networking:A Top-Down Approach(pp. 61-64)''&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the TCP/IP protocol was introduced by BoB Kahn, the networking protocols used for the ARPANET was NCP, Network Control Protocols. NCP did not have the ability to address networks further downstream than a destination IMP on ARPANET. By 1980, the Internet had reached a certain level of maturity and started to exposed to public usage more and more often. At the same time, French launched the Minitel project to bring data networking into everyone’s home by gave away a free terminal to each household requested.&lt;ref&gt;Retrieved 27,November,2011 from http://www.livinginternet.com/i/ii_ncp.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 1990s, the Internet predecessor, ARPANET finally came to an end, and replaced by the NSFNET which serve as a backbone connecting regional networks in USA. However, the most significant changes of Internet at 1990s was the World Wide Web(WWW) application which truly brought Internet to our daily life. Various technologies such as VoIP, HTML, web browsers with graphical user interfaces, P2P file sharing, instant messaging which is very familiar to us nowadays.&lt;ref&gt;''Histories of the Internet''. Retrieved 27,November,2011 from http://www.isoc.org/internet/history/brief.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

==Internet usage and benefit==
It is globalization and modernization nowadays, Internet become more and more useful and come into everyday life. So we need to understand its social impact and the behaviors leading to this impact. Let us study why people using Internet for certain reasons and some benefits from it. From the early days of computers to now, communication between people to people has been the technology’s most frequent used. People using the Internet to sent or received email. Using email leads people to spend more time online, encourages their use of the Internet for information, entertainment. All this can save time and money because it is consider efficiency enough and always is cheaper. As new Internet communication services arise such as those instant messaging, chat rooms, online games, auctions (eBay), and my groups, they become instantly popular.  &lt;ref&gt;Terry Bernstein, Anish  B. Bhimani, Eugene Schultz, Carol A. Siegel, ''Internet Security for Business''. 29th November 2011 from http://www.invir.com/int-bus-advantages.html &lt;/ref&gt;

Information searching is the second basic Internet function. Many use the Internet to search and download some of the free, useful computer software that provided by the developers on computers worldwide. The only major problem would be finding what you need among the storehouses of data found in databases and libraries. It is therefore necessary to explain the two major methods of accessing computers and locating files without the information retrieval function would not be possible. There are also educational resources on the Internet. They are in various forms such as journals and databases on different types of knowledge. For example, people can access online journals, or learning languages. There are also special homepages on special topics or subjects of interest. These sites are very helpful to those who are doing academic research or even teachers. This will go a long way to improve their knowledge to make them more competitive and knowledgeable. There are now even virtual libraries and full degree programs, all available online. &lt;ref&gt; Courtney Boyd Myers''How The Internet is Revolutionizing Education'' . 30 November 2011 from http://chevyvolt.cm.fmpub.net/#http://thenextweb.com/insider/2011/05/14 &lt;/ref&gt;j

In fact, it is undeniable a trend of commerce on the Internet. The communication facilities have now rapidly become integrated as core business tools such as Internet market, banking, advertisement and so on. Thus most of the business functions are communicative in nature. Users or consumer need not to waste their time on queue up waiting their transaction and service. Internet makes communication with customers and other business partner even to some respondent if related to some online survey.
&lt;ref&gt; Emporion Plaza Ltd ''Benefits of Internet Use''. 30 November 2011 from http://www.cyberethics.info/cyethics2/page.php?pageID=70&amp;mpath=/86/88 &lt;/ref&gt;

To conclude, using the Internet in the right way, give lots of benefits.

==Internet Application==
Network applications are among the most important parts in computer network – if we couldn’t get any useful applications, there would be no use designing networking protocols to support them.  Over half a century ago, a variety of intelligent network applications were created. These applications included the classic text-based applications that become popular in the 1970s and later developed into e-mail, remote access to computers, file transfers, newsgroup and text chat in 1980s. As time went by they introduced more killer applications like the World Wide Web, encompassing Web surfing, search and electronic commerce in middle 1990s. Applications like instant messaging with buddy list and P2P file sharing were introduced at the end of millennium.

Nowadays, instead of the already applications was updated, they also include successful audio and video applications including Internet telephony, video sharing and streaming, social networking applications, Internet radio and IP television (IPTV). In addition, the increased penetration of residential broadband access and ubiquity increased access wireless applications set the stage for an exciting future. At the core of the network applications development writing programs that take place on different end systems communicated with each other through the network. 
&lt;ref&gt;Kurose Ross.Application Layer,''Computer Networking:A Top-Down Approach(pp. 111-112)''&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, the Web application, there are two different programs that communicate with each other: the browser program running on the user’s host desktop, laptop. PDA, cell phone and so on; and the Web server program running in the Web server host. As another example, in a P2P file sharing systems have a program in each host community to participate in file sharing. In this case, the programs on the various hosts may be similar or identical. This basic design – namely, confining application software to the end.&lt;ref&gt;Kurose Ross.Application Layer,''Computer Networking:A Top-Down Approach(pp. 113)''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction to Packet Switching==

Packet switching is a digital networking communications method which is similar to message switching using short messages.All the transmitted data are broken into suitably sized blocks (shorter units), regardless of their contents, types, or structures. This grouped data are called packets.  Each packet is associated with a header before they are transmitted individually through the network. The path taken by each packet to reach their respective destination is depending on the status of links, or algorithms used by switching equipment. Meanwhile, switching is carried out by special nodes on the network which govern the flow of data. Devices such as routers, switches or bridges are the one which carry out the task.

Packet switching differences itself with another principal networking paradigm, circuit switching. Circuit switching is a method which sets up a limited number of dedicated connections with a constant bit rate and a constant delay between nodes for exclusive use during a communication session. In terms of network traffic fee, circuit switching is characterized by a fee per time unit of connection time, even when no data is transferred, while packet switching is characterized by a fee per unit of information.

Many different strategies, algorithms and protocols used to maximize the throughput of packet switching networks. There are two major packet switching protocols that we are using today. The first one is connectionless packet switching, also known as datagram switching, and the second one is connection-oriented packet switching, also known as virtual circuit switching. In datagram, each packet is treated individually for complete addressing and routing. Thus, sometimes packets are transmitted in different path or any routes available. Virtual circuit switching means the packet switching behaves like circuit switching. Connections between devices are completed by using dedicated nodes or routes for packet transmission. Each packet includes a connection identifier and delivered in an order.

Packet mode communication may be used with or without transitional forwarding nodes (packet switches or routers). In all packet mode communication, network resources are managed by statistical multiplexing or dynamic bandwidth allocation in which a communication channel is efficiently divided into an arbitrary number of logical variable-bit-rate channels or data streams. Statistical multiplexing, packet switching and other store-and-forward buffering introduce varying delay and input/output amount in the transmission. Each logical stream consists of a sequence of packets, which normally are forwarded by the multiplexers and intermediate network nodes asynchronously using first-in, first-out buffering. Alternatively, the packets may be forwarded according to some scheduling restraint for fair queuing, traffic shaping or for segregated or guaranteed quality of service, such as weighted fair queuing or leaky bucket. In case of a shared physical medium, the packets may be delivered according to some packet-mode multiple access schemes.


==History of Packet Switching==

The concept of switching small blocks of data was first explored by Paul Baran in the early 1960s. Independently, Donald Davies at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) in the UK had developed the same ideas.

Baran developed the concept of message block switching during his research at the RAND Corporation for the US Air Force into survivable communications networks, first presented to the Air Force in the summer of 1961 as briefing B-265[1] then published as RAND Paper P-2626 in 1962 and then including and expanding somewhat within a series of eleven papers titled On Distributed Communications in 1964. Baran's P-2626 paper described a general architecture for a large-scale, distributed, survivable communications network. The paper focuses on three key ideas: first, use of a decentralized network with multiple paths between any two points; and second, dividing complete user messages into what he called message blocks (later called packets); then third, delivery of these messages by store and forward switching.

Baran's study made its way to Robert Taylor and J.C.R. Licklider at the Information Processing Technology Office, both wide-area network evangelists, and it helped influence Lawrence Roberts to adopt the technology when Taylor put him in charge of development of the ARPANET.
Baran's work was similar to the research performed independently by Donald Davies at the National Physical Laboratory, UK. In 1965, Davies developed the concept of packet-switched networks and proposed development of a UK wide network. He gave a talk on the proposal in 1966, after which a person from the Ministry of Defence told him about Baran's work. A member of Davies' team met Lawrence Roberts at the 1967 ACM Symposium on Operating System Principles, bringing the two groups together.

Interestingly, Davies had chosen some of the same parameters for his original network design as Baran, such as a packet size of 1024 bits. In 1966 Davies proposed that a network should be built at the laboratory to serve the needs of NPL and prove the feasibility of packet switching. The NPL Data Communications Network entered service in 1970. Roberts and the ARPANET team took the name &quot;packet switching&quot; itself from Davies's work.

The first computer network and packet switching network deployed for computer resource sharing was the Octopus Network at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory that began connecting four Control Data 6600 computers to several shared storage devices and to several hundred Teletype Model 33 ASR terminals for time sharing use starting in 1968.

In 1973 Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn wrote the specifications for Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), an internetworking protocol for sharing resources using packet-switching among the nodes.


==Packet Switching in Networks==

Packet switching is used to optimize the use of the channel capacity available in digital telecommunication networks such as computer networks, to minimize the transmission latency, the time it takes for data to pass across the network. It is also used to increase robustness of communication.

There are seven layers in network communication to transmit data from one note to another. The end user’s computer buffers a data of any length to be sent. If the data is too large, it will be cut into smaller pieces (segmentation). Each segment will be appended with a header which contains information for where the data will be send to and some relevant information. Then the segment is then passed down to the next layer which will do the same task on the segment which is called data now. These processes is iterated until the data reaches the final layer and it is placed on the communication link and sent to the receiving node. The receiving node will just simply remove the headers from data and puts all the segments back together in its initial condition (encapsulation).

These layers are introduced to break down the complexity of communications. The top layer (layer 7) is the layer at user level. As the layers go down, they get increasingly primitive. Layer is most primitive from as it is just binary numbers prepared to be transmit to the end node.

==Advantages of Packet Switching==

Packet switching offers some of the advantages over circuit switching:

•	More robust than the circuit switched systems and packet switching is more suitable for transmitting the binary data. (since that is what it was originally designed for packet switching) 

•	Since the advances of the technology nowadays, it is possible to encode voice and send it in packetised format with minimal problems. In the past it was generally accepted that delay sensitive data (for example voice) was to be handled through a circuit switched network.

•	A damaged packet can be resent, this is because only the damaged part is sent, no need to resent an entire file. 

•	 It allows multiplexing, different users, or different processes from the same user, can communicate at the same time.

•	Might be more economical than using private lines if the amount of traffic between terminals does not warrant a dedicated circuit.

•	Might be more economical than dialed data when the data communication sessions are shorter than a telephone call minimum chargeable time unit.

•	Destination information is contained in each packet, so numerous messages can be sent very quickly to many different destinations. The rate depends on how fast the data terminal equipment (DTE) can transmit the packets.

•	Computers at each node allow dynamic data routing. This inherent intelligence in the network picks the best possible route for a packet to take through the network at any particular time. So the throughput and efficiency might be maximized.

•	The packet network inherent intelligence also allows graceful degradation of the network in the event of a node or path (link) failure. Automatic rerouting of the packets around the failed area causes more congestion in those areas, but the overall system is still operable.

•	Ability to emulate a circuit switched network. For example, X.25 and ATM uses a method of communication that is called virtual circuit. These virtual circuits perform in much the same way as circuit switched circuits, but with one fundamental difference; Virtual circuits allow other virtual circuits to occupy the same link. This means that communication can occur concurrently along a link between many nodes (rather than between two nodes, which is the solution circuit switching provides).

==Introduction to Circuit Switching==

Circuit switching is the most commonly use in for the dedicated telecommunication field. But this is strong concept the developer use for communication that provide reliability and consistent connection that established between one node to another node.  So, many people have strong misunderstanding about circuit switching that only use in establishment of voice analog and voice circuit but in fact the circuit switching is provide more than consistency connection among the network.

The simple analogy for circuit switching is the reserving the lane on the highway. For circuit switching, we reserve the lane so that only the car (data) can reach to the destination fast and consistent without delay. There is no traffic jam occur that will slow down the car. On the other hand, the packet switching, they didn’t reserve the lane, so the packets (car) can easily going through the highway (connection) that will produce the congestion on the connection.

Telephony system is much related to the circuit switching system. To make a connection, we must setup a connection between two nodes that is sender and receiver. So the subscriber will use operator to connect to another subscriber to make a call connection. In this situation, electrical connection is established between two subscribers. As the result, the connection is reserved and cannot be used by other user. In the mean time, the copper wire that carries that call will not receive any calls that made by other users in the same time.

When the nodes are connected with an electrical circuit physically, then the switching network become available to generate a communication route between the nodes before the user communication. There are three switch circuit methods of circuit switching which are store and forward, cut-through and the last is fragment-free switching.

==Advantages and Pitfalls of Circuit Switching==

Both the advantages and pitfalls should be taken in consideration when talking about Circuit Switching. This is due to the fact that although it may be useful in certain scenarios, it may not be convenient in others. For example, some may prefer to use Packet Switching over Circuit Switching and some may prefer the opposite. 

Below are  the lists of some of the advantages in Circuit Switching:

'''1. Guaranteed bandwidth'''

The communication performance in Circuit Switching is predictable and there will be no &quot;best-effort&quot; delivery with no real guarantees.

'''2. Simple abstraction''' 

Circuit Switching is a reliable communication channel between hosts and one would not have to worry about lost or out-of-order packets.

'''3. Simple forwarding'''

The forwarding in Circuit Switching is based on time slot or frequency and one would not need to inspect a packet header.

'''4. Low per-packet overhead'''

There will be no IP (and TCP/UDP) header on each packet in Circuit Switching.


Despite the advantages listed above, Circuit Switching cannot avoid having pitfalls or disadvantages that has led to the invention of Packet Switching in order to overcome its pitfalls. Below are some of the pitfalls in Circuit Switching:


'''1. Wasted bandwidth'''

Since most traffic occurs in bursts, in Circuit Switching this may leads to idle connection during silent period. Because it is unable to achieve gains from statistical multiplexing that relies in identifying, predicting and allocating more time for the generally more active paths.

'''2. Blocked connections'''

When resources are not sufficient, the connection will refuse to be connected and thus, Circuit Switching is unable to offer &quot;okay&quot; service to everybody.

'''3. Connection set-up delay'''

There will be no communication until the connection is set up. Plus, in Circuit Switching, it is unable to avoid extra latency for small data transfers.

'''4. Network state'''

The network nodes in Circuit Switching must store per-connection information and it is unable to avoid per-connection storage and state.

==Circuit Switching vs Packet Switching==

There are a few aspects when it comes to comparing between circuit switching and packet switching. The few common comparisons made to distinguish the two are:

1. History of the techniques

Circuit switching is a technique that has been developed long before packet switching came into view. Circuit switching is used to dedicate point-to-point connections during calls and this method is used in Public Switched Telephone Network.
Packet switching, however, is a more modern way of sending data by breaking it down to pieces and transmitting based on the destination address in each packet, hence the name packet switching. Today, the Voice Over Internet Protocol (VoIP) is commonly associated with packet switching technology which means voice communication or multimedia gets sent over the Internet through Internet Protocol networks.

2. Cost

When circuit switching is used, the end-to-end point of the communication path is reserved for users. For example, when a call is made, the communication path (telephone line) is considered ‘rented’ and users find that charges apply to how long they use the path. So the cost falls on the single user who made the call.

However, with VoIP, many people can use the same communication path (there is no dedicated circuit to any user in particular e.g. the internet line) and the cost is shared.

3. Reliability

Most people would think that modern technology would fare better than ancient ones. On the contrary, in this case, it seems that circuit switching is deemed to be the more reliable method of transferring data. 

Since circuit switching reserves the whole communication path, the can almost be said that the information can be get across with no loss. This makes circuit switching very preferable when it comes to real time communication such as conference calls and video streams.

Meanwhile, packet switching breaks the information into small packets and transmits them over a congested medium such as the Internet, there is bound to be lost packets along the way. However, there are various protocols built to prevent huge data losses in a packet switched network, so even though real time data stream may pose a problem, packet switched networks are still relatively reliable.

'''Conclusion'''

In the modern and fast paced world, what we are looking for is efficiency, low costs and reliability and packet-switched networks seems to fulfill most of the criteria that the society is looking for. It would only be a matter of time before circuit switching becomes a thing of the past.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Хранителни добавки и фитнес ==

Постоянното спортуване предизвиква по-често хапване , а възможностите на атлета се засилват в зависимост от честотата на тренировките и опит, но това е до едно време.

Употребяването на допълнителни храни е възможно да ти помогне да достигнещ по-лесно свръх постижения. Основното в идеята е те да притежават добро качество. Може да намерите голям брой аналогични уеб сайтове, за допълнителни храни. От това място можете да придобиете много добра информация за необходимите за вас добавки и да получите фитнес консултация.

На фитнес маниаците не мога да не обясня, че посещаването на фитнеса преди 16-17 годишна възраст не трябва да се допуска. Това е така защото до толкова години организма расте и костите не трябва да се справят със чести немалки натоварвания. Това не означава, разбира се, че не е добре да се спортува, говорим за спорта където се намесват тежести. Спортуването е перфектния помощник в борбата със затлъстяването. По-късно обаче някои фитнес маниаци се стремят да подобрят границата на своитете възможности. Тогава спортистите употребяват хранителни добавки.

За да е използването на протеини благоприятно се налага активно трениране и в зависимост от спорта фитнес програма. Когато се употребява една хранителна добавка обаче всеки трябва да е събрал нужната информация за него. Тук има някои основни неща за добавките:

На първо място е нужно да се отбележи, че хранителните добавки не представляват опасност както анаболните стероиди. Добавките ще бъдат рисковани само ако не се следва написаната доза, а се увеличава многократно. Дори са потребни на организма да се възстанови след тежката тренировка, като му доставят нужните минерали, витамини и други субстанции, които няма как да снабдят организма в това количество чрез храната.

Още нещо което е наложително да се има предвид е разделението на добавките на раздели:
Хранителни добавки за здраве, [http://sportlements.com Хранителни добавки] за уголемяване на мускулите, Хранителни добавки за стопяване на мастните натрупвания.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Even if you do not plan to make a 3D game, and stick to 2D, OpenGL will still bring invaluable tools.

== Hardware acceleration ==

In the past, 2D graphic card provided hardware acceleration by allowing the programmer to store bitmaps and sprites directly in the card, along with a few primitives to perform basic copies (blits), with or without alpha blending.

Nowadays, these features are being replaced by OpenGL and its (more generic) textures.  Programming in 2D in OpenGL is basically displaying textures facing the screen, with z coordinates always set to 0.  This also introduces a greatly needed standardization for 2D acceleration (for instance, there is essentially no way to get 2D acceleration under GNU/Linux + X11).

This technique is used by several graphics libraries, including SFML, ClanLib or Gnash.

== Setting up the 2D space ==

We will use an orthographic projection matrix, where there is no perspective (objects far away look as big as near objects - you may have already seen this in technical drawing, or by typing Numpad 5 in Blender).

GLM provides &lt;code&gt;glm::ortho&lt;/code&gt; to compute such a projection.  Since we'll be manipulating pixels directly, let's use the size of the physical screen in pixels, rather than [-1, 1] as we previously did.

In addition, we've seen that OpenGL's vertical axis is bottom-to-top, while traditional 2D screens are top-to-bottom, so let's reverse the Y axis:

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
  glm::mat4 projection = glm::ortho(0, screen_width, screen_height, 0);
&lt;/source&gt;

But, since we're programming ''modern'', shouldn't we forget about old-style 2D coordinates?  Well, it happens that most graphic formats are top-to-bottom, too.  TGA and BMP are bottom-to-top, but almost all other formats, and above all formats libraries (JPG, PNG, etc.), will give you top-to-bottom pictures.  And we saw in the [[../Modern_OpenGL_Tutorial_06|texture tutorial]] that OpenGL uses bottom-to-top for textures, so it would display them upside-down!

Reversing the OpenGL screen means that our pictures can be uploaded to the OpenGL graphic card as-is, and will be displayed in the right direction.  The alternative would be to reverse texture coordinates.

The only point of attention is that the rotation angle on the Z axis need to be reversed, too.

But maybe the main reason behind reversing coordinates is that most users ''expect'' Y coordinates at top-to-bottom: check Gimp and Dia for instance; also check other 2D game frameworks and libraries. One notable exception is Inkscape (vector drawing) where coordinates start at the bottom-left like OpenGL.

== Uploading textures ==

Graphic cards used to have odd limits, such as only allowing power-of-two dimensions.  Since we are targetting OpenGL 2 and later, we can safely assume that this limitation is now lifted.


== Displaying a sprite ==

To &quot;blit&quot; the texture to the OpenGL buffer the simplest way is to draw a pair of triangles with a texture:
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
/* code here */
&lt;/source&gt;

You could however perform incremental display updates, by not calling &lt;code&gt;glClear&lt;/code&gt; and using techniques such as dirty rectangles - although nowdays the GPU is usually fast enough to avoid implementing this kind of optimization.

== Blitting on a texture ==

framebuffer / renderbuffer / reuse-that-as-textures / ... ?

WIP

== Optimizing for 2D ==

Since we work in 2D, we can remove:
* shrink transformation matrices from 4x4 to 3x3
* the z coordinates in the vertices
* back-face culling is not necessary
* depth-test is not necessary

GLM only provides 4x4 transformation matrices. We'd need a different set of function to work with 3x3 matrices&lt;ref&gt;For instance, if converting with &lt;code&gt;glm::mat3(mvp)&lt;/code&gt;, we'll lose the 4th matrix column that contains the translation operations&lt;/ref&gt;, so let's keep using 4x4 translations.
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
  glm::mat4 mvp = glm::mat4(...);
&lt;/source&gt;

For the vertices, we can pass a 2d vector, and convert it later to multiply it by our 4x4 matrix.

gl_Position is still a vec4, so:
&lt;source lang=&quot;glsl&quot;&gt;
  gl_Position = mvp * vec4(v_coord, 1.0);
&lt;/source&gt;

== Zooming the whole screen ==

You can perform a zoom effect by adjusting the projection.  Here's a progressive zoom out, for instance:
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
  float scale = glutGet(GLUT_ELAPSED_TIME) / 1000.0 * .2;  // 20% per second
  glm::mat4 projection = glm::ortho(0.0f, 1.0f*screen_width*scale, 1.0f*screen_height*scale, 0.0f);
&lt;/source&gt;

== Exact / perfect pixelization ==

OpenGL has a special rule to draw fragments at the center of pixel screens, called &quot;diamond rule&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.khronos.org/registry/gles/specs/2.0/es_full_spec_2.0.25.pdf |title=OpenGL ES Common Profile Specification Version 2.0.25 |publisher=Khronos.org |date=2010-11-02 |accessdate=2011-11-12}} - section 3.4.1 ''Basic Line Segment Rasterization''&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opengl.org/resources/faq/technical/transformations.htm#tran0030 |title=OpenGL FAQ and Troubleshooting Guide v1.2001.11.01 - 9.030 How do I draw 2D controls over my 3D rendering? |accessdate=2011-11-12}} - ''If exact pixelization is required, you might want to put a small translation in the ModelView matrix''&lt;/ref&gt;.
Consequently, it is recommended to add a small translation in X,Y before drawing 2D sprite:
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
glm::translate(glm::mat4(1), glm::vec3(0.375, 0.375, 0.));
&lt;/source&gt;

This chapter will explore yet another shorthand method of representing the valence electrons. The method explored in this lesson will be a visual representation of the valence electrons. We will, as we observed in the previous lesson, finish the lesson with a look at how this visual representation flows in a pattern throughout the Periodic Table.

==Lesson Objectives==
* Explain the meaning of an electron dot diagram.
* Draw electron dot diagrams for given elements.
* Describe the patterns of electron dot diagrams in the Periodic Table.

==A Simplified Way to Show Valence Electrons==
As defined earlier in this chapter, core electrons are all the electrons except the valence electrons and valence electrons are the electrons in the outermost energy level. Valence electrons are the electrons responsible for chemical reactions. Here is the electron configuration for sodium.

:[[File:Electron configuration sodium.svg|200px|Electron configuration for sodium (Na)]]

The electron configuration is: 1''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2''p''&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;3''s''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;. The core electrons are 1''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2''p''&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;. The valence electron is 3''s''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;. One way to represent this valence electron, visually, was developed by Gilbert N. Lewis. These visual representations were given the name '''Lewis electron dot diagrams'''. Lewis suggested that since the valence electrons are responsible for chemical reactions and the core electrons are not involved, we should use a diagram that shows just the valence electrons for an atom.

To draw a Lewis electron dot diagram for sodium you can picture the symbol for sodium in a box with the box having four sides. Each side of the box represents either the ''s'' or one of the three ''p'' orbitals in the outermost energy level of the atom. The first and second valence electrons are placed on the side representing the ''s'' orbital and the next electrons are placed in the ''p'' orbitals. Just as the electrons are placed singly before being doubled up in the orbital representation, so they are placed one at a time in the ''p'' orbitals of an electron dot formula. A single dot represents one valence electron. Thus, the Lewis dot formula for sodium is:

:[[File:Lewis dot Na.svg|50px]]

Look at the electron configuration for magnesium. Magnesium is element #12.

:[[File:Electron configuration magnesium.svg|200px|Electron configuration for magnesium (Mg)]]

To draw the Lewis electron dot diagram we picture in our minds the symbol for Mg in a box with all of its core electrons (i.e., 1''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2''p''&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;). Then we place the valence electrons around the sides of the box with each side representing an orbital in the outermost energy level. How many valence electrons does magnesium have? There are 2 valence electrons, 3''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

Therefore the Lewis electron dot formula for magnesium is:

:[[File:Lewis dot Mg.svg|50px]]

Look at the electron configuration for chlorine.

:[[File:Electron configuration chlorine.svg|200px|Electron configuration for chlorine (Cl)]]

The electron configuration for chlorine could be written as: 1''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2''p''&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;3''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;3''p''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;. The core electrons would be 1''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2''p''&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; while the valence electrons would be in the third shell (or where ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3). Therefore, chlorine has 7 valence electrons. The Lewis electron dot diagram would look like the following:

:[[File:Lewis dot Cl.svg|50px]]

Notice that the electrons are in groups of two. Think of the chlorine in a box and the box has 4 sides. Each side can have 2 electrons on it. Therefore there can be a maximum of {{nowrap|1=2 × 4 = 8}} electrons normally on any Lewis electron dot diagram.
{{High School Chemistry/Example|Sample Question}}
Write the Lewis electron dot formula for:
: (a) Oxygen
: (b) Sulfur
: (c) Potassium
: (d) Carbon
----
'''Solution''':

(a) Oxygen has the electron configuration: 1''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2''p''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;, therefore there are 2 core electrons and 6 valence electrons. The Lewis electron dot formula is:
:[[File:Lewis dot O.svg|50px]]

(b) Sulfur has the electron configuration: 1''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2''p''&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;3''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;3''p''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;, therefore there are 10 core electrons and 6 valence electrons. The Lewis electron dot formula is:

(c) Potassium has the electron configuration: 1''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2''p''&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;3''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;3''p''&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;4''s''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, therefore there are 18 core electrons and 1 valence electron. The Lewis electron dot formula is:

(d) Carbon has the electron configuration: 1''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2''p''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, therefore there are 2 core electrons and 4 valence electrons. The Lewis electron dot formula is:

==All the Elements in a Column Have the Same Electron Dot Diagram==
In the previous lesson, it was shown that using the earlier version for numbering the periodic table, we could see a pattern for finding the number of valence electrons in each of the groups in the main group elements. Since the Lewis electron dot diagrams are based on the number of valence electrons, it would hold true that the elements in the same group would have the same electron dot diagram. In other words, if every element in Group 1A has 1 valence electron, then every Lewis electron dot diagram would have one single dot. Take a look at the table below.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;margin:10px auto; text-align:center;&quot;

The same pattern holds for all elements in the main group. Look at Table 9.8 for the Lewis dot diagrams for Group 2A elements.

A similar pattern exists for the Lewis electron dot diagrams for Group 3A.

==Lesson Summary==
* A Lewis Electron Dot Diagram is used to visually represent only the valence electrons.
* The core electrons are symbolized using the symbol of the element with the valence electron dots surrounding the element symbol.
* The maximum number of valence electron dots in the Lewis electron dot diagram is 8. Two electrons can go on each side (top, bottom, left, and right).
* Electrons are added to the electron dot formula by placing the first two valence electrons in the ''s'' orbital, then one in each ''p'' orbital until each ''p'' orbital has one electron, and then doubling up the electrons in the ''p'' orbitals.
* Each element in a group has the same number of valence electrons and therefore has the same Lewis electron dot diagram. (Same number of dots, different symbol.)

Before science/engineering, confusion existed. Different substances were measured different ways. Chickens were counted differently than snakes. Height was measured differently than horizontal distance on the ground. Different languages added confusion. The confusion shown on the Camp Nelson sign occurred everywhere rather than being a joke. Today a number is assigned to everything. Rule: '''Don't add numbers unless they have the same units.'''

Units are involved in every engineering and science class. Don't write a number down without the units. Don't plug into a formula without first checking if it makes sense by plugging in units. Unit mistakes lower respect. Unit problems can cripple an engineering career.

If you know the dimensions of units, you can ace most physics tests without memorizing formulas. Please explore these two pages thoroughly:

      <text xml:space="preserve">''Do I have to?'' '''Yes'''.

''Aren't there conversion programs?'' '''Yes, but they only help find conversion factors. They don't help solve problems'''.

''I have developed my own way of doing units that is easier.'' '''Most people do, but:'''
:*In complicated problems you will make mistakes
:*You will be unable to explain this to people
:*Others will not be patient enough to listen to your way
:*Others will not be able to find your mistakes
:*You will loose respect
When everyone does them the same way, then communication of technical information improves. 

There are two standard ways of doing units. One involves tables, the other does the conversion on a single horizontal line. The line method is described below.

==Treat Units like Numbers==
Units become complicated when multiplying and dividing. Treat them like numbers. Follow the same rules.

==Find Truth, Make Identities==
Find a true statement. Set it equal to 1 to create an identity and then start doing math. Change language into math (grammer)! Become an expert at word problems!

===Truth===
Units start with true statements such as 5280 feet = 1 mile. Or three 3 teaspoons = 1 tablespoon. Or 3600 seconds = 1 hour. Who comes up with this? We count money in 10's but eggs in 12's. And this is just English. There are other weird units. The French tried to fix the world with the [[:w:International_System_of_Units|SI system]] of units. The goal was to multiply by 10 and have no strange numbers like 5280, 3600 or 3. SI is a tremendous success. Once you start using it, going to another system is painful. There is just one slight oddity:

:&lt;math&gt;1 Newton = 1 killogram * \frac{1\,\mathrm{meter}}{1\,\mathrm{seconds^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

&quot;killo = 1000&quot; is another truth, but slightly different. It is called a &quot;prefix&quot;, but is merely equating a word and to number. 

Every country has it's own &quot;standards&quot; organization that maintains these truths. In the United States this organization is called the &quot;National Institute of Standards and Technology&quot; or &quot;[[:w:National_Institute_of_Standards_and_Technology|NIST]].&quot; NIST defines what a meter, foot, yard or mile is for the US and [[:w:Harmonisation_of_law|harmonizes]] with other countries. Tools that measure the physical world have to produce trusted numbers in order for science and commerce to function. This is done through a tree system that starts at NIST called &quot;[[:w:Calibration|calibration]].&quot; Stickers on equipment or certificates that ship with equipment mean that it has been tested to measure weight, time, length, count, etc. accurately. The calibration tests are maintained and improved by NIST.

===Identities===
Suppose in wizard world of Harry Potter, 29 knuts = 1 sickle. How is math done with this truth? 

Any number or any word can be multiplied by 1 and still be itself. The number 1 is some times called the &quot;[[:w:1_(number)#Mathematics|identity]]&quot; because of this property.

Most engineering and science text books start off with a list of identities to be used. They are a subset of the world's possibilities. Identities are formed by putting all the numbers and words on one side of the equal sign. This can be done in two ways. For each truth, there are two identities. Here is the list of identities that can be formed from the true statements above: 

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Truth
! Identity #1
! Identity #2
|-
| 1 mile = 5280 feet
| &lt;math&gt;1 = \frac{5280\,\mathrm{ft}}{1\,\mathrm{mile}}&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;1 = \frac{1\,\mathrm{mile}}{5280\,\mathrm{ft}}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| 3 teaspoons = 1 tablespoon
| &lt;math&gt;1 = \frac{3\,\mathrm{teaspoons}}{1\,\mathrm{tablespoon}}&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;1 = \frac{1\,\mathrm{tablespoon}}{3\,\mathrm{teaspoons}}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| 1 hour = 3600 seconds
| &lt;math&gt;1 = \frac{3600\,\mathrm{seconds}}{1\,\mathrm{hour}}&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;1 = \frac{1\,\mathrm{hour}}{3600\,\mathrm{seconds}}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| 1 sickle = 29 knuts
| &lt;math&gt;1 = \frac{29\,\mathrm{knuts}}{1\,\mathrm{sickle}}&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;1 = \frac{1\,\mathrm{sickle}}{29\,\mathrm{knuts}}&lt;/math&gt;
|}

As the textbook and course progresses, there may be new truths introduced. Chemistry classes spend a lot of time with [[:w:Avogadro_constant|moles]] and then stops introducing new units. Physics likes to introduce new units constantly and summarizes them on the jacket covers. You have to be able to create the identities. New identities typically appear in a problem statement. Sometimes they are temporary.

==Word Problems==
Almost all engineering problems start off as word problems. The first step is to look for new truths, or temporary truths that can be turned into identities. The problems below are related to Harry Potter in order to force students to deal with new units. (From Milner_d FortLewis.edu.)

===Hagrid===
''As Hagrid says, wizard money is very easy to understand. There are three coins: knuts, sickles and galleons. There are 29 knuts in one sickle and 17 sickles in one galleon. How many knuts in a galleon?''

There are three steps to finding the solutions:
# Find new truths/identities
# Find what is wanted in the form of an unknown identity
# Find closest starting identity, multiply by other identities until reach destination

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Truth
! Identity #1
! Identity #2
|-
| 1 galleon = 17 sickle
| &lt;math&gt;1 = \frac{17\,\mathrm{sickles}}{1\,\mathrm{galleon}}&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;1 = \frac{1\,\mathrm{galleon}}{17\,\mathrm{sickles}}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| ?? knuts = 1 galleon
| &lt;math&gt;1 = \frac{??\,\mathrm{knuts}}{1\,\mathrm{galleon}}&lt;/math&gt;
| the unknown identity
|}

&lt;math&gt;\frac{17\,\mathrm{\cancel{sickles}}}{1\,\mathrm{galleon}}*\frac{29\,\mathrm{knuts}}{1\,\mathrm{\cancel{sickle}}}&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;1 = \frac{17*29\,\mathrm{knuts}}{1\,\mathrm{galleon}}&lt;/math&gt;

The answer also forms another identity to add to our list. 

===Ron===
''Ron has carefully horded every knut he’s found for 10 years and now he has three huge bags. He didn’t want to count every coin so he weighed the bags and found he had 75 pounds of knuts. One knut weighs 2 ounces. 16 oz = 1 lb. How much does he have in galleons?''

Sometimes extraneous information (truth that is not needed) confuses us. Other times it appears there is truth needed, but we don't know it. Here the issue is 3 bags. Are the bags equal size? Is one a lot larger than the other? We don't know. We have to hope that the problem can be solved without knowing the details of this issue. 

Don't worry about needing to use every fact or truth in the world to solve a problem. Just follow the three steps. Don't try to do math in your head. This will just confuse people. Remember the goal of this system is to clearly communicate how you arrive at your answer. If other engineers can agree with you .. without having to do the unit analysis themselves, then a trust is born. This trust grows into respect and an engineer is born. 

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Truth
! Identity #1
! Identity #2
|-
| 10 years = 3 bags
| &lt;math&gt;1 = \frac{3\,\mathrm{bags}}{10\,\mathrm{years}}&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;1 = \frac{10\,\mathrm{years}}{3\,\mathrm{bags}}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| 3 bags = 75 pounds
| &lt;math&gt;1 = \frac{3\,\mathrm{bags}}{75\,\mathrm{pounds}}&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;1 = \frac{75\,\mathrm{pounds}}{3\,\mathrm{bags}}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| 1 knut = 2 ounces
| &lt;math&gt;1 = \frac{1\,\mathrm{knut}}{2\,\mathrm{ounces}}&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;1 = \frac{2\,\mathrm{ounces}}{1\,\mathrm{knut}}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| 16 ounces = 1 pound
| &lt;math&gt;1 = \frac{16\,\mathrm{ounces}}{1\,\mathrm{pound}}&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;1 = \frac{1\,\mathrm{pound}}{16\,\mathrm{ounces}}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| ?? galleons = 3 bags
| &lt;math&gt;1 = \frac{??\,\mathrm{galleons}}{3\,\mathrm{bags}}&lt;/math&gt;
|the unknown identity
|}

&lt;math&gt;\frac{75\,\mathrm{\cancel{pounds}}}{3\,\mathrm{bags}}*\frac{16\,\mathrm{\cancel{ounces}}}{1\,\mathrm{\cancel{pound}}}&lt;/math&gt; * &lt;math&gt;\frac{1\,\mathrm{\cancel{knut}}}{2\,\mathrm{\cancel{ounces}}}&lt;/math&gt;  * &lt;math&gt;\frac{1\,\mathrm{galleon}}{17*29\,\mathrm{\cancel{knuts}}}&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;1 = \frac{75*16\,\mathrm{galleons}}{3*2*17*29\,\mathrm{bags}}&lt;/math&gt;

The answer above is not quite finished. The answer wanted is galleons, not galleons per bag (an identity). Furthermore we don't know if the bags are of equal size. We could assume bag size is equal, but we don't have to if we multiple the above answer by the number of bags. 

&lt;math&gt;\frac{75*16\,\mathrm{galleons}}{2*17*29*\cancel{3}\,\mathrm{\cancel{bags}}}&lt;/math&gt; * &lt;math&gt;\cancel{3}\cancel{bags}&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\frac{75*16\,\mathrm{galleons}}{2*17*29}&lt;/math&gt;

This answer appears to be uniquely associated with Ron, so it's identity will probably not be used again unless we stumble across Ron and his money again.

===Harry===
''Harry is practicing flying on his Firebolt. He does 10 laps around the Quidditch field in 18 minutes. One lap of the field is 700 meters (m). How fast is he going in kilometers (km) per hour?''

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-

|-
| 10 laps = 18 minutes
| &lt;math&gt;1 = \frac{18\,\mathrm{minutes}}{10\,\mathrm{laps}}&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;1 = \frac{10\,\mathrm{laps}}{18\,\mathrm{minutes}}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| 1 lap = 700 meters
| &lt;math&gt;1 = \frac{1\,\mathrm{lap}}{700\,\mathrm{meters}}&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;1 = \frac{700\,\mathrm{meters}}{1\,\mathrm{lap}}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| 1 kilo = 1000
| &lt;math&gt;1 = \frac{1\,\mathrm{kilo}}{1000\,\mathrm{}}&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;1 = \frac{1000\,\mathrm{}}{1\,\mathrm{kilo}}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| 60 minutes = 1 hour
| &lt;math&gt;1 = \frac{60\,\mathrm{minutes}}{1\,\mathrm{hour}}&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;1 = \frac{1\,\mathrm{hour}}{60\,\mathrm{minutes}}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| ?? kilo meters = 1 hour
| &lt;math&gt;1 = \frac{??\,\mathrm{kilo meters}}{1\,\mathrm{hour}}&lt;/math&gt;
|the unknown identity
|}
&lt;math&gt;\frac{60\,\mathrm{\cancel{minutes}}}{1\,\mathrm{hour}}*\frac{10\,\mathrm{\cancel{laps}}}{18\,\mathrm{\cancel{minutes}}}&lt;/math&gt; * &lt;math&gt;\frac{700\,\mathrm{meters}}{1\,\mathrm{\cancel{lap}}}&lt;/math&gt;  * &lt;math&gt;\frac{1\,\mathrm{killo}}{10000\,\mathrm{}}&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;1 = \frac{60*10*700\,\mathrm{killo meters}}{18*1000\,\mathrm{hours}}&lt;/math&gt;

===Boomslangs===
''One of the most important ingredients in Polyjuice Potion (used to make you look like someone else) is dried boomslang skin. As you know, boomslangs are very small which is why boomslang skin is so expensive. It takes 32 boomslangs to make 1 teaspoon (tsp.) of dried boomslang skin. The potion calls for ½ cup (c.) of skin. 3 tsp. = 1 tablespoon (tbsp.) 16 tbsp. = 1 cup How many boomslangs have to give their lives for the recipe?''

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;

| 32 boomslangs = 1 teaspoon
| &lt;math&gt;1 = \frac{32\,\mathrm{boomslangs}}{1\,\mathrm{teaspoon}}&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;1 = \frac{1\,\mathrm{teaspoon}}{32\,\mathrm{boomslangs}}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| 1 potion = 0.5 cup
| &lt;math&gt;1 = \frac{1\,\mathrm{potion}}{0.5\,\mathrm{cup}}&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;1 = \frac{0.5\,\mathrm{cup}}{1\,\mathrm{potion}}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| 3 teaspoons = 1 tablespoon
| &lt;math&gt;1 = \frac{3\,\mathrm{teaspoons}}{1\,\mathrm{tablespoon}}&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;1 = \frac{1\,\mathrm{tablespoon}}{3\,\mathrm{teaspoons}}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| 16 tablespoons = 1 cup
| &lt;math&gt;1 = \frac{16\,\mathrm{tablespoons}}{1\,\mathrm{cup}}&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;1 = \frac{1\,\mathrm{cup}}{16\,\mathrm{tablespoons}}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| ?? boomslangs = 1 potion
| &lt;math&gt;1 = \frac{??\,\mathrm{boomslangs}}{1\,\mathrm{potion}}&lt;/math&gt;
|the unknown identity
|}
&lt;math&gt;\frac{32\,\mathrm{boomslangs}}{1\,\mathrm{\cancel{teaspoon}}}*\frac{3\,\mathrm{\cancel{teaspoons}}}{1\,\mathrm{\cancel{tablespoon}}}&lt;/math&gt; * &lt;math&gt;\frac{16\,\mathrm{\cancel{tablespoons}}}{1\,\mathrm{\cancel{cup}}}&lt;/math&gt;  * &lt;math&gt;\frac{0.5\,\mathrm{\cancel{cup}}}{1\,\mathrm{potion}}&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;1 = \frac{32*3*16*0.5\,\mathrm{boomslangs}}{1\,\mathrm{potion}}&lt;/math&gt;

===Polyjuice===
''The evil Barty Crouch Jr. had to drink at least 4 fl. oz. of Polyjuice Potion every hour in order to maintain his disguise as Mad Dog Moody. 64 fl. oz. = 1 gallon. How many days would 5 gallons of potion last him?''

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Truth
! Identity #1
! Identity #2
|-
| 4 fluid oz = hour
| &lt;math&gt;1 = \frac{4\,\mathrm{fluid oz}}{1\,\mathrm{hour}}&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;1 = \frac{1\,\mathrm{hour}}{4\,\mathrm{fluid oz}}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| 64 fluid oz = 1 gallon 
| &lt;math&gt;1 = \frac{64\,\mathrm{fluid oz}}{1\,\mathrm{gallon}}&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;1 = \frac{1\,\mathrm{gallon}}{64\,\mathrm{fluid oz}}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| 24 hours = 1 day
| &lt;math&gt;1 = \frac{24\,\mathrm{hours}}{1\,\mathrm{day}}&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;1 = \frac{1\,\mathrm{day}}{24\,\mathrm{hours}}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| ?? days = 1 gallon
| &lt;math&gt;1 = \frac{??\,\mathrm{days}}{1\,\mathrm{gallon}}&lt;/math&gt;
|the unknown identity
|}
&lt;math&gt;\frac{1\,\mathrm{\cancel{hour}}}{4\,\mathrm{\cancel{fluid oz}}}*\frac{1\,\mathrm{day}}{24\,\mathrm{\cancel{hour}}}&lt;/math&gt; * &lt;math&gt;\frac{64\,\mathrm{\cancel{fluid oz}}}{1\,\mathrm{gallon}}&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;1 = \frac{64\,\mathrm{days}}{4*24\,\mathrm{gallons}}&lt;/math&gt;

The question was how many days would 5 gallons last. So we need to multiply the identity above by 5 gallons to give an answer in days alone.

&lt;math&gt;\frac{64\,\mathrm{days}}{4*24\mathrm{\cancel{gallons}}}&lt;/math&gt;*&lt;math&gt;5 \cancel{gallons}&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\frac{64*5\,\mathrm{days}}{4*24}&lt;/math&gt;</text>

      <comment>/* Shaders */ Corrected pixel shader to vertex shader.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Post-processing are effects applied after the main OpenGL scene is rendered.

== Technical overview ==

To apply a global effect on the whole scene, we face a limitation: all the shaders work ''locally'': vertex shaders only know about the current vertex, and fragment shaders only know about the current pixel.

The only exception is when working with textures: in this case, we can access any part of the texture using texture coordinates.

So the idea for post-processing is to first render the whole scene in a texture, and then render this single texture to screen with the post-processing.

Two main alternatives exist:
* render the screen a first time, then copy the screen to a texture using &lt;code&gt;glCopyTexSubImage2D&lt;/code&gt;
* render directly to a texture through a framebuffer object

We'll use the second method, which should be more efficient, and can render on an area bigger than the physical screen if necessary.

(The first method may be necessary if you plan to use the [[../Stencil_buffer#Limitations|stencil buffer]] as well.)

== Objects ==

=== Framebuffer ===

We will create:
* a framebuffer object
* with a depth buffer stored in a render buffer (necessary to render a 3D scene)
* a color buffer stored in a texture (with GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE to avoid default GL_REPEAT's border &quot;warping&quot; effect).

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
/* Global */
GLuint fbo, fbo_texture, rbo_depth;
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
/* init_resources */
  /* Create back-buffer, used for post-processing */

  /* Texture */
  glActiveTexture(GL_TEXTURE0);
  glGenTextures(1, &amp;fbo_texture);
  glBindTexture(GL_TEXTURE_2D, fbo_texture);
  glTexParameteri(GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_MAG_FILTER, GL_LINEAR);
  glTexParameteri(GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER, GL_LINEAR);
  glTexParameteri(GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_S, GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE);
  glTexParameteri(GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_T, GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE);
  glTexImage2D(GL_TEXTURE_2D, 0, GL_RGBA, screen_width, screen_height, 0, GL_RGBA, GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE, NULL);
  glBindTexture(GL_TEXTURE_2D, 0);

  /* Depth buffer */
  glGenRenderbuffers(1, &amp;rbo_depth);
  glBindRenderbuffer(GL_RENDERBUFFER, rbo_depth);
  glRenderbufferStorage(GL_RENDERBUFFER, GL_DEPTH_COMPONENT16, screen_width, screen_height);
  glBindRenderbuffer(GL_RENDERBUFFER, 0);

  /* Framebuffer to link everything together */
  glGenFramebuffers(1, &amp;fbo);
  glBindFramebuffer(GL_FRAMEBUFFER, fbo);
  glFramebufferTexture2D(GL_FRAMEBUFFER, GL_COLOR_ATTACHMENT0, GL_TEXTURE_2D, fbo_texture, 0);
  glFramebufferRenderbuffer(GL_FRAMEBUFFER, GL_DEPTH_ATTACHMENT, GL_RENDERBUFFER, rbo_depth);
  GLenum status;
  if ((status = glCheckFramebufferStatus(GL_FRAMEBUFFER)) != GL_FRAMEBUFFER_COMPLETE) {
    fprintf(stderr, &quot;glCheckFramebufferStatus: error %p&quot;, status);
    return 0;
  }
  glBindFramebuffer(GL_FRAMEBUFFER, 0);
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
/* onReshape */
  // Rescale FBO and RBO as well
  glBindTexture(GL_TEXTURE_2D, fbo_texture);
  glTexImage2D(GL_TEXTURE_2D, 0, GL_RGBA, screen_width, screen_height, 0, GL_RGBA, GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE, NULL);
  glBindTexture(GL_TEXTURE_2D, 0);

  glBindRenderbuffer(GL_RENDERBUFFER, rbo_depth);
  glRenderbufferStorage(GL_RENDERBUFFER, GL_DEPTH_COMPONENT16, screen_width, screen_height);
  glBindRenderbuffer(GL_RENDERBUFFER, 0);
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
/* free_resources */
  glDeleteRenderbuffers(1, &amp;rbo_depth);
  glDeleteTextures(1, &amp;fbo_texture);
  glDeleteFramebuffers(1, &amp;fbo);
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Vertices ===

Then we'll need a basic set of vertices to display the resulting texture on screen. In this example we'll only use 2D coordinates because we plan to make a 2D effect, but feel free to use 3D coordinates for a 3D effect (mapping the texture on a rotating cube like Compiz, for instance):
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
/* Global */
GLuint vbo_fbo_vertices;
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
/* init_resources */
  GLfloat fbo_vertices[] = {
    -1, -1,
     1, -1,
    -1,  1,
     1,  1,
  };
  glGenBuffers(1, &amp;vbo_fbo_vertices);
  glBindBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, vbo_fbo_vertices);
  glBufferData(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, sizeof(fbo_vertices), fbo_vertices, GL_STATIC_DRAW);
  glBindBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, 0);
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
/* free_resources */
  glDeleteBuffers(1, &amp;vbo_fbo_vertices);
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Program ===

Now we'll need a separate program for our post-processing effect.
It's a lot of code, but it's a mere copy/paste from the basic tutorials :)

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
/* Global */
GLuint program_postproc, attribute_v_coord_postproc, uniform_fbo_texture;
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
/* init_resources */
  /* Post-processing */
  if ((vs = create_shader(&quot;postproc.v.glsl&quot;, GL_VERTEX_SHADER))   == 0) return 0;
  if ((fs = create_shader(&quot;postproc.f.glsl&quot;, GL_FRAGMENT_SHADER)) == 0) return 0;

  program_postproc = glCreateProgram();
  glAttachShader(program_postproc, vs);
  glAttachShader(program_postproc, fs);
  glLinkProgram(program_postproc);
  glGetProgramiv(program_postproc, GL_LINK_STATUS, &amp;link_ok);
  if (!link_ok) {
    fprintf(stderr, &quot;glLinkProgram:&quot;);
    print_log(program_postproc);
    return 0;
  }
  glValidateProgram(program_postproc);
  glGetProgramiv(program_postproc, GL_VALIDATE_STATUS, &amp;validate_ok); 
  if (!validate_ok) {
    fprintf(stderr, &quot;glValidateProgram:&quot;);
    print_log(program_postproc);
  }

  attribute_name = &quot;v_coord&quot;;
  attribute_v_coord_postproc = glGetAttribLocation(program_postproc, attribute_name);
  if (attribute_v_coord_postproc == -1) {
    fprintf(stderr, &quot;Could not bind attribute %s\n&quot;, attribute_name);
    return 0;
  }

  uniform_name = &quot;fbo_texture&quot;;
  uniform_fbo_texture = glGetUniformLocation(program_postproc, uniform_name);
  if (uniform_fbo_texture == -1) {
    fprintf(stderr, &quot;Could not bind uniform %s\n&quot;, uniform_name);
    return 0;
  }
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
/* free_resources */
  glDeleteProgram(program_postproc);
&lt;/source&gt;

== Drawing ==

We've got all our pre-requisites, so now how do we draw to the texture?

In &lt;code&gt;onDisplay&lt;/code&gt;, let's add:
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
  glBindFramebuffer(GL_FRAMEBUFFER, fbo);
  // draw (without glutSwapBuffers)
  glBindFramebuffer(GL_FRAMEBUFFER, 0);
&lt;/source&gt;

We've changed the destination framebuffer to our own framebuffer, drawn the scene (to its texture), and then switched back to the physical screen's framebuffer (&lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;).

Now we can display the texture on screen, using our new program:
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
  glClearColor(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0);
  glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT|GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT);

  glUseProgram(program_postproc);
  glBindTexture(GL_TEXTURE_2D, fbo_texture);
  glUniform1i(uniform_fbo_texture, /*GL_TEXTURE*/0);
  glEnableVertexAttribArray(attribute_v_coord_postproc);

  glBindBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, vbo_fbo_vertices);
  glVertexAttribPointer(
    attribute_v_coord_postproc,  // attribute
    2,                  // number of elements per vertex, here (x,y)
    GL_FLOAT,           // the type of each element
    GL_FALSE,           // take our values as-is
    0,                  // no extra data between each position
    0                   // offset of first element
  );
  glDrawArrays(GL_TRIANGLE_STRIP, 0, 4);
  glDisableVertexAttribArray(attribute_v_coord_postproc);

  glutSwapBuffers();
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Gotchas ===

When manipulating multiple program, you need to make sure that all code that rely on the current program works on the right program.
In particular, we added &lt;code&gt;glUniform&lt;/code&gt; calls in &lt;code&gt;onIdle&lt;/code&gt;, so make sure you have the right &lt;code&gt;glUseProgram&lt;/code&gt; before setting the uniforms, or you'll get a blank screen due to a missing MVP matrix (and OpenGL won't tell you).

== Shaders ==

First, let's implement an identity (no-change) shader, we'll modify it later to create a first effect.

We chose not to pre-compute the texture coordinates, so the vertex shader will do it:
&lt;source lang=&quot;glsl&quot;&gt;
attribute vec2 v_coord;
uniform sampler2D fbo_texture;
varying vec2 f_texcoord;

void main(void) {
  gl_Position = vec4(v_coord, 0.0, 1.0);
  f_texcoord = (v_coord + 1.0) / 2.0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;
Nothing fancy.

Now the fragment shader will be able to pick pixels anywhere we want in the texture - we're not restricted to the current pixel anymore!
&lt;source lang=&quot;glsl&quot;&gt;
uniform sampler2D fbo_texture;
varying vec2 f_texcoord;

void main(void) {
  gl_FragColor = texture2D(fbo_texture, f_texcoord);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

== A first effect ==

Let's implement a very basic post-processing effect: a static wave on the screen, using the &lt;code&gt;sin&lt;/code&gt; function.
There is a similar (but more complex) effect in God of War III during the Poseidon Hippocamp's water breathing attack.

[[File:OpenGL Tutorial Post-processing Water.png|thumb|Suzanne takes a bath]]
The idea is to postpone the x axis regularly, changing progressively on the y axis:
&lt;source lang=&quot;glsl&quot;&gt;
uniform sampler2D fbo_texture;
uniform float offset;
varying vec2 f_texcoord;

void main(void) {
  vec2 texcoord = f_texcoord;
  texcoord.x += sin(texcoord.y * 4*2*3.14159 + offset) / 100;
  gl_FragColor = texture2D(fbo_texture, texcoord);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

We have 4 vertical sin waves, and its amplitude is 1/100 of the screen width.

&lt;code&gt;offset&lt;/code&gt; is used to animate, by changing the starting point of the &lt;code&gt;sin&lt;/code&gt; function, we define this uniform as:
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
/* onIdle() */
  glUseProgram(program_postproc);
  GLfloat move = glutGet(GLUT_ELAPSED_TIME) / 1000.0 * 2*3.14159 * .75;  // 3/4 of a wave cycle per second
  glUniform1f(uniform_offset, move);
&lt;/source&gt;

We've done our first post-processing effect!

Feel free to request a task to be added, any repetitive tasks and/or tedious work would be good candidates.

Please notify me on [[User_talk:Hethrir| My Talk Page]] if I make an erroneous change.

= Tasks =
These tasks operate by request, you may leave a message on [[User_talk:Hethrir|my talk page]], you may also request certain bot actions to be done. For clarification, each task may be done separately.


* Dewikify pages, either removing all links on a page, or linking to wikipedia.
* Fix spelling errors.
* Check for dead links to external websites, and leave a message on the talk page.
* Welcome new users.(it can sign someones name for them)


* Move all articles under one category to another.
* Clean the sandbox(s).
* Delete large numbers of pages(with permission, obviously).
* Change one image to another, or completely remove images.
* Looks for images that are linked inline (i.e., they are hosted from an external server and hotlinked.).
* Given an existing or new category, find pages for that category.
* Move pages.
* Fix broken and double redirects.
* Check references to see if they are properly formatted
* Converts external links and notes/references to Footnote3 ref/note format.  Rewrites References.
* Change html tables to wiki tables.
* Change one template to another.
* Unlink a page on every page that links to it.

= Cosmetic changes =

* ''fix self interwiki'': interwiki links to the site itself are displayed like local links, removing their language code prefix.
* ''standardize page footer'': makes sure that categories, stars templates for featured articles and interwiki links are put to the correct position. templates and interwiki links are sorted into the right order.
* ''clean up links'': improves how links are presented by doing the following:
** replaces underlines by spaces, also multiple underlines.
** removes unnecessary leading spaces from a title.
** removes unnecessary trailing spaces from a title.
** converts URL-encoded characters to unicode.
** removes unnecessary initial and final spaces from a label.
** tries to capitalize the first letter of the title.
* ''clean up section headers'': for better readability of section header source code, puts a space between the equal signs and the title; for example: &quot;==Section title==&quot; becomes &quot;== Section title ==&quot; .
* ''put spaces in lists'': for better readability of bullet list and enumeration wiki source code, puts a space between the * or # and the text.
* ''translate and capitalize namespaces'': makes sure that localized namespace names are used. Does not change &quot;image&quot; alias on en-wiki or fr-wiki.
* ''resolve html entities''
* ''valid xhtml'': tries to make a valid XHTML document, for example, replacing &quot;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&quot; by &quot;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&quot;
* ''remove useless spaces''
* ''remove non breaking space before percent'': newer MediaWiki versions automatically place a non-breaking space in front of a percent sign, so it is no longer required to place it manually.
* ''fix syntax'': correct mediawiki syntax for external links
* ''fix HTML'': translates some HTML-entities into the corresponding mediawiki syntax; remove unneeded &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ref /&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; tag.
* ''fix style'': convert prettytable to wikitable class (de-wiki and en-wiki only).
* ''fix typo'': change ccm with preleading number to cm³; change º to ° if it concerns degree Celsius or Fahrenheit
* ''hyphenate isbn numbers'': tries to hyphenate an ISBN</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
In the last chapter, five types of forces were mentioned. Those forces are: `normal force, friction, tension, weight, and drag. In this chapter, we will focus on three types of forces: friction, drag, and centripetal acceleration. These forces are all forces that we encounter in our daily lives, and there are plenty of examples highlighting the importance of these forces. For example, a race car must be designed so that it encounters minimal air resistance as it moves along the track. In addition, the tires must be specially manufactured so that there is minimal friction between the tires and the track.
==Friction==
Friction is a force that always opposes all motion; it always acts in a direction exactly opposite to that in which an object is moving (or trying to move), and typically comes when the object rubs or drags against another object as it moves.  It is defined as &lt;math&gt;{\vec f}=\mu{\vec N}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the coefficient of friction, and &lt;math&gt;{\vec N}&lt;/math&gt; is the normal force acting on the object. There are two types of friction, static and kinetic, also known as sliding friction. Static friction is the amount of initial force required to move an object, and kinetic friction is the amount of force required to sustain motion in an object. Because of this, static friction is always greater than or equal to kinetic friction.
==Drag==
Drag is similar to friction, in the sense that it always acts in the direction opposite of motion, but unlike friction, drag occurs from air or water. Thus, the air resistance experienced by a race car is a type of drag.

      <comment>/* Mesa */ add link to Mesa environment variables page</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">= Mesa =

If you are using the Mesa OpenGL implementation you can set the following environment variables:
* LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1 : use the software implementation, without using the graphic card at all.  This help when:
** you suspect a bug in a driver,
** you want to try an alternative implementation (as if you were using a different graphic card),
** you want to check whether a graphic glitch is due to unitialized memory or to a programming mistake
* MESA_DEBUG=1 : will output diagnostic messages in erroneous situations (e.g. assigning a uniform when the program is not linked)

See also Mesa's [http://mesa3d.org/debugging.html debugging] and [http://www.mesa3d.org/envvars.html environment variables] pages.

= Common mistakes =

If you manually draw lines or triangles, and nothing appears:
* check that your 4th coordinate is 1 and not 0
* check that you properly set glEnableVertexAttribArray / glBindBuffer / glVertexAttribPointer
* double-check that you used the right variables (bad copy/paste...) - avoid global variables to help this
* triple-check your &lt;code&gt;glUniform*&lt;/code&gt; calls, including the type (3fv, 4fv...) - OpenGL is unforgiving ''and'' silent
* beware that glDrawElements' 4th and last parameter (&lt;code&gt;indices&lt;/code&gt;) is expressed in byte offset from the start, not in number of elements from the start, even when working with IBOs

= Stencil buffer =

For tips on how to debug the stencil buffer, you can check the [[../Stencil_buffer#Debugging|Stencil buffer]] section.

= Links =

* [[GLSL_Programming/Blender/Debugging_of_Shaders|Debugging of Shaders]] in the GLSL wikibooks (about debugging with colors)
* [[OpenGL_Programming/Installation/Android_NDK#Debugging|Debugging Android NDK]] for debugging OpenGL NDK application on Android

How do you expect local teachers to react on reading this?

Much of this is racist:

“Popular culture in Hong Kong is fast moving, dominated by brief fads, eclectic, highly gender-based and at times may seem infantile to an outsider.”

Or stupid:

“However, the biggest challenge for Chinese speakers who are learning English is grammar. Cantonese, like all other Chinese dialects, is an isolating, non-agglutinative language. It has no suffixes or prefixes, no system of changing word-endings to mark plurals, declension or tenses” and on and on the writer goes…with a lot of tripe they have copied and pasted without understanding or thinking through.

The author shouldn't be allowed near a school unless they want to provoke an international incident.</text>

      <comment>TODO: audio streams</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">[https://github.com/apitrace/apitrace apitrace] is a nice [[../Debugging|debugging]] tool.

It has a save/replay feature that captures everything you told the graphic card, and can reproduce it later on, and even save the result as a stream of pictures.

We'll use this to create a video suitable for upload at Wikicommons!

== Compilation (instructions for GNU/Linux) ==

Get the source code:
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
cd /usr/src/
git clone https://github.com/apitrace/apitrace.git
cd apitrace/
&lt;/source&gt;

Install cmake and the dependencies:
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
apt-get install cmake libx11-dev
&lt;/source&gt;

Compile!
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
cmake -H. -Bbuild
cd build
make
&lt;/source&gt;

Note: For 32bit build on 64bit host:
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
CFLAGS=&quot;-m32&quot; CXXFLAGS=&quot;-m32&quot; cmake -H. -Bbuild
&lt;/source&gt;

== Capture ==

Let's test with the simple wave post-processing effect:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
cd wikibooks-opengl-modern-tutorials/obj-viewer/
LD_PRELOAD=/usr/src/apitrace/build/wrappers/glxtrace.so ./obj-viewer
&lt;/source&gt;

Run the program for a few seconds, rotate the object, zoom, etc., and then quit the program.

This will create a &lt;code&gt;obj-viewer.trace&lt;/code&gt; binary file. If the file already exists, it will create &lt;code&gt;obj-viewer.1.trace&lt;/code&gt;, and so on.

== Replay ==

You use the &lt;code&gt;glretrace&lt;/code&gt; command, passing it the trace file as parameter:
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
/usr/src/apitrace/build/glretrace suzanne.trace
&lt;/source&gt;

Of course, this is not interactive anymore, this is just a replay.

== Convert to video ==

Let's install ffmpeg:
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
apt-get install ffmpeg
&lt;/source&gt;

Note: we tried to use ffmpeg's scaling filter to reduce the screen size (&lt;code&gt;-vf scale=200:150&lt;/code&gt;), but sadly it caused a segfault however we tried&lt;ref&gt;This bug might be related to https://ffmpeg.org/trac/ffmpeg/ticket/397&lt;/ref&gt;.  So instead we just recompiled the application and specified a smaller screen size directly.

ffmpeg's options are organized the following way:
 ffmpeg &lt;input options&gt; -i source &lt;output options&gt; destination

* We'll use a &lt;code&gt;.ogg&lt;/code&gt; output since that's the only format accepted by Wikicommons (if you know who could get support for the free and better .webm format, please contact him/her!).
* The screen used during the tutorial has a refresh rate of 75Hz, but videos usually are 25 images/s, so we'll reduce the rate (double input and ouput &lt;code&gt;-r&lt;/code&gt; parameters)
* We'll use a fixed, good quality (&lt;code&gt;-qscale&lt;/code&gt;)
* We overwrite the destination file (&lt;code&gt;-y&lt;/code&gt;)

We get:
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
/usr/src/apitrace/build/glretrace -s - suzanne.trace \
  | ffmpeg -r 75 -f image2pipe -vcodec ppm -i pipe: -r 25 -qscale 31 -y output.ogg
&lt;/source&gt;

We've got our video - and no additional code was needed.

Here's the result!

= WebGL variant =

When running a WebGL application, capturing the browser didn't work well for us: performance was poor, and it captured the whole Firefox window - not just the animation.

So we implemented an internal capture system:

== Time control ==

One pro of doing the capture manually is that you can control the time flow as slow as you want, and hence avoid any performance issue during the capture.
We did so by adding a little wrapper around the time function (in our case, threejs'):
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
    var capture_rate = 30;
    var capture_frame = 0;
    ...
    function getElapsedTime() {
        if (capture) {
            return capture_frame/capture_rate;
        } else {
            return clock.getElapsedTime();
        }
    }
    ...
    function render() {
        ...
        var angle = getElapsedTime() * 10;  // 10° per second
        ...
        if (capture) {
            capture_frame++;
        }
    }
&lt;/source&gt;

We decided to use a 30FPS frame rate, which is common in videos (as of 2013).

== Copy the WebGL frame ==

Use your WebGL canvas' &lt;code&gt;toDataURL&lt;/code&gt; method :

&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
var base64_encoded_image = renderer.domElement.toDataURL();
&lt;/source&gt;

This returns a base64-encoded image in the form &lt;code&gt;data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAA...&lt;/code&gt;.

== Export using AJAX ==

JavaScript cannot save local files directly, so we'll export these images to a webserver using Ajax :
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
    if (capture) {
        capture_frame++;
        r = XMLHttpRequest();
        r.open('POST', 'http://localhost:1337/' + capture_frame);
        r.send(renderer.domElement.toDataURL().substr(&quot;data:image/png;base64,&quot;.length));
    }
&lt;/source&gt;

== Minimal web server ==

We can write a minimal webserver that will just store the images we exported, using NodeJS:
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
var http = require('http');
var fs = require('fs');
http.createServer(function (req, res) {
    var idx = req.url.split('/')[1];
    var filename = &quot;capture/&quot; + (&quot;0000&quot; + idx).slice(-5)+&quot;.png&quot;;
    var img = '';
    req.on('data', function(chunk) { img += chunk });
    req.on('end', function() {
        f = fs.writeFileSync(filename, Buffer(img));
        res.end();
    });
    console.log('Wrote ' + filename);
}).listen(1337, '127.0.0.1');
console.log('Server running at http://127.0.0.1:1337/');
&lt;/source&gt;

You can run it with :
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
mkdir capture/
nodejs save_capture.js
&lt;/source&gt;

== Assemble the video ==

This step is similar to the one with glretrace above. We'll just use a special syntax to grab all the PNG files:
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
avconv -r 30 -i capture/%05d.png -y capture/output.webm
&lt;/source&gt;

(By the way, avconv is a fork/alternative to ffmpeg, with nearly similar command-line options.)

We're done: we've got a perfect-sync capture of our WebGL animation!

Contribution on how to capture synchronized application audio streams would be welcome :)

      <comment>/* Drawing a surface */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:OpenGL Tutorial Graph 05.png|thumb|Hidden line removal]]

= Introduction =

In the [[OpenGL Programming/Scientific OpenGL Tutorial 04|previous tutorial]],
we have drawn a three-dimensional graph using grid lines.
This allowed you to look through the graph, but for more complex functions,
this can be rather confusing.
It would be much nicer to draw the graph as a continuous, opaque surface.
In this tutorial we will see how to do that.

= Front and back faces =

Since our graph is not a close surface, but rather a sheet with some bumps in it,
it is possible, depending on the orientation, to see both sides of the graph.
When OpenGL draws a triangle, it automatically determines which side of the triangle is facing the camera,
the front or the back face (see also the [[GLSL Programming/GLUT/Two-Sided Surfaces|two-sided surfaces GLSL tutorial]]).
We will change the fragment shader from the previous tutorial slightly
to draw back facing triangles only half as bright as front facing triangles,
making it easy to distinguish which side of the graph we are looking at.
We will also introduce the uniform color, so that we can modulate the color depending on whether we are drawing the surface or the grid.

&lt;source lang=&quot;glsl&quot;&gt;
#version 120

varying vec4 graph_coord;
uniform vec4 color;

void main(void) {
  float factor;

  if(gl_FrontFacing)
          factor = 1.0;
  else
          factor = 0.5;

  gl_FragColor = (graph_coord / 2.0 + 0.5) * color * factor;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

= Drawing a surface =

In the previous tutorial, we created a VBO which contained all the x and y coordinates of the graph.
We also created an IBO that traced the horizontal and vertical grid lines.
To draw a surface, we will reuse the VBO,
but we will have to create a new IBO that describes how to draw the triangles that make up the surface of the graph:

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
GLushort indices[100 * 100 * 6];
int i = 0;

// Triangles
for(int y = 0; y &lt; 100; y++) {
  for(int x = 0; x &lt; 100; x++) {
    indices[i++] = y * 101 + x;
    indices[i++] = y * 101 + x + 1;
    indices[i++] = (y + 1) * 101 + x + 1;

    indices[i++] = y * 101 + x;
    indices[i++] = (y + 1) * 101 + x + 1;
    indices[i++] = (y + 1) * 101 + x;
  }
}

GLuint surface_ibo;
glGenBuffers(1, &amp;surface_ibo);
glBindBuffer(GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER, surface_ibo);
glBufferData(GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER, sizeof indices, indices, GL_STATIC_DRAW);
&lt;/source&gt;

To draw the surface with the new shader, we use the following commands:

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
GLfloat white[4] = {1, 1, 1, 1};
glUniform4fv(uniform_color, 1, white);

glEnableVertexAttribArray(attribute_coord2d);
glBindBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, vbo);
glVertexAttribPointer(attribute_coord2d, 2, GL_FLOAT, GL_FALSE, 0, 0);
glBindBuffer(GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER, surface_ibo);
glDrawElements(GL_TRIANGLES, 100 * 100 * 6, GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT, 0);
&lt;/source&gt;

If you do this, and rotate the graph, you will notice that depending on the orientation,
the surface is not always drawn correctly.
In orientations where the back most triangles are drawn first, there is no problem.
However, when the front most triangles are drawn first, triangles that are more to the back can overwrite the triangles that are in the front.
To prevent this from happening, we need to enable the depth buffer of course.
In the &lt;tt&gt;main()&lt;/tt&gt; function, use:

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
glutInitDisplayMode(GLUT_RGBA|GLUT_DEPTH|GLUT_DOUBLE);
&lt;/source&gt;

And in &lt;tt&gt;init_resources()&lt;/tt&gt; add:

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
glEnable(GL_DEPTH_TEST);
&lt;/source&gt;

Also do not forget to clear the depth buffer before drawing a new frame:

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT | GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT);
&lt;/source&gt;

Exercises:
* Could we not simply reverse the order in which we draw the triangles when necessary? Perhaps with a negative stride parameter in the &lt;tt&gt;glVertexAttribPointer()&lt;/tt&gt; call?
* Try changing the order of the vertices in the triangles in various ways.
* Try to get the same result without specifying backside triangles by using glEnable(GL_CULL_FACE) and glCullFace(GL_FRONT_AND_BACK).

= Drawing the grid on top of the surface =

Although the surface has its appeals, it is much harder to see subtle curves.
It would be nice to draw the grid on top of the surface.
We already know how to do that, so we just switch back to our grid IBO and draw using GL_LINES after we have drawn the surface.
However, we have to give the grid lines a different color than the surface.
Let's make them twice as bright as the surface:

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
GLfloat bright[4] = {2, 2, 2, 1};
glUniform4fv(uniform_color, 1, bright);

glBindBuffer(GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER, ibo);
glDrawElements(GL_LINES, 100 * 101 * 4, GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT, 0);
&lt;/source&gt;

When you do this, you will notice two things.
The grid lines look horrible, but you can no longer see &quot;hidden&quot; grid lines.
This is all because the depth test, by default, will ensure only fragments are drawn that are closer to the camera than any existing fragment at that position.
The surface was drawn first, so no fragments will be drawn that are behind it.
But if the grid lines are using the same vertices as the surface, you would expect the depth to be exactly the same.
With the default depth test, you would think no grid lines should appear at all.
In reality though, a line is not drawn in the same way as a triangle, and floating point rounding errors will cause some grid fragments to be slightly in front, and some slightly behind the surface.

To fix the grid lines, they should be drawn slightly closer to the camera than the surface,
or the surface should be drawn slightly farther away.
We could do that by applying a translation to the MVP matrix, but there is an OpenGL call that specifically addresses this problem:

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
glPolygonOffset(1, 1);
glEnable(GL_POLYGON_OFFSET_FILL);
&lt;/source&gt;

This will cause triangles (but not lines or points) to be drawn with a slightly increased depth value,
with the result that the grid lines now appear as they should.

Exercises:
* Make it so you can turn the polygon offset on and off with the F4 key.
* The default depth test function is &quot;lesser than&quot; (GL_LESS). Try changing it to &quot;lesser than or equal&quot; with &lt;tt&gt;glDepthFunc(GL_LEQUAL)&lt;/tt&gt;. Does it help?
* Try different values for &lt;tt&gt;glPolygonOffset()&lt;/tt&gt;, larger and/or negative.
* Between drawing the surface and the grid, try clearing either the depth buffer or the color buffer.
* Would it be possible to draw the grid before drawing the surface?

      <comment>Removed &quot;3d10&quot; from Se valence electrons. It is counted in core electrons</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{TOC right}}

Combining what we have learned from the previous lessons, we can now determine how the core electrons and the valence electrons relate to the properties of families in the periodic table. We have looked at the trend of the number of valence electrons within each group and now we will expand this to include a look at the trends that exist between the sublevel of valence electrons and the relative ability of an element to react in a chemical reaction. We will explore the possibility of predicting chemical reactivity based on the number of valence electrons and the sublevel to which they belong. Let's begin our lesson with a review of the core electrons and discuss their application in chemical reactions. Following this, we will have a similar discussion about valence electrons.

==Lesson Objectives==
* Explain the role of the core electrons.
* Explain the role of valence electrons in determining chemical properties.
* Explain how the chemical reactivity trend in a chemical family is related to atomic size.

==Core Electrons Can be Ignored in Determining an Element's Chemistry==
As learned in an earlier lesson, the core electrons are the inner electrons found in the electron configuration for the element. These electrons fill up the inner sublevels and are thus not responsible for bonding and are not involved in chemical reactions. The core electrons also are not directly responsible for determining the properties of the elements. Remember that the core electrons represent all of the electrons except for the valence electrons.

Look at the electron configuration for beryllium (Be).
:Be: 1''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

There are two core electrons (1''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and two valence electrons (2''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).

When we look at the electron configuration for Selenium (Se), we see the following.
:Se: 1''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2''p''&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;3''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;3''p''&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;4''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;3''d''&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;4''p''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;

There are 28 core electrons (1''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2''p''&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;3''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;3''p''&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;4''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;3''d''&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;) and six valence electrons (4''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;4''p''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;). Again, none of the core electrons from either of these elements, or any element for that matter, will participate in chemical reactions.
{{High School Chemistry/Example|Sample Question}}
What are the core electrons in each of the following?
: (a) O: 1''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2''p''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;
: (b) In: [Kr]5''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;4''d''&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;5''p''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;
----
'''Solution''':
: (a) O: core electrons = 1''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, therefore there are two of them.
: (b) In: indium has three valence electrons and all the rest are core electrons. The core electrons include all the electrons in the energy levels below ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;5. (4''d''&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; are core electrons since they are held in a lower energy level.)
{{Robox/Close}}

==Valence Electrons Determine Chemical Properties==
The valence electrons, unlike the core electrons, are responsible for all of the chemical reactions that take place between elements. They determine the properties of the elements. We have already learned that all metallic elements in the main group elements are able to lose their valence electrons since the energy requirements to do so are relatively low. The non-metallic elements (other than noble gases) are able to gain electrons readily because of high electron affinities. For elements in Group 3A, the atoms will have to lose three electrons to have electron configurations similar to the previous noble gas. For elements in Group 6A,
they will have to gain two electrons to have similar electron configurations as their nearest noble gas. Earlier we determined that all elements in the same group have the same Lewis electron dot diagram. What this means is that all elements in the same group have the same number of valence electrons and will react the same way to gain or lose electrons when participating in reactions. The number of valence electrons determines what types of chemical properties the elements will have.

When you look at Table 9.11, you can see that the Group 1A metals all have the same number of valence electrons and also have the same appearance. These metals also react the same way under similar conditions.

|}

We can see that all of the elements in the Group 1A metals all have one valence electron in their outer energy levels. This means that they can lose this one electron and become isoelectronic with a noble gas configuration. Thus, elements in Group 1A will readily lose this electron because it takes very low energy to remove this one outer electron.

As the atomic number increases for the elements in the alkali metal family group, the valence electron is further away from the nucleus. The attraction between the valence electron and the nucleus decreases as the atomic size increases. The further the electrons are away from the nucleus, the less hold the nucleus has on the electrons. Therefore the more readily the electrons can be removed and the faster the reactions can take place. So, the valence electrons will determine what reactions will occur and how fast they will occur based on the number of electrons that are in the valence energy level. All Group 1A elements will lose one
electron and form a 1+ cation.

Looking at Table 9.12 for the electron configuration of the Group 2A metals, we see that the outer energy level holds two electrons for each of the metals in Group 2A.

|}

As with the Group 1A metals, the Group 2A metals will form cations by losing the ''s'' electrons, but this time they will lose two electrons. And, as with the Group 1A elements, the elements are more reactive as the atomic number increases because the s electrons are held further away from the nucleus.

Consider the electron configurations for the elements in family 7A (the halogens).

|}

The elements in group 7A were placed in the same chemical family because they all have similar chemistry, that is, they react with other substances in similar ways and their compounds with the same metals have similar properties. Now we know why they have similar chemical properties… because chemical properties are controlled by the valence electrons and these elements all have the same configuration of valence electrons.

The trend for chemical reactivity (speed of reaction) for the non-metal families is the reverse of the situation in the metal families. The metallic families lose electrons and the largest atoms lose their electrons most easily so the larger the atom, the faster it reacts. In the case of the non-metals, such as the halogens, the atoms react by taking on electrons. In these families, the smaller atoms have the largest electron affinity and therefore take on electrons more readily. Hence, in the non-metals, the smaller atoms will be more reactive.

==Lesson Summary==
* Core electrons are the inner electrons that are in filled orbitals and sublevels. 
* Core electrons are not responsible for chemical reactivity and do not participate in chemical reactions.
* Valence electrons are the outermost electrons, are responsible for determining the properties, and are the electrons that participate in chemical reactions.
* Because the members of each group in the main group elements has the same number of valence electrons, there are similar properties and similar trends in chemical reactions found in the group.
* For metals, chemical reactivity tends to increase with increases in atomic size because the outermost electrons (or the valence electrons) are further away from the nucleus and therefore have less attraction for the nucleus.

==Review Questions==
# What is the difference between valence electrons and core electrons?
# Why would the valence electrons be responsible for the chemical reactivity?
# Which of the following pairs of elements would have the greatest similarities in terms of chemical properties?

The main group elements are actually in two groups: the ''s'' block and the ''p'' block. These two, let's call them sub groups, are separated in the Periodic Table by a special group of highly colorful compounds known as the transition metals. The transition metals represent groups 1B through 8B of the diagram below and are formed as electrons are filling in the ''d'' orbitals. This is why they are referred to as the ''d'' block. We will look at all of this in the lesson that follows.

:[[File:Periodic Table structure.svg|500px]]

==Lesson Objectives==
* Define transition metals.
* Explain the relationship between transition metals and the ''d'' sublevels.
* State the periods that contain transition metals.
* Write electron configurations for some transition metals.

==Elements Whose Atoms are Filling ''d'' Sublevels==
The elements in groups 1B through 8B (also known as 3 through 12) are called the '''transition metals'''. Sometimes this block of elements are referred to as the ''d'' block. They are called ''d'' block elements because the electrons being added in this block of elements are being added to the ''d'' orbitals. Look at the electron configurations for Scandium (Sc), Titanium (Ti), and Vanadium (V), the first three transition metals of the first row in the ''d'' block.

:{|
|&lt;math&gt;_{21}\text{Sc}&lt;/math&gt;: || &lt;math&gt;1s^22s^22p^63s^23p^64s^23d^1&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|&lt;math&gt;_{22}\text{Ti}&lt;/math&gt;: || &lt;math&gt;1s^22s^22p^63s^23p^64s^23d^2&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|style=&quot;text-align:right;&quot;|&lt;math&gt;_{23}\text{V}&lt;/math&gt;: || &lt;math&gt;1s^22s^22p^63s^23p^64s^23d^3&lt;/math&gt;
|}

Notice that as the atomic number increases, the number of electrons in the ''d'' sublevels increases as well. This is why the phrase ''d'' block was started for the transition metals. The transition metals were given their name because they had a place between Group 2A (now Group 2) and Group 3A (now Group 13) in the main group elements. Therefore, in order to get from calcium to gallium in the Periodic Table, you had to transition your way through the first row of the ''d'' block (Sc → Zn). To get from strontium to indium, you had to transition your way through the second row of the ''d'' block (Y → Cd) .

One interesting point about the transition metals that is worth mentioning is that many of the compounds of these metals are highly colored and used in dyes and paint pigments. Also, metallic ions of transition elements are responsible for the lovely colors of many gems such as jade, turquoise and amethyst.

==Transition Metals Occur in Periods 4 – 7==
As stated before, transition metals are also called the ''d'' block because they fill up the ''d'' sublevels. Therefore, the first three periods do not have transition elements because those energy levels do not have ''d'' sub-shells. The transition metals have atomic numbers greater than 20 because the first ''d'' electron appears in element #21 after the 1''s'', 2''s'', 2''p'', 3''s'', 3''p'', and 4''s'' orbitals are filled.

To complete our look at the periodic table there is one more group we have to consider. This group holds its own unique position in any pictorial representation of the Periodic Table. The two rows that are generally placed underneath the main Periodic Table are called the lanthanide series and the actinide series. These two rows are produced when electrons are being added to ''f'' orbitals. Therefore, this block of elements are referred to as the &quot;''f'' block&quot;. The lanthanides are also occasionally referred to the ''rare earth elements''. The ''f'' block, as shown in the figure below, are the two rows in yellow.

==Lesson Objectives==
* Define the lanthanides and actinides.
* Place the lanthanides and actinides in the periodic table.
* Explain the importance of both the lanthanides and actinides.
* Write electron configurations for lanthanides and actinides.

==Elements Whose Atoms are Filling ''f'' Sublevels==
There is one group that we have neglected to mention throughout this chapter. This group belongs to a special group found almost disjointed, if you like, from the Periodic Table. They are given the names the Lanthanide Series and the Actinide Series or the '''lanthanides''' and the '''actinides'''. The lanthanides are an important group of elements. Most of them are formed when uranium and plutonium undergo nuclear reactions. The elements of the lanthanide series are also known as the ''rare earth'' elements. Both the lanthanides and the actinides make up what are known as the ''inner transition series''. The ''f'' block is given this
name because if the ''f'' block were placed in its proper numerical position in the Periodic Table, it would be in the transition metals between groups 2 and 3.

The lanthanide series includes elements from number 58 to 71, which is 14 elements. The ''f'' sub-level contains seven orbitals and each orbital will hold two electrons. Therefore, it is possible to place 14 electrons in the 4''f'' sub-level.

The lanthanide series fills the 4''f'' sublevel as you move from cerium (Ce) to lutetium (Lu). The same holds for the actinide series that runs from atomic number 90 through to number 103, again 14 elements. Thus, as you move from thorium (Th) at element number 90, you begin to fill up the 5''f'' sublevel and continue to fill up the 5''f'' sublevel until you finish the actinide series at lawrencium (Lr).

==Lanthanides and Actinides Vary in Electron Filling Order==
The lanthanides and the actinides make up the ''f'' block of the Periodic Table. The lanthanides are the elements produced as the 4''f'' sublevel is filled with electrons and the actinides are formed while filling the 5''f'' sublevel. Generally speaking, the lanthanides have electron configurations that follow the Aufbau rule. There are some variations, however, in a few of the lanthanide elements. We will expand a tiny portion of the Periodic Table below to show what happens to some of the electron configurations in the lanthanide and actinide series.

Look, for example, at the electron configuration for cerium, the first element of the lanthanide series. Cerium, Ce, is element number 58.

:&lt;sub&gt;58&lt;/sub&gt;Ce: 1''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2''p''&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;3''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;3''p''&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;4''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;3''d''&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;4''p''&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;5''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;4''d''&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;5''p''&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;6''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;5''d''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;4''f''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

or

:&lt;sub&gt;58&lt;/sub&gt;Ce: [Xe]6''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;5''d''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;4''f''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

Now look at the electronic configuration for praseodymium, an element used in the making of aircraft engines but also in lighting for making movies. Praseodymium, Pr, is element number 59 and has the following electron configuration.

:&lt;sub&gt;59&lt;/sub&gt;Pr: 1''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2''p''&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;3''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;3''p''&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;4''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;3''d''&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;4''p''&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;5''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;4''d''&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;5''p''&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;6''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;4''f''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;

or

:&lt;sub&gt;59&lt;/sub&gt;Pr: [Xe]6''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;4''f''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;

Notice the ''d'' electron is no longer a part of the electron configuration. There are three lanthanide metals that have properties similar to the ''d'' block. These are cerium, Ce, lutetium, Lu, and gadolinium, Gd. All of these metals contain a ''d'' electron in their electron configuration. The rest, like praseodymium, simply fill the 4''f'' sublevel as the atomic number increases.

Unlike the lanthanide family members, most of the actinide series are radioactive. Most of the elements in the actinide series have the same properties as the ''d'' block. Members of the actinide series can lose multiple numbers of electrons to form a variety of different ions. Table 9.14 shows the noble gas electron configuration for the elements of the actinide series.

==Lesson Summary==
* The lanthanide and actinide series make up the inner transition metals.
* The lanthanide series fill up the 4''f'' sublevel and the actinide series fill up the 5''f'' sublevel.
* The first, middle, and last member of the lanthanide series have properties of the ''f'' block and the ''d'' block.
* Many of the actinide series have properties of both the ''d'' block and the ''f'' block elements.

==Review Questions==
# Why are the ''f'' block elements referred to by some as inner transition elements?
# What do europium and americium have in common as far as their electron configuration?
# What is the electron configuration for Berkelium?
#: (a) [Xe]7''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;5''f''&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;
#: (b) [Xe]7''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;5''f''&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;6'd''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;
#: (c) [Rn]7''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;5''f''&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;
#: (d) [Rn]7''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;5''f''&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;6''d''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;
# How many ''f'' electrons are there in the electron configuration for einsteinium?
#: (a) 0
#: (b) 11
#: (c) 14
#: (d) 25
# Write the electron configuration for Ytterbium, Yb.
# What are the valence electrons for Ytterbium, Yb? What periods and sublevels are they in?
# Write the noble gas electronic configuration for uranium, U.
# What are the valence electrons for uranium, U? What periods and sublevels are they in?
# Write the electron configurations for neptunium and then for plutonium. Now write an explanation for what seems to be happening.

==Vocabulary==
; actinides
: The elements found in the second period of the ''f'' block. These elements fill up the 5''f'' sublevel.
; lanthanides
: The rare earth elements found in the first period of the ''f'' block. These elements fill up the 4''f'' sublevel.

== Sample Numbering system / Примерная система нумерации ==
=== English / Английский язык ===
Based on ''[[World Stamp Catalogue/Numbering System]]'' the following numbering system is being tried for Kazakhstan's stamps

 Format:  CCC - YYYY - SSDD - TTKK
          ---   ----   ----   ----
 Example: KAZ - 1992 - 0101 - 3201
          ---   ----   ----   ----
 where: KAZ  = 3-letter country code
                 (KAZ = Kazakhstan)
        YYYY = 4-digit year of issue
                 (1992 = Year of issue)
        SS   = 2-digit series order (varies by year)
                 (01 = first series for 1992)
        DD   = 2-digit denomination order (varies by series)
                 (01 = 1 kopek, 02 = 5 kopeks, 03 = 10 kopeks, etc.)
        TT   = 2-digit type and subtype (varies by denomination),   
                 (31 = Type III, 32 = Type IIIa)
        KK   = 2-digit color variation (varies by denomination),
                 (01 = first color for this denomination (blue))

A &quot;00&quot; in the DD position is reserved for collective details about the set.

This numbering system will likely change to some extent as more stamps are catalogued.

=== Russian / Русский язык ===
На основе ''[[World Stamp Catalogue/Numbering System/Russian|Системы нумерации Каталога марок мира (русский язык)]]'' предлагается следующая система нумерации для марок Республики Казахстан:

 Формат:  CCC - YYYY - SSDD - TTKK
          ---   ----   ----   ----
 Пример: KAZ - 1992 - 0101 - 3201
          ---   ----   ----   ----
 где: KAZ  = 3-буквенный код страны
                 (KAZ = Казахстан)
        YYYY = 4-значное обозначение года выпуска марки
                 (1992 = Год выпуска)
        SS   = 2-значное обозначение порядкового номера серии (варьируется по годам)
                 (01 = первая серия за 1992 г.)
        DD   = 2-значное обозначение номинала марки (варьируется от серии к серии)
                 (01 = 1 копейка, 02 = 5 копеек, 03 = 10 копеек, и т.п.)
        TT   = 2-значное обозначение типа и подтипа (варьируется по номиналам),   
                 (31 = Тип III, 32 = Тип IIIa)
        KK   = 2-значное обозначение разновидности цвета (варьируется по номиналам),
                 (01 = первый цвет для данного номинала (синий))

Номер &quot;00&quot; в элементе DD зарезервирован за сведениями, общими для всей серии.

В систему нумерации могут быть внесены определённые изменения по мере каталогизации почтовых марок.

== Perforation / Зубцовка ==
=== English / Английский язык ===
To keep the catalogue compact, stamp perforation is designated by following letters:

 C - Comb perforation
 L - Line perforation
 H - Harrow perforation

=== Russian / Русский язык ===
Для компактности каталога тип зубцовки марок обозначается литерами:

 C - гребенчатая зубцовка
 L - линейная зубцовка
 H - рамочная зубцовка

== Sample Numbering system / Примерная система нумерации ==
=== English / Английский язык ===
Based on ''[[World Stamp Catalogue/Numbering System]]'' the following numbering system is being tried for Kyrgyzstan's stamps

 Format:  CCC - YYYY - SSDD - TTKK
          ---   ----   ----   ----
 Example: KGZ - 1992 - 0101 - 3201
          ---   ----   ----   ----
 where: KGZ  = 3-letter country code
                 (KGZ = Kyrgyzstan)
        YYYY = 4-digit year of issue
                 (1992 = Year of issue)
        SS   = 2-digit series order (varies by year)
                 (01 = first series for 1992)
        DD   = 2-digit denomination order (varies by series)
                 (01 = 1 kopek, 02 = 5 kopeks, 03 = 10 kopeks, etc.)
        TT   = 2-digit type and subtype (varies by denomination),   
                 (31 = Type III, 32 = Type IIIa)
        KK   = 2-digit color variation (varies by denomination),
                 (01 = first color for this denomination (blue))

A &quot;00&quot; in the DD position is reserved for collective details about the set.

This numbering system will likely change to some extent as more stamps are catalogued.

=== Russian / Русский язык ===
На основе ''[[World Stamp Catalogue/Numbering System/Russian|Системы нумерации Каталога марок мира (русский язык)]]'' предлагается следующая система нумерации для почтовых марок Киргизской Республики:

 Формат:  CCC - ГГГГ - ННДД - TTЦЦ
          ---   ----   ----   ----
 Пример: KGZ - 1992 - 0101 - 3201
          ---   ----   ----   ----
 где: KGZ  = 3-буквенный международный код страны
                 (KGZ = Киргизия)
        ГГГГГ = 4-значное обозначение года выпуска марки
                 (1992 = Год выпуска)
        НН   = 2-значное обозначение порядкового номера серии (варьируется по годам)
                 (01 = первая серия за 1992 г.)
        ДД   = 2-значное обозначение номинала марки (варьируется от серии к серии)
                 (01 = 1 копейка, 02 = 5 копеек, 03 = 10 копеек, и т.п.)
        TT   = 2-значное обозначение типа и подтипа (варьируется по номиналам),   
                 (31 = Тип III, 32 = Тип IIIa)
        ЦЦ   = 2-значное обозначение разновидности цвета (варьируется по номиналам),
                 (01 = первый цвет для данного номинала (синий))

Номер &quot;00&quot; в элементе ДД зарезервирован за сведениями, общими для всей серии.

В систему нумерации могут быть внесены определённые изменения по мере каталогизации почтовых марок.

== Perforation / Зубцовка ==
=== English / Английский язык ===
To keep the catalogue compact, stamp perforation is designated by following letters:

 C - Comb perforation
 L - Line perforation
 H - Harrow perforation

=== Russian / Русский язык ===
Для компактности каталога тип зубцовки марок обозначается литерами:

 C - гребенчатая зубцовка
 L - линейная зубцовка
 H - рамочная зубцовка

      <text xml:space="preserve">====What it is====
In this page noise means '''[[w:Phase noise|phase noise]]''', even when it can be traced back to voltage noise, current noise, limit cycles of a DSP, etc.&lt;br&gt;
The signals have a fixed amplitude, and only their characteristic instants are affected by &quot;instabilities&quot;: whatever noise spectral density is measured (or calculated) is phase noise&lt;ref name = &quot;IEEE Std 1139-1999&quot;/&gt; only.
Phase noise is jitter ([[Clock and Data Recovery/Introduction/Definition of (phase) jitter#Definition of (phase) jitter|jitter is a  &quot;jittery&quot; time difference]]) that is not present in the remote clock that has been used to transmit the data stream.&lt;br /&gt;
Either phase noise or jitter, their representation is a one-sided spectral density (where the clock ''(=carrier)'' frequency has disappeared) and the Fourier frequency ranges from 0 to &amp;infin;; nevertheless it includes fluctuations from both the upper and the lower sidebands of the clock&lt;ref name = &quot;IEEE Std 1139-1999&quot;&gt;IEEE Std 1139-1999 IEEE Standard Definitions of Physical Quantities for Fundamental Frequency and Time Metrology—Random Instabilities, http://www.umbc.edu/photonics/Menyuk/Phase-Noise/Vig_IEEE_Standard_1139-1999%20.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;.


It is common practice to separate the phase noise picked up by the incoming signal before it reaches the CDR (the &quot;signal&quot; phase noise)&lt;br /&gt;
from the additional phase noise that is generated by the CDR itself and that is present even when the input signal is practically noiseless (the &quot;generated&quot; phase noise).&lt;br /&gt;
See for instance &lt;ref&gt;Keiji Kishine, Noboru Ishihara, Ken-ichi Takiguchi, Haruhiko Ichino, “A 2.5-Gb/s Clock and Data Recovery IC with Tunable Jitter Characteristics for Use in LAN's and WAN's” from IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits, June 1999&lt;/ref&gt;.

*'''The &quot;signal&quot; noise''' comes from impairments (line distortions, line noise, receiver first stages, intersymbol interference, ..) suffered by the signal before it reaches the PLL input.
:The PLL filters out the (high) frequencies of the jitter, because the true timing signal spectrum is known as to differ from the local clock only by a frequency offset and some low frequency wander. 
:This filtering action is modeled by the jitter transfer function.

*'''The &quot;generated&quot; noise''' is just the noise part that originates inside the CDR, and not the part that has been added to the signal along the preceding channel path.
&lt;p style=&quot;font-style:italic;text-align: left; width:auto; margin-left:50px;&quot;&gt; The source of jitter that probably most often troubles practical circuits, is the one coming from supply noise inside the CMos circuitry of the CDR itself.&lt;br /&gt;
The internal supply rails inside an IC are affected by high current transients, that are generated inside output buffers, clock trees and other large CMos stages inside the IC itself, even if such blocks are not part of the CDR proper.&lt;br /&gt;
Those large current spikes will cause small ripple waves on the voltage supply lines.&lt;br /&gt;
Other CMos stages, inside the receive paths and inside the CDR proper, see –as a result of the supply ripples- their switching threshold ripple by exactly half the amount of the supply ripple.&lt;br /&gt;
The rise and fall edges of the waveforms inside these CMos stages are not perfectly steep, but exhibit a certain non negligible slope.&lt;br /&gt;
It is easy to see that a '''change of the CMOS threshold during the edge transition''' corresponds exactly to an earlier (or to a later) switching of the CMos stage: this time change, occurring almost at random at different transitions, will be nothing but '''a generated jitter'''.&lt;br /&gt;
It can be minimised (and should be minimised) by careful design and layout of the supply scheme inside the IC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;font-style:italic;text-align: left; width:auto; margin-left:50px;&quot;&gt;The other noise source that often is the origin of '''generated jitter''' inside the PLL is the '''VCO noise'''.&lt;/p&gt;

====When it matters====
Noise matters when its level is comparable with the signal level to the point that its presence affects the important characteristics of the signal.

In the CDR case, phase noise (=unwanted jitter) matters if it influences the Bit Error Rate (BER).&lt;br /&gt;
A good tutorial on how to measure, identify and possibly mitigate the unwanted jitter in a CDR is the Ransom Stephens Jitter Tutorial &lt;ref&gt;Ransom Stephens, “Tektronics Jitter 360° Knowledge Series” from http://www.tek.com/learning/ &lt;/ref&gt;

====What is addressed here====
Many good books and papers address the CDR noise in general and the VCO noise (the main source of generated phase noise in actual CDRs) in particular. &lt;ref&gt;Leeson, D. B. (February 1966), &quot;A Simple Model of Feedback Oscillator Noise Spectrum&quot;, Proceedings of the IEEE 54 (2): 329–330, doi:10.1109/PROC.1966.4682 &lt;/ref&gt;, &lt;ref&gt;Noise Properties of PLL Systems, by Venceslav F. Kroupa, in IEEE Trans. Comm., vol. COM-30, pp. 2244-2252, October 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;, &lt;ref&gt;A General Theory of Phase Noise in Electrical Oscillators, by Ali Hajimiri and Thomas H. Lee, IEEE JOURNAL OF SOLID-STATE CIRCUITS, VOL. 33, NO. 2, FEBRUARY 1998  http://chic.caltech.edu/publication/a-general-theory-of-phase-noise-in-electrical-oscillators/&lt;/ref&gt;, &lt;ref&gt; &lt;/ref&gt;, .

Focus here is made on the reshaping (transfer function) that a particular structure &lt;small&gt;(of the three investigated in the following pages of this book: [[Clock and Data Recovery/Structures and types of CDRs/The CDR based on a first order PLL|1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; order, type 1]], [[Clock and Data Recovery/Structures and types of CDRs/The (slave) CDR based on a second order PLL/2nd order type 1|2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; order type 1]] and [[Clock and Data Recovery/Structures and types of CDRs/The (slave) CDR based on a second order PLL/2nd order type 2|2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; order type 2]])&lt;/small&gt; makes on the spectrum of the noise that is generated by the CDR circuitry itself.

As in previous and following pages, linear models of the three structures are used, but it will be suggested that the properties that the linear models identify are -to a good extent- present also in the non-linear variants of these structures.

====Noise modeling====
Noise is a &quot;small signal&quot; in the CDR, and can be studied with the linear models of the CDR blocks.
 
Noise may be injected at any node of a PLL, where only two nodes are significant: filter output and VCO output. ''(The node at the comparator output behaves the same as the PLL input, with the only difference of a flat gain G&lt;sub&gt;φ&lt;/sub&gt;)''

In general, using the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superposition_principle| superposition principle], reference can be made to the following figures:
[[File:Block diagram and noise equations 2-1.png|thumb|center|800x408px|alt = The phase noise generated inside each PLL block is modified before it appears at the PLL output. Block diagram and equations for the 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; order type 1 loop.|&lt;center&gt;&lt;small&gt;The phase noise generated inside each PLL block is modified before it appears at the PLL output,&lt;br /&gt;
block diagram and equations for the 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; order type 1 loop&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:Block diagram and noise equations 2-2.png|thumb|center|835px|alt = The phase noise generated inside each PLL block is modified before it appears at the PLL output. Block diagram and equations for the 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; order type 2 loop.|&lt;center&gt;The phase noise generated inside each PLL block is modified before it appears at the PLL output,&lt;br /&gt;
block diagram and equations for the 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; order type 2 loop.&lt;/center&gt;]]
Filter cut-off frequencies, damping ratios and natural undamped frequencies are chosen for a meaningful comparison.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/center&gt;]]

The noise generated by the filter '''N'''&lt;sub&gt;'''f'''&lt;/sub&gt; is modified by the transfer equation TF&lt;sub&gt;'''Nf'''&lt;/sub&gt; = (TF&lt;sub&gt;filter&lt;/sub&gt;) / 1 + TF&lt;sub&gt;filter&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt;TF&lt;sub&gt;VCO&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;br&gt;
The noise generated by the VCO '''N&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;''' is modified by the transfer equation  TF&lt;sub&gt;'''No'''&lt;/sub&gt; = 1/(1 + TF&lt;sub&gt;filter&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt;TF&lt;sub&gt;VCO&lt;/sub&gt;)

====How the PLL structure reshapes the noise spectrum====
[[File:VCO noise - transfer functions 1 1 , 2 1 , 2 2.png|thumb|center|800x408px|alt = VCO noise - transfer functions of the PLLs of order 1 type 1, order 2 type 1 and order 2 type 2, as well as the transfer functions of the two filter blocks for the two order 2 loops.|&lt;center&gt;&lt;small&gt;VCO noise - transfer functions VCO-to-output of the loops of  order 1 type 1, order 2 type 1 and order 2 type 2.&lt;br /&gt;
Filter cut-off frequencies, damping ratios and natural undamped frequencies are chosen for a meaningful comparison.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/center&gt;]]

====Summing up====
The VCO noise is the most important to consider, because the VCO produces low frequency noise and those low frequency components can not be distinguished from the useful signal components of the same frequencies.

All loop models act as high-pass for the VCO noise, i.e. they mitigate the low frequency noise from the VCO.

The high-pass corner frequency coincides with their natural frequency. 

All loops therefore tend to reject the low frequency noise that is generated by the VCO, but with some differences:


* the '''1 - 1''' loop attenuates the VCO noise at all frequencies below &lt;math&gt;\omega_{1}&lt;/math&gt;, with a single slope (20 dB/decade) and no gain overshoot. All VCO noise components at frequencies higher than &lt;math&gt;\omega_{1}&lt;/math&gt; appear unmodified in the PLL output.


* the '''2 - 1''' loop attenuates the VCO noise at all frequencies below &lt;math&gt;\omega_{21}&lt;/math&gt;, with a single slope (20 dB/decade) and with a gain overshoot that - ''whenever &amp;zeta; &gt; 0 , i.e. always'' -  peaks at &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{\omega^2}{\omega_{n21}^2}  = \tfrac{1 + \sqrt{1+8\zeta_{21}^{2}}}{2}&lt;/math&gt;  reaching a peak value that can represent a problem whenever &amp;zeta;&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt; is lower than 0.5.&lt;br /&gt;
::&lt;small&gt;The following figure illustrates the behavior of the 1-1 and 2-1 loops (using on purpose for the 2-1 a damping ratio that is unacceptably low) and gives the relevant formulas.&lt;/small&gt;
[[File:VCO Noise transfer 1-1 n 2-1.png|thumb|center|750px|alt = VCO to output (noise) transfer functions of the PLLs of order 1 type 1 and order 2 type 1, as well as the transfer function of the filter block for the order 2 loop|&lt;center&gt;&lt;small&gt;VCO to output (noise) transfer functions of the PLLs of order 1 type 1 and order 2 type 1, as well as the transfer function of the filter block for the order 2 loop.&lt;br /&gt;
The damping ratio of the 2nd order loop has been chosen too low on purpose, to emphasize the risk of amplification of noise at certain frequencies.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/center&gt;]]
::&lt;small&gt;The 2-1 loop is normally used in regenerator applications (when &lt;math&gt;\omega_{21}&lt;/math&gt; is low): a low noise VCO must be used.
::It also needs very good control of &amp;zeta;&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt; that must be kept close to 1.0 (this rules out the use of blocks with hard non-linearities and largely variable gain, like bang-bang phase detectors).&lt;/small&gt;


* the '''2 - 2''' loop attenuates the VCO noise at all frequencies below &lt;math&gt;\omega_{22}&lt;/math&gt;, with a double slope (40 dB/decade).&lt;br /&gt;There can be noise amplification at certain frequencies because of the gain magnitude oveshoots 0 dB,  whenever &lt;math&gt;\zeta_{22}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;­{{math|{{radical|1/2}}}} .&lt;br /&gt;The peaking of the overshoot occurs at &amp;omega; = &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt; / {{math|{{radical|1 &amp;minus; 2''&amp;zeta;''&amp;sup2;}}}},  and reaches as high as   20log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;(1 / (2&amp;zeta;{{math|{{radical|1 &amp;minus; 2''&amp;zeta;''&amp;sup2;}}}})).
&lt;div class=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;width:auto; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;The following figure illustrates the behavior of the 1-1 and 2-2 loops (using on purpose for the 2 - 2 a damping ratio that is unacceptably low) and gives the relevant formulas.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
[[File:VCO Noise transfer 1-1 n 2-2.png|thumb|center|750px|alt = VCO to output (noise) transfer functions of the PLLs of order 1 type 1 and order 2 type 2, as well as the transfer function of the filter block for the order 2 loop|&lt;center&gt;&lt;small&gt;VCO to output (noise) transfer functions of the PLLs of order 1 type 1 and order 2 type 2, as well as the transfer function of the filter block for the order 2 loop.&lt;br /&gt;
The damping ratio of the 2nd order loop has been chosen too low on purpose, to emphasize the risk of amplification of noise at certain frequencies.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/center&gt;]]
::&lt;small&gt;The 2-2 loop is a good choice if a noisy VCO must be used and is certainly preferable when some loop parameters can vary in a wide range because of hard non linearities (if G can become very large in certain conditions e.g. when a bang-bang detector is used)).

This architecture is the best of the three to mitigate a noisy VCO (see the double slope of attenuation for low frequencies), but the damping ratio &lt;math&gt;\zeta_{22}&lt;/math&gt; shall remain larger than {{math|{{radical|1/2}}}} = 0.707, to avoid amplification of noise frequencies around &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Feature Complete Software ==

The following outlines the essential elements for feature-complete software. A software package of any kind that does not have *all* of these features, is incomplete for purposes of this discussion.

In addition, all of these software features should be amenable to:
* '''automated processing''' (not require human intervention except where an essential function cannot be completed without a human)
* '''accessibility''' (capable of capturing through a screen reader or other assistance technology)
* '''batch processing''' (automated processing on multiple items in series, instead of just one at a time)

=== Data Access Factors ===
* authentication ;; you are who you say you are
* access control ;; the cabinets and drawers are lockable
* authorization  ;; the rules and conditions for access to the cabinets and drawers

=== Data Persistence Factors ===
* view
* add
* edit
* delete

=== Interaction Factors ===
* search
* sort
* filter
* collate
* validate
* scrub

=== Architecture ===
* model
* view
* controller

== Anylang Simple Data System ==

The anylang Simple Data System explains how to represent '''any kind of data for typical software applications''', where the primary goal is to '''make all data structures''' within your architecture ''as '''easy as possible to understand''''' for the average user. This approach is effective for applications where storage and performance are not significant constraints.

=== SimpleRecord SimpleTable and SimpleTree ===

The basic elements of the anylang Simple Data System can be composed and translated to fit the needs of virtually any software application or sytem.

The anylang Simple Data System consists of the following basic elements:

* '''SimpleRecord''' ;; a standard record as modeled in a typical RDBMS
* '''SimpleTable''' ;; a standard table as modeled in a typical RDBMS
* '''SimpleTree''' ;; a nested data element where every SimpleRecord is allowed to have zero or more SimpleTable child items

The '''SimpleTree''' data element is typically not capable of being represented in the RDBMS without using JOIN queries.

== Sample data ==

This is a snapshot of sample data represented as a '''SimpleTree''' using YAML syntax.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Leff, Michael. &quot;Serious Comedy: The Strange Case History of Dr. Vitanza.&quot; Rhetoric Review 6.2 (1988): 237-245.

Leff’s article does not show much patience with Vitanza. In it, Leff recognizes the inherent value of comic purpose in rhetoric, but when he compares how it is used by Gorgias to Vitanza’s “comic relief” (237) he finds it sorely lacking. The article comes off pretty stuffy at first, as Leff really seems taken aback that Vitanza is willing to admit up-front that he will be ironic, and perhaps due to this irritation Leff does not hold back as he offers specific critical dissections of Vitanza’s “clear announcement of a ‘post-modernist’ project for the history of rhetoric” (238). Leff feels that Vitanza is restricted by his use of irony that “can function only so long as it operates against an all encompassing and palpable object of derision” (238). This trope creates a binary, a history that over-simplifies the history of rhetoric and philosophy by simply reducing it to an opposite of the standard. While Leff recognizes that brevity and genre may allow some minor glosses of events and people, he calls Vitanza’s result “bad history” that suggests “his antibody rhetoric is too much infected by the disease it would cure” (239).

      <text xml:space="preserve">Crowley, Sharon. &quot;A Plea for the Revival of Sophistry.&quot; Rhetoric Review 7 (1989): 318-334.

Sharon Crowley begins “A Plea for the Revival of Sophistry” with a familiar trope – a nostalgic, soft-focus look at educators past. But Crowley does not call on this utopic image for reactionary purposes; instead, she draws on the past to advocate progressive change in the contemporary composition classroom. In the service of this pedagogical reimagining, Crowley attempts to reclaim sophistry and integrate its awareness of multiple viewpoints and social action within modern Composition. Unlike most contemporary composition classrooms (circa 1989) that Crowley sees as overly permissive in regard to worthwhile writing topics and oversimplified in regard to writing instruction, she longs to imbue contemporary Composition with the positive attributes of sophistic rhetoric, primarily “rhetorical awareness” that contextualizes composition within a “complex network of social, political, ethical, and cultural parameters” (323).


Crowley traces the historical approaches to teaching writing and discourse as they have moved from the teaching of the Sophists in ancient Greece to instruction in the modern American institution, noting what she calls a movement from a “philosophy of wisdom” toward a “philosophy of knowledge” brought on by the modern reverence and authority given to the scientific, the objective, and the knowable. Crowley notes that modern composition pedagogies have become “technologized” rhetorics—rhetorics reduced to a set of techniques which can be observed, learned, and applied “like varnish” to any discourse on any issue, essentially insisting that the same rhetorical techniques operate in a discussion on abortion as those that operate in a discussion on bicycle assembly. Crowley argues that this technologized approach places the public in the position of an observer of rhetoric rather than a participant; indeed, in the public domain, rhetorical authority has been placed in the hands of specialists, with politics becoming increasingly privatized and scholarship becoming silent, as specialized knowledge is not distributed widely from specialists into the public domain. As, Crowley observes, the public authorities rely less on public use of rhetoric, rhetorical practice has become less visible and knowable to the public on which it is used, creating a massive lack of awareness of the way rhetorical practice operates and resulting in a public discourse whose efficacy is “so well hidden that America has a nearly silent citizenry” (322). Crowley insists that teachers in the University, who have political, social, and cultural predilections whether or not they realize it, do a disservice to their students by creating the illusion of the classroom as a “value-neutral space,” as a place of “refuge from social realities” (325). Rather, Crowley calls for modern teachers to be active participants in and to engage their students with political and social issues; she calls for writing and rhetoric to be taught the way it was taught in ancient Greece and in early America: with increased rhetorical awareness of the way discourse operates within a complex network of cultural, political and social factors and of the ways discourse is used to solve public problems, with understanding of the real-life situations in which composing occurs, with awareness of the role status and character plays in the authority of the speakers, and to understand the range of responses an audience might have. She is calling for a non-silent, engaged citizenry, with the goal of discourse education, as it was in ancient Greece, to produce citizen-orators.

Discussion Questions:

1.	Crowley says 

“Just as doctors use drugs to change unsatisfactory physical conditions into more comfortable ones, teachers unsettle their pupils in such a way as to move them away from unsatisfactory positions toward more useful ones. In this way, social and political change come about.” (329)

In Acts of Enjoyment, Thomas Rickert warns that a dangers occurs in the cultural studies classroom when the instructor thinks he or she knows what is best for the student more than the student does. How do we understand Crowley’s plea in consideration of Rickert’s warning? Does a Sophistic rhetoric put instructors into this position? Must it?

2.	Consider Crowley’s point below as it relates to the Vitanza and Jarratt readings for today.

“Technical rhetoric is ordinarily studied from textbooks. Since textbooks are intended to initiate novices into a field of study, they tend to reductivize its tenets, as well as to universalize them. That is, textbook authors choose, organize, and present the supposedly fundamental tenets of any field of study as though these had always existed in the coherent form in which they appear in the textbook. . . . Too, authors of textbooks usually condense or omit altogether the historical debates that led to the formulation of the discipline as a coherent field of study. Thus they overlook the local and time-bound nature of the speculative investigations that unearthed the principles they present.” (324)

	How would (and would it?) a Sophistic rhetoric in the composition classroom 	avoid this historiographical problem?

Scott’s reply to Vitanza is a very well-written and subtle form of praise, criticism, and slight deprecation, much in the flavor of how Socrates “praises” Isocrates in the Pheadrus; which is to say the reader is left wondering exactly what the relationship really is. Scott opens quickly by calling Vitanza a “post-modern, rhetorical provocateur” (234) which is not unlike saying he is young, “but nature…has placed the love of wisdom in his mind” (Plato 555). He appreciates (?) the jovial nature with which Vitanza writes and which prevents the critic from pinning him down, and remarks “He’s right even when he’s wrong. That is the beauty and benefit of being provocative” (Scott 234). Scott offers explicit warnings of Vitanza's micro- and metalinguistic focus (while deftly bring in a medical metaphor) by noting “a good deal of unease if not disease in the intellectualizing we undertake in the name of all sorts of disciplines and desires” (235), even while appreciating that there is value in questioning the role of Plato et al. in how we define rhetoric. Scott seems to mostly question what is better for the future of rhetoric, word-play and an attack on philosophy or taking a more practical and easier-to-follow intersubjective approach to the question.

From Consigny's abstract:

:&quot;I next examine Schiappa's critique of his adversaries and the nature of his own &quot;foundationalist&quot; reading, one he presents as a more accurate and objective historical account of the sophists. Aligning myself with his neosophistic opponents, I then critique Schiappa's approach, arguing that rather than offering a more objective reading, he instead presents a highly partisan interpretation that attempts to portray the sophists in his own foundationalist precursors [sic]&quot; (253)

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{TOC right}}

In the Periodic Table, there are a number of physical properties that are not really &quot;similar&quot; as it was previously defined, but are more trend-like. This means is that as you move down a group or across a period, you will see a trend-like variation in the properties. There are three specific periodic trends that we will discuss. The first lesson of this chapter is devoted to the trend in atomic size in the Periodic Table. The two following this lesson will discuss ionization energy and electron affinity. Each of these trends can be understood in terms of the electron configuration of the atoms.

The actual trends that are observed with atomic size have to do with three factors. These factors are:

# The number of protons in the nucleus (called the '''nuclear charge''').
# The number of energy levels holding electrons (and the number of electrons in the outer energy level).
# The number of electrons held between the nucleus and its outermost electrons (called the '''shielding effect''').

==Lesson Objectives==
* Define atomic radius.
* State the boundary issue with atomic size.
* Describe measurement methods for atomic size.
* Define the shielding effect.
* Describe the factors that determine the trend of atomic size.
* Describe the general trend in atomic size for groups and for periods.
* Describe the trend of atomic radii in the rows in the Periodic Table.
* Describe how the trend of atomic radii works for transition metals.
* Use the general trends to predict the relative sizes of atoms.
* Use the concept of effective nuclear charge to explain why the atomic radii of the main group elements increase when we move down a group in the periodic table

==Atoms Have No Definite Boundary==
The region in space occupied by the electron cloud of an atom is often thought of as a probability distribution of the electrons and therefore, there is no well-defined &quot;outer edge&quot; of the electron cloud. Atomic size is defined in several different ways and these different definitions often produce some variations in the measurement of atomic sizes.

Because it is so difficult to measure atomic size from the nucleus to the outermost edge of the electron cloud, chemists use other approaches to get consistent measurements of atomic sizes. One way that chemists define atomic size is by using the '''atomic radius'''. The atomic radius is one-half the distance between the centers of a homonuclear diatomic molecule (a diatomic molecule means a molecule made of exactly two atoms and homonuclear means both atoms are the same element). The figure below represents a visualization of the atomic size definition.

[[File:Atomic radius of H2.svg|475px|thumb|center|A visual representation of the atomic radius of a hydrogen atom. The measurement would be taken as one-half the distance between the nuclei of the hydrogen atoms in a diatomic hydrogen molecule.]]

How do we measure the size of the atom? Ernest Rutherford is famous for his experiments bombarding gold foil with alpha particles. The ''gold foil experiment'' by Rutherford, first done in 1911, is of particular interest to us in this unit because it was this experiment that first gave science an approximate measurement for the size of the atom. He was able, using technology available in the early part of the 1900s, to determine quantitatively that the nucleus had an approximate size of 4{{e|−12}}&amp;nbsp;cm. The size of the atom is slightly larger, approximately 2{{e|−8}}&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter.

==Atomic Size in a Column Increases from Top to Bottom==
Let's now look at the atomic radii or the size of the atom from the top of a family or group to the bottom. Take, for example, the Group 1 metals. Each atom in this family (and all other main group families) has the same number of electrons in the outer energy level as all the other atoms of that family. Each row (period) in the periodic table represents another added energy level. When we first learned about principal energy levels, we learned that each new energy level was larger than the one before. Energy level 2 is larger than energy level 1, energy level 3 is larger than energy level 2, and so on. Therefore, as we move down
the Periodic Table from period to period, each successive period represents the addition of a larger energy level. It becomes apparent that as we move downward through a family of elements, that each new atom has added another energy level and will, therefore, be larger.

[[File:Comparative atomic sizes.png|500px|center]]

One other contributing factor to atomic size is something called the '''shielding effect'''. The protons in the nucleus attract the valence electrons in the outer energy level because of opposite electrostatic charges. The strength of this attraction depends on the size of the charges, the distance between the charges, ''and'' the number of electrons in-between the nucleus and the valence electrons. The core electrons ''shield'' the valence electrons from the nucleus. The presence of the core electrons weakens the attraction between the nucleus and the valence electrons. This weakening of the attraction is called the shielding effect. The amount of ''shielding'' depends on the number of electrons between the nucleus and the valence electrons. The strength with which the nucleus pulls on the valence electrons can pull the valence shell in tighter when the attraction is strong and not so tight when the attraction is weakened. The more shielding that occurs, the further the valence shell can spread out.

For example, if you are looking at the element sodium, it has the electron configuration:
:Na: 1''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2''p''&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;3''s''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

The outer energy level is ''n'' = 3 and there is one valence electron but the attraction between this lone valence electron and the nucleus that has those 11 protons is shielded by the other 10 inner (or core) electrons.

When we compare an atom of sodium to one of cesium, we notice that the number of protons increases as well as the number of energy levels occupied by electrons. There are also many more electrons between the outer electron and the nucleus, thereby shielding the attraction of the nucleus.
:Cs: 1''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2''p''&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;3''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;3''p''&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;4''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;3''d''&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;4''p''&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;5''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;4''d''&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;5''p''&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;6''s''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

The outermost electron, 6''s''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, therefore, is held very loosely. In other words, because of shielding, the nucleus has less control over this 6''s''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; electron than it does over a 3''s''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; electron. The result of all of this is that the atom's size will be larger. Table 10.2 gives the values for the atomic radii for the Group 1 metals plus a visual representation to appreciate the size change in a group in the periodic table (measurement units for atomic radii are picometers [pm] or 1{{e|−12}}&amp;nbsp;meters).

What is true for the Group 1 metals is true for all of the groups, or families, across the periodic table. As you move downward in the periodic table through a family group, the size of the atoms increases. For instance, the atoms that are the largest in the halogen family are bromine and iodine (since astatine is radioactive and only exists for short periods of time, we won't include it in the discussion).
{{High School Chemistry/Example|Sample Question}}
Which of the following is larger? Explain.
: (a) As or Sb
: (b) Ca or Be
: (c) Po or S
----
'''Solution''':

: (a) Sb because it is below As in Group 15.
: (b) Ca because it is below Be in Group 2.

As noted earlier for the main group metals, the outermost energy level in the electron configuration is indicated by the period number. So the element magnesium (''Z''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;12), is in Period 3, Group 2. According to this, we can say that there are 3 energy levels with 2 electrons in the outermost energy level. Let's look at the electron configuration for magnesium.
:Mg: 1''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2''p''&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;3''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

Moving from magnesium to strontium, strontium is in the 5&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; period of Group 2. This means that there are two electrons in the valence energy level. Strontium also has electrons occupying five energy levels.

You can imagine that with the increase in the number of energy levels, the size of the atom must increase. The increase in the number of energy levels in the electron cloud takes up more space.

Therefore, the trend within a group or family on the periodic table is that the atomic size increases with increased number of energy levels. The Periodic Table below shows the trend of atomic size for groups. The arrow indicates the direction of the increase.

[[File:Atomic size periodic table.svg|500px|center]]

==Atomic Size in a Period Decreases from Left to Right==
In order to determine the trend for the periods, we need to look at the number of protons ('''nuclear charge'''), the number of energy levels, and the shielding effect. For a row in the Periodic Table, the atomic number still increases (as it did for the groups) and thus the number of protons would increase. When we examine the energy levels for Period 2, we find that the outermost energy level does not change as we increase the number of electrons. In Period 2, each additional electron goes into the second energy level. So the number of energy levels ''does not go up''. As we move from left to right across a period, the number of electrons in the outer energy level increases ''but it is the same outer energy level''. Table 10.3 shows the electron configuration for the elements in Period 2.

|}

Looking at the elements in Period 2, the number of protons increases from lithium with three protons, to fluorine with nine protons. Therefore, the nuclear charge increases across a period. Meanwhile, the number of energy levels occupied by electrons ''remains the same''. The numbers of electrons in the outermost energy level increases from left to right along a period but how will this affect the radius? We know that every one of the elements in row #2 has two electrons in their inner energy level (2 core electrons). The core electrons shield the outer electrons from the charge of the nucleus. With lithium, there are two core electrons and one valence electron so those two core electrons will shield the one outer electron. In beryllium, there are four protons being shielded by the 1''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; electrons. With the increasing number of protons attracting the outer electrons and the same shielding from the core electrons, ''the valence electrons are pulled closer to the nucleus, making the atom smaller''.

In group 17, the first element in the group is fluorine. With fluorine, there are 9 protons and 9 electrons. The electronic configuration is 1''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2''p''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;. However, there are still the same core electrons as with lithium and beryllium, that is, the 1''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; electrons. Since there are more protons, there is an increase in the nuclear charge. With an increase in nuclear charge, there is an increase in the pull between the protons and the outer level, pulling the outer electrons toward the nucleus. The amount of shielding from the nucleus does not increase because the number of core electrons remains the same (1''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; for this period). The net result is that the atomic size ''decreases'' going across the row. In Table 10.4, the values are shown for the atomic radii for the row starting at lithium and ending with fluorine plus a visual representation to appreciate the size change in a group in the Periodic Table.

Let's add this new trend to the Periodic Table. Look at the diagram below of our new &quot;periodic trend table&quot;. In the diagram you will notice that the trend arrow for the period shows the atomic radii increase going from right to left, which is the same as decreasing from left to right.

[[File:Atomic size periodic table 2.svg|500px|center]]

Considering all the information about atomic size, you will recognize that the largest atom on the periodic table is all the way to the left and all the way to the bottom, francium, #87, and the smallest atom is all the way to the right and all the way to the top, helium, #2.

The fact that the atoms get larger as you move downward in a family is probably exactly what you expected before you even read this section, but the fact that the atoms get smaller as you move to the right across a period is most likely a big surprise. Make sure you understand this trend and the reasons for it.

==For the Transition Elements, the Trend is Less Systematic==
A general trend for atomic radii in the Periodic Table would look similar to that found in the diagram below. The elements with the smallest atomic radii are to the upper right; those with the largest atomic radii are to the lower left.

[[File:Atomic size periodic table 3.svg|500px|center]]

Until now, we have worked solely with the main group metals. Let's look at our three factors and see how these factors fit the transition metal series. Looking at the first row of the transition metals, the 3''d'' row, Table 10.5 shows the number of protons in each of the 10 elements in this row. The number of protons is increasing so the nuclear charge is increasing.

The number of electrons are increasing, but in a particular way. We know that as the number of electrons increases going across a period, there is more pull of these electrons toward the nucleus. However, with the ''d''−electrons, there is some added '''electron-electron repulsion'''. Take a look at Table 10.5 and note the unusual electron configuration of chromium.

In chromium, there is a promotion of one of the 4''s'' electrons to half fill the 3''d'' sublevel, the electron-electron repulsions are less and the atomic size is smaller. The opposite holds true for the latter part of the row. Table 10.6 shows the first row of the transition metals along with their size.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;margin:10px auto; width:225px; text-align:center;&quot;

We can see the trend in the 3''d'' transition metals isn't quite as systematic as with the main group elements.

==Lesson Summary==
* Atomic size is the distance from the nucleus to the valence shell where the valence electrons are located.
* Atomic size is difficult to measure because it has no definite boundary. The electrons surrounding the nucleus exist in an electron cloud. You can predict the probability of where the electrons are but not their exact location.
* Atomic size is determined indirectly.
* Atomic radius is a more definite and measureable way of defining atomic size. It is the distance from the center of one atom to the center of another atom in a homonuclear diatomic molecule.
* Rutherford led the way to determining the size of the atom with his gold foil experiment.
* There are three factors that help in the prediction of the trends in the Periodic Table: number of protons in the nucleus, number of shells, and shielding effect.
* The atomic size increases from the top to the bottom in any group as a result of increases in all of the three factors. (As the number of energy levels increases, the size must increase.)
* Going across a period (from left to right), the number of protons increases and therefore the nuclear charge increases. (Going across a period, the number of electron energy levels remains the same but the number of electrons increases within these energy levels. Therefore the electrons are pulled in closer to the nucleus.)
* Shielding is relatively constant since the core electrons remain the same.
* The trend in the periodic table is that as you move across the Periodic Table from left to right, the atomic radii decrease. This trend is not as systematic for the transition metals because other factors come into play.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Research Paper Topic #1 - Selfishness Notes from &quot;Predictably Irrational&quot; by Dan Ariely pg 195-pg robberies 2004 cost 525 million corporate theft cost 600 billion every year
  *higher than robberies, burglary, larceny, auto theft combined
24 million added to property losses each year IRS gap 350 billion/year two types of dishonesty? do &quot;honest&quot; people cheat given the opportunity? EXPERIMENT: one group takes mult choice test, then transfers answers to bubble sheet (15c for each right answer) second group sees correct answers when they fill in the bubble sheet third group destroyed bubble sheet and reported earnings fourth group destroyed bubble sheet and then walked up to front of room and collected earnings from a jar RESULTS: group one - avg 32.6 questions right group two - avg 36.2 questions right group three - avg 35.9 questions right group four - avg 36.1 questions right interesting that all &quot;cheat&quot; opportunities were higher than average, but none was extremely higher than the other majority of ppl cheated, but only a little bit even when have little/no chance of getting caught, we are still only slightly dishonest ADAM SMITH: (great quote!!) &quot;Nature, when she formed man for society, endowed him with an original desire to please, and an original aversion to offend his bretheren. She taught him to feel pleasure in their favourable, and pain in their unfavourable regard&quot; ppl are honest if it serves them well survey of high school students (US) 98% of 36 thousand students said imp to be honest SOLUTIONS:? moral reminders - Bible/honor codes degradation of professions - used to be elitist, now are more geared toward commoners - does the possibility of wealth creation encourage fraud in these areas? not enough punishment for unethical actions? prevent &quot;bending&quot; of reality to accommodate selfishness Notes From Chapter 12: pg 217 EXPERIMENT: leave a 6-pack of Coke in a mini-fridge at MIT and see how long it takes to disappear (72 hrs) leave a plate with six one dollar bills at MIT fridge, same thing (untouched at 72 hrs) COMMENTS: most dishonesty is removed from cash
     *arguably this makes it easier
EXPERIMENT: control group solves math probs and reports number correct for money second group solves probs, shreds paper and then reports correct number for money last group solves probs for tokens and then exchanges the tokens for money RESULTS: control(no cheating) 3.5 right second group - 6.2 right last group - 9.4 right
    *many cheated as much as was possible - perfect scores
EXAMPLES: Reporting lost/damaged items to insurance comp - size and/or value tends to increase Wardrobing - buy clothing, wear, then return, but store can't use it anymore
   *lose abt 16 bill year due to this
COMMENTS: nonmonetary exchanges are easier to rationalize/make us more likely to be dishonest electronic transactions? should we be weary of these? what happens when:
  *ppl don't care about being honest?
  * behavior isn't public?
  *nonmonetary things that take longer/more steps to be converted to money?
BENEFITS OF DISHONESTY: Upton Sinclair
 &quot;It is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends upon his not understanding it&quot;
DISHONESTY ON PART OF BUSINESSES: credit card rates WHAT'S SO SPECIAL ABOUT MONEY? clear unit of exchange symbolism of US govt, history, etc need to find a solution soon! cash rapidly becoming extinct Notes from &quot;Exotic Preferences&quot; by Loewenstein Theory of Moral Sentiments - Adam Smith (check this out!! may be helpful!)
   *may also be worth checking out classical view on selfishness in Wealth of Nations
   *behavior is determined by &quot;passions&quot; vs &quot;impartial spectator&quot;
why do humans have a concern for fairness? if we are all selfish creatures, what use is there in protecting others? fairness is reinforced by fear of negative appraisal (so it still is selfish) markets often built on fairness, altruism, trust rather than just self-interest Notes from: Sigmund, Karl. Calculus Of Selfishness, The. Princeton University Press, 2009. 1 October 2011 &lt;http://lib.myilibrary.com.ezproxy2.library.arizona.edu?ID=245880&gt; Pascal: &quot;We are born unfair; for everyone inclines towards himself. . . . The tendency towards oneself is the origin of every disorder in war, polity, economy etc.” Selfishness was depicted as the root of all evil. Adam Smith: by pursuing one's own self interest, society as a whole benefits
   *invisible hand benefits society when we are selfish
   *what about prisoner's dilemma? both cooperate = reward, both selfish= punishment
   *if both ppl get different answers, one gets a temptation (greater than reward)
   *trap!
   *modern day example? cold war
how does concern for reputation affect your tendency to be selfish?
    *indirect reprocity - the more players know abt each other, the more likely they are to help each other
Why do people engage in costly punishment? The first explanation is obvious. By punishing defectors, one can hope to reform them. Notes from: Selfishness, cooperation, the evolutionary point of view and its implications for economics Dariusz Pieńkowski , Mälardalen University, Sweden Received 27 March 2007; revised 27 September 2007; Accepted 1 October 2007. Available online 7 November 2007. Adam Smith: The natural effort of every individual to better his own condition… is so powerful, that it is alone, and without any assistance, not only capable of carrying on the society to wealth and prosperity, but of surmounting a hundred impertinent obstructions with which the folly of human laws too often encumbers its operations (Smith, 1776, book 4, chapter V, section IV), What about 'rational' not necessarily as just selfish, what about rational as promoting public goals? “How selfish soever man may be supposed, there are evidently some principles in his nature, which interest him in the fortune of others, and render their happiness necessary to him, though he derives nothing from it, except the pleasure of seeing it” (Smith, 1759, part I chapter 1) pro-social behavior: benefits others selfish behavior: self-benefit but can be applied to another person as well altruistic behavior: help others without worrying about oneself classical economics looks more at competitive models, when in fact cooperation is quite possible theory - humans are not naturally selfish - economic situations increase their tendency to commit selfish actions SELFISHNESS IN THE MARKET: why is economic rationality associated with selfishness? argue that human beings must be selfish because market is based on these rules selfish because they think others are going to be selfish how does one's behavior differ in the market place vs in a domestic environment? rational economic decisions in the market vs rational social interactions - - -how do these two play into eachother? Japanese capitalism - teamwork, cooperation, very group oriented http://www.sciencedirect.com.ezproxy2.library.arizona.edu/science/article/pii/S0921800907005034

Introduction:
*self-interest is not the same thing as selfishness

Adam Smith on Self-Interest:
*humans are capable of self-interest, but they are also capable to recognizing when this interest harms others  and will then change their actions
*&quot;self command&quot; is the term used to describe this restraining
*approval comes from &quot;impartial spectator&quot;
*actions that directly harm others are NOT endorsed by Smith
*so why does self-interest play out in the market? because markets are mechanical, more anonymous than human relationships
Quote:: that to feel much for others and little for ourselves, that to restrain our
selfish, and to indulge our benevolent affections, constitutes the perfection of human nature; 
*selfishness often results in one harming another
*businesses should not deceive consumers or harm them in any way
*competition is fueled by self-interest. competition leads to lower prices and/or higher quality as well as new products
*societal benefit is synonymous with consumer benefit

“Economic man” in cross-cultural

*selfishness axiom: individuals seek to maximize perosonal gains and expect others to do the same
*research performed in 12 countries (4 continents)

Ultimatum Game and Dictator Game Findings:
*offers below 20 percent rejected
*most offers 50%

Public Goods Game:
*selfish individual should free ride and either contribute as little as possible or withdraw as much as possible
     *if this game is repeated (with same players), contribution tends towards zero
*little variation among gender
*younger children tend to display more selfishness than older adults

Findings:
*wide range of rejection rates, even for extremely low offers
*wider range of modal offering
*proposers are violating selfishness axiom by offering more than minimal amounts
     *perhaps they 'are' selfish but do not believe others are (fear of being rejected)
Things that may influence tendency towards selfishness:
Social complexity (SC) .242  .778 .913 .374   .670
Payoffs to cooperation (PC) — −.063 .039  −.320  .165
Anonymity (AN)  — .934 .743 .664
Market integration (MI)   — .644  .731
Privacy (PR)    — .328
Settlement size (SS

*much of behavior is determined by culture (not hardwired into us)
*more likely to cooperate when you think others will cooperate

Milton Friedman and Social Responsibility:
*increasing individual freedom is encouraged
     **voluntary exchanges btwn individuals vs centrally-planned exchanges
*voluntary exchanges only happen if both individuals benefit
*&quot;Seif-interest is not myopic selfishness. It is whatever it is that
interests the participants, whatever they value, whatever goals they pursue&quot;
*is absolute freedom possible? no - of course not. different people have different wants, so when these conflict they must negotiate their behaviors
*ppl have the ethical responsibility to analyze their actions 
     *avoid 'external' effects unless those that are affected approve of these actions
*firstly, humans should limit their own behavior. secondly, governments should intervene
*businesses should conduct themselves so as to positively affect society and society must consent to being affected
*businesses should pursue profit (and only profit) but should NOT engage in fraud/deception

*are we intrinsically selfish or altruistic
*how do repeated encounters with people (or even the belief in them) affect behavior?

Notes from: American Mania - When More is Not Enough
Introduction
*material wealth and choice in US is unique in human history - never before have we had so much
*to want (more) is a basic instinct
*what about free time? entertainment? stress levels?
*wiring in our brain causes us to be curious, seek rewards, and avoid loss/injury
*self-interest constantly at odds with the fact that we are intensely social animals
*self-interest said to play into societal good (think Adam Smith)
*Smith worried abt envy and compulsiveness
*how do we limit our craving when we live in a society as rich as the US?

Chapter One: Adam Smith's American Dream
*&quot;78% of Americans still believe that anybody in America can become rich and live the good life&quot;
*shopping is NOT a rational experience - humans are manipulated by advertising companies
*&quot;behavior of multitudes&quot; - sum of all ind desires, this is what drives the market - self-preservation
*&quot;self-love&quot; leads to social order
*along with self love there should be curiosity - exploration, invention, new ideas
*ambition - what makes us try and be better than how we already are and/or better than those around us
     *importance of self-image (ranking, distinction) - we do things to be noticed by others
*Francis Hutcheson - Glasgow College moral phil professor
       *Adam Smith liked his ideas on self-interest - Hutcheson believed this is balanced by need to be accepted and loved
*Smith's impartial spectator is both ambitious and conscious of social relations
*in today's world (globalized and technological) &quot;social good&quot; has little practical value - no economic incentive
       *focus is now on material wealth - how much money/stuff do you have?
*selfish behavior is reward driven while self-restraint is learned behavior - cultural
*cultural shift away from society and towards self - really noticeable towards beginning of 1990s

Chapter Three: (page 80 onwards)
*work of Professor Robert Cloninger - psych at Wash School of Medicine is St Louis, Missouri - evaluating human temperament
*dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin systems
*harm - avoidance (shyness), novelty seeking, reward dependence, persistence
*above describe how we interact with people/social challenges
*when dopamine levels are stimulated by an experience, we continue to seek out this experience

The Time Trade:
*crunch for time encourages solitary, competitive work rather than cooperative work

NOTES FROM:
The Soul of Modern Economic Man: Ideas of Self Interest - Thomas Hobbes to Adam Smith
Chapter Two:The Soul of Modern Economic Man
*soul = self-interest
*18th century - clear respect for work and its benefits for society
    *The Spectator - Joseph Addison and Richard Steele -collection of essays
    *merchants - goods brought to country by trade, give work to poor, creates wealth
*Josiah Tucker - 'Elements of Commerce and Theory of Taxes'
       *self-love as a motivation is the &quot;great Mover of created beings&quot;
       *unchecked self-love, however, is destructive - set out to become the best of the best - end in poverty for all
       *public good versus private gain
       *extremely anti-monopolist - - - self-interest can be useful as long as all companies are allowed to compete
*Godwin - 'Political Justice (1798)
       *&quot;all wealth, in a state of civilized society, is the produce of human industry&quot;
       *negative views of businessmen, who are seen as exploiters of workers

Chapter Three: Thomas Hobbes - Self Interest and the Public Destruction
*self-interest is identified as the &quot;most destructive of human motives&quot;
*material vs mental implications of self-interest
        *material - economic effects, mental - psychology, human character/motivation
*Hobbes point of view: all actions of men are motivated by his selfishness</text>

'''''Engineers do it First'''''

'''Abstract'''
“Introduction to Engineering” courses introduce a university's unique programs, projects and tools. Ethics and privileges such as 24 hour by 7 access to tools, materials and rooms are negotiated. Community Colleges don't have the resources, graders, graduate assistants, and multiple professors teaching the course. This paper lists the problems of teaching “Introduction to Engineering” at a Community College. It argues that truly open ended projects can be taught to freshman. It proposes an external assessment process as well as internal grading system. It is inspired by DIY, maker/hacker spaces, wikibooks, and wikiversity. It starts from a new narrative of playing, doing things first, design and problem solving. “Introduction to Engineering” is where students learn “Engineers do it First.”

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''''The Narrative Problem'''''

The current Engineering narratives are “Applied Science”, “Solve Problems”, “Make Things”, “Design“ and “Engineers help shape the Future.” Do these narratives work? How many kids say they want to be an engineer? Who is they as in “They just created a new wire with carbon and no metal or copper.” Only at community colleges do students declare an engineering major that:
*can not pass an algebra placement test
*want to move knobs up and down in a sound studio
*already have some other undergraduate degree (like physics, or architecture)
*are challenged in some way

Engineers live in a business to business world (B2B) where both clients and customers are other engineers. Doctors and lawyers interface with the public every day. The public has a strong narrative associated with most occupations. Engineering draws a blank.

Why aren't current narratives working? Look at their origin. The B2B world provides no ability to test narratives. Retaining freshman interested in engineering at four year schools is a different objective than explaining engineering to the public. 

===K-12 “Trust Science” Narrative Dominance===
The US military preferred to work with physicists rather than engineers during WWII. Engineers belonged to unions, not societies. They were either super techs or tech managers. “Art and Practice” dominated the engineering profession. A deliberate decision to begin promoting Engineering Science was made during the creation of the National Science Foundation (NSF). This has been a success.
Engineering undergrads now drop out to become physicists. Less prestigious colleges offer Physics instead of Engineering. Physics is cheaper, easier to staff and can survive the efficiency/assessment demands of modern accountability. This is reflected in [http://www.gmac.com/NR/rdonlyres/76FC2158-8497-48BA-8AC7-CF689D027B6A/0/ProfileofGMATCandidates_TY200607to201011.pdf GMAT] scores engineers average around 590, science averages below social science at around 560. 

The K-12 “trust science” narrative inspires education that discourages magic, establishes an understandable universe and promotes the “scientific process.” This narrative does create a public that votes for a pure research infrastructure. Changing this would be dangerous. The gap between a needed “creating scientist” narrative and the K-12 “trusting science” narrative has now fallen on the shoulders of engineering.

===The Technology Narrative===
Engineers face a real danger of becoming technologists. Engineering Technology programs fill a real need. They provide a career pathway between technology and engineering. They establish mutual respect. Unfortunately current engineering narratives blur the engineering/technician distinction.

To fight this, most colleges are either focused on engineering science or engineering technology. K-12 and community colleges have both. Most of the articulation problems between community colleges and four year institutions exist because of technology narrative problems.  Four year institutions believe K-12 and community colleges don't implement the “create scientist” narrative, have to train technicians and thus cannot simultaneously support engineering science. 

What is the technology narrative? The industrial arts, technician, technologist, certification, apprentice, master occupations can all be lumped into one narrative. “Do something for 15 years.” Become an expert. Experience creates expertise. This is not an engineering or “creating scientist” narrative.

===Engineers do it first===
The design requirements for an engineering narrative:
*puts &quot;inventing&quot; in the right context
*sandwich between “create scientist” and “technology” narratives
*fit on a bumper sticker
*archetypical guide for all engineering courses
*strengthen context of existing engineering courses
*foster engineering projects

The “Do it First” narrative emerged while sinking into the ugliness of “Design” and “Solve problems” narratives. It is the fruit of students suffering through process without relevance.
 
What is “it”? 
*It extends and matures through the group play to engulf “exploring.” 
*It values ignorance as much as experience and expertise. 
*It creates inspiration that can’t happen in education where the teacher says “Be like me.”  
*It sets the stage for an emphasis on repeatability and documentation. 
*It matures into design and engineering problem solving versus technician problem solving. 
*It can lead to the scientific narrative of theories, instruments and experiments 
Asking the question “Who gets to do it first?” establishes the currency of engineering: '''RESPECT'''.

The full narrative is Play → Do it First → Design → Solve Problems.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''''The Freshman Problem'''''
===Respect versus Expertise and Experience===
Freshman engineers are crippled by the K-12 narrative: “experience creates expertise and ultimately respect.” Today, first hand, direct experience is expensive. Expertise is now routinely gained from simulation. Ignorance can have as much value as expertise. The order has been reversed: demonstrate Respect, build some Expertise and then reward with direct Experience. The currency freshman engineers need to be taught is Respect.

===Push off versus Pull Up the Educational Mountain (expertise)===
K-12 requires instructor expertise. But it cripples the self-motivated/self-learning that everyone is naturally born with. For example, a freshman team is tasked with building a toy robot boat. One person decides to design the hull. They feel their first task is to find a hull design expert or become an expert. 

Many engineering programs combat this with “scaffolding” which merely reinforces education expertise rather than challenge it. Scaffolding homogenizes, puts content before creativity and provides no future skills other than exhaust yourself/do your best. 

What is the alternative? Meet the world as it presents itself. There are toy boats. There are soda bottles. Pick one. Put it in the water. Attach the motors and radio controls. Create an on time, functional, attractive deliverable. Earn engineering reuse respect. Modern adventures are in junk pile explorations. Let the project dictate the content.

Engineering education must become comfortable with pushing students off the mountain into unknown waters (to both student and teacher) and learning to swim on their own. We have to teach against the K-12 archetypes rather than leverage them. We have to never work harder and never know than our students. We have to resist doing the project ourselves. We must wear the client/project manager hat, not the students engineering hat.

===My problem versus atoms (timidity)===
How does an engineer gain the respect that will attract investment when nobody else knows? If the engineer calls their own personal lack of knowledge a “problem”, there will be no investment. Engineering will not happen. The simple answer is to focus on service. “I am going to serve you by building a radio controlled model boat on time, that works and it will look gorgeous.” 

There are three paths an engineer walks. One is the path of exercising expertise. This is the public face of engineering and it unfortunately fits the K-12 education models. But it is not the focus of engineering. The second path is exploration, learning about something that will improve the species. The third is learning what one doesn't know, something new to the engineer.

For an engineer, expertise is a fleeting moment of clarity that disappears as soon as the next unknown is tackled and technicians take over. Expertise is not the goal. Service is the goal. 

The typical question freshman engineers are asked (“What type of engineer do you want to be?”) plays into the wrong archetype. Almost every engineer will describe their life by their role in a project (sales, support, design, testing, implementation, prototype, management). The non-engineering public expects expertise demonstrations. Do we want to graduate engineering students that will only look for jobs in the fields they have some educational derived expertise .. ie Statics = Bridge Building?

===Big versus little problems (scope)===
Why introduce huge project issues into freshman engineering courses? Most intro engineering texts describe big problems and then assign students a project such as “Here is a bunch of parts: build a model car.”  Students cannot connect the small problems they encounter to the big ones discussed.

K-12 loves reflections that start with “I have a problem organizing”, “ I have a problem focusing”, “I have a lack of expertise.” None of these are engineering problems. Engineering problems are outside of our minds. They are stumbled upon. Some are small, some grow large and engulf everyone.

K-12 doesn't like problems. Problems exist only paired to solutions. The seduction of solutions, the impartiality of problems, the brainstorming of possible solutions, and the rationalization of testing are foreign issues. Most minimize the pain and frustration a problem triggers. Freshman avoid problems instead of finding engineering inspiration in them. 

Engineering problems seeds are discovered by individuals. Most remain small and are solved immediately. Some grow. Some explode to many small problems. Documenting the process, collecting justifications, describing attempts and failure symptoms results in an engineering mind. Trying to fit anything into a big problem design mold confuses students.

===Feeling success===
Many community college engineering students have experienced life narrowing failure. They have not experienced motivating, confidence building success.

Most introduction to engineering classes have a single project that all students do. Even huge colleges with 700 students, force them all into one project. Some officially label the whole experience a competition. Competition produces success for a handful and failure for most. This supposedly models competition in the real world. In reality it is discouraging to all but the best and brightest.

The alternative is many small different projects, three team members, smaller scopes, lower expectations, and small successes with enormous celebrations. The problem is not multiple choice questions on tests. The problem is that we only celebrate multiple choice question test success. Celebrations create respect. Can we organize engineering departments to celebrate the design of a screw?

===Failure Respect===
The hardest part of engineering is helping students find inspiration in frustration and problems. The second hardest thing is teaching students how to generate Respect in the face of failure. The secret is teaching students how to document failure. 

The goal of Failure/Can't be Done documentation is to establish enough Respect that others don't attempt to repeat the failure. Typically this requires exhaustion of internet searches, time and inspiration. Any uncertainty or timidity will attract more engineering. All respect will be lost.

===Like and Timidity===
Freshman are often motivated by social connections. Without carefully describing engineering team member relationships, most teams fall apart. The need to create social connections may create priorities that compete with their intellectual goals. Stories must be told of Respect lost when everyone agrees on everything, and stories must be told of Respect gained  by working through differences.

Students will try to justify undebated solutions by the K-12 efficiency archetype rather than acknowledge the like and be liked seduction. It is necessary to look for problems rather than gloss over them, to slow down and reword the problem different ways without solution, to sink into the frustration's despair and find inspiration there. Teams don't do this. Individuals do.

Most team activity is individual activity. The team aspect is comparing, fitting, testing and then negotiating how to split up again. Separating We from I requires being accountable and transparent. It is one of the most important engineering ethic and respect issues. The maturing of freshman is has to begin with targeting the like and be liked timidity dance.

===Slackers===
Engineering education grading overvalues those that can concentrate/learn from books and undervalues those that learn verbally and can shrink complex topics to sound bytes. This is expressed by the saying “A students become instructors, B students end up working for C students.” This is scary to community college students who will never transfer with a C. 

Slacking issues appear immediately. At least half of all K-12 students learn from the class collective mind rather than from the teacher. Unique projects expose this parasitical ugliness.  This has to be spun positively. Turn slackers into communicators. Talk about the other danger of &quot;hard to work with.&quot; Identify and celebrate communicator success. Equate communication with documentation success. Both are needed on an engineering team.

This issue is not solved by Myers Briggs tests or even [http://www.jocrf.org/ Johnson O'Connor] interviews. The conventional approach that creates slackers and the hard to work with has to be addressed early. Otherwise students will immediately begin labeling themselves and drop out of engineering.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''''The Open Ended Project Problem'''''

The gray area between Open Ended and Canned Projects has been thoroughly explored and named.  But there is still a lot of confusion. The definition used here is:
*students choose among a variety of new/old projects
*projects are never finished (endless improvement)
*instructors grade form and celebrate success
This needs to be the standard definition of an “Open Ended Project.”

===Inspiration versus Content===
Education research has shown that students walk away from open ended problems with more inspiration and less content. It is a narrative problem that students don't value the inspiration until after graduation. Engineering is fun when content and inspiration emerge together.  K-12, content volume, and value discussions are important. But they discourage inspiration. The comparisons invited by competitions inspire only a few. Engineering has to be about adding back the inspiration, not continuing K-12 expectations.

Engineering project grading typically slips into K-12 expectations. Experts lecture and assign homework on content that seems random to the students or supports the single project that everyone does. Neither accomplishes the inspiration objectives of an open ended project.

This is done because there is no model for grading inspiration. The next section proposes how to do this easily. Inspiration can be graded just like in the engineering workplace: through project management accountability, documentation and presentations.

===Project Management versus Content===
The freshman engineering class needs to give up content. Instructors should not present themselves as experts. Freshman need to discover content themselves. They need to be forced to learn on their own. Instructors should point out options like a project manager. 

The project management approach focuses on documentation, transparency and accountability. The documentation requirement creates a course management issue similar to engineering corporations. The goal is to hold individuals accountable and celebrate team success. Documentation should start off personal, and them move to team presentations and team documentation. Personal success can be withheld until the team's work is done.

===Materials and Facilities===
Projects need space. Space is normally created by demonstrating need. Large projects that create lots of noise, dust, and debris can justify facilities.

Facilities can only be built slowly. External money and grants normally increase existing success. They don't finance start up programs. Facilities have to be built slowly over time from what students leave behind, from junk and discards of other departments.

Open ended projects don't fit the K-12 efficiency expectations of lesson plans, materials lists and ordering of materials during the summer for the entire year. Efficiency expectations kill most open ended project enthusiasm and cause white elephant kit purchases. For example, open ended projects always involve searches for materials. Ordering materials requires a justification, a problem statement and confidence respected by the instructor. Ordering materials is a minor form of success that is missed if all materials are ordered during the summer by the instructor.

===Scaffolding versus DIY University===
Project scaffolding is an excuse some engineering schools use to lecture students, force them to purchase text books, and meet expertise expectations. No development of rapid-self learning, skimming, need to know, just in time, or design build talents are possible. Scaffolding kills inspiration, discourages documentation and sets the example of starting from the beginning. Students don't have to find a starting point and then reverse engineer backwards as well as engineer forwards. 

Scaffolding denies prior work documentation exists that has to be leveraged. Some colleges deliberately delete all documentation after each semester's work. This creates an unethical, underground documentation system. It forces competition complexity increases. This creates a crippling negative feedback loop. Scaffolding denies freshman the opportunity to wrestle with the start over, catch up, or repeat previous success decisions that all engineers wrestle with. Scaffolding denies freshman scope and scale experiences that moderate K-12 delusions of grandeur.

Maker Magazine, DIY University concepts and Hacker Space successes are stealing the open ended project archetype. The signature of an [http://www.unallocatedspace.org Unall{Ø}cated Space] member is “teach, learn, party.” If engineering colleges don't embrace open ended projects, they will continue to grow in DIY spaces.

===Definition of Success===
The big problem narrative forces an inflated definition of success that only a few can achieve. Engineering is about solving the small problems along a path of shifting scope, focus and subsystems. A suggested individual grading metric is “pushing the project forward”. Celebrating these tiny successes weekly in class is absolutely necessary.

===Context===
Projects don't have to be competitions. They can include: science demo, service, reverse engineering, art, improving, profiting, and inventing. The best project context is solving a problem defined by someone outside the introduction to engineering class ... someone called a &quot;client&quot;. This reduces the need for the instructor to wear the client, customer, project manager and engineer hats.

===Good  Clients===
A freshman engineering class works best when clients are outside the classroom. Ideally these are engineers in the community. Non-engineering clients are a lot of work. College support staff can help in two ways: educate non-engineering clients and become clients themselves.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''''The Course Management Problem'''''

Managing open ended projects in a community college is difficult. Residential engineering colleges with successful open ended freshman projects grow a culture were juniors and seniors mentor freshman and sophomores.  Creating this culture at a community college in isolation from the world has been impossible. Volunteers at Wikibooks and Wikiversity, could change this.

===Engineering Notebooks===
Engineering notebooks have not moved into the electronic world, and may never. The inspiration gained from hand writing compliments that gained by white board writing and word processing.

===In the Moment versus After the Fact===
Students initially turn the engineering notebook into a torture device. They try to write perfect summaries or reports. This eliminates an inspiration gained by writing in the moment. The uncertainty fog, the minute detail, the tiny but significant decision rationalization disappears unless captured in the moment. A summary is a litany of lost opportunities and lost information. Writing in the moment creates more volume, better design, better problem solving, less play, .. better engineering. The [[General_Engineering_Introduction/Notebooks|reasons]] for writing in an engineering notebook have not changed. Writing in a notebook creates an extension of the brain.

===LMS===
A Learning Management System (LMS) is a useful tool. The problem is that all LMS information is controlled by the college. Colleges kick students out of the LMS for not paying their bills. Colleges delete old course information, making DIY university portfolios more difficult. Newer open source LMS systems (Canvas) do eliminate the college's storage volume and backup issues. But ultimately the student loses. Colleges will never give up their ownership, censorship, and reuse control of information.

===Wikiversity===
Wikia space has changed the educational narrative. Content is polished through enthusiasm and loose consensus. Wikia space separates information from its organization. It depends heavily on search engines. Search engines require knowing what we don't know. To learn what we don't know, wiki organizes information using a category concept. This makes it possible to simultaneously document a variety of learning paths. The flatness of Wikipedia illustrates the focus on information. Wikibooks are merely extensions of the information with a lot of categorizing. The categorizational chaos of Wikimedia and Wikiversity is where the future of education can be seen.

===Wikia Promotes Reuse===
Most education is trapped in a disclosure, copyright, fair use, create your own work narrative that is increasingly divorced from the modern world. Somebody somewhere has already done it and it can usually be found before a sentence is finished. Finding and continuing that previous work emphasizes open ended projects, reuse and Respect.

Students need to work in a place where reuse is encouraged, where everything they create is put in the public domain. Some students want to improve the world, and yet don't want to worry about patents, copyrights, trademarks and fair use interpretations. Creativity doesn't require starting from scratch.

===Creating Value in Public===
Students will create electronic, documents from other's work and try to pass it off as their own because of LMS privacy. The minute students are asked to create something that can not be deleted, that will be around the rest of their lives, that will be searched by potential employers, that can change the world, that can establish respect, they start behaving professionally.

===Badges of Respect===
Web sites reward desired behavior with points and badges of respect. This is no different than the Boy Scouts, fraternal organizations or the military. The success of badges has been proven by the Gates Foundation and can be seen in its full implementation at the [http://www.khanacademy.org/badges/view Kahn Academy]. Wikia sites have similar rewards. The engineering profession needs to extend Wikia rewards. Engineering awards that end with FE, PE certification need to replace the increasingly awkward, random content test (despite how statistically significant it is).

===Wikia Space Introduction===
Wikimedia includes Wikipedia, Wikibooks, and Wikiversity. The interwiki_map lists a variety of wikias, both for-profit and non-profit. Within wikia's there are spaces. The most obvious is article space. Every registered user gets a user space. There is no privacy associated with any space. Anyone can edit pages in any space including help, category, and file space. Both the content and the file storage type must be public domain in order to be uploaded.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''''The Internal Grading Problem'''''

Many different Introduction to Engineering grading systems have been tried including problem/solution, all or nothing team, milestone submissions, time spent, and writing volume. All have problems fitting into any kind of engineering narrative. The “doing things first narrative” fits a portfolio context. Individual portfolios graded by instructors is promoted below. Team documentation assessed by outside experts is more appropriate for program/course assessment.

===Portfolios===

K-12 and Post Secondary students from around the country working on individual and team projects have been using the Innovation Portal to document their design projects.  https://innovationportal.org/stats   The portfolio template is organized around the Engineering Design Process Portfolio Scoring Rubric (EDPPSR) that is being developed by groups of engineering design educators from around the country under a formal research effort and lead by Researchers from the University of Maryland.

http://www.innovationsintesting.org/2013presentations/Data/56-ATP2013-Presentation%20Abts%20Reshetar.pdf

Capturing the design process in a way that can be compared , shared and that can help bridge the gap between K-12 and post-secondary course work is the goal of all of those who have come together to build the EDPPSR and the Innovation Portal. the Innovation Portal is free and open for use by all teaches and students.  The rubric, scored and annotated examples, and tutorials can all be accessed on the Innovation Portal site.. https://innovationportal.org/


 The Project Lead The Way team has designed, built and continues to improve the Innovation Portal for all students because we are committed to supporting, promoting, and working to gain recognition for student works that incorporate the application and integration of knowledge and critical thinking skills associated with original problem solving and design projects. The Innovation Portal is an excellent vehicle for helping to achieve that goal.

***********************************************************************************
 
Individual students have been building individual portfolios in the [http://www.pltw.org/ PLTW] EDD class. The [http://www.innovationportal.org/how-to-use-the-portal EDPPSR] (Engineering Design Process Portfolio Scoring Rubric) is being used to encourage Engineering schools, the [http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/Controller.jpf College Board] and [http://www.abet.org/ ABET] to increase:
*admissions into other project-based programs;
*admissions into post-secondary studies;
*career pathway recognition; and
*advanced Placement or dual-credit into more rigorous academic courses.

The rubric doesn't measure teamwork documentation, commitment, transparency, contribution, integrity, or persistence. The rubric has tried to create an information control point by establishing a web site to upload portfolios. The portfolio is forced into a one size fits all mold so that an “efficient” assessment process involving outside experts (College Board) can be created.  Development has been dominated by technology arts K-12 personnel, not STEM. It doesn't separate individual student grading (feedback on daily/weekly basis that forms the basis of gradual improvement) from program or curriculum assessment (goals are all individual, portfolio is individual). The rubric depends heavily upon subjectivity.  EDPPSR hopes that there is a statistically significant, (but as yet undiscovered) “ideal portfolio” vision within the expert engineering portfolio evaluators.
The positives of  EDPPSR are that it:
*focuses on documentation;
*raises assessment questions;
*is general, not focusing on a particular technology.

===Team versus Individual===
The words “teams and projects” lead students to think of sports teams, winning and loosing. They are surprised when there is an individual grading component in a “project” class. The first step in grading an “introduction to engineering class” has been to create a mechanism to separate “We” and “I.”

Introduction to engineering students want to socialize. “We” will happen with no effort by the instructor. The focus has to be on the individual. Engineering problems need to be separated from personal, “life gets in the way” problems. Ignorance needs to be turned into a problem solving asset.  Technician troubleshooting needs to be separated from engineering design. There are lots of “I” issues that start with individuals defining and solving small engineering problems themselves. Open ended projects are merely opportunities to explore small engineering problems.

===Atoms versus Documentation===
Students learn through hands on experiences. Given enough stuff, students will begin playing. If only the final product is assessed, then goal of moving students through playing, doing things first, design and problem solving is not addressed. Students can and will spend enormous amounts of time .. playing .. to get something to work if this is all that is rewarded. The goal of the grading has to be encouraging students to stop and design; to stop and define engineering problems.

There are two ways to get students to stop. The first is to force students to write before, during after they do something of their choice. This improves handwriting, forces carrying engineering notebooks around and captures level of chaotic detail and inspiration that is missed in after the fact, summary writing. Currently this is being done through the GoingToDo, Doing and Analysis triplet. This evolved  from the science triplet of Hyopthesis, Procedure/Testing, Conclusion.

The challenge is to get students to Analyze. The Reflection of EDPPSR has too much in common with service learning reflection (personal life reflection) and not enough in common with testing, analysis, and conclusions. Analysis is described as picking Socratic questions and answering:
*what went right/wrong
*why something went wrong 
*what is the error that is built into the number
*if had more time would have done .......
*a better tool for this job would have been ........
*if could do over again, would have ........
*how this could be done more accurately ......
*if could automate, would improve data by ........
*this was expected, and this was not expected

Three points are given per completed project triplet of &quot;GoingToDo, Doing and Analysis&quot;. One point is given if there is no Analysis. Students generate 3 of these triplets per hour on average. This is called project work in the notebook grading system. It leads to design.

Six points are given per completed problem triplet of “problem, possible solutions and testing” that can get 6 points. This quickly raises the issue of “What is an engineering problem.” “I can not pop all the balloons in the Pogo.com game Poppit?” is not an engineering problem. &quot;Can all the balloons in each game possibly be popped?&quot; is.  Single solutions are not rewarded. Students must brainstorm possible solutions. Testing is determined by context and has to exist. Working through these issues matures student engineers.

===Time versus Accomplishment===
Notebook writing gives a clear indication of time spent. Electronic documentation emphasizes accomplishment. Both are needed. Accomplishment starts off personal and passes from teammate to teammate like a hot potato, each adding something personal. To capture this process, four levels of electronic documentation are needed: weekly personal, weekly team, team summary, commons contribution.

Weekly personal documentation is graded with push points (accomplishment points) that range from 0 to 100. Weekly team documentation is graded 40-80 points, but only if a short presentation is made. Team Summary documentation is motivated by withholding project points from the notebook and push points from individual grading until the Team Summary is done. PLTW promotes the inventing engineer rather than the &quot;do it first&quot; engineer. A Commons Contribution fits into the service motive that forms the root of engineering ethics much more than misleading expectations of invention wealth. Help equate Open Ended Projects with “Open Source” engineering!

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''''The External Assessment Problem'''''

Engineers have supported educational projects through advice, materials, money and review. Project documentation review is all that is needed for external assessment. Once reviews have been accumulated, then some kind of metric can be created. Any other system is going to distort engineering. Engineers want to evaluate projects rather than evaluate individual student portfolios, teachers, courses, or engineering programs.

===Assess Uniqueness===
Every project, every problem an engineer encounters is unique whether in school or on the job. Why are all star forts are unique? Why does every McDonald's built require an engineer? Projects need to be unique. Let K-12 and tech programs argue the merits of hot dog launching projects.

===Assess Repeatability===
The difference between Edison and Tesla was documentation. The audience of documentation is other engineers. Engineers read documentation with one question in mind, “Could I replicate this?”

===How===
Assess by editing wikiversity pages. Change pages if the assessor can clarify, don't penalize. Celebrate communication that leads to clarity, not clarity itself. Don't try to create an assessment rubric. Read and react like an engineer. Read other assessments. Let them inform the current. Wikiversity success is more about process than polishing stagnant information. Wikia has lowered the barrier to document storage, document archiving and document change control … for the planet.

A critical mass of non-engineers is already in wikia. Freshman students named their team “ManBearPig.” A wikiversity editor deleted the team's project page within a day. Students solved the problem with a new name. No track record means no respect, no job. Wikia is already about respect.

===Gain Respect Yourself===
Ultimately reviewers of engineering projects will evolve an organization with a promotion process through levels of responsibility and influence. Start as a student. Continue as a working engineer. Help guide engineering assessment throughout the planet.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''''Whats Next?'''''

Help edit the book &quot;General Engineering Introduction&quot; in wikibooks. Assess general engineering projects in wikiversity. 

===Fear Content===
Content may no longer be the control point. Students can find answers before the question is finished. Calculator-only tests are cruel. When students cannot find an answer to any question, a project is born. How does one prove there is no answer on the Internet? How does one prove the question is badly formed?  These are the more important issues.

Respect now starts with creativity rather than content expertise. Projects are the starting point. Every engineering course should be evolving into an open ended project course. Imagine projects dictating content. Instructors advise. Students choose courses based upon the projects they tackle rather than arbitrary content. Projects can exist outside the educational institution boundaries of grades, semesters, and budgets. Instructors need to turn into invisible program managers. Projects need to dominate over content.

Pushing statics down into the high schools will not solve the content volume problem.  In summary, encyclopedia like courses can not compete with open ended projects.

===DIY, Hackerspaces===
DIY and Hacker spaces are a modern church. Members pay dues and are always trying to dream up cool (open ended) projects that will attract new members. One hacker space is hacking the Bible. They will replace traditional engineering practice if nothing changes.

===Feeding Birds===
A [[wikipedia:Hackerspace|hackerspace]] decided to celebrate the 60th anniversary of [http://www.alcatel-lucent.com/bstj/vol29-1950/articles/bstj29-2-147.pdf Richard Hamming's original paper]. Six people sat facing each other over a narrow table with a power strip down the middle. Each had a [[wikipedia:Netbook|netbook]]. They were reading the paper on line. They started off talking about how far they got in the paper, where they got stuck, what was confusing.

The older engineer tried to clear up some confusion. The hacker space members glanced at him and then started chattering with each other across the table, typing madly at their computers. Then there was a collective silence and all of them looked at the older engineer. The older engineer talked again. The cycle repeated itself until no one had anything to say. 

The older engineer left feeling like he had just fed some birds. Some understood little, some a lot.  They trusted the information they found on the net. They trusted that the collective mind in that room could figure anything out. They didn't feel obligated to understand everything. They had boundaries that the older engineer did not have. The older engineer felt obligated to absorb any information in the article or book. What set the boundary of the younger people?

The next generation's context is evolving on the web, not in text books or articles. What web sites are popular? What are their names? What has a wikia page? The boundaries of younger people seem to be set personally. Brains are being structured to hold searchable keywords (artifacts or archetypes like thingiverse or instructables), not content. Do we really want to answer the boundary question? .. yes it is “open ended projects”.

* &lt;font size=3&gt;Early meter stamps of Ireland are inscribed “SAORSTAT EIREANN”, and later ones show a variation of “EIRE” in the frank. Some post office meters do not show the country name and can be recognized only by the town name, an image of a harp, “POSTAS IOCTHA” (Postage Paid) or “POST NA MBEART” (Parcel Post).
* Many Irish meter types do not show leading zeros in the value figures (V/F). Several meter types show no or only one leading zero for low denominations (e.g. 3 or 03) although they are capable of printing values up to 999½.
* The stamps are grouped according to political conditions and inscription:
:: '''A''' - Irish Free State: SAORSTAT EIREANN
:: '''B''' - Republic: éIRe
:: '''PO''' - Special stamps generated only by Post Office meters
:: '''PP''' - Special stamps generated only for Parcel Post

      <text xml:space="preserve">I was born in Kranj, Slovenia in 1971, and grew up in Solkan, where I attended the local grade school. I attended high school in Nova Gorica.  Slovenia is a great place for skiing and hiking.  This is one of my favorite hikes there.  I came to the US as an exchange student in Virginia, MN.  I then studied at Yale and got my Ph.D. in Economics from Princeton.  I now work at Dartmouth College.
 
I am married to Eric Edmonds.  We are very proud parents to Ella and Mia.

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to [[Help|help]] you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* Make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window (if javascript is enabled on your browser) that will insert it too (looks like part of a signature). This will let others know who left it, and make it easy to reply back to you.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]] (global to the system) or in a page on your own userspace.
* Remember to use [[Commons:Main Page|Commons]] project for image uploading.
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* Wikibooks are open-source textbooks. ([[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]]).
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer since things work a little different here.
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]].
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Help us by participating in policy and guideline creation.
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to keep a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you have questions, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or [[User_talk:Panic2k4|ask me personally on my talk page]]. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be a good idea to add that page to your &quot;[[Special:Watchlist|watchlist]]&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there. You can do that by clicking the tab labeled &quot;watch&quot; at the top of the page.

&lt;small&gt;&lt;small&gt;(This is not an automated message, I'll be watching during a time for any reply you make to it...)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

Good luck and I also take this chance to thank you for the heads-up regarding the deployment of the new MediaWiki version.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 21:36, 4 October 2011 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">When you draw something with OpenGL, you see colors on the screen, but keep in mind that there are other buffers than the color buffer.  You are already familiar with the depth buffer, that prevent background pixels from being displayed if there is a closer pixel already.  Now it's time to introduce the stencil buffer.

= Concept =

The stencil buffer is another buffer for your custom use: you can store per-pixel information there and direct OpenGL to act differently depending on that information.

There are quite a few points to understand to manipulate the stencil buffer correctly, so let's take time to learn them.

= Bitplanes =

This is mostly a matter of vocabulary: the per-pixel information is a number of ''bitplanes'' - that is, of bits.

For instance, it is common to have 8 bitplanes, which means one byte is associate with each pixel on screen, and you can store up to &lt;math&gt;2^8=256&lt;/math&gt; different values.  You can inspect the number of bitplanes using &lt;code&gt;glGetIntegerv(GL_STENCIL_BITS, &amp;i)&lt;/code&gt;.

= Tests and Operations =

The stencil buffer can be manipulated using &lt;code&gt;glStencilFunc&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;glStencilOp&lt;/code&gt;: &lt;code&gt;glStencilFunc&lt;/code&gt; specifies a test to apply to each pixel of the stencil buffer, then &lt;code&gt;glStencilOp&lt;/code&gt; specifies the action to apply depending on the test result.

&lt;code&gt;glStencilFunc&lt;/code&gt; takes 3 parameters, to build the following test &lt;code&gt;(ref &amp; mask) OP (stencil &amp; mask)&lt;/code&gt;:
* ''OP'': one of GL_NEVER, GL_ALWAYS, GL_EQUAL, GL_NOTEQUAL, GL_LESS, GL_LEQUAL, GL_GEQUAL, GL_GREATER
* ''ref'': a fixed integer used in the comparison
* ''mask'': a mask applied to both ''ref'' and the stencil pixel; you can use 0xFF (if you have 8 bitplanes) to disable the mask

&lt;code&gt;glStencilOp&lt;/code&gt; takes 3 parameters:
* ''sfail'': the test from &lt;code&gt;glStencilFunc&lt;/code&gt; failed
* ''dpfail'': the test from &lt;code&gt;glStencilFunc&lt;/code&gt; passed, but the depth buffer test failed
* ''dppass'': the test from &lt;code&gt;glStencilFunc&lt;/code&gt; passed, and the depth buffer passed or is disabled
Each of these 3 parameters is an action to perform on the stencil buffer, one of GL_KEEP, GL_ZERO, GL_REPLACE, GL_INCR, GL_INCR_WRAP, GL_DECR, GL_DECR_WRAP, GL_INVERT (default GL_KEEP).

'''So''', we see that two differents tests are chained, resulting in '''3 situations''':
* first &lt;code&gt;glStencilFunc&lt;/code&gt;, if it fails we apply ''sfail'' and stop
* then depth-test (if depth buffer is available and enabled), if it fails we execute ''dpfail'' and stop
* if both tests work, we evaluate the fragment buffer in the color buffer and apply ''dppass''
Note that with ''sfail'' and ''dpfail'', the color buffer is left unmodified.

If you draw a volumetric shape, keep in mind that OpenGL may draw the same stencil pixel several times, depending on the order of overlapping triangles and/or the availability of the depth buffer; in such cases, your action will be applied several times.

= Sample =

[[File:OpenGL Tutorial Stencil.png|thumb|Rotating cube, clipped]]
In our example, we'll draw a moving circle, and the scene will be clipped inside that circle:

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
/* main */
  glutInitDisplayMode(GLUT_RGBA|GLUT_ALPHA|GLUT_DOUBLE|GLUT_DEPTH|GLUT_STENCIL);
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
/* onDisplay */
  glClear(GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT);
  glEnable(GL_STENCIL_TEST);
  glColorMask(GL_FALSE, GL_FALSE, GL_FALSE, GL_FALSE);
  glDepthMask(GL_FALSE);
  glStencilFunc(GL_NEVER, 1, 0xFF);
  glStencilOp(GL_REPLACE, GL_KEEP, GL_KEEP);  // draw 1s on test fail (always)

  // draw stencil pattern
  glStencilMask(0xFF);
  glClear(GL_STENCIL_BUFFER_BIT);  // needs mask=0xFF
  draw_circle();

  glColorMask(GL_TRUE, GL_TRUE, GL_TRUE, GL_TRUE);
  glDepthMask(GL_TRUE);
  glStencilMask(0x00);
  // draw where stencil's value is 0
  glStencilFunc(GL_EQUAL, 0, 0xFF);
  /* (nothing to draw) */
  // draw only where stencil's value is 1
  glStencilFunc(GL_EQUAL, 1, 0xFF);

  draw_scene();

  glDisable(GL_STENCIL_TEST);
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;draw_scene&lt;/code&gt; draws the color cube from [[../Modern_OpenGL_Tutorial_05|tutorial 05]], and &lt;code&gt;draw_circle&lt;/code&gt; draws a circle in [[../Modern_OpenGL_Tutorial_2D|2d mode]].  We won't discuss these functions because they are not related to the stencil feature, but you're invited to look at the source code (see at the link at the bottom of this page).

Note that there's no need to use a separate program to draw in the stencil buffer.  In this case it makes sense, because we draw a 2D pattern, but it's perfectly possible to draw a 3D pattern in the same scene, as in the [[../Mini-Portal|Mini-Portal]] tutorial.

= Working on color, depth and/or stencil buffers specifically =

In the sample, we see that we first worked exclusively on the stencil buffer to draw the stencil shape, then exclusively on the color buffer to use it as a mask.

When you want to modify the stencil buffer without modifying the color buffer and/or depth buffer, you can mask these buffers:
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
  glColorMask(GL_FALSE, GL_FALSE, GL_FALSE, GL_FALSE);
  glDepthMask(GL_FALSE);
&lt;/source&gt;
Don't forget to set them back.
You can save the previous values this way:
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
  GLboolean save_color_mask[4];
  GLboolean save_depth_mask;
  glGetBooleanv(GL_COLOR_WRITEMASK, save_color_mask);
  glGetBooleanv(GL_DEPTH_WRITEMASK, &amp;save_depth_mask);

  /* Do something */

  glColorMask(save_color_mask[0], save_color_mask[1], save_color_mask[2], save_color_mask[3]);
  glDepthMask(save_depth_mask);
&lt;/source&gt;

If you want to apply changes on the color buffer without modifying the buffer, you can either:
* set &lt;code&gt;glStencilMask(0x00)&lt;/code&gt; - this means nothing will be written in any condition
* set &lt;code&gt;glStencilOp(GL_KEEP, GL_KEEP, GL_KEEP)&lt;/code&gt; - which applies a no-op for all conditions

= Debugging =

It is difficult to understand what is wrong when working on the stencil buffer, because we have no direct way to see it.

If you use OpenGL non-ES, you can call &lt;code&gt;glReadPixels&lt;/code&gt; to grab the whole stencil buffer and inspect it externally, but it's tedious.

Another method is to fill the screen using two triangles, and with a stencil test (for instance, to match only non-0 stencil pixels).
You may need to enable/disable the color buffer when doing so.

Then swap the OpenGL color buffer and pause, so you can inspect the result visually:

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
      glColorMask(GL_TRUE, GL_TRUE, GL_TRUE, GL_TRUE);
      glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT);
      glStencilMask(0x00);
      glStencilFunc(GL_LEQUAL, 1, 0xFF);
      fill_screen();
      glutSwapBuffers();
      cout &lt;&lt; &quot;swap&quot; &lt;&lt; endl;
      sleep(1);
      glStencilMask(0xFF);
      glColorMask(GL_FALSE, GL_FALSE, GL_FALSE, GL_FALSE);
&lt;/source&gt;

Your &lt;code&gt;fill_screen()&lt;/code&gt; function will preferably use a dedicated program that will involve no MVP matrix, though you can reuse an existing program and pass &lt;code&gt;v=glm::mat4(1)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;m=glm::inverse(projection)&lt;/code&gt;.

= Performances =

We saw there are three possible actions in &lt;code&gt;glStencilOp&lt;/code&gt;:
* sfail
* dpfail
* dppass

It is true that it's counter-intuitive to express your action on the stencil buffer using the ''sfail'' action, because of the double-negation (instead of &quot;do this when this condition is met&quot;, you have to write &quot;don't do this when this condition is not met).

However, if you use ''dppass'' to express your action, keep in mind that OpenGL will check both the stencil and depth test, and will also compute the pixel value using the fragment shader.  This is a terrible performance hit if you are only drawing a shape in the stencil buffer - because you don't need to call the fragment shader at all.

A suggestion is to first implement your drawing algorithm using ''dppass'' for clarity, and once it works, reverse the conditions in &lt;code&gt;glStencilFunc&lt;/code&gt; and use the ''sfail''.  ''sfail'' will not try to evaluate the pixel fragment when the test fails, so it's faster.

Example:
* First prototype with:
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
    glStencilFunc(GL_NOTEQUAL, 0, 0xFF);
    glStencilOp(GL_KEEP, GL_KEEP, GL_INCR);  // +1 when current pixel != 0
&lt;/source&gt;
* then optimize:
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
    glStencilFunc(GL_EQUAL, 0, 0xFF);
    glStencilOp(GL_INCR, GL_KEEP, GL_KEEP);  // +1 when !(current pixel == 0)
&lt;/source&gt;

= Limitations =

The OpenGL 4.2 core profile specification mentions:
: ''However, when both depth and stencil attachments are present, implementations are only required to support framebuffer objects where both attachments refer to the same image.'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opengl.org/registry/doc/glspec42.core.20110822.pdf |title=The OpenGL Graphics System: A Specification - Version 4.2 (Core Profile) |publisher=Khronos.org |date=2011-08-22 |accessdate=2011-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This means that you probably cannot attach two renderbuffers to a single frame buffer.

In OpenGL ES 2.0 in particular, combined formats are not supported (&lt;code&gt;GL_FRAMEBUFFER_UNSUPPORTED&lt;/code&gt;) in &lt;code&gt;glRenderbufferStorage&lt;/code&gt; (only &lt;code&gt;DEPTH_COMPONENT16&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;STENCIL_INDEX8&lt;/code&gt; are supported, typically ''not'' &lt;code&gt;DEPTH32F_STENCIL8&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;DEPTH24_STENCIL8&lt;/code&gt;).

If you need to combine [[../Post-Processing|post-processing]] and stenciling, you'll need to avoid framebuffer objects and use the 
&lt;code&gt;glCopyTexSubImage2D&lt;/code&gt; technique instead.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Background==
Breast Cancer Related Lymphoedema (BCRL) is a possible long term side effect of breast cancer treatment&lt;ref name=&quot;doman&quot; &gt; &quot;Study explores best exercise for breast cancer survivors&quot; Author: Claudia Doman. Retrieved from http://www.canberra.edu.au/faculties/health/news &lt;/ref&gt;. [[w:Lymphedema#cite_note-lymphnet-9|Lymphoedema]] (or Lymphedema) is a chronic build up of lymph fluid caused by partial or complete obstruction of lymph nodes &lt;ref name=&quot;schmitz&quot; &gt;Schmitz, K.H., Ahmed, R.L., Troxel, A., Cheville, A., Smith, R., Lewis-Grant, L.,Bryan, C.J.,Williams-Smith, C.T &amp; Greene, Q.P., 2009, “Weight Lifting in Women with Breast-Cancer–Related Lymphedema”, N Engl J Med 2009; vol 361, pp664-673 (August 13, 2009) http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa0810118#t=articleMethods&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;lane&quot; &gt; Lane, K., Worsley, D. &amp; McKenzie, D. 2005, &quot;Exercise and the Lymphatic System: Implications for Breast-Cancer Survivors, Sports Med. vol.35(6), p461-471&lt;/ref&gt;. Risk factors for developing BCRL include&lt;ref name=&quot;schmitz&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;livestrong&quot;&gt; Livestrong.org - Physical Effects of Cancer: Lympoedema http://www.livestrong.org/Get-Help/Learn-About-Cancer/Cancer-Support-Topics/Physical-Effects-of-Cancer/Lymphedema&lt;/ref&gt;:
:*biopsy of axillary (arm pit) lymph nodes
:*removal or axillary lymph nodes
:*radiation therapy
:*obesity
:*tumour stage
&lt;br /&gt; 
Damage to the axillary lymph nodes during cancer treatment can impair or decrease the function of lymph vessels draining lymph from the arm to be returned to the blood stream&lt;ref name=&quot;lane&quot; /&gt;. This can result in a build-up of fluid in the arm, chest or breast. Once the condition presents it is incurable and treatments focus on controlling the volume of swelling and infections.

==Resistance Exercise== 
Breast Cancer patients often avoid use of the affected limb out of fear of worsening the symptoms of BCRL&lt;ref name=&quot;lane&quot; /&gt;. While this intends to reduce harm it can lead to a reduction in quality of life from further complications including:
:*'''Increased''' risk of injuring the weakened limb
:*'''Decreased''' physical recovery
:*'''Decreased''' muscle mass
:*'''Decreased bone''' density
:*'''Increased''' body weight
:*'''Decreased''' employment prospects
&lt;br /&gt;
These issues can make everyday tasks like picking up a child difficult and greatly impacts on the long term health of the woman. 
&lt;br /&gt;
===Benefits of Resistance Exercise===
Recent research has reduced concerns and shown resistance type exercises to not increase lymphoedema and to be safe for patients with BCRL while providing considerable health benefits &lt;ref name=&quot;schmitz&quot; /&gt;. Resistance exercise has been shown to: 
:*'''Control''' the severity of BCRL&lt;ref name=&quot;schmitz&quot; /&gt;
:*'''Increase''' lymph flow&lt;ref name=&quot;schmitz&quot; /&gt;
:*'''Decrease''' the number and severity of BCRL sypmtoms&lt;ref name=&quot;schmitz&quot; /&gt; 
:*'''Increase''' strength&lt;ref name=&quot;schmitz&quot; /&gt;
:*'''Control''' body fat&lt;ref name=&quot;schmitz&quot; /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Consideration should also be given to the psychological health benefits &lt;ref name=&quot;doman&quot; /&gt; of resistance exercise including: 
:*'''Improved''' self esteem&lt;ref name=&quot;schmitz&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;doman&quot; /&gt;
:*'''Improved''' self confidence&lt;ref name=&quot;schmitz&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;doman&quot; /&gt;
:*'''Improved''' social interactions&lt;ref name=&quot;schmitz&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;doman&quot; /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

This research may indicate it is unreasonable to recommend breast cancer patients completely avoid physical activity and lifting loads equivalent to everyday tasks. This may include:
:*carrying a small bag of groceries
:*hanging washing
:*pushing a stroller
&lt;br /&gt; 

Promising research is being undertake to determine the best type of resistance exercises for BCRL patients with results to be published shortly.

&lt;br /&gt;
===Considerations and Precautions===
While research has shown the safety of resistance type exercises some care and planning needs to be taken:
:*discuss physical activity with your doctor to determine what may be appropriate.
:*ensure infections and exacerbations of lymphoedema are under control.
:*stop any activity which causes swelling or pain in the limb.

http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Visual_Basic/History
&quot;
With version 5.0 (February 1997), Microsoft released Visual Basic exclusively for 32-bit versions of Windows. Programmers who preferred to write 16-bit programs were able to import programs written in Visual Basic 4.0 to Visual Basic 5.0, and Visual Basic 5.0 programs can easily be &lt;u&gt;'''converted with'''&lt;/u&gt; Visual Basic 4.0. Visual Basic 5.0 also introduced the ability to create custom user controls, as well as the ability to compile to native Windows executable code, speeding up runtime code execution.
Visual Basic 6.0 (Mid 1998) improved in a number of areas, including the ability to create web-based applications using Internet Explorer. Visual Basic 6 is no longer supported.
&quot;
1)     &lt;u&gt;'''converted with'''&lt;/u&gt;
Please link to further details or rephrase.  Is this a 'compile' process or some kind of 'import' procedure
2)     This seems incomplete.
MS currently offers VB Express and Studio... level packages.  A brief history of how these all relate and intervening development stages is of interest to me ... and perhaps others.
More detail regarding 'Getting Started' at low prices and the consequences of reduced level of functionality and later migration would help me and, I hope, may become clearer as I read on.
I am in a special case and would greatly benefit from System Requirements information...  I have inherited an iMac running Snow Leopard 10.8.6 and have not installed a Windows environment yet [cannot afford and don't really know how or whether to upgrade to Lion and try to get registered, etc. as am retired and unsure whether I will get very far with building the APP/Widgets I am trying to design.]

== Getting Started needs a bit more introductory material ==

&quot;Start VB&quot;
Seems simple but given my current situation, where do I get VB?  Will it run on my iMac [see above] or will I need a whole new machine or need to load a Windows environment onto this one?  
Is VB6 available as a free download as is Express?
If VB6 requires a different system, why not go to Express?
Why should I be doing this if I must eventually upgrade to some form of VB10 or 11...?

I see that:
&quot;This page was last modified on 17 November 2010, at 04:26.&quot;
which is only somewhat reassuring since anyone could have made some small change and this Discussion I am trying to start might sit idle and unresponded to for some time.  I have never been sure how to come back to an area where I have made comments and hope anyone offering guidance will also send me an email.

'''mbrlen''' is the standard library function used to determine the length of the multi-byte character using conversion state . The mbrlen function differ from '[[mblen]]' '[[mblen l]]' by its restartability.

== Need ==
To use this function in program one  include the standrad [[header file]]&lt;[[wchar.h]]&gt;.

== Syntax ==
 size_t mbrlen (const char *s, size_t maxsize, mbstate_t *ps ).&lt;br /&gt;
the mbrlen() function inspects at most maxsize of the string pointed  i.e. s and extracts the next complete multibyte character . It updates the shift state *ps .If the multibyte character is not the [[NULL]] wide character , it returns the number of the bytes that were consumed by s.

== Return value ==
(size_t) - 2 : the resulting conversion state indicates an incomplete multibyte character after all   maxsize character were converted .&lt;br /&gt;
 
(size_t) - 1 : the function detected an encoding error before completing  the next multibyte chracter , in which case the function errno to EILSEQ amd leaves the resulting conversion state undefined.

0 : the next complete character is a null character , in which  case the resulting conversion state is the initial  conversion state .&lt;br /&gt;
 
positive : if the next n or fewer byte complete a valid character ; the value returned shall be the number of bytes that complete the character .

'''&lt;code&gt;strxfrm&lt;/code&gt;''' is a [[C Standard Library]] string function as defined in [[string.h]]. It transforms string according to the current locale setting. 

The [[prototype]] of this function is:
   size_t strxfrm(char *str1 , const char *str2 , size_t num);


==Parameters==
====str1====
is the string which receives num characters of transformed string. If num is equal to zero then str1 contains only [[null]] character.
====str2====
is the string which is to be transformed.
====num====
is the maximum number of characters which to be copied into str1.

==Description==
strxfrm() function transforms str2 according to the current locale setting.For that LC_COLLATE category is used which is defined in [[locale.h]]. After transformation, the first num characters of the transformed string is copied into str1.
strxfrm() function performs transformation in such a way that result of [[strcmp]] on two strings is the same as result of [[strcoll] on two original strings. 

==Return Value==
strxfrm() function returns length of transformed string excluding terminating [[null]] character.
==Example usage==
&lt;source lang=c&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;
 
int main(void)
{
    char str2[] = &quot;Hello World&quot;;
    char str1[];
    printf(&quot;The length of str2 = %d\n&quot;,strxfrm(str1, str2, 4));
    printf(&quot;The content of str1 = %s\n&quot;, str1[]);
    printf(&quot;The content of str2 = %s\n&quot;, str2[]);
    return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

===Output===
The length of str2 = 11&lt;br /&gt;
The content of str1 = Hell&lt;br /&gt;
The content of str2 = Hello World&lt;br /&gt;

'''&lt;code&gt;fgetws&lt;/code&gt;''' is a function in the C programming language. It is wide-character version of the function &lt;code&gt;fgets&lt;/code&gt;. The ''w'' in &lt;code&gt;fgetws&lt;/code&gt; is for wide. A ''string'' is read  as a ''multibyte-character'' or ''a wide character string '' by &lt;code&gt;fgetws&lt;/code&gt; depending on whether the stream is opened in ''text/binary mode'' respectively. The &lt;code&gt;fgetws&lt;/code&gt; subroutine reads characters from the input stream, converts them to the corresponding wide character codes, and places them in the array pointed to by the string parameter.

The subroutine continues until either:
* The number of characters specified by the number parameter '-1' are read 
* The subroutine encounters a newline or EOF character.

The fgetws subroutine terminates the wide character string with a NULL wide character.

==Syntax==
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;wchar.h&gt;
wchar_t *fgetws( 
    wchar_t *string;
    int n;
    FILE *stream ;
);
&lt;/source&gt;

==Parameters==
fgetws has three parameters:
# &lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt; - a string used to provide storage location for data
# &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; - the maximum number of readable characters
# &lt;code&gt;stream&lt;/code&gt; - a FILE pointer

==Requirements==
Although fgetws is wider relative to fgets, it can be compiled by an additional optional header along with stdio.h called wchar.h. However, fgets requires stdio.h compulsorily. Hence, fgetws provides option.

==Return value==
Just as fgets function, fgetws function also returns the same value string  i.e. a '''ws''' is returned on success. The error condition is taken care-of by this function using a NULL pointer. A Null pointer is returned to the function-called for error or even at EOF(end of file). One can use also use the feof or ferror for error determination.

==Compatibility==
ubuntu, fedora, ANSI, Win 98, Win Me, Win NT, Win 2000, Win XP

'''iswdigit''' is a function in included in the C Standard Library header wctype.h. It checks if a wide character is a decimal digit in the current locale (always includes '0' to '9'). The iswdigit function is a wide charactered version of isdigit function.

==Syntax==
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;int iswdigit(wint_t wc);&lt;/source&gt;

==Return value ==
The iswdigit function return non zero value if its argument is a digit between 0 to 9. In other cases, a zero value because of it's independent working.

== Example ==
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;wctype.h&gt;

int main(void) {
    for (unsigned i = 0; i &lt; 0xff; i++) {
        printf(&quot;%x, %s\n&quot;, i, iswdigit(i) ? &quot;digit&quot; : &quot;not a digit&quot;);
    }
    return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

== C standard library imports ==

I requested several pages you've imported to be deleted. Most of them are either about non-standard functions or not manual-like pages. I think former should be not present in both Wikipedia and Wikibooks, the latter doesn't need to be imported as it is easier to create a new page that to copyedit. Just in case you wonder. [[User:1exec1|1exec1]] ([[User talk:1exec1|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/1exec1|contribs]]) 19:40, 18 October 2011 (UTC)

: Okay. It's somewhat easier to sort this out after importing everything than doing it beforehand. [[User:Ruud Koot|Ruud Koot]] ([[User talk:Ruud Koot|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Ruud Koot|contribs]]) 19:46, 18 October 2011 (UTC)

:: &lt;code&gt;strcasecmp&lt;/code&gt; is listed as an extension by the Open Group [http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007904975/functions/strcasecmp.html]. It would seem appropriate to include, but a proper naming convention/method to mark is as a non-standard extensions needs to be established as well.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In this chapter we will go through gathering customer information from the perspective of a retail business. We will show why it is beneficial to the growth of your company to collect consumer data by yourself as well as researching any available data so that you can make the best decisions. There will be comparisons of the many ways to go about collecting data, as well as how to do it. Then, more importantly, we will discuss the many options you have in utilizing that data, whether it be discounting certain items together or sending coupons to a specific set of people. 

==Why collect data?==
There are many positive things retailers can do with a massive database that would help the business as well as the consumer. If they see that people who buy cookies usually buy milk as well than one thing they might want to do is arrange them in the store so that if you go to get cookies you pass the milk section. This helps the business sell more as well as suggest to the consumer something they may want but did not think of. In classical economics when we consider what will affect the quantity demanded of a product the only factor we consider is the price. However when we realistically look at the retail industry of a supermarket we know this is not true. There are many other factors that influence consumers purchasing behaviors such as product placement, display size, appearance of label, and many others.

Product appearance is more specifically aimed at which item will sell, not if it will sell. For instance if your going to buy frozen vegetables you might be more inclined to buy the one that is wrapped in a green wrapper than a brown wrapper because it gives you the idea that it is healthier since green is associated with healthiness. This however can affect the supermarket since many times the supermarket offers there own generic brand of many items, and if they can realize that the product appearance can be improved than there item will have a considerable advantage in appearance and price. There are so many variables when it comes to how consumers behavior will respond to different things. How can we tell if a consumer will be less likely to buy fruit if there's only a few there opposed to the entire display being full. The only way to make an educated decision on something with so many variables is to physically test it over and over and see what works the best. There is a need to collect data on this so that we can understand what works best and what needs to be done, but that leaves us with other questions. What is the best way to collect this data and turn it into information, how can we know that the data we collect will translate into results that work.

==How do we physically collect the data?==
If the retail industry you are assessing is a supermarket there are a few different ways we can collect data. Manual counting and a computer generated system don’t compare closely in ease of use and price to use. A manual count of everything that happens would be extremely time consuming and would be completely inefficient. Because of the advances in the technological world there is a way to compile this data automatically every time something is rang into the register. After you compile the data there are many different ways to compile it. 

You can compile data specifically for each consumer by using a membership system that you must sign up for. An alternative option would be to employ an open membership policy, in this system you would compile data that spoke to the supermarket as a whole. We will go into the different ways you might want to sort the data later.

Consider fictional consumers Nancy and Sally, Nancy has no preference to which supermarket she goes to and usually bounces around to many different ones. Sally on the other hand always goes to the same supermarket because it is so close to her house and she has always been satisfied with it. Nancy at some point might sign up for a membership to one of the supermarkets but she is unlikely to do so because she has no habit of going to the same one. Nancy however is very likely to be a member of her supermarket because she always goes to the same one and she would be foolish to not take part in the discounts offered for being a member. This example shows that regardless of what system you use its not going to be the best for everyone. One important aspect of understanding how you would like to collect data is to first collect data of which type of customers you have more of, Nancy or Sally. Are the consumers dominantly one time shoppers or loyal customers. If you can understand the type of business you are getting than you have a better chance to use a system that will be effective for you.

==Which way of collection is right for you?==
To understand which data collection method you want to implicate you need to understand which type of information you want to receive. If you collect your data on a customer basis instead of an overall database for your store you will get data that can be used to give personal rebates and coupons to boost sales. When you analyze what your company needs, you can than decide which way is the best for you. There are a few guidelines that would benefit you to follow when deciding how to go about collecting and analyzing your data.

===Pre-data collection steps ===
#Clearly define the goals and objectives of the data collection  so that you know your purpose for the study, this is one of the most important aspects of the research. Even if you do everything else right without having the correct aim for implementation of your data could make it entirely useless.
#Clearly define the data collection plan  such as when to record the price of a product bought, or how to quantify location of a product.
#Ensure data collection repeatability, reproducibility, and accuracy so that the data can be reliable.

===What do we do with our database?===
Sometimes when we have a large data set we simply use algorithms to find patterns that we can use to our advantage in a few different ways. Other applications of this information would be utilizing not just what is bought, but the behavior of the consumer. A great example of this would be to look at some airline companies, they change the price of the same exact ticket depending on how you search for the flight. They did a lot of studies that showed people who search for flight based solely on date and price don’t care about amenities such as paying for food. A smart utilization of this information was to charge you to book your bags. People don’t realize to factor in that cost when comparing flights so you end up paying that airline the same amount of money as the other one without realizing it. Amazon and a lot of other online retailers show another example of behavioral analysis when you search for an item, down below it they have a few options of other things you might like. This way when you are shopping for something you are more likely to buy another product because they know that they usually go together. So how can we get from our database to the utilization of our information? With a process called Data Mining.

===Data Mining===
Data mining is the process of extracting patterns from data. As more data are gathered, data mining is becoming an increasingly important tool to transform these data into information. While data mining can be used to uncover patterns in data samples, it is important to be aware that the samples of data may produce results that are not always accurate. You need to make sure you have a large enough sample size before deciding to make decisions based on the information you have received. Likewise you must realize that there are patterns that may not appear in your data set even if they do exist, just because a pattern does not show up does not mean its not there. To start “mining” your data you must first go through your data set and ensure that there are no inconsistencies. Eliminate mistakes from your data set to reduce the possibility of coming to wrong conclusions once you analyze the data correctly it is up to you to use the information as best you can.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Summary==

A universal definition of High-speed railroad (HSR) does not exist. Different regions in the world have different ways to define high speed rail in terms of its operating speed. For example, the common North America practice considers high speed rail to run over 180 km/h, or 110 mph while the Asian and European countries generally categorize trains that have a top operating speed of 200 km/h (125 mph) or more as high speed rail. Because of its high speed, high operation frequency, high capacity, environmental-friendliness and potential social benefits especially in highly dense areas, high speed rail technology is very popular across the world. 
Having seen the success of the high speed rail in other countries, the Chinese government decided to develop its own high speed rail technology and network in order to mitigate its existing intercity traffic problem. It plans to spend $300 billion on high speed rail development by the year of 2020, one of the largest infrastructure development expenditures ever in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;T7&quot;&gt;Forsythe, Michael. &quot;Letter From China - Is China's Economy Speeding Off the Rails? - NYTimes.com.&quot; The New York Times - Breaking News, World News &amp; Multimedia. 22 Dec. 2009. Web. [http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/23/world/asia/23iht-letter.html].&lt;/ref&gt; Aggressive government proposals to raise the speed of rail travel include upgrading high speed rail tracks and build new HSR track have been followed by massive deployment resulting in an exponential growth of the higher speed track system as well as an increase in average rail travel speeds across the country.

Only a decade after pursuing HSR technology and infrastructure, the Chinese’ set the world speed record and are now aggressively seeking to export its technology to other parts of the world. Such glorious success has wowed the world. Chinese HSR success is often used to support the development of high speed rail in the United States. However, the success in terms of rapid development in high speed rail technology and expansion of the high speed rail network in China has come with great problems. By skipping technology mastery and going straight to rapid deployment, questions have been raised in terms of the financial justification for the project which resulted in huge deficit for the Ministry of Railway and safety and environmental concerns. The Wenzhou crash, in which dozens died, has raised great concerns for safety and the policy issues surrounding the rapid progress.

==Timeline==
*December 1990: The Ministry of Railways (MOR) submitted a proposal to build a high speed railway between Beijing and Shanghai to the Nantional People’s Congress. It was the first time the high speed rail was proposed as an option for intercity transportation. &lt;ref name=&quot;T1&quot;&gt;&quot;Wenzhou High Speed Rail Started Construction (In Chinese).&quot; PRC Government Website. 18 Apr. 2008. Web. [http://www.gov.cn/jrzg/2008-04/18/content_947868.htm].&lt;/ref&gt;
*December 1994: The State Council commissioned a feasibility study for the line.&lt;ref name=&quot;T1&quot;&gt;&quot;Wenzhou High Speed Rail Started Construction (In Chinese).&quot; PRC Government Website. 18 Apr. 2008. Web. [http://www.gov.cn/jrzg/2008-04/18/content_947868.htm].&lt;/ref&gt;Guangzhou-Shenzhen Railway became the first line in China to offer sub-high speed service of 160 km/h using domestically-produced DF-class diesel locomotives during the “Speed Up Campaign”.
*1995: Premier Li Peng announced that preparatory work on the Beijing Shanghai HSR would begin in the 9th Five Year Plan (1996-2000). Construction was not scheduled. 
*1998: Guangzhou-Shenzhen line was electrified and by introducing Swedish-made X 2000 trains, the service speed increased to 200km/h. 
*Oct. 12th, 2003: Qinshen Railroad started operation as the first passenger only railroad line in China. The line featured the “China Star” electrified locomotive with a designed speed of 200km/h and a top speed of 300km/h. The MOR discontinued developing the China Star because of its technological flaws.&lt;ref name=&quot;T2&quot;&gt;&quot;Kanke Magazine Special Edition: China Rail History (In Chinese).&quot; Wangyi News. 30 Jun. 2011 Web. [http://news.163.com/photoview/3R710001/15359.html].&lt;/ref&gt;
*2004: Shanghai Maglev Train connecting the Pudong Airport and Shanghai’s central business district opened. Its top speed reached 431 km/h (268 mph). Although it is a mature and efficient technology, the maglev has not gained widespread use in the world because of its high cost and concerns for safety. 
*June 2004: The MOR accepted bids from Alstom of France, Bombardier Transportation of Germany, and Kawasaki of Japan for 200 high speed train sets with top speed of 200 km/h with the terms of technology transfer.&lt;ref name=&quot;T3&quot;&gt;&quot;The Birth and Growth of China High Speed Rail (In Chinese).&quot; Xinhua News. Web. [http://news.xinhuanet.com/globe/2010-03/04/content_13096289.htm].&lt;/ref&gt;
*June to September 2005: The MOR bought train sets with a top speed of 350km/h.
*2006: The State Council in its Mid-to-Long Term Railway Development Plan, adopted conventional track HSR technology over maglev. This decision enabled rapid construction of standard gauge, passenger dedicated HSR lines in China.
*April 2007: The high speed rail system upgraded to more that 423 km (263 mi) of tracks capable of supporting 250 km/h (155 mph) train service and 3,002 km (1,865 mi) of tracks capable of supporting 200 km/h (124 mph) as a result of the Speed Up Campaign.&lt;ref name=&quot;T4&quot;&gt;&quot;Six-Round Rail Speed up (In Chinese).&quot; CCTV News. Web. [http://news.cctv.com/china/20070417/105210.shtml].&lt;/ref&gt;
*2008: The first high speed rail with an operating speed over 300 km/h connecting Beijing and Tianjing was completed.
*April 18th 2008: The high speed railway between Beijing and Shanghai was the world’s first high speed rail with a 380km/h designed speed. And the MOR decided to develop new trains that can operate at that level.
*Jan. 2011: 13 high speed rails have been built so far with a total length of 8358 km. &lt;ref name=&quot;T2&quot;&gt;&quot;Kanke Magazine Special Edition: China Rail History (In Chinese).&quot; Wangyi News. 30 Jun. 2011 Web.                               [http://news.163.com/photoview/3R710001/15359.html].&lt;/ref&gt;
*April 2011: The new Minister of Railways, Sheng Guangzu, announced delay of some current construction projects and speed reductions due to concerns for corruption, safety, financial sustainability and environmental impact.&lt;ref name=&quot;T5&quot;&gt;&quot;China: Off the Rails? | The Economist.&quot; The Economist - World News, Politics, Economics, Business &amp; Finance. Web. [http://www.economist.com/node/18488554?story_id=18488554].&lt;/ref&gt;
*July 23rd, 2011: Wenzhou Train accident occurred where two high speed trains crashed. Over 30 deaths have been confirmed with hundreds injured. 
*August  2011: The Chinese government announced suspending approvals of any new high-speed rail lines and enforced further speed reductions of 50 km/h. A 5 percent ticket price cut was implemented in order to stimulate ridership.&lt;ref name=&quot;T6&quot;&gt;Dingding, Xin. &quot;More High-speed Trains Slow down to Improve Safety|Society|chinadaily.com.cn.&quot; Chinadaily US Edition.

==Narrative==


===History===
Because of the Qing Dynasty’s closed-door policy, the technology development in China was rather slow. The introduction of western advanced technology to China, including guns, the steam engine and the railroad happened during and after the First Opium War, when the British Empire successfully invaded China in 1840. The first railroad in China, the 14.5 km Wusong Railroad in Shanghai was built by the British Empire in 1875. &lt;ref name=&quot;T2&quot;&gt;&quot;Kanke Magazine Special Edition: China Rail History (In Chinese).&quot; Wangyi News. 30 Jun. 2011 Web. [http://news.163.com/photoview/3R710001/15359.html].&lt;/ref&gt; This technology transfer enabled China to skip years of development and go directly into deployment. However, frequent wars and other external conflicts Chinese kept rail development slow until the 21st century. Since 2000, China has committed to a vast network of high speed rail. The outcome thus far is both fascinating and questionable.

===Intercity Travel Modes===
China, with the worlds largest population of over 1.3 billion people, has suffered from serious congestion problems in all areas of transportation including intercity travels. The existing major intercity travel modes include: private cars, long-distance buses, trains and airplane, each of which has its own advantages and disadvantages. The private vehicle industry in China is currently booming; however, cars are still considered a luxury for most Chinese. Despite the comfort and convenience they provide, cars pose concerns for cost and sustainability. Traffic congestion problems have become increasingly severe in China with the skyrocketing growth in car sales, which made car traveling less appealing. Besides, they are not suited for long distance travel. Buses are cheaper but their low speeds make them not suited for long distance travel either. Airplanes are the best long distance travel mode in terms of speed and comfort. Yet plane tickets are generally quite expensive and delays are frequent in the nationalized Chinese airline industry where there isn’t much competition. In comparison, trains, especially the high speed rail, have distinct advantages. The high speed rail is usually considered a direct competitor to plane travel. It is comfortable, cheaper, reliable and fast, though not as fast as the airplane. Additionally, airports are usually built a long distance from the city center whereas train stations are usually within the city center. When considering the time it takes to get to the airport versus a train station, the speed advantage of airplane travel may not be that significant. 

===High Speed Rail===
[[File:Rail map of China.svg|thumb|China Current Railroad Network]]
Since China has a centralized planning regime, all the discussion and debate about the adoption of high speed rail was done by the government without much public participation. Details and information of the policy justification are not available to the public. The government only announces general comments on the benefits of the high speed rail technology including economic productivity and competitive improvements, job creation, urban center growth, energy saving and environmental sustainability. Since 2006, China has invested huge amounts of money on conventional-track high speed rail.  Total investment in new rail lines almost doubled from $14 billion in 2004 to $22.7 billion and $26.2 billion in 2006 and 2007 respectively. During the global economic recession from late 2007, the government accelerated high speed rail construction aiming to stimulate the economy. Total investments increased exponentially to $49.4 billion in 2008 and $88 billion in 2009. &lt;ref name=&quot;T9&quot;&gt;Bradsher, Keith. &quot;China Sees Growth Engine in a Web of Fast Trains - NYTimes.com.&quot; The New York Times - Breaking News, World News &amp; Multimedia. Web. [http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/13/business/global/13rail.html?pagewanted=all].&lt;/ref&gt; More investments will be made to high speed rail in the next 10 years. The entire current network is shown in the picture.

===Wenzhou Crash===
Who:
*	Over a thousand passengers were estimated to be onboard the two trains, including at least two Americans.
What:
*	High speed train rear ends another high speed train.
::	“The trains that crashed are technically not part of the high-speed rail network that China has been aggressively building out across the country, but they are said to be the first generation of high-speed technology adopted by the Chinese” &lt;ref name=&quot;M8&quot;&gt;Mong, Adrienne, and Bo Gu. &quot;Deadly Train Crash in China Provokes Outrage.&quot; Behind The Wall. 25 July 2011. Web. [http://behindthewall.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2011/07/25/7157046-deadly-train-crash-in-china-provokes-outrage].&lt;/ref&gt;

*	6 cars derailed and 4 fell off viaduct (approximately 65 to 100 ft high)
::	“two cars from the first train and four cars from the second” &lt;ref name=&quot;M8&quot;&gt;Mong, Adrienne, and Bo Gu. &quot;Deadly Train Crash in China Provokes Outrage.&quot; Behind The Wall. 25 July 2011. Web. [http://behindthewall.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2011/07/25/7157046-deadly-train-crash-in-china-provokes-outrage].&lt;/ref&gt;
*	“39” died and 210 injured (although numbers are criticized by the public since the Chinese government has skewed the numbers in past disasters to minimize their required response procedures)
Where:
*	Wenzhou China, approximately 300 miles south of Shanghai
When:
*	Saturday, July 23, 2011 around 8:37 PM
Why:
*	Signal system malfunction
*	The signal failed to turn red to alert the 2nd train that the 1st train was still in the way.
*	The first explanation that was published stated lighting struck the 1st train causing it to lose power, but the train was actually moving when the collision occurred disproving this implausible event.  
::	This exemplifies the lack of available knowledge in Chinese media and demonstrates the government’s unwillingness to do a robust investigation of the crash scene.
How:
*	“Jiang Xiaomei, identified as the manager of the train that was struck from behind, was quoted by a state-run newspaper as saying that a thunderstorm had forced her train to slow down and to wait about 20 minutes at its previous station. Six minutes after her train left the station, she said, it slowly came to a stop on the tracks and paused for five or six minutes. It had just started moving again when the other train plowed into it”.&lt;ref name=&quot;M10&quot;&gt;LaFraniere, Sharon. &quot;Crash Raises Questions on China’s Push to Build High-Speed Passenger Rail Lines.&quot; New York Times. 26 July 2011.

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aftermath===
The Wenzhou crash was just one of many public transportation accidents that happen in 2011.  An overloaded bus caught fire in Henan Province and killed 41 people.&lt;ref name=&quot;M10&quot;&gt;LaFraniere, Sharon. &quot;Crash Raises Questions on China’s Push to Build High-Speed Passenger Rail Lines.&quot; New York Times. 26 July 2011. Web. [http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/25/world/asia/25train.html?_r=2].
&lt;/ref&gt;  In early July, an escalator collapsed killing one and injuring 28 at a new subway station in Beijing.  Several bridges have been collapsing in various Chinese cities.  In September, two subway trains collided in Shanghai, injuring 270 people.  The speed of the collision was low enough to prevent any deaths and the cause of the collision is blamed on human error and faulty signaling.&lt;ref name=&quot;M8&quot;&gt;Mong, Adrienne, and Bo Gu. &quot;Deadly Train Crash in China Provokes Outrage.&quot; Behind The Wall. 25 July 2011. Web. [http://behindthewall.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2011/07/25/7157046-deadly-train-crash-in-china-provokes-outrage].&lt;/ref&gt;  The number of accidents this year is making many people wonder if the public transportation system is safe to use.

There is an increasing public outcry from the public to urge the Railway Ministry to rethink their transportation deployment strategy.  Many people are demanding for “no development without safety” on internet websites like People’s Daily.&lt;ref name=&quot;M9&quot;&gt;Johnson, Ian. &quot;Train Wreck in China Heightens Unease on Safety Standards.&quot; New York Times. 24 July 2011. Web. [http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/25/world/asia/25train.html?_r=2].&lt;/ref&gt;  The Wenzhou crash happened just four years after the first high speed trains began operating in China.  “Rail experts had warned against the rush to build the world's longest and fastest high-speed rail network in record time amid safety concerns.  There are allegations that corners were cut during construction because of corruption, raising questions about infrastructure across the country&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;M10&quot;&gt;News, Martin Patience BBC. &quot;China Train Crash: Signal Design Flaw Blamed.&quot; BBC. 28 July 2011. Web. [http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-14321060].&lt;/ref&gt;  China had hopes of selling trains abroad to countries starting high speed rail systems like the United States in an attempt to become the world’s leading high-tech rail exporter.  Since the crash, shares in the technology have greatly decreased as many people are now unsure of the safety in the Chinese rail technology.


==Key Stakeholders==


===Proponents===
*Chinese National Government
::The government is the biggest contributor for instigating and expanding the national high speed rail network.  The government values their system as a national emblem for the advancement of China over the past decades as it hopes to gain better world attention.  President Hu Jintao perceives the high speed rail network as a top priority for China.

*Ministry of Railways
::The organization in charge of construction and operation of China's railroads and high speed trains.  The organization is considered dysfunctional by many as several leaders have been fired for corruptive behaviors.  Sheng Guangzu is the current rail minister after his predecessor was fired last year.

*Public
::Most people are excited to have new rail lines as this will save them time and money by reducing travel times and adding more competitive modes of transportation other than flying and driving.

===Opponents===
*Safety Activists
::After several recent transportation mishaps, a growing number of people are urging for safer trains instead of faster trains.  They have concerns that the Government is compromising public safety in order to rapidly expand the network to gain a better global status.

*Crash victims
::The victims are upset at how the Government responded to the Wenzhou crash.  More lives potentially could have been saved if the recovery effort was longer and train cars not buried.  Many people are dissatisfied with the investigation procedure and some of the victim's families are turning down compensation.

*Low wage workers
::Not everyone can afford the fares and will never ride the high speed trains.  The lower class is upset at the enormous government funding going to something they never will use.


==Policy Issues==


===&lt;u&gt;''Planning''&lt;/u&gt;===

====Safety of China's High Speed Rail System====
Many of the Chinese high speed trains are modeled after the Japenese bullet trains.  The Japanese Shinkansen (bullet train) has been operating since 1964 and has no deaths as result of derailments or crashes.&lt;ref name=&quot;M27&quot;&gt; &quot;Safety.&quot; Central Japan Railway Company. Web. [http://english.jr-central.co.jp/about/safety.html].&lt;/ref&gt;  The Wenzhou crash raises suspicion that Chinese Government sacrificed safety and adequate operator training in order to rapidly build its HSR infrastructure.&lt;ref name=&quot;M28&quot;&gt; &quot;Eschede ICE Disaster.&quot; Danger Ahead! - Historic Railway Accidents. Web. [http://danger-ahead.railfan.net/textonly/eschede.htm].&lt;/ref&gt;  HSR systems have failed before, including the French TGV trains.  In most cases, the trains were able to safely stop without any fatalities.  Some comparisons to other crashes can be made to the Wenzhou crash.

In 1998, the German ICE train derailed and jackknifed into a bridge near Eschede killing over a hundred people.&lt;ref name=&quot;M28&quot;&gt; &quot;Eschede ICE Disaster.&quot; Danger Ahead! - Historic Railway Accidents. Web. [http://danger-ahead.railfan.net/textonly/eschede.htm].&lt;/ref&gt;  The train was part of the first generation ICE1 fleet that began operation in 1991.  An investigation determined that metal fatigue in one of the wheels caused the derailment when going through a switch.  The train was traveling at 200 km/h which was a safe operational speed for the tracks and was less than the top speed of 250km/h that the train could reach.  In other rail disasters excessive speed was the primary cause.  Even though the train was not speeding, the speed contributed to the level of damage.   

In 2006, a Transrapid maglev train gliding above a track, supported and propelled by magnetic repulsion, collided with a maintenance vehicle near Lathen, Germany.  This accident happened on the Emsland test track during trial runs.&lt;ref name=&quot;M29&quot;&gt; &quot;'23 Dead' in German Maglev Train Accident (Roundup).&quot; M &amp; C News. 22 Sept. 2006. Web. [https://archive.is/20130129011817/www.monstersandcritics.com/news/europe/news/article_1204030.php/23_dead_in_German_maglev_train_accident_Roundup].&lt;/ref&gt;  The impact occurred while traveling close to 200 km/h and killed 23 people, many of them were Transrapid employees.  The primary cause was human error as the maintenance crew failed to call the dispatcher when the work was finished.  There was no electronic system in place to inhibit the operation of the maglev while maintenance was being performed and safety policies were not being adhered to on the test track.  Maglev trains are considered impossible to derail as the cars wrap around and underneath the guiderail.  The Lathen crash reinforced this notation as the train stayed on the guiderail and did not fall off the 4m high viaduct.  The Lathen crash was a major setback for the deployment of maglev technology.  Consequently, only one commercially used maglev system exists, and it is in Shanghai, China.

The response to the crashes is key to evaluating the effectiveness of the management of the high speed rail network.  After the Eschede disaster, every car in the ICE1 fleet was inspected and no other wheel damage was found.&lt;ref name=&quot;M28&quot;&gt; &quot;Eschede ICE Disaster.&quot; Danger Ahead! - Historic Railway Accidents. Web. [http://danger-ahead.railfan.net/textonly/eschede.htm].&lt;/ref&gt;  The Lathen crash taught designs to adhere to safety procedures even when running on a test track.  At this point, it is unclear if the Ministry of Railway has re-inspected every similar signal device being used throughout the Chinese network, and the speedy clean up shows a higher priority for keeping its designs secret and operation schedule punctual than to perform a full investigation of the crash scene.  Both the German and Chinese high speed rail systems had deadly accidents within the first decade of service, indicating that new systems come with imperfections.  Perfectly safe trains are probably a fantasy, so it is important to be proactive and have emergency and safety policies in place before disaster strikes rather than creating them as an afterthought.  China currently has 36% of the world’s high speed track by length and will triple its size in the near future bringing the total close to 60%.&lt;ref name=&quot;M30&quot;&gt; &quot;High Speed Lines in the World.&quot; UIC - International Union of Railways. 23 July 2010. Web. [http://www.uic.org/spip.php?article573].&lt;/ref&gt;  Basic probability predicts the next high speed rail crash will be in China.  This indicates the necessity for China to have plans in place in order to respond effectively to future disasters.  Perhaps the best thing China can do to improve its system is to postpone construction and rethink safety.  Furthermore, the major disaster in Wenzhou may facilitate greater consideration and development of maglev technology in China and the world.

====Technology &amp; Design====
HSR equipment in Japan, Germany and France has been tested and trusted for several decades whereas the Chinese system has largely come online within the last decade.  Although indigenous HSR technology has been a major goal of the Chinese government since they began building the network, they still look to foreign design for help.  Initially the Chinese Ministry of Railways wanted to solely use the extremely successful Shinkansen technology in Japan but have instead adopted a diverse approach to incorporate foreign HSR technology.  Through a bidding process in 2004 China agreed to purchase a cumulative total of 200 train-sets from Alstom of France, Bombardier Transportation based in Germany and a Japanese consortium led by Kawasaki.&lt;ref name=&quot;P4&quot;&gt;(Chinese) &quot;中国式高铁的诞生与成长.&quot; Xinhua. 4 March 2010. Web. [http://news.xinhuanet.com/globe/2010-03/04/content_13096289.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of the train-sets were delivered to China completely assembled by the companies, some were delivered in parts and assembled in China, while still others were built in China using transferred technology, domestic and imported parts, the rest locally made with transferred technology and some imported parts.&lt;ref name=&quot;P5&quot;&gt; (Chinese) &quot;CRH5型动车组详细资料.&quot; 中国铁路网. 18 November 2009. Web. [http://news.chineserailways.com/Html/25/200911/20091118095821.html] &lt;/ref&gt;  

Bombardier Transportation, the first foreign train maker to do business with China back in 1998, continues to share passenger car and rolling stock manufacturing technology today.  Chinese relations with other companies such as Kawasaki have not gone so well.  Shortly following a 2006 agreement in which Kawasaki delivered 60 CRH2A train-sets, China began building CRH2B, CRH2C, and CRH2E models independently at its Sifang plant.&lt;ref name=&quot;P6&quot;&gt; &quot;Japan Shoots itself in the foot.&quot; Ft.com. 8 July 2010. [http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/60da2222-8ab5-11df-8e17-00144feab49a,Authorised=false.html?_i_location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2Fcms%2Fs%2F0%2F60da2222-8ab5-11df-8e17-00144feab49a.html&amp;_i_referer=http%3A%2F%2Fsearch.ft.com%2Fsearch%3FqueryText%3Djapna%2Bshoots%2Bitself%2Bin%2Bthe%2Bfoot%26ftsearchType%3Dtype_news#axzz1a7FZlgCe]&lt;/ref&gt;   

The signaling systems, designed to prevent train collisions, were also imported.  Consequently, local engineers don’t completely understand the inner workings of the systems, according to a review of corporate documents and interviews with rail executives inside and outside China.&lt;ref name=&quot;M5&quot;&gt;Areddy, James T. &amp; Shirouzu, Norihiko. “China Bullet Trains Trip on Technology .” ''Wall Street Journal.'' 3 October 2011. Web.
[http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111904353504576568983658561372.html?mod=world_newsreel].&lt;/ref&gt;  Even though a major manufacturer of key signaling systems is Beijing based Hollysys Automation Technologies Ltd, its products are still not free from fault.   Hollysys products integrate foreign built components, several of which contain tailor-made circuitry built to Hollysys specifications by companies such as Hitachi Ltd in Japan.&lt;ref name=&quot;M5&quot;&gt;Areddy, James T. &amp; Shirouzu, Norihiko. “China Bullet Trains Trip on Technology .” ''Wall Street Journal.'' 3 October 2011.

Web.
[http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111904353504576568983658561372.html?mod=world_newsreel].&lt;/ref&gt;  “Black box” components make it extremely difficult to accurately sync systems and troubleshoot when then fail.  This is especially troubling knowing the signaling system is essentially the brain which is supposed to anticipate and protect against problems.

===''&lt;u&gt;Funding&lt;/u&gt;''===
Because China has a single party communist government, funding for the China HSR system is quite different from funding for other similar systems around the world.  In China, major infrastructure is largely the result of major government investment.  In the case of the HSR system, the Ministry of Railways (MOR) loaned 1 trillion RNB (US $150 billion in 2010 dollars) from state owned banks and financial institutions.  This investment was only to finance HSR construction from 2006 to 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;P2&quot;&gt; (Chinese) 25 September 2010 [http://www.tianjinwe.com/business/hgjj/201009/t20100925_1892640_1.html].&lt;/ref&gt;  The China Real Estate Information Corporation also contributed by selling some of stake in the Beijing-Shanghai HSR to the Bank of China.&lt;ref name=&quot;P2&quot;&gt; (Chinese) 25 September 2010 [http://www.tianjinwe.com/business/hgjj/201009/t20100925_1892640_1.html].&lt;/ref&gt;

Huge investments like this are possible in China because the government does not have to convince anyone or provide translucent reasoning behind their route choices.  They just build it.  HSR lines are quickly constructed primarily to serve the public, in turn pushing initial estimated repayment periods further down the list of concerns.  Despite impressive ridership numbers, nearly all HSR lines built in China incur loses within their first couple years of operation.&lt;ref name=&quot;P2&quot;&gt; (Chinese) 25 September 2010 [http://www.tianjinwe.com/business/hgjj/201009/t20100925_1892640_1.html].&lt;/ref&gt;  Meaning the revenue generated from fares does not even cover operating costs.  For example, the Beijing-Shanghai HSR line took 20.42 billion RNB to build and an additional 1.8 billion RNB operating cost per year.&lt;ref name=&quot;P2&quot;&gt; (Chinese) 25 September 2010 [http://www.tianjinwe.com/business/hgjj/201009/t20100925_1892640_1.html].&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite delivering 18.7 million riders in 2008 to 2009, the line lost  0.7 billion RNB.&lt;ref name=&quot;P2&quot;&gt; (Chinese) 25 September 2010 [http://www.tianjinwe.com/business/hgjj/201009/t20100925_1892640_1.html].&lt;/ref&gt;  Ridership rose to 22.3 million rides in its second year of operation but it still ended up 0.5 billion RNB in the red.&lt;ref name=&quot;P2&quot;&gt; (Chinese) 25 September 2010 [http://www.tianjinwe.com/business/hgjj/201009/t20100925_1892640_1.html].&lt;/ref&gt;  In order to just break even on operating costs alone, the line must deliver 30 million rides every year.&lt;ref name=&quot;P2&quot;&gt; (Chinese) 25 September 2010 [http://www.tianjinwe.com/business/hgjj/201009/t20100925_1892640_1.html].&lt;/ref&gt;  To repay the initial capital costs would require ridership to exceed 40 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;P2&quot;&gt; (Chinese) 25 September 2010 [http://www.tianjinwe.com/business/hgjj/201009/t20100925_1892640_1.html].&lt;/ref&gt;  The line has the capacity to accommodate 100 million rides per year and the initial estimated full repayment period was 16 years.

Ridership and fare price are inversely related.  Therefore some economists suggest further subsidizing fare price to entice more riders to use the system, generating greater revenues.  However, others argue financing that heavily is unsustainable and will lead to greater national debt.&lt;ref name=&quot;P2&quot;&gt; (Chinese) 25 September 2010 [http://www.tianjinwe.com/business/hgjj/201009/t20100925_1892640_1.html].&lt;/ref&gt;

====Exportation Aspirations====
Quick development and deployment has become the national model of china in hopes of ushering in an era of Chinese HSR exportation worldwide.  Government propaganda has touted their HSR network as, “fast, low cost, and large, both a symbol of national pride and a miracle to the rest of the world.” &lt;ref name=&quot;P1&quot;&gt;Yu, Michelle. “Train Crash Heightens Safety Concerns over China Exports.” Epoch Times. 17 August 2011. Web. [http://www.theepochtimes.com/n2/china-news/train-crash-heightens-safety-concerns-over-china-exports-60438.html].&lt;/ref&gt;  Until the Wenzhou crash, China seemed poised to achieve that goal.  For example, China conducted 13 billion RNB in sales of rail equipment overseas in 2010. &lt;ref name=&quot;P3&quot;&gt;Ni, Vivian. “Wenzhou Rail Crash May Undermine China’s Train Export Aspirations.” 27 July 2011. Web. [http://www.2point6billion.com/news/2011/07/27/wenzhou-rail-crash-may-undermine-chinas-train-exports-9840.html].&lt;/ref&gt;  Official media say more than 50 countries and regions currently use China-made locomotives, high-speed trains and their components. &lt;ref name=&quot;P1&quot;&gt;Yu, Michelle. “Train Crash Heightens Safety Concerns over China Exports.” Epoch Times. 17 August 2011. Web. [http://www.theepochtimes.com/n2/china-news/train-crash-heightens-safety-concerns-over-china-exports-60438.html].&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, China has signed “bilateral rail cooperation” agreements with more than 30 countries, including the United States. &lt;ref name=&quot;P1&quot;&gt;Yu, Michelle. “Train Crash Heightens Safety Concerns over China Exports.” Epoch Times. 17 August 2011. Web. [http://www.theepochtimes.com/n2/china-news/train-crash-heightens-safety-concerns-over-china-exports-60438.html].&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite these agreements, the crash and unstable performance may dramatically weaken China’s export push and credibility as a world leader in HSR technology. Edwin Merner, president of Atlantis Investment Research Corp. in Tokyo, made the bold prediction that China’s chances of selling high-speed trains are now “zero,” saying “I don’t think they can ever get confidence back.” &lt;ref name=&quot;P1&quot;&gt;Yu, Michelle. “Train Crash Heightens Safety Concerns over China Exports.” Epoch Times. 17 August 2011. Web. [http://www.theepochtimes.com/n2/china-news/train-crash-heightens-safety-concerns-over-china-exports-60438.html].&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerns over safety have not only tainted international desire for China HSR technology but domestic investors have become wary as well.  Stock in the company that manufactured the trains that collided, CSR Group, dropped 14 percent.  The sharpest drop in the past three years. &lt;ref name=&quot;P3&quot;&gt;Ni, Vivian. “Wenzhou Rail Crash May Undermine China’s Train Export Aspirations.” 27 July 2011. Web. [http://www.2point6billion.com/news/2011/07/27/wenzhou-rail-crash-may-undermine-chinas-train-exports-9840.html].&lt;/ref&gt;  In the same day, mainland shares in HSR-related stock dropped 31.6 billion RNB, bringing huge loses to project investors. &lt;ref name=&quot;P3&quot;&gt;Ni, Vivian. “Wenzhou Rail Crash May Undermine China’s Train Export Aspirations.” 27 July 2011. Web. [http://www.2point6billion.com/news/2011/07/27/wenzhou-rail-crash-may-undermine-chinas-train-exports-9840.html].&lt;/ref&gt;

====Economic comparison with Japan====
In 1949 the Japanese National Railways organized the rail lines into a state-owned corporation.  A direct success of the merger was the inauguration of the Shinkansen HSR service. &lt;ref name=&quot;P6&quot;&gt;Kakumoto, Ryohei. “Sensible Politics and Transport Theories? – Japan’s National Railways in the 20th Century.” Japan Railway &amp; Transport Review 22.  December 1999. Web. [http://www.jrtr.net/jrtr22/pdf/F23_Kakumoto.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;  Merging the 17 previously private railways allowed the rail network to quickly and efficiently expand, but expansion came at a price.  JNR was pulled further and further into dept and had to increase loaning to fund massive capital projects.  By 1987, JNR’s dept was 27 trillion Yen ($280 billion at 2009 exchange rates) and the company was spending 147 Yen for every 100 Yen earned. &lt;ref name=&quot;P6&quot;&gt;Kakumoto, Ryohei. “Sensible Politics and Transport Theories? – Japan’s National Railways in the 20th Century.” Japan Railway &amp; Transport Review 22.  December 1999. Web. [http://www.jrtr.net/jrtr22/pdf/F23_Kakumoto.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;  Later that year, an act signed by the Diet of Japan divided the JNR into several companies collectively called the Japan Railways Group (JR Group). &lt;ref name=&quot;P6&quot;&gt;Kakumoto, Ryohei. “Sensible Politics and Transport Theories? – Japan’s National Railways in the 20th Century.” Japan Railway &amp; Transport Review 22.  December 1999. Web. [http://www.jrtr.net/jrtr22/pdf/F23_Kakumoto.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;  Now six private companies control operating passenger lines in six separate regions and the Japan Freight Railway Company operates nationwide.  As a result, the passenger rail sector has increased its profitability, and technological advances such as tilting carriages have allowed for greater system efficiency.  Future safety concerns or extensive maintenance expenses may cause the Chinese government to consider privatization as a way to preserve their huge national infrastructure.

===&lt;u&gt;''Environmental Impacts''&lt;/u&gt;===
Many of China’s high speed rail lines have been built on upgraded existing railroad lines, minimizing the environmental impact.  New lines incorporate elevated rail on viaducts to avoid intense disturbance of protected wetlands and ecosystems and reduce deforestation.  Most documents regarding environmental studies are not in the public domain as the Chinese Government has not published the information.  China’s railways have reduced emissions by using electricity instead of coal to power their locomotives.  However, that doesn't mean coal isn't still used to generate the electricity.

===&lt;u&gt;''Government response to Wenzhou crash''&lt;/u&gt;===
The July 23rd crash was the first major mishap since the Chinese government began funding the monumental HSR network in 2007.  Shortly after the crash, the President Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiaboa called for an all-out effort to rescue passengers. &lt;ref name=&quot;M3&quot;&gt;Watt, Louise. “China Train Collision: 35 Dead, 190 Injured.” ''Huffington Post.'' 23 July 2011. Web. [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/07/23/china-train-collision_n_907886.html].&lt;/ref&gt;  Train operations on the line were suspended as infrastructure was repaired.  Railway officials inspected the trains as several emergency crews from nearby hospitals searched for the injured and the dead.  China’s Railway Minister, Sheng Guangzu, visited the scene on the 24th and ordered an investigation of the accident.

However, less than a day after the crash, seven excavators began crushing the train cars and digging a hole to bury them in.  During the three hours the front car was being buried, there were no sign of railway officials or experts of any kind entered the cockpit to investigate the cause of the accident.&lt;ref name=&quot;M1&quot;&gt;Okudera, Atsushi, Minemura, Kenji &amp; Hayashi, Nozomu. “Criticism spreads as China buries car in high-speed train disaster.” ''The Asahi Shimbun.'' 26 July 2011. Web. [http://www.webcitation.org/query?id=1311727256384884&amp;url=www.asahi.com/english/TKY201107250340.html].&lt;/ref&gt;  Normally, an inspection of the technical and sensitive instruments is a key part of the investigation but was seemingly forgone in this instance.  A source in Japan that investigates train accidents said, &quot;Investigative agencies in China are not very independent, and I have heard that in many cases they are influenced by what the government wants done.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;M1&quot;&gt;Okudera, Atsushi, Minemura, Kenji &amp; Hayashi, Nozomu. “Criticism spreads as China buries car in high-speed train disaster.” ''The Asahi Shimbun.'' 26 July 2011. Web. [http://www.webcitation.org/query?id=1311727256384884&amp;url=www.asahi.com/english/TKY201107250340.html].&lt;/ref&gt;  A railway official on site said, “the investigation was completed,” by the time the crushing and burying began. &lt;ref name=&quot;M1&quot;&gt;Okudera, Atsushi, Minemura, Kenji &amp; Hayashi, Nozomu. “Criticism spreads as China buries car in high-speed train disaster.” ''The Asahi Shimbun.'' 26 July 2011. Web. [http://www.webcitation.org/query?id=1311727256384884&amp;url=www.asahi.com/english/TKY201107250340.html].&lt;/ref&gt;  The last survivor, a 2-year-old girl, was pulled from the wreck by firefighters just as cleanup efforts were wrapping up.&lt;ref name=&quot;M2&quot;&gt;Xinhua. “HSR train crash toddler victim in stable condition.” ''Want China Times.'' 25 July 2011. Web. [http://www.wantchinatimes.com/news-subclass-cnt.aspx?id=20110725000033&amp;cid=1103].&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the crash, the Chinese Government immediately ordered trains to reduce their speeds.  Even before the crash, the Railway Minister had set the HSR maximum speed at 350km/h rather than their capable speeds of 380km/h.  After the crash, speeds were cut for trains capable of 350km/h to 300km/h and those running at 250km/h were slowed to 200km/h.&lt;ref name=&quot;M4&quot;&gt;“China's Awkward Quest for Bullet Train Technology.” ''Arabic Knowledge@Wharton.'' 27 September 2011. Web. [http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/arabic/article.cfm?articleid=2720&amp;language_id=1].&lt;/ref&gt;  It is not clear how temporary these restrictions are, but it is likely they will be lifted in order to save passenger travel time, allow fare prices to increase, and so China can showcase their national HSR technological superiority.

In 2004, Chinese trains achieved modest speeds of 160km/h.  That year, Kawasaki Heavy Industries president Tadaharu Ohashi warned the Chinese government that it would take 8 years to master the technology to run trains at 200km/h and another 8 years to run trains at 350km/h.  Instead, it took 7 years for Chinese trains to increase from 160km/h to 380km/h.&lt;ref name=&quot;M4&quot;&gt;“China's Awkward Quest for Bullet Train Technology.” ''Arabic Knowledge@Wharton.'' 27 September 2011. Web. [http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/arabic/article.cfm?articleid=2720&amp;language_id=1].&lt;/ref&gt;  In comparison, Japan spent 47 years to achieve bullet train speeds of 300km/h in 2011 after the Tokaido Shinkansen opened in 1964.&lt;ref name=&quot;M4&quot;&gt;“China's Awkward Quest for Bullet Train Technology.” ''Arabic Knowledge@Wharton.'' 27 September 2011. Web. [http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/arabic/article.cfm?articleid=2720&amp;language_id=1].&lt;/ref&gt;  Some argue that high speeds should not be the only way of measuring technological success.  Other factors such as noise, vibration levels, ride comfort, and safety records are important barometers as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;M4&quot;&gt;“China's Awkward Quest for Bullet Train Technology.” ''Arabic Knowledge@Wharton.''
27 September 2011. Web. [http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/arabic/article.cfm?articleid=2720&amp;language_id=1].&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the crash, the Ministry of Railways announced that three high-ranking railway officials in conjunction with the national HSR project were fired immediately after the crash.  They were identified as Long Jing, head of the Shanghai Railway Bureau; Li Jia, party secretary and the deputy chief of the bureau, He Shengli.&lt;ref name=&quot;M6&quot;&gt;Chan, Royston &amp; Duncan, Maxim. “China sacks 3 officials after train crash.” ''Reuters.'' 24 July 2011. Web. [http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/07/24/us-china-train-idUSTRE76M26T20110724].&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, 55-year-old Ma Cheng, a top executive of the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), reported collapsed and died during questioning by crash investigators.&lt;ref name=&quot;M5&quot;&gt;Areddy, James T. &amp; Shirouzu, Norihiko. “China Bullet Trains Trip on Technology .” ''Wall Street Journal.'' 3 October 2011. Web. [http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111904353504576568983658561372.html?mod=world_newsreel].&lt;/ref&gt;  Premier Wen Jiabao also ordered safety inspections of all HSR and railway lines, both functional and under construction.  According to the Xinhua News Agency&lt;ref name=&quot;M2&quot;&gt;Xinhua News Agency. “HSR train crash toddler victim in stable condition.” ''Want China Times.'' 25 July 2011. Web. [http://www.wantchinatimes.com/news-subclass-cnt.aspx?id=20110725000033&amp;cid=1103].&lt;/ref&gt;, the Shanghai Railway Bureau determined a design flaw in a signaling system likely caused the crash.  Despite parts of the viaduct being clearly damaged, structural testing was seemingly forgone.  A speedy cleanup process enforced by the Railway Ministry, resumed service on the line between Wenzhou and Ningbo within 30 hours of the crash.&lt;ref name=&quot;M11&quot;&gt;&quot;China Reopens Crash-hit Track.&quot; Straits Times. 25 July 2011. Web. [http://www.straitstimes.com/BreakingNews/Asia/Story/STIStory_694548.html].&lt;/ref&gt;

The government also moved swiftly to compensate victims’ families, agreeing to pay 500,000 RNB, or more than $77,000, for each family according to the official Xinhua news agency. The government described bonuses of 10,000 RNB, or more than $1,500, for families who signed compensation agreements quickly.&lt;ref name=&quot;M10&quot;&gt;LaFraniere, Sharon. &quot;Crash Raises Questions on China’s Push to Build High-Speed Passenger Rail Lines.&quot; New York Times. 26 July 2011. Web. [http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/25/world/asia/25train.html?_r=2].
&lt;/ref&gt;

Broader measures with regards to the entire HSR project were also taken as the Chinese government pulled the brakes on project funding and bullet train manufacturing.  The Chinese National Railway Corporation recalled for testing 54 of the CRH380BL bullet trains it had built.  No timetable was released by CNR but the recall will likely reduce traffic on the popular lines, further increasing head-ways and safety measures.  CNR also announced the delayed delivery of 17 more CRH380BL carriages, a value of about $1 billion.&lt;ref name=&quot;M7&quot;&gt;Areddy, James T. “China bullet trains recalled.” ''Wall Street Journal.'' 12 August 2011. Web. [http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111904006104576501291114086996.html].&lt;/ref&gt;  The delivery is pending upon the outcomes of the safety inspections Premier Wen Jiaboa ordered and should be released in late September.

Funding and approval of new railway schemes for the national HSR project was frozen following an executive meeting of China’s cabinet, presided over by prime minister Wen Jiabao. &lt;ref name=&quot;M5&quot;&gt;Areddy, James T. &amp; Shirouzu, Norihiko. “China Bullet Trains Trip on Technology .” ''Wall Street Journal.'' 3 October 2011. Web. [http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111904353504576568983658561372.html?mod=world_newsreel].&lt;/ref&gt;  The cabinet stated it would suspend for the time being the examination and approval of new railway construction projects.  This decision will also subject projects submitted for approval to thorough safety examinations as well.  Although the crash, safety inspections and the funding suspension, have not deterred the Chinese government from still committing to HSR, the government has scaled back network expansion plans( china bullet trains trip on technology).  To what extent is unknown, but by slowing development more time and care can be devoted to the project theoretically increasing performance certainty and overall safety.


==Project Future==
Although safety issues raised by the Wenzhou Crash and economic sustainability concerns have slowed China’s HSR development, the Chinese government is still determined to expand its HSR network across the nation. The “Mid-term and Long-term Railroad Network Planning”, modified in 2008, laid out further developmental goals till the year of 2020.  Specific goals include: the total length of the operating railroads to exceed 120000 km; 60 percent of the trains will be electrified; In the highly busy corridors, passenger and freight lines will be separated and the equipment will be upgraded to internationally advanced standards; In order to meet the increasing demand of passenger transport, a “Four-Horizontal and Four-Vertical” (four east-west lines and four north–south lines) national high speed railroad grid dedicated to passengers will be constructed totaling 16000 km in length. The four east-west lines include: Qingdao to Taiyuan passenger dedicated line (PDL), Xuzhou to Lanzhou PDL, Shanghai to Chengdu PDL, and Shanghai to Kunming PDL. The four north-south lines include Beijing to Harbin PDL, Beijing to Shanghai PDL, Beijing to Hong Kong PDL and Shanghai to Shenzhen PDL. Other PDLs include Chengdu to Guangzhou PDL, Lanzhou to Orumqi PDL, and Hefei to Fuzhou PDL. All the PDLs are shown in the figure. &lt;ref name=&quot;T8&quot;&gt; (Chinese) &quot;Mid-term and Long-term Railroad Network Planning.&quot; PRC Development and Reformation Committee.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== What is Diabetes? ==
Diabetes is a group of metabolic disorders characterised by hyperglycemia resulting from defects in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both. The type 2 form of the disease is associated with obesity and physical inactivity.(5)

== What is the HbA1c? ==
Strict control of the hyperglycemia is an essential part of the management of diabetes in order to prevent chronic progression of the complications.
== Resistance Training : A Definition ==
Resistance training involved using weights such as a dumbbell, barbell or other type of resistance against the muscles to increase muscular strength.&lt;br/&gt;
A program set up for those at risk of type 2 diabetes, utilising resistance training is that of Lift for Life &lt;br/&gt;

== Benefits of Resistance training for the HbA1c ==
There are many benefits of using Resistance training on the HbA1c of people with Type II Diabetes, The 'Lift for Life' program based on research conducted by Baker IDI which showed that using strength training, there were changes in blood glucose control which matched and sometimes exceeded that which is normally produced by the traditional drug solutions, is one such program that shows benefits. &lt;br&gt;
This program was recognised in 2005 by the Australian Government as an important resource for type II diabetics and agreed to support it's further development and implementation throughout the nation to improve quality of life.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi.  I'm Professorman101. 

 I've chosen this id because it was my ID on one of my favorite online games, a &quot;virtual world&quot; called &quot;There&quot;.


I'm new at this so it may take me a while before I get the hang of everything but I feel as I can contribute something here. 

 I was actively involved in SETI@Home and wrote the &quot;SETI Enhanced FAQ&quot;.  I maintained this faq either on their servers or on a dedicated computer at my home until the newest application for SETI became available.


I have worked with computers since the early days.  My first computer was a TI-99/4a on which I learned to program in BASIC, even though it was a proprietary variation of BASIC called &quot;TI Basic&quot; developed for Texas Instruments for use on their line of computers.


I am also a radio amateur (ham radio) operator, and a SCUBA diver.  I have also been involved in automobile racing, auto mechanics, electronics repair, and many other professions and hobbies. 

 So with these qualifications, although I don't claim to be an &quot;expert&quot; in any one subject by any means, at least I feel like I can contribute in some way or another.</text>

Previous: [http://test.jmonkeyengine.org/wiki/doku.php/jme3#installing_jmonkeyengine_3 Installing JME3], Next: [http://test.jmonkeyengine.org/wiki/doku.php/jme3:beginner:hello_node Hello Node]

'''Prerequisites:''' This tutorial assumes that:

* You have [http://jmonkeyengine.org/wiki/doku.php/ downloaded the jMonkeyPlatform] (or set up the jMonkeyEngine3 in another IDE of your choice)
* You are have [http://test.jmonkeyengine.org/wiki/doku.php/sdk:project_creation created a Java SE project with the JME3 libraries on the classpath].

You are ready to create your first jMonkeyEngine3 game! You can generally use the tutorials in this introductory series with any integrated development environment (IDE), such as the jMonkeyPlatform, NetBeans, Eclipse, or run them straight from the commandline. In the following, we will use the jMonkeyPlatform.

== Writing a SimpleApplication ==
Create a &lt;tt&gt;jme3test.helloworld&lt;/tt&gt; package and a file &lt;tt&gt;HelloJME3.java&lt;/tt&gt; in it. 

In the jMonkeyPlatform, you right-click the Source Packages node:

* Select &lt;tt&gt;New… &gt; Java Class&lt;/tt&gt; to create a new file.
* Enter a class name: &lt;tt&gt;HelloJME3&lt;/tt&gt;
* Enter a package: &lt;tt&gt;jme3test.helloworld&lt;/tt&gt;
* Click Finish.

== Sample Code ==
Replace the contents of the HelloJME3.java file with the following code:

 package jme3test.helloworld;
 &amp;nbsp;
 import com.jme3.app.SimpleApplication;
 import com.jme3.material.Material;
 import com.jme3.math.Vector3f;
 import com.jme3.scene.Geometry;
 import com.jme3.scene.shape.Box;
 import com.jme3.math.ColorRGBA;
 &amp;nbsp;
 /** Sample 1 - how to get started with the most simple JME 3 application.
  * Display a blue 3D cube and view from all sides by
  * moving the mouse and pressing the WASD keys. */
 public class HelloJME3 extends SimpleApplication {
 &amp;nbsp;
     &lt;nowiki&gt;public static void main(String[] args){&lt;/nowiki&gt;
         HelloJME3 app = new HelloJME3();
         app.start(); // start the game
     }
 &amp;nbsp;
     @Override
     public void simpleInitApp() {
         Box b = new Box(Vector3f.ZERO, 1, 1, 1); // create cube shape at the origin
         Geometry geom = new Geometry(&quot;Box&quot;, b);  // create cube geometry from the shape
         Material mat = new Material(assetManager,
           &quot;Common/MatDefs/Misc/Unshaded.j3md&quot;);  // create a simple material
         mat.setColor(&quot;Color&quot;, ColorRGBA.Blue);   // set color of material to blue
         geom.setMaterial(mat);                   // set the cube's material
         rootNode.attachChild(geom);              // make the cube appear in the scene
     }
 }

Build and run the HelloJME3 class. If a jme settings dialog pops up, confirm the default settings.

# You should see a simple window displaying a 3-D cube.
# Use the WASD keys and the mouse to navigate around.
# Press Escape to close the application.

Congratulations, it works! How did we do that?

== Understanding the Code ==
The code above has initialized the scene, and started the game.

=== Understanding the Terminology ===

{| style=&quot;border-spacing:0;&quot;
| style=&quot;border:0.002cm solid #000000;padding:0.049cm;&quot;| &lt;center&gt;'''What you want to do'''&lt;/center&gt;
| style=&quot;border:0.002cm solid #000000;padding:0.049cm;&quot;| &lt;center&gt;'''How you say it in JME3 terminology'''&lt;/center&gt;

|-
| style=&quot;border:0.002cm solid #000000;padding:0.049cm;&quot;| You want to create a cube.
| style=&quot;border:0.002cm solid #000000;padding:0.049cm;&quot;| You create a Geometry with a 1x1x1 Box shape.

|-

| style=&quot;border:0.002cm solid #000000;padding:0.049cm;&quot;| You create a Material with a blue Color property.

|-
| style=&quot;border:0.002cm solid #000000;padding:0.049cm;&quot;| You want to colorize the cube blue.
| style=&quot;border:0.002cm solid #000000;padding:0.049cm;&quot;| You set the Geometry's Material.

|-
| style=&quot;border:0.002cm solid #000000;padding:0.049cm;&quot;| You want the cube to appear in the scene.
| style=&quot;border:0.002cm solid #000000;padding:0.049cm;&quot;| You attach the cube to the rootNode.

|}
=== Initializing the Scene ===
In Java, the creation of a blue cube looks as follows:

     public void simpleInitApp() {
         Box b = new Box(Vector3f.ZERO, 1, 1, 1); // create cube shape at the origin
         Geometry geom = new Geometry(&quot;Box&quot;, b);  // create cube geometry from the shape
         Material mat = new Material(assetManager,
           &quot;Common/MatDefs/Misc/Unshaded.j3md&quot;);  // create a simple material
         mat.setColor(&quot;Color&quot;, ColorRGBA.Blue);   // set color of material to blue
         geom.setMaterial(mat);                   // set the cube's material
         rootNode.attachChild(geom);              // make the cube appear in the scene
     }

In the &lt;tt&gt;simpleInitApp()&lt;/tt&gt; method, you create or load all game objects before the game starts. The &lt;tt&gt;simpleInitApp()&lt;/tt&gt; method is automatically called once at the beginning of every JME3 game.

A typical JME3 game has the following initialization process:

# You initialize game objects:
** You create or load objects and position them.
** You make objects appear in the scene by attaching them to the &lt;tt&gt;rootNode&lt;/tt&gt;.
** '''Examples:''' Load player, terrain, sky, enemies, obstacles, and place them in their start positions.
# You initialize variables
** You set variables to their start values. 
** You want to use variables track the game state. 
** '''Examples:''' Set the &lt;tt&gt;score&lt;/tt&gt; to 0, set &lt;tt&gt;health&lt;/tt&gt; to 100%, and so on.
# You initialize keys and mouse actions
** The following input bindings are pre-configured by default:
*** W,A,S,D keys – Move around in the scene
*** Mouse movement and arrow keys – Turn the camera
*** Escape key – Quit the game
** Add your own keys and mouse clicks.
** '''Examples:''' Click to shoot, press Space to jump, etc.

=== Starting the Game ===
The HelloJME3.java class extends &lt;tt&gt;com.jme3.app.SimpleApplication&lt;/tt&gt;, which is a subclass of &lt;tt&gt;com.jme3.app.Application&lt;/tt&gt;. Every JME3 game is an instance of &lt;tt&gt;com.jme3.app.SimpleApplication&lt;/tt&gt;.

To run a JME3 game, you first instantiate your &lt;tt&gt;SimpleApplication&lt;/tt&gt;-based class, and then call its &lt;tt&gt;start()&lt;/tt&gt; method:

     &lt;nowiki&gt;public static void main(String[] args){&lt;/nowiki&gt;
         HelloJME3 app = new HelloJME3();
         app.start(); // start the game
     }

Typically you start a game from your Java application's main() method. 

== Conclusion ==
These few lines of code simply display a static 3D cube. You can navigate around in this 3D scene. 

You have learned that a SimpleApplication is a good starting point because it provides you with:

* A &lt;tt&gt;simpleInitApp()&lt;/tt&gt; method where you create objects.
* A &lt;tt&gt;rootNode&lt;/tt&gt; where you attach objects to make them appear in the scene.
* Useful default input settings that you can use for navigation in the scene.

When developing a game application, you will now want to:

# Initialize your game world,
# Trigger actions in the event loop,
# Respond to user input.

In the following tutorials you learn how accomplish these tasks with the jMonkeyEngine 3.

Continue with the [http://test.jmonkeyengine.org/wiki/doku.php/jme3:beginner:hello_node Hello Node] tutorial, where we will first show you more details about how to initialize the game world, also known as the scene graph.

:That's why I put the notice on rather than just deleting it, because I wanted to attract your attention that it might be off topic for WB. Since then I've done some digging and found your original source and that the licensing is appropriate, so I think you are fine. I have deleted the subject you created though as we don't have subjects at such a granular level (e.g., Computer programming is a subject, not C++). I've removed the deletion notice, sorry for the disruption - carry on contributing please.

In C language, the function wcscmp is included in header file , wchar.h.
The functions wcsncmp ,wcscmp , strncmp , strcmp are used to compare strings.
Function wcsncmp, is similar to strncmp() , which is used to compare two fixed-size wide-character strings.
it looks similar to  strncmp()  .This function is  used to handle wide character strings. 
The  wcsncmp()  function  is the wide-character equivalent of the strncmp() function.
The function wcsncmp is similar to wcscmp, but it compares only first n characters.

== Description==

Wcsncmp is the standard library function used to compare two wide character strings.
The function is similar to standard library function strcmp. But the comparison is not like strcmp.
The  first difference is that the function wcsncmp compares the two strings upto some limit(at most n character) i.e  '''size_t n''' but strcmp compares the strings till '\0' occurs.
and the second is that it handles wide characters as mentioned.
It compares the wide-character string pointed to by  say '''a''' and the wide character string 
pointed to by say '''b''', but at most  '''n''' wide characters from each string. 

If the wide character string '''a''' is greater than wide character string '''b'''
at first differentiating position i (i &lt; n)
then the function Wcsncmp returns positive integer and if second string is greater 
than first  at the first differing position i (i &lt; n), then the function wcsncmp  returns negative integer.
if the first i characters (i &lt; n) of '''a'''  and '''b''' are equal , the function wcsncmp returns 0.

== Required Header Files==

[[#include&lt;wchar.h&gt;]]&lt;br /&gt;
'''OR'''&lt;br /&gt;
[[#include&lt;string.h&gt;]]

==Syntax==

In [[C language| C]], the function '''wcscat()''' is included in [[header file]] [[wchar.h]]. This function is quite similar to [[strcat]].&lt;br /&gt;
This function is used to concatenate two wide character strings.&lt;br /&gt;

==Syntax==
 #include &lt;wchar.h&gt;
 wchar_t *wcscat(wchar_t *a, const wchar_t *b);

== Description==

The job done by the functions [[strcat]] and Wcscat   is same as mentioned i.e concatenating two strings.. The difference is that the function [[strcat]] takes (normal)''' character strings ''' and wcscat takes '''wide character strings''' as arguments.&lt;br /&gt;
The function [[wcscat]] ,copy the  wide character string say '''b''' including '\0'(at the end of string b) , at the end of  wide character string say '''a'''.
The '\0' character of the string a is replaced by the first character of the string 'b'. I.e function append the sring 'b' to the end of string 'a'.
If  wide character string 'a' is &quot;hello&quot; and  wide character string 'b' is &quot;world&quot; . After calling the function wcscat(a , b) , string 'a' becomes &quot;helloworld&quot; and string 'b' remains same.  The  wide string 'a' must have memory of  at least  (strlen(a) + strlen(b) +1) bytes so that it can  store wcs(Wide character string) 'a' , wcs 'b' and '\0'.&lt;br /&gt;

== Sample Program==
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;wchar.h&gt;
#define SIZE 32

int main() {

      wchar_t destination[SIZE] = L&quot;Hello&quot;; /*SIZE should be sufficient enough to store both strings and NULL termination '\0' */
      wchar_t * source  = L&quot; World&quot;;
      wchar_t * ptr;

      ptr = wcscat( destination, source );
      printf(&quot; %ls\n&quot;, ptr ); /* prints &quot;hello World&quot;*/
     /*OR printf(&quot;%ls\n&quot; , destination);*/

      return 0;

}
&lt;/source&gt;
Output  of program will be ' Hello World '.
&lt;br /&gt;
Wide character string 'source'(World) is appended at the end of wide character string 'destination'(Hello).

==Return Value== 

The function wcscat() returns pointer to  wide character string 'a' i.e pointer to the string which is concatenated.

In C language the function labs is included in header file stdlib.h. The abs() function computes and returns the absolute value of the integer argument i. The '''labs()''' function computes and returns the absolute value of the long integer argument, of the appropriate long integer type for the function. The '''llabs()''' function computes and returns the absolute value of long long integer argument.

==Description==
The labs() is a library function. It is used under #include&lt;stdlib.h&gt; header file. This function computes the absolute value of the long integer argument i. It also returns the absolute value of the argument. That is, if i is negative, the result is opposite of i, but if i is non-negative the result is i.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{dewikify}}
The [[C language]] function calls '''mempcpy''' and '''wmempcpy''' are used to copy one area of memory to another area.

==Introduction==
In [[C language |C]], the function '''mempcpy''' is included in header file [[string.h]]. '''mempcpy''' is nearly identical to '''memcpy()'''. This function is used to copy the strings. The function '''wmempcpy''' is identical to mempcpy() but takes [[wchar_t]] type arguments and copies n wide characters. It comes under [[wchar.h]] header file.

==Description==
In [[C programming]], functions mempcpy() , wmempcpy() are used.The mempcpy() function is nearly identical to the memcpy() function.It comes under '''Buffer Manipulating Functions'''. It copies a specified number of characters from one buffer to another. It copies n bytes from the object beginning  at  src  into  the  object
pointed  to  by  dest.
But  instead of returning the value of dest it returns a pointer to the byte following the last written byte. This function is useful in situations where a number of  objects  shall be copied to consecutive memory positions. If copying between objects overlap, then the behavior is undefined.

==Return value==
dest + n.

==Example==
void *&lt;br /&gt;
combine (ciod *o1, size_t s1, void *o2, size_t s2)&lt;br /&gt;
{&lt;br /&gt;
void *result = [[malloc]](s1 + s2);&lt;br /&gt;
if (result != NULL)&lt;br /&gt;
[[mempcpy]]([[mempcpy]](result, o1, s1), o2, s2);&lt;br /&gt;
return result;&lt;br /&gt;
}

==Versions==
[[mempcpy]] first appeared in glibc in version 2.1

==See also==
memccpy( ), memcpy( )

In C language ,the function wcscmp is included in [[header file]]  [[wchar.h]]
wcscmp is similar to [[strcmp]] i.e it is used to compare two strings.but the 
function wcscmp is used to compare wide character strings.
If two wide character strings say s1 and s2 are to be compared.
Then function wcscmp returns positive integer if s1 is greater than s2.
It returns negative integer if string s2 is greater than s1.
if two wide character strings i.e s1 and s2 are same then function returns 0.

== syntax ==

 #include &lt;wchar.h&gt;
       int wcscmp(const wchar_t *s1, const wchar_t *s2);
== Sample program which uses function wcsncmp==
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;wchar.h&gt;
int main() {
        wchar_t string1[] = L&quot;char&quot;;
        wchar_t string2[] = L&quot;character&quot;;
        int difference;

        difference = wcscmp( string1, string2 );
        if ( difference == 0 )
                printf( &quot; Both strings are same&quot;  );
        else {
                if ( difference &lt; 0 )
                        printf( &quot; char is less than character\n&quot; );
                else
                        printf(&quot; char is greater than character\n&quot; );
        }
        return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;
Output of program will be 'char is less than character '&lt;br /&gt;
as value of difference is negative.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[Unix]]-like operating systems, '''mprotect'''() is a POSIX system call for controlling memory protections. It sets protection for memory mapping. The function mprotect changes the access protection specified by the 
prot .&lt;br /&gt;
In the word 'mprotect', 'm' stands for memory and 'protect' for protection so, mprotect basically stands for memory protection. mprotect() is a protecting kind of a function. It's working is based on prot. Prot is just a parameter. The proction to access is provided by mprotect as specified by prot.Prot is the one which decide what kind of access is permitted. The access can be of just read, write, execute or even some combinations. However, the argurment to the parameter prot set compulsarily to PROT_READ or one or more of PROT_READ, PROT_EXEC. and PROT_WRITE. Access to the one's not specified by prot is also permitted; But the thing is different in case of PROT_WRITE and PROT_NONE.It is not permitted for write to succed where PROT_WRITE isn't set.Also access is not permitted where PROT_NONE is alone set without any other. 

Following values of prot can be implemented:-
PROT_NONE, PROT_READ, PROT_WRITE, and the inclusive OR of PROT_READ and PROT_WRITE

If mprotect fails and the error is not EINVAL then it indicates change in protection in the range(addr, addr + len).

== Header file ==
To use the mprotect function one need to include 'sys/mman.h' header file.

== Syntax==
 int mprotect(void *addr, size_t len, int prot);

== Parameter ==
addr : the starting address of memory for witch access is to changed.&lt;br /&gt;
len  : the length of address range in byte.&lt;br /&gt;
prot :  ptot may be PROT_NONE  or PROT_READ or PROT_WRITE or PROT_EXEC.&lt;br /&gt;

each of it has a special meaning 
*PROT_NONE  : the memory can not be assessed in any way.    
*PROT_READ  : the data of memory can be read.       
*PROT_WRITE : data can be modified by writing to it.
*PROT_EXEC  : the data of memory can be executed.

== Errors ==
Following are the common errors due to which mprotect() function will fail if:-

*EACCES 
*EAGAIN 
*EINVAL
*ENOMEM
*ENOMEM
*ENOTSUP

== Return values ==
Upon successful completion, mprotect() returns 0. Otherwise, it returns -1 and sets errno to indicate the error.

==Introduction of Internet of Things==
The Internet of Things (IoT) is a technological revolution that represents the future of computing and communications, and its development depends on dynamic technical innovation in a number of important fields, from wireless sensors to nanotechnology.&lt;ref name= ITU&gt; International Telecommunications Union (2005). ITU Internet Reports 2005: The Internet of Things. Retrieved from www.itu.int/internetofthings/ &lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of the internet of things is come from Massachusetts Institute of Technology(MIT)’s Auto-ID Center in 1999.&lt;ref name= dummies &gt; Patrick J. Sweeney, Patrick J. Sweeney (II.) (2005). RFID for dummies. Wiley Publishing, Inc. &lt;/ref&gt; The MIT Auto-ID Laboratory is dedicated to creating the Internet of Things using Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) and Wireless Sensor Networks. The Internet of Things is a foundation for connecting things, sensors, actuators, and other smart technologies, thus enabling person-to-object and object-to-object communications.&lt;ref name= Architecting&gt; Uckelmann.D, Harrison.M, Michahells.F (2011). Architecting the Internet of Things. Springer Heidelberg Dordrecht London New York &lt;/ref&gt; A new dimension has been added to the world of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs): from anytime, anyplace connectivity for anyone, now we have connectivity for anything. Connections will multiply and create an entirely new dynamic network of networks, which is Internet of Things.&lt;ref name= ITU&gt; International Telecommunications Union (2005). ITU Internet Reports 2005: The Internet of Things. Retrieved from www.itu.int/internetofthings/ &lt;/ref&gt;

RFID techniques and related identification technologies will be the cornerstone of the upcoming Internet of Things. While RFID was initially developed with retail and logistics applications in mind in order to replace the bar code, developments of active components will make this technology much more than a simple identification scheme. In the not too distant future, it can be expected that a single numbering scheme, such as IPv6, will make every single object identifiable and addressable.&lt;ref name=roadmap&gt; Internet of Things in 2020: Roadmap for the future. (May, 2008) Retrieved from: http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/policy/rfid/documents/iotprague2009.pdf &lt;/ref&gt; The technologies of the Internet of Things provide many benefits to the world. For example, sensor technologies are being used to test the quality and purity of different products, such as coffee in Brazil and beef in Namibia. 

However, the security and privacy issues need to be considered. Concerns over privacy and data protection are widespread, particularly as sensors and smart tags can track users’ movements, habits and ongoing preferences. To promote a more widespread adoption of the technologies underlying the Internet of Things, principles of informed consent, data confidentiality and security must be safeguarded.&lt;ref name= ITU&gt; International Telecommunications Union (2005). ITU Internet Reports 2005: The Internet of Things. Retrieved from www.itu.int/internetofthings/ &lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture of Internet of Things==

The Internet of Things needs an open architecture to maximise interoperability among heterogeneous systems and distributed resources including providers and consumers of information and services, whether they be human beings, software, smart objects or devices. Architecture standards should consist of well-defined abstract data models, interfaces and protocols, together with concrete bindings to neutral technologies (such as XML, web services etc.) in order to support the widest possible variety of operating systems and programming languages.&lt;ref name=visions &gt; Vision and Challenges for Realising the Internet of Things, European Union 2010,ISBN 9789279150883. &lt;/ref&gt;

The architecture should have well-defined and granular layers, in order to foster a competitive marketplace of solutions, without locking any users into using a monolithic stack from a single solution provider. Like the Internet, the Internet of Things architecture should be designed to be resilient to disruption of the physical network and should also anticipate that many of the nodes will be mobile, may have intermittent connectivity and may use various communication protocols at different times to connect to the Internet of Things.&lt;ref name= NIC&gt; National Intelligence Council, Disruptive Civil Technologies — Six Technologies with Potential Impacts on US Interests Out to 2025—Conference Report CR 2008–07, April 2008, Online: www.dni.gov/nic/NIC_home.html. &lt;/ref&gt;

Internet of Things nodes may need to dynamically and autonomously form peer networks with other nodes, whether local or remote, and this should be supported through a decentralised, distributed approach to the architecture, with support for semantic search, discovery and peer networking. Anticipating the vast volumes of data that may be generated, it is important that the architecture also includes mechanisms for moving intelligence and capabilities for filtering, pattern recognition, machine learning and decision-making towards the very edges of the network to enable distributed and decentralised processing of the information, either close to where data is generated or remotely in the cloud. The architectural design will also need to enable the processing, routing, storage and retrieval of events and allow for disconnected operations (e.g., where network connectivity might only be intermittent). Effective caching, pre-positioning and synchronisation of requests, updates and data flows need to be an integral feature of the architecture. By developing and defining the architecture in terms of open standards, we can expect increased participation from solution providers of all sizes and a competitive marketplace that benefits end users. In summary, the following issues have to be addressed:

• Distributed open architecture with end to end characteristics, interoperability of heterogeneous systems, neutral access, clear layering and resilience to physical network disruption.

• Decentralized autonomic architectures based on peering of nodes.

• Architectures moving intelligence at the very edge of the networks, up to users’ terminals and things.

• Cloud computing technology, event-driven architectures, disconnected operations and synchronization.

• Use of market mechanisms for increased competition and participation.

==IPv6==
Today’s dominant Internet Protocol (IP), Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4), which has only about 4.3 billion addresses, is not enough to satisfy the rising IP addresses demand due to exponential growth in the number of internet user.&lt;ref name= appleinc&gt; What is IPv6? (2011, June 01). In Apple Inc. Retrieved November 10, 2011, from http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4669 &lt;/ref&gt; This worsening address drought leads to the introduction of Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6),&lt;ref name= ccna&gt; Todd Lammle (2007). CCNA: Cisco Certified Network Associate Study Guide, Sixth Edition. &lt;/ref&gt; which was developed to solve the shortage of internet address. It is often referred to as “next-generation internet” because of its almost limitless IP addresses (3.4x10^38 addresses).&lt;ref name= whatsmyipaddr&gt; What is IPv6? (2000-2011). In What Is My IP Address.com. Retrieved November 15, 2011, from http://whatismyipaddress.com/ip-v6 &lt;/ref&gt; It serves the function of IPv4, but without the same limitations of IPv4. Besides numerous address spaces, the differences between IPv6 and IPv4 are in five major areas: Addressing and Routing, Security, Network Address Translation (NAT), Administrative Workload, and Mobility. IPv6 also offers remarkable capability in the area of multicasting technologies.&lt;ref name= opus&gt; What is IPv6? (2000). In Opus One. Retrieved November 4,2011, from http://www.opus1.com/ipv6/whatisipv6.html &lt;/ref&gt; 

===Addressing and Routing===
IPv6’s extremely large address space gives Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to have sufficient IP addresses to assign to every end system so that every IP device has a truly unique address. Another goal of this address space expansion is to improve the connectivity, reliability, and flexibility. The additional address space is also helpful in the core of Internet by reducing the size and complexity of the global routing tables.&lt;ref name= opus&gt; What is IPv6? (2000). In Opus One. Retrieved November 4,2011, from http://www.opus1.com/ipv6/whatisipv6.html &lt;/ref&gt;

===Security===
One of the goals of IPv6 is Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). The new Internet Protocol Security (IPSec) security protocols, Encapsulating Security Protocol (ESP) and Authentication Header (AH) are capabilities posses by IPv6 that IPv4 does not offer.&lt;ref name= opus&gt; What is IPv6? (2000). In Opus One. Retrieved November 4,2011, from http://www.opus1.com/ipv6/whatisipv6.html &lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, IPv6 mandates that security be provided through information encryption and source authentication. 

===Address Auto-Configuration===
IPv6 Auto-Configuration feature reduces the total time that use to configuring and managing the systems. This ‘stateless’ auto-configuration means that it is no more need to configure IP addresses for end systems, even via Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP).&lt;ref name= opus&gt; What is IPv6? (2000). In Opus One. Retrieved November 4,2011, from http://www.opus1.com/ipv6/whatisipv6.html &lt;/ref&gt; This allows new equipment to communicate with the network once it is detected, which means devices are ready to use on demand, on the other word, plug-and-play. 

===Administrative Workload===
IPv6 improves communication and eliminates the need for NAT, through its automated configuration capabilities. 

===Mobility (Support for Mobile Devices)===
IPv6 hosts are not restricted by location. As its name suggests, Mobile IP allows a device to roam from one network to another without losing their established IP addresses.&lt;ref name= ccna&gt; Todd Lammle (2007). CCNA: Cisco Certified Network Associate Study Guide, Sixth Edition. &lt;/ref&gt;  

===Multicast Technologies===
IPv6 allows multiple addresses for hosts and networks, which means transmission of a single datagram to multiple receivers. This optimizes media streaming applications and allowing more data transmission to millions of locations. Except unicast communication, IPv6 defines a new kind of service, called “anycast”.&lt;ref name= opus&gt; What is IPv6? (2000). In Opus One. Retrieved November 4,2011, from http://www.opus1.com/ipv6/whatisipv6.html &lt;/ref&gt; Anycast communication allows the same address to be placed on more than one device so that when traffic is sent to one device addressed in this way, it is routed to the nearest host that shares the same address.&lt;ref name= ccna&gt; Todd Lammle (2007). CCNA: Cisco Certified Network Associate Study Guide, Sixth Edition. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Sensor==
The Internet of Things is a network of objects connected by things like sensors, RFID tags, and IP addresses. In this respect, sensors have a special role in the Internet of Things paradigm. According to the International Telecommunication Unit (ITU Report 2005), Internet of Things can be defined as a vision “... to connect everyday objects and devices to large databases and networks ... (using) a simple, unobtrusive and cost-effective system of item identification...”.

In the Internet of Things, sensors are the edge of the electronics ecosystem&lt;ref name=Edge&gt; Sensors empower the &quot;Internet of Things&quot; (May, 2010) Retrieved from: http://www.edn.com/article/509123-Sensors_empower_the_Internet_of_Things_.php &lt;/ref&gt;. Sensors allow the physical world to interact with computers, playing an important role in bridging the gap between the physical world and the virtual one. This allows a richer array of data, other than data available from keyboard and mouse inputs. Currently, the internet is full of information that has been input by someone at the keyboard. But the concept of Internet of Things will change that, because we are at an inflexion point where more Internet data originates from sensors rather than keyboard inputs.

A sensor is a device that can measure a physical quality and converts that physical quantity into a signal that can be read by an instrument or an observer. In the idea of the Internet of Things, the ability to detect changes in the physical status of things is also essential for recording changes in the environment&lt;ref name=Summary&gt; International Telecommunications Union (2005). ITU Internet Reports 2005: The Internet of Things Executive Summary. Retrieved from http://www.itu.int/osg/spu/publications/internetofthings/InternetofThings_summary.pdf &lt;/ref&gt;. Sensors collect data from the environment, such as vibrations, temperature, and pressure, among others, and convert them into data that can be processed and analyzed. This allows the Internet of Things to record any changes in the environment or an object.

For example, by having sensors installed on a bridge, the data collected can be used to estimate the number of cars that travel on the bridge, the traffic on the bridge at different times of the day, and the speed of the cars travelling on the bridge. This data can then be used for navigation systems, to allow programs or software to determine the fastest route, depending on the time of day.

Also, the sensors installed on to a bridge can be used to determine the safety of the structure of the bridge.  For example, the sensors can be made to detect the vibrations along each part of the bridge, to detect any impending failure or fault. By collecting such information, any problems such as damage to a structure can be detected early on and dealt with, before any problems arise.

Embedded intelligence in things themselves can further enhance the power of the network. This is possible because the information processing capabilities are devolved, or delegated, to the edges of the network. Embedded intelligence will distribute processing power to the edges of the network, and offers greater possibilities for data processing and increasing the resilience of the network. With embedded intelligence, the things or devices connected at the edge of the network can make independent decisions based on the input received at the sensors.

“Smart things” are difficult to define. However, the term implies a certain processing power and reaction to external stimuli. Advances in smart homes, smart vehicles and personal robotics are some of the leading areas. Research on wearable computing is swiftly progressing. Scientists are using their imagination to develop new devices and appliances, such as intelligent ovens that can be controlled through phones or the internet, online refrigerators and networked blinds. The Internet of Things will draw on the functionality offered by all of these technologies to realize the vision of a fully interactive and responsive network environment.

==RFID==
Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is a system that transmits the data of an object or a person using radio waves for identifying or tracking the object or person. It is done by first attaching a tag, known as the RFID tag, to the object or person. This tag will then be read by the reader to determine its identification information. &lt;ref name= Wiki&gt; Wikipedia Retrieved from: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio-frequency_identification &lt;/ref&gt;

It works much like a barcode, where a scanner scans the barcode and the information will be obtained from the barcode. However, barcode requires a line of sight in order to be scanned whereas RFID tags do not need a line of sight to be read. This means that RFID tags can be read even if the tag is kept in a box or a container, or kept in a pocket. This is because it uses radio waves. This is a huge advantage of RFID. Another advantage of it is that there is a type of RFID tag known as a passive RFID tag which does not require batteries to function. Its power supply comes from the radio energy transmitted by the reader. Other than that, hundreds of RFID tags can be read at a time, unlike the barcode where only 1 can be scanned at a time.&lt;ref name= Wiki&gt; Wikipedia Retrieved from: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio-frequency_identification &lt;/ref&gt;

It is often seen that RFID is a prerequisite of Internet of Things. This is because the Internet of Things is a network of objects connected together and if all everyday objects in the world are to be connected, we would definitely need a simple and cost effective system to do it. RFID is the solution to this problem.&lt;ref name= ITU&gt; International Telecommunications Union (2005). ITU Internet Reports 2005: The Internet of Things. Retrieved from www.itu.int/internetofthings/ &lt;/ref&gt; RFID tags are very simple and small enough such that it can be attached to everyday devices without being noticed. In terms of cost effectiveness, passive tags are said to cost starting from only US$0.05 each. This means that it is very cheap and is possible to be attached to huge amounts of everyday objects. Other than that, as said in the previous paragraph, there is a type of RFID tag known as a passive tag which does not require any batteries to function and gets its power supply from the radio energy transmitted by the reader. This will save the cost of batteries and we do not have to worry about batteries being worn out and replacing them. This will save us from much hassle of checking and replacing batteries. Other than saving trouble and cost, this also gives the tags infinite lifetime because they are completely dependent on the reader for power. As long as there is a reader, the tag will work. Another point stated in the previous paragraph is that hundreds of RFID tags can be read at a time. The RFID system was designed to be able to distinguish the different tags which are within range of the RFID reader. This means that there will be no mistake in the information which the tag provides and will not be jumbled up with information from other tags.
RFID tags can be integrated with sensors to send not only identification data but also valuable information.&lt;ref name=Tyrrhenian&gt; The Internet of Things: 20th Tyrrhenian Workshop on Digital Communications&lt;/ref&gt; A sensor will monitor the change of a physical status and convert it into a signal which will be stored by the RFID tag. When a reader reads a tag, the sensors information will be sent to the reader along with the identity of the object. This way, we can monitor changes in an object such as temperature, pressure or vibration. This allows us to avoid any disaster or safety hazard from happening. For example, if we were to tag the tyres of a vehicle with a pressure sensor and we assume that a workshop has a RFID tag reader, every time the vehicle enters the workshop, the reader will automatically read the tag and obtain the information of the pressure of the tyres. It will be able to identify a specific tyre which has too much or too little pressure and so we can either increase or decrease the pressure to prevent any mishap from happening.&lt;ref name= ITU&gt; International Telecommunications Union (2005). ITU Internet Reports 2005: The Internet of Things. Retrieved from www.itu.int/internetofthings/ &lt;/ref&gt;

==Security and Privacy==

The trend of having ever more objects included in the IT data flows and ever more connected devices, moving toward mobile and decentralized computing is evident. The Internet of things has become a new Era in this day and age. There is a need to have a solution to guarantee privacy and the security of the customers in order to have a widespread adoption of any object identification system. 

The security has been done as an add-on feature in most cases, and the feeling that the public acceptance for the internet of things will happen only when the strong security solutions are in place. This could be hybrid security mechanisms that for example combine hardware security with key diversification to deliver superior security that makes attacks significantly more difficult or even impossible. The selection of security features and mechanisms will continue to be determined by the impact on business processes.

The security and privacy issues should be addressed by the forthcoming standards which must define different security features to provide confidentiality, integrity, or availability services.

These are some security and privacy requirements with descriptions:

•	Resilience to attacks: The system has to avoid single points of failure and should adjust itself to node failures.

•	Data authentication: As a principle, retrieved address and object information must be authenticated.&lt;ref name= auth&gt; For RFID authentication see Juels, supra note 14, at 384 s; Rolf H. Weber/Annette Willi, IT-Sicherheit und Recht, Zurich 2006, at
284. &lt;/ref&gt;

•	Access control: Information providers must be able to implement access control on the data provided.&lt;ref name= IIler&gt; See also Eberhard Grummt/Markus Mu¨ ller, Fine-Grained Access Control for EPC Information Services, in: Floerkemeier/ Langheinrich/Fleisch/Mattern/Sarma, supra note 4, at 35–49.&lt;/ref&gt;

•	Client privacy: Measures need to be taken that only the information provider is able to infer from observing the use of the lookup system related to a specific customer.

The fulfillment of customer privacy requirements is quite difficult. A number of technologies have been developed in order to achieve information privacy goals. These Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PET) can be described in short as follow:&lt;ref name= Fabian&gt; Fabian, supra note 6, 61 s; Benjamin Fabian/Oliver Gu¨ nther,Security Challenges of the EPCglobal Network, Communications of the ACM, Vol. 52, July 2009, 121–125, at 124 s.&lt;/ref&gt;

•	Virtual Private Networks (VPN) is extranets established by close groups of business partners. As only partners have access, they promise to be confidential and have integrity. However, this solution does not allow for a dynamic global information exchange and is impractical with regard to third parties beyond the borders of the extranet.

•	Transport Layer Security (TLS), based on an appropriate global trust structure, could also improve confidentiality and integrity of the IoT. However, as each Object Naming Service (ONS) delegation step requires a new TLS connection, the search of information would be negatively affected by many additional layers.

==Conclusion==
In conclusion, Internet of Things is the concept in which the virtual world of information technology connected to the real world of things. The technologies of Internet of things such as RFID and Sensor make our life become better and more comfortable.

The Basic Concept of Efficiency Wages:&lt;br /&gt;
An efficiency wage will exceed the market clearing wage for a given occupation. The intended purpose of this decision is to provide the worker with an incentive to labor effectively by decreasing the propensity to shirk or behave poorly.&lt;ref&gt;http://areweb.berkeley.edu/~perloff/PDF/effic.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Efficiency wages may only have a noticeable effect for a limited duration, after which there is no discernible differentiation from the market clearing wage. 
Labor is like a commodity: There is a market clearing price for a which a worker is willing to put in the minimum effort required.  It is further assumed that there is a positive relationship between increased wages and the effort that they put forth (reciprocity).  Laboratory evidence supports this hypothesis (1366).  It is questionable as to whether or not this holds true in actuality when duration and adaptation are brought into consideration.  It appears that those offered higher wages (an efficiency wage) increased effort and productivity for a short time, only to sink to average levels later on. It is important to note that this is true in for a one-time work situation, not continued employment.  It seems that higher wages may not improve productivity, but may help to attract and retain high quality workers.
&lt;br /&gt;
From the Article:
THE  FAIR  WAGE-EFFORT  HYPOTHESIS  AND 
UNEMPLOYMENT* &lt;br /&gt;

Workers have an idea of the fair wage which is greater than the market clearing wage.  They will therefore provide only a fraction of normal effort.  The existence of efficiency wages provide a possible explanation for unemployment, as they exceed market clearing wages and limit the number of possible hires (likewise, the negative correlation between skill and unemployment).  If a wage is below the perceived wage, the laborer will lower actual effort or adjust their non-pecuniary perception of the job.  The effect of overpayment may be psychological rather than resulting in actual improvements in labor.  Simply put, underpaid worker get angry.  They may feel resentment towards higher paid workers and offer a declining level of service to customers if they interact directly.  Inequity among workers can create strife, lower morale and productivity (particularly if they are of the same labor group).  If a firm must pay high wages to one group of workers in order to attain skilled individuals, it is likely that wages throughout the firm will rise.
&lt;br /&gt;
From the Book: 
Animal Spirts&lt;br /&gt;
Firms cannot fully monitor their employees; therefore workers can work or shirk. In an economy where there is no unemployment, there is no incentive to work.  Firms pay extra, reducing shirking but resulting in unemployment. Falls in unemployment result in rises in shirking.  &lt;br /&gt;
Alternatives to Efficiency Wages:
* Seniority Rights: If a worker builds benefits during his tenure in a given occupation, he will be persuaded to work efficiently because all other jobs would not provide the same benefit.  
* Reputation:  Educated workers may find that the cost of shirking is the cost of their education; job loss due to poor performance will result in difficulty finding work in any other firm because of a tarnished reputation.  The time any money spent on school will be useless in this situation.  &lt;br /&gt;
It is likely that the relationship between an employee and the employer is more complicated that the simple exchange of a wage for labor.  There is a sense of duty that laborers feel to complete their tasks.  If they feel that they are being unfairly compensated, the will shirk or sabotage.  If they feel they are being more than fairly compensated, they will fully buy into the goals of the company.  Therefore, the decision of whether or not to shirk is dependent on the cost to do so and how fairly to laborer feels they are being treated.  &lt;br /&gt;
Low or unfairly distributed wages will result in the sensation that necessary tasks do not fall on any specific individual (a result of complex interactions between laborers within the workplace.

==Labor as a Commodity==
Labor, being a good that can be traded, is very much a commodity. Like other tangible goods and services, there is a market clearing price for which the demand and supply for labor will be in equilibrium. &lt;ref&gt;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-0262.2006.00707.x/pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  However, this is the price for which a worker is just willing to trade his labor for income, meaning that only the minimal amount of effort will be exerted.  In this situation, a worker may shirk responsibilities that are felt to be unwarranted at the market clearing price, or wage. &lt;br /&gt;
The theory of efficiency wages suggests that there is a positive relationship between wages which exceed the market clearing wage and the level of effort that a worker reciprocates to their employer.&lt;ref&gt;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-0262.2006.00707.x/pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  In turn, it is postulated that the effort and therefore productivity of a worker will increase along with their wages.

==Basic Model==

The basic concept of efficiency wages can be explained mathematically using the formula below.  In order for a wage to increase the efficiency of a worker:
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;θ(α-β) &gt; G&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
where:
&lt;br /&gt;
* θ represents the likelihood that a worker will be caught and punished for unsatisfactory labor
* α represents the efficiency wage
* β represents the going market clearing wage
* G represents the value a worker places on providing only the minimum necessary effort
&lt;br /&gt;
A worker will choose the benefit, '''G''', of supplying the minimum level of effort his occupation requires in the case that their employer fails to provide a wage '''α''' large enough to render the risk of release, '''θ(α-β)''', greater than or equal to the benefit of slacking on the job.  The efficiency wage '''α''' must exceed the market clearing wage '''β''' so that the cost associated with losing one's job is greater than the benefit of supplying minimum effort.  If the wage '''α''' does not exceed '''β''', a worker can simply move to a different firm within the industry and maintain a constant level of utility while enjoying the benefits of minimal effort.&lt;ref&gt;http://areweb.berkeley.edu/~perloff/PDF/effic.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Test==
In an experiment organized by Uri Gneezy and John list, two mutually exclusive groups of individuals, say A and B, were asked to digitize a library's catalog. Both A and B were promised a wage of $12 an hour for six hours of labor.  Upon arrival, however, group A was instead offered a wage of $20 an hour, 167% of group B's wage.  Initially, the generosity of the wage was reciprocated by the individual laborers of group A- information processed by A exceeded that of B by nearly 25%, suggesting greater effort.  After ninety minutes time, productivity slipped to levels which were indistinguishable from that of group B.&lt;ref&gt;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-0262.2006.00707.x/pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">In early computers, program memory was expensive. Programmers spent a lot of time minimizing the size of a program to fit it into the limited memory available. Thus the combined size of all the instructions needed to perform a particular task, the code density, was an important characteristic of any instruction set.&lt;ref&gt;
{{wikipedia|code density}} [[Wikipedia: code density]]
&lt;/ref&gt;
Even today, it makes a large difference whether or not the vast majority of instructions executed fit into the [[Microprocessor Design/Cache#Split cache|instruction cache]], which is by many orders of magnitude smaller than main memory.

In the early decades of CPU development, people gradually added more and more &quot;powerful&quot; instructions to the instruction set,
reducing the total number of instructions stored to implement common tasks,
but increasing the average [[Microprocessor_Design/Instruction_Set_Architectures#instruction_length | number of bits required to store each instruction]] -- in many cases this improves overall code density.
After the development of on-chip instruction cache,
the RISC revolution was led by people who sacrificed code density and eliminated complex, &quot;powerful&quot; instructions in order to simplify and speed up CPU implementation and improve performance on other CPU performance metrics.
More recently, some people have been experimenting with minimal instruction set computers (MISC), making the number of bits per instruction much shorter, in an attempt to improve code density.

For processors with variable-length instructions, it helps code density if frequently-used instructions are short, even if that forces other (rarely-used) instructions to be long.

For processors with fixed-width instructions, choosing 16-bit-wide instructions appears to give slightly better code density than 8-bit or 32-bit-wide instructions.&lt;ref&gt;
&quot;It seems that the 16-bit ISA hits somehow the &quot;sweet spot&quot; for the best code density, perhaps because the addresses are also 16-bit wide and are handled in a single instruction. In contrast, 8-bitters need multiple instructions to handle 16-bit addresses.&quot;
-- [http://embeddedgurus.com/state-space/2009/03/insects-of-the-computer-world/ &quot;Insects of the computer world&quot;] by Miro Samek 2009.
&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a widespread belief that 32-bit microcontrollers have much bigger code size (worse code density) than 8-bit microcontrollers.
However, in many cases
32-bit microcontrollers that use mostly 16-bit-wide instructions have smaller code size (better code density) than
8-bit microcontrollers that use mostly 14-bit-wide instructions or
16-bit microcontrollers that use mostly 16-bit-wide instructions.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;


As typical RAM sizes increased, and
after the development of the separate instruction cache large enough to contain inner loops and common subroutines
(so code density had much less effect on [[Microprocessor Design/Performance Metrics | CPU performance metrics]]),
and after the invention of nested subroutines and threaded code and other instruction-set-independent executable compression techniques,&lt;ref&gt;
[[Data Compression/Executable Compression]]
&lt;/ref&gt;
code density has become a less important part of [[Microprocessor Design/Instruction Set Architectures | instruction set architecture]].

== Bitcoin ==
Bitcoin (BTC) is a recent decentralized electronic currency that is used in online transactions between two parties.  It continues to be a substitute for online transaction with the goal of one day being the primary online currency.  The main benefit that BTC continues to make known is the removable of a central bank to process transactions and the use of cryptography to verify each transaction.  It was released in 2009, by Satoshi Nakamoto (possibly a pseudonym) and since then it has had a slow start at gaining popularity.  The design of BTC is considered to be sophisticated and bullet-proof to hackers and abuse.  Bitcoins are primarily used for online transactions with the exception of a few establishments able to do BTC-to-Dollars exchanges (and other national currencies).  There has been negative criticisms that BTC has had dealt with, including abuse from attackers of the network in efforts to try to find weaknesses and other possible faults described below.  There has also been good response from the increase in users, merchants, traders using the electronic currency to sell their products and increase their BTC profits.

== Breakdown ==
'''Getting Started'''

'The first step to enter the market of bitcoins is to download the free software available to anyone on various websites.  Bitcoin is currently available to MAC and Windows user and as of mid-2012 it has released its 0.6.2 version.  Once the software is installed a user must obtain a bitcoin wallet to be able to store their wealth.  There are a variety of wallets not including the one provided by the software, which can give the user a more sense of security over their currency and that offer additional benefits.  Some of these bitcoin wallets are InstaWallet, and flexcoin.  As an example, flexcoin serves as an online bank where you are able to store your money and have access from various online devices such as mobile applications and multiple computers. &lt;ref&gt;Flex Coin The bitcoin bank, http://www.flexcoin.com/, Retrieved May 2012. &lt;/ref&gt;  Once the software is installed users can begin to obtain BTC using a variety of methods. 

'''Mining'''

New BTC are generated and enter the network's eco-system through a process called &quot;mining.&quot;  The term &quot;mining&quot; is used because it assimilates the real-life work that miners perform to extract minerals.  Users competing in Bitcoin mining run computerized programs that solve puzzles in return for new BTC.  The creation of BTC is much more complex when analyzed in depth.  The process of mining generates &quot;blocks,&quot; at a predetermined rate based on the number of miners in the network.  An amount of data tracking the time consumed by the computer running cycles to solve difficult problems, or a new block, is known as “proof-of-work”.  This proof-of-work helps regulate the number of blocks released (as of May 2012 at one block every ten minutes for the whole network)&lt;ref&gt; Barber, Simon, Xavior Boyen, Elaine Shi, and Ersin Uzun. &quot;Bitter to Better — How to Make Bitcoin a Better Currency.&quot; Print. Palo Alto Research Center, University of California-Berkeley, pg4.&lt;/ref&gt;., as well as the validity of the block.  This proof-of-work tracks and secures the validity of each BTC preventing double spending.  When a miner creates blocks, they are able to charge transaction fees for that blocks information and receive bitcoin transaction fees from vetting.  The idea that for currency to have value there must be a finite amount, Bitcoin minting is set so that the number of BTC released approximates but never reaches 21 million.  The number of bitcoins entering the economy is reducing as more blocks are created(as more miners enter the network), and will continue to do so until its max is reached.  It is estimated the the maximum number of bitcoins circulating the economy will be reached in 2029.&lt;ref&gt;Grinberg, Reuben. &quot;Bitcoin: An Innovative Alternative Digital Currency.&quot; HASTINGS SCIENCE &amp; TECHNOLOGY LAW JOURNAL 4.1 (2011): 164+. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  Mining has the potential to be very lucrative, if the user is able to supply a high power computer to solve the problems, since there is double payout in doing so: one with the minting of BTC and second with the transaction fees charged for using blocks.
Users can also increase their BTC wealth by establishing themselves as merchants, selling products in the BTC market, or purchasing directly from a seller.  There is no set exchange rate of bitcoins-to-US dollars( or other national currency), so the value of bitcoins fluctuates based on the exchange rate of the market.  At one point a single bitcoin was worth 30 USD before crashing and setting at approximately 2 USD in October 2011.&lt;ref&gt; Barber, Simon, Xavior Boyen, Elaine Shi, and Ersin Uzun. &quot;Bitter to Better — How to Make Bitcoin a Better Currency.&quot; Print. Palo Alto Research Center, University of California-Berkeley, pg1.&lt;/ref&gt; Other common ways to earn bitcoins is by participating in surveys, or rating products, finding free bitcoins online, joining mining groups, and other ways that payout out small quantities of BTC.

'''Transactions'''

When a users signs up to the BTC network they are issued a sets of crypto-keys.  Also known as public-key cryptography these keys allow for users to safely transfer BTC among one another without the risk of being duplicated or misused. The public key is embedded with the information of the owner of the bitcoin, and also serves as a tool to track and verify the genuineness of that single coin.  When a transaction takes place, the owner attaches the key information (bitcoin address) of the receiver and waits for a miner to validate the coin(s).  Validating the authenticity of the bitcoins being transferred requires the information embedded in the second key.  The process to transfer BTC using public-key cryptography has assured BTC users and merchants of the piece of mind they can have when transferring and receiving currency.  Once this piece of mind can be established in the users of bitcoin, the user can feel comfortable making multiple transactions that lead to an increase in the network. 

'''Merchants''' 

As of October 2011 there was an estimated 20 million BTC users, with a about $20 million USD worth in BTC.&lt;ref&gt;Grinberg, Reuben. &quot;Bitcoin: An Innovative Alternative Digital Currency.&quot; HASTINGS SCIENCE &amp; TECHNOLOGY LAW JOURNAL 4.1 (2011): 160. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  Today you can buy software, alpaca socks, servers and many other products using BTC.  The number of transactions have also begin to increase as more BTC enter the economy.   Bitcoins also offers merchants the ability to capitalize using the electronic currency.  Merchants must pay transaction fees for the use of running a credit card at the point of sale.  Transaction fees can vary, but in 2008 financial institutions pocketed around 48 billion USD charging merchants these transaction fees.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, Stacy. &quot;Soaring Credit Card Transaction Fees Squeeze Independent Businesses.&quot; Institute for Local Self-Reliance. Banking, Independent Business, 5 May 2009. Web. 28 May 2012.http://www.ilsr.org/soaring-credit-card-transaction-fees-squeeze-independent-businesses/&lt;/ref&gt;  Bitcoin has pushed for the use of their currency by promoting the low transaction cost that merchants pay for the use of BTC.  These low transaction fees can result in merchants increasing their profits.  Merchants have the option of managing each and every transaction or can also use third parties that can manage their accounts.  The increases in small transactions, also known as Micropayments, have the potential to benefit merchants if the customer finds it beneficial to make multiple transactions.    

A [[w:Micropayment|micropayment]] is a term to describe a financial payment system in which a low per-unit price is offered to consumers.  The low price is offered in order to entice consumers to purchase multiple amounts or items.  As such the system must have a large network of users for the concept to be affective.  Examples exist in different types of networks: 
*'''Real''': Subway/Public transportation systems, Gift-card, University meal plans
*'''Virtual''': ITunes, ESPN, Online multiplayer games
*'''Sponsored''':  One party in the transaction will have control over the network

== Network Externalities ==
Bitcoin can be considered an open network by definition, because as long as you have a computer and Internet access, you may download Bitcoin and begin to make use of it.  There is no reason to conclude that there is a set administrator that prevents anyone from downloading and installing it and the software is free. BTC is considered a peer-to-peer network because the information generated from the mining of any block becomes public, and through the publication of such information the network prevents fraudulent activity by keeping everyone accountable.  The latter is possible with the use of very sophisticated encryption for the transactions being performed between both parties.  This also leads to conclude that the network is sponsored since there is a creator of BTC, which continue to release updated versions.  To renforce the latter the network is maintained by a community of open source developers. &lt;ref&gt;We Use Coins, http://www.weusecoins.com/getting-started.php, Retrieved May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
The use of BTC is a one-sided network just like the US dollar and any other national currency.  There is user ‘A’ using BTC to purchase a good/service from user ‘B’.  The increase use of BTC, has also allowed other user to enter this network platform such as flexcoin.  The managing of BTC from flexcoin allows users to use this third party source to facilitate process of the transaction.  Bitcoin has served as network with various multiple parties using BTC for different purpose, creating positive network externalities.  It can be argued that it is a multi-sided network, but since its primary purpose is, and continues to be, a medium of exchange (money) it has the nature of a one-sided network.
As more online users begin to use BTC as a mean of exchange of goods and services, the more useful the BTC become to each user, leading to demand-side economies of scale.  The increase in users, whether its merchants, consumers, traders, etc., will attract more non-users to join the network for a variety of reasons that each see beneficial.  As of this writing in May 2012, Bitcoin is still in the beginning stages, but it is one of the most popular online virtual currencies.  The benefit from using BTC can come in the way of more merchants entering the market and offering BTC as a form of payment.  Currently the amount of merchants offering BTC as a payment option is very small, since its exchange rate for actual money is not stable.  This also leads to a collective lock-in, because it is hard for an aggregate amount of people to do the switch do to the lack of popularity, trust and other barriers.  Today using a credit card or PayPal to purchase goods is still more beneficial to everyone, then making a switch to a small network such as BTC.

== Cons ==
The downside to BTC has been its lack of popularity among other concerns that have arise since its establishment in 2009.  There has been a few attacks and glitches in the code that have lead to contamination of BTC. Such was the case of recent problems such as an overflow of transactions in a block in August 2010, and invalid transactions in micropayments in September of the same year. &lt;ref&gt;Bit Coin Project 2009-2012, http://bitcoin.org/, Retrieved May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since the start of BTC there has been a handful of updated version to correct problems that may erupt in the software.
Another level of concern is the possibility of cyber-criminals using BTC and abusing it like regular currency.  Since there are no specific ways to track who and where is using BTC in transaction, and with the absence of a central bank system that BTC lacks, the FBI has demonstrated concern that cyber-criminals will use it for illicit activities.  This creates a problem for investors since there is no &quot;state enforcer&quot; looking out for the criminals and their BTC wealth. Unlike the United States dollar which is to some degree backed up by the government, BTC only has the confidence of the users to rely on.  If confidence is lost in the currency, perhaps by the entrence of a new virtual currency, then BTC has the potential to fail.  It is argued that the hoarding of BTC can also be a barrier for BTC to succeed.  The possibility to create bitcoins is diminishing with time and as more users enter the network.  Making them more valuable in the future and incentivizing owner of BTC to reframe from using them today to have greater wealth in the future.  The latter in a large scale can cause BTC to downfall with less bitcoins in circulation driving users away.  Many national currencies have the backing of their government that can instill confidence, a peace of mind, and seance of security for personal wealth.  Bitcoin unfortunately still lacks all three.  Other issues such as inflation, deflation, money supply, etc., that currencies are affected both positive and negativelly and that BTC still lacks can play a role in the future of BTC and its success.

== Review 2/7/2011 ==

This is a well written piece, and is written in a way that is easy to understand. I think one thing that I would like to see as a reader is information about actually conducted tests of these experiments or ones similar to them. How well do these predict peoples behavior given the situation?

== TDang review April 2012 ==

I'm reviewing [https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikibooks/en/w/index.php?title=Strategy_for_Information_Markets/Background/Nash_equilibrium&amp;diff=2314616&amp;oldid=2312647 this version]. I'll likely be more critical than complimentary, because (a) that's the way I am and (b) that's what will help improve things. Please don't take the criticism-over-compliments to mean I have a wholly negative view.

Make sure to check the [[Talk:Strategy_for_Information_Markets#review_thoughts_April_2012|all-purpose review thoughts]] as well.

* I moved this page from ''Nash equilibrium and coordination games'' to just ''Nash equilibrium'' (to include other selected games). That's because I think including public goods games on this page would also be worthwhile. Those are structurally the same as [[w:prisoner's dilemma|], but are more specifically interpreted.
* So, doing something with a public goods / voluntary contribution game would help here.
* Once those are included, some restructuring of the introduction would also be in order.
* ''&quot;In all games matrices there are two pure strategy and two mixed strategy results.''&quot;--This paragraph is incorrect, in a number of ways.
*# First, it's wrong about what mixed strategy means. I don't anticipate using mixed strategy in this book, and it's not very important for the games that this page will discuss, so leaving out mixed strategy altogether is probably a good approach.
*# Second, it's important to separate the ''definition of the game'' as represented in the table from the ''solution/prediction'' which Nash equilibrium will find. The game exists separate from the Nash equilibrium.
* ''Nash equilibrium''--This section needs to be phrased very carefully. It's a bit confusing now. I don't think we want to give the formal mathematical definition, but what we give should be equally rigorous.
* That's about the right amount of experiments on coordination games. Unless there's something which clearly connects the experiments to the kind of things we're interested in (information goods, network externalities) we don't want to fill up too much on experiments.
* ''References''
** A google search is not a good reference, in fact it breaks Wikibooks' spam filter. Here;s an alternative link: http://www.uh.edu/econpapers/RePEc/hou/wpaper/2006-01.pdf
** Try to use the references with all appropriate information, with the author and title being more important than the university they're from.
** It looks like both of your references were to &quot;working papers&quot;. If possible, it's better to use a paper which has been published. (It's possible those papers have been published, and you can reference the published versions.)
* I was working from the principle that this page shouldn't get much bigger. It still shouldn't get ''much'' bigger, but expansing to include a public goods game, and maybe a public goods game with a provision point would be worthwhile.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Cournot competition''' is an economic model used to describe industry structure. It so called after [[w:Antoine Augustin Cournot|Antoine Augustin Cournot]] (1801-1877) after he observed competition in a spring water duopoly. It has the following features: 

* There are two firms producing homogeneous products; 
* Firms do not cooperate.  
* Firms have market power; 
* There are barriers to entry; 
* Firms compete in quantities, and choose quantities simultaneously; 
* There is strategic behaviour by the firms; 

Price is a commonly known decreasing function of total output. All firms know N and take the output of the others as given. Each firm has a cost function ci(qi) (cost per unit multiply quantity). Normally the cost functions are treated as common knowledge. The cost functions are normally the same for all firms. The market price is set at a level such that demand equals the total quantity produced by both firms.

==Graphically finding the Cournot duopoly equilibrium==
:p1 = firm 1 price, p2 = firm 2 price

:q1 = firm 1 quantity, q2 = firm 2 quantity

:c = marginal cost (assumed to be constant)

Equilibrium prices will be:
:p1 = p2 = P(q1+q2)

This implies that firm i’s profit is given by &lt;math&gt;\Pi\ i = qi(P(q1+q2)-c)&lt;/math&gt;

*Calculate firm 1’s residual demand: Suppose firm 1 believes firm 2 is producing quantity q2. What is firm 1s optimal quantity? Consider the diagram 1. If firm 1 decides not to produce anything, then price is given by P(0+q2)=P(q2). If firm 1 sets produces q1’ then price is given by P(q1’+q2). More generally, for each quantity that firm 1 might decide to set, price is given by the curve d1(q2). The curve d1(q2) is called firm 1’s residual demand; it gives all possible combinations of firm 1’s quantity and price for a given value of q2.

[[Image:economics_cournot_diag1.png]]

*Determine firm 1’s optimum output: To do this we must find where marginal revenue equals marginal cost. Marginal cost (c) is assumed to be constant. Marginal revenue is a curve - r1(q2) - with twice the slope of d1(q2) and with the same vertical intercept. The point at which the two curves intersect corresponds to quantity q1’’(q2). Firm 1’s optimum q1’’(q2), depends on what it believes firm 2 is doing. To find an equilibrium, we derive firm 1’s optimum for other possible values of q2. Diagram 2 considers two possible values of q2. If q2=0, then firm firms residual demand is effectively the market demand, d1(0)=D. The optimal solution is for firm 1 to choose the monopoly quantity; q1’’(0)=q&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;  (q&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt; is monopoly quantity). If firm 2 were to choose the quantity corresponding to perfect competition, q2=qc P(q&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt;)=c, then firm 1’s optimum would be to produce nil: q1’’(q&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt;)=0. This is the point at which marginal cost intercepts the marginal revenue corresponding to d1(q&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt;).

[[Image:economics_cournot_diag2.png]]

*It can be shown that, given the linear demand and constant marginal cost, the function q1’’(q2) is also linear. Because we have two points, we can draw the entire function q1’’(q2), see diagram 3. Note the axis of the graphs has changed, The function q1’’(q2) is firm 1’s reaction function, it gives firm 1’s optimal choice for each possible choice by firm 2. In other words, it gives firm 1’s choice given what it believes firm 2 is doing.

[[Image:economics_cournot_diag3.png]]

*The last stage in finding the Cournot equilibrium is to find firm 2’s reaction function. In this case it is symmetrical to firm 1’s as they have the same cost function. The equilibrium is the interception point of the reaction curves. See diagram 4.

[[Image:economics_cournot_diag4.png]]

*The prediction of the model is that the firms will choose [[Strategy_for_Information_Markets/Background/Nash_equilibrium_and_coordination_games#Nash_equilibrium|Nash equilibrium]] output levels.

==Calculating the equilibrium==

In very general terms, let the price function for the (duopoly) industry be &lt;math&gt;P(q_1+q_2)&lt;/math&gt; and firm i have the cost structure &lt;math&gt;C_i(q_i)&lt;/math&gt;. To calculate the Nash equilibrium, the best response functions of the firms must first be calculated.

The profit of firm i is revenue less cost. Revenue is the product of price and quantity and cost is given by the firm's cost structure, so profit is (as described above):
&lt;math&gt;\Pi\ i = P(q_1+q_2).q_i - C_i(q_i)&lt;/math&gt;. The best response is to find the value of &lt;math&gt;q_i&lt;/math&gt; that maximises &lt;math&gt;\Pi\ i&lt;/math&gt; given &lt;math&gt;q_j&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;i \ne \ j&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. given some output of the opponent firm, the output that maximises profit is found. Hence, the maximum of &lt;math&gt;\Pi\ i&lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;q_i&lt;/math&gt; is to be found. First derive &lt;math&gt;\Pi\ i&lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;q_i&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \Pi\ i }{\partial q_i} = \frac{\partial P(q_1+q_2) }{\partial q_i}.qi + P(q1+q2) - \frac{\partial C_i (q_i)}{\partial q_i}&lt;/math&gt;

Setting this to zero for maximisation:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \Pi\ i }{\partial q_i} = \frac{\partial P(q_1+q_2) }{\partial q_i}.qi + P(q1+q2) - \frac{\partial C_i (q_i)}{\partial q_i}=0&lt;/math&gt;

The values of &lt;math&gt;q_i&lt;/math&gt; that satisfy this equation are the best responses. The Nash equilibria are where both &lt;math&gt;q_1&lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt;q_2&lt;/math&gt; are best responses given those values of &lt;math&gt;q_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q_2&lt;/math&gt;.

si===An example===

Suppose the industry has the following price structure: &lt;math&gt;P(q_1+q_2)= a - b(q_1+q_2)&lt;/math&gt;  The profit of firm i (with cost structure &lt;math&gt;C_i(q_i)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial ^2C_i (q_i)}{\partial q_i^2}=0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial C_i (q_i)}{\partial q_j}=0, j \ne \ i&lt;/math&gt; for ease of computation) is:

&lt;math&gt;\Pi\ i = \bigg(a - b(q_1+q_2)\bigg).q_i - \partial C_i(q_i)&lt;/math&gt;

The maximisation problem resolves to (from the general case):

&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \bigg(a - b(q_1+q_2)\bigg) }{\partial q_i}.qi + a - b(q_1+q_2) - \frac{\partial C_i (q_i)}{\partial q_i}=0&lt;/math&gt;

Without loss of generality, consider firm 1's problem:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \bigg(a - b(q_1+q_2)\bigg) }{\partial q_1}.q1 + a - b(q_1+q_2) - \frac{\partial C_1 (q_1)}{\partial q_1}=0&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow \ - bq_1 + a - b(q_1+q_2) - \frac{\partial C_1 (q_1)}{\partial q_1}=0&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow \ q_1 = \frac{a - bq_2 - \frac{\partial C_1 (q_1)}{\partial q_1}}{2b}&lt;/math&gt;

By symmetry:

&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow \ q_2 = \frac{a - bq_1 - \frac{\partial C_2 (q_2)}{\partial q_2}}{2b}&lt;/math&gt;

These are the firms' best response functions. For any value of &lt;math&gt;q_2&lt;/math&gt;, firm 1 responds best with any value of &lt;math&gt;q_1&lt;/math&gt; that satisfies the above. In Nash equilibria, both firms will be playing best responses so solving the above equations simultaneously. Substituting for &lt;math&gt;q_2&lt;/math&gt; in firm 1's best response:

&lt;math&gt;\ q_1 = \frac{a - b(\frac{a - bq_1 - \frac{\partial C_2 (q_2)}{\partial q_2}}{2b}) - \frac{\partial C_1 (q_1)}{\partial q_1}}{2b}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow \ q_1* = \frac{a + \frac{\partial C_2 (q_2)}{\partial q_2} - \frac{\partial C_1 (q_1)}{\partial q_1}}{3b}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow \ q_2* = \frac{a + \frac{\partial C_1 (q_1)}{\partial q_1} - \frac{\partial C_2 (q_2)}{\partial q_2}}{3b}&lt;/math&gt;

The Nash equilibria are all &lt;math&gt;(q_1*,q_2*)&lt;/math&gt;. This yields a market price of 5a/3.

==Implications==
* Output is greater with Cournot duopoly than monopoly, but lower than perfect competition. 
* Price is lower with Cournot duopoly than monopoly, but not as low as with perfect competition.

==Bertrand versus Cournot==
* Although both models have similar assumptions, but both have very different implications.
* Bertrand predicts a duopoly is enough to push prices down to marginal cost level, meaning that duopoly will result in perfect competition.
* Neither model is ‘better’, it depends on the industry as to which is more accurate.
* If capacity and output can be easily changed, Bertrand is a better model of duopoly competition. Or, if output and capacity are difficult to adjust, then Cournot is generally a better model.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Bertrand competition''' is a model of competition used in economics, named after [[w:Joseph Louis François Bertrand|Joseph Louis François Bertrand]] (1822-1900).  It describes interactions among firms (sellers) that set prices and their customers (buyers) that choose quantities at that price. 

The model rests on the following assumptions:

* There are at least two firms producing homogeneous (undifferentiated) products; 
* Firms do not cooperate;
* Firms compete by setting prices simultaneously; 
* Consumers buy everything from a firm with a lower price. If all firms charge the same price, consumers randomly select among them.

== Calculating the classic Bertrand model ==
*MC = Marginal cost
*p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = firm 1’s price level
*p&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = firm 2’s price level
*p&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; = monopoly price level

* Firm 1's optimum price depends on where it believes firm 2 will set its prices. Pricing just below the other firm will obtain full market demand (D), though this is not optimal if the other firm is pricing below marginal cost as that would entail negative profits. In general terms, firm 1's [[best response]] function is p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;’’(p&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), this gives firm 1 optimal price for each price set by firm 2.

* Diagram 1 shows firm 1’s reaction function p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;’’(p&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), with each firm's strategy on each axis. It shows that when P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is less than marginal cost (firm 2 pricing below MC) firm 1 prices at marginal cost, p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;=MC. When firm 2 prices above MC but below monopoly prices, then firm 1 prices just below firm 2. When firm 2 prices above monopoly prices (P&lt;sup&gt;M&lt;/sup&gt;) firm 1 prices at monopoly level, p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;=p&lt;sup&gt;M&lt;/sup&gt;.

[[Image:economics_bertrand_diag1.png]]

*Because firm 2 has the same marginal cost as firm 1, its reaction function is symmetrical with respect to the 45 degree line. Diagram 2 shows both reaction functions.

[[Image:economics_bertrand_diag2.png]]

*The result of the firms' strategies is a [[Strategy_for_Information_Markets/Background/Nash_equilibrium_and_coordination_games|Nash equilibrium]], that is, a pair of strategies (prices in this case) where neither firm can increase profits by unilaterally changing price. This is given by the intersection of the reaction curves, Point N on the diagram. At this point p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;=p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;’’(p&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and p&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=p&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;’’(p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;). As you can see, point N on the diagram is where both firms are pricing at marginal cost.

Another way of thinking about it, a simpler way, is to imagine if both firms set equal prices above marginal cost, firms would get half the market at a higher than MC price. However, by lowering prices just slightly, a firm could gain the whole market, so both firms are tempted to lower prices as much as they can. It would be irrational to price below marginal cost, because the firm would make a loss. Therefore, both firms will lower prices until they reach the MC limit.

== Implications ==
* Note that colluding to charge the monopoly price and supplying one half of the market each is the best that the firms could do in this set up. However not colluding and charging [[marginal cost]], which is the non-cooperative outcome is the only Nash equilibrium of this model.

* If one firm has lower average cost (a superior production technology), it will charge the highest price that is lower than the average cost of the other one (i.e. a price ''just'' below the lowest price the other firm can manage) and take all the business. This is known as [[limit price|&quot;limit pricing&quot;]]

== Bertrand competition versus Cournot competition==
*While reviewing Oligopoly theory, Bertrand found that the creator of Cournot Competition, Augustin Cournot, while comparing quantities between firms had come to an incorrect conclusion. Bertrand recalculated the Cournot model using prices instead of quantities and proved that the equilibrium price was simply the competitive price. 

*According to Cournot, each firm selects a quantity to produce for some time period, then the combined total output between the firms will then determine the market price. 

*According to Bertrand's method, each firm selects a price as each firm's goal is to maximize their profits, given the price it believes its competitor, the other firm, will produce.

* Bertrand predicts a duopoly is enough to push prices down to marginal cost level; a duopoly will result in an outcome exactly equivalent to what prevails under perfect competition.

* Neither model is necessarily &quot;better.&quot; The accuracy of the predictions of each model will vary from industry to industry, depending on the closeness of each model to the industry situation.

* If capacity and output can be easily changed, Bertrand is generally a better model of duopoly competition. Or, if output and capacity are difficult to adjust, then Cournot is generally a better model.

* Under some conditions the Cournot model can be recast as a two stage model, where in the first stage firms choose capacities, and in the second they compete in Bertrand fashion.

== Critical analysis of the Bertrand model ==
* The classic Bertrand model assumes firms compete purely on price, ignoring non-price competition. Firms can differentiate their products and charge a higher price. For example, would someone travel twice as far to save 1% on the price of their vegetables? The Bertrand model can be extended to include product or location differentiation but then the main result - that price is driven down to marginal cost - no longer holds.

* The model ignores capacity constraints. If a single firm does not have the capacity to supply the whole market then the &quot;price equals marginal cost&quot; result may not hold.

* The classical model only focuses on the pure strategy Nash equilibrium. There are mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium with positive economic profits (see Kaplan &amp; Wettstein, 2000, and Baye &amp; Morgan, 1999).

* The classical model ignores search cost of consumers. If the consumer does not know the price of the product before visiting a firm and each visit is costly (however small), then a Nash equilibrium price will not arise. This creates the possibility that firms will randomly price at some point between marginal cost and the monopoly price.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Commitment devices seek to align short-term behavior with consciously desirable long-term goals. Often times the short-term costs associated with an action do not properly reflect its marginal effect on long-term costs. Employing commitment devices increases the short-term cost of perceived bad behavior to stay on track to achieve long-term goals. The most explicit way to do this is to draw up a contract where an individual promises to act positively in the short-term (in pursuit of a long-term goal) or else be forced to pay a predetermined amount to another party. 

Notes from A Dual Self Model of Impulse Control by Drew Fudenberg and David K. Levine
* People do not view time consistently. When given the choice between a greater quantity tomorrow and a lesser quantity today, many people will choose the lesser quantity. When given the same quantities, but in a year and a year and a day, almost everyone chooses the larger quantity. 
* There are not multiple selves which compete for dominance, but a single self with two subsystems - one preoccupied with maximizing short-run utility and the other with long run utility.
* The short run self is indifferent to the decisions of the long run self.
* “The idea of self-control is paradoxical unless it is assumed that the psyche contains more than one energy system, and that these energy systems have some degree of independence from each other.”  
(McIntosh [1969])

      <text xml:space="preserve">Typically for a good to be made and introduced into the market, a firm creates an intellectual property (IP), to go along with the good.  This is done so that the owners of that good have recognized rights under the law. By creating an IP, the creators can safeguard their profits from competitors who seek to simply copy the property. Traditional IP creation does require filing for patents and possibly trademarks. Filing for patents, defending your them, and ultimately maintaining an IP comes at the cost of time and money. &lt;ref name=utilitypatent&gt;http://www.uspto.gov/patents/process/index.jsp&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatives do exist for entities that want to innovate without resorting the traditional IP model however.  It is imperative to note that these alternatives still legally produce an IP and thus still have protection under copyright law; the key differences lie on the legal ownership of the IP and the types of rights  granted under copyright law. &lt;ref name=arstechnica&gt;http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2008/08/court-violating-copyleft-copyright-infringement.ars&lt;/ref&gt; Below are some alternatives to the traditional IP approach towards innovation.

== Open Source ==
Open source means a source is free to access and edit. However, it is not exactly the same as public domain. but they are not the same thing.The key difference is that open source has some restrictions on using and redistribution. Wikibooks is extremely proper example of open source. Wikibook has its policy on copyright, so it is a open source. Wikibooks offers a free media for users to discuss and share ideas easily and conveniently. People from very different places can communicate opinions, so innovation gets a bigger chance to occur. Another good example is open source software. Opens source software (OSS) is computer software that is available in source code form: the source code and certain other rights normally reserved for copyright holders are provided under an open-source license that permits users to study, change, improve and at times also to distribute the software.A report by the Standish Group states that adoption of open-source software models has resulted in savings of about $60 billion per year to consumers.&lt;ref&gt;^ Rothwell, Richard (2008-08-05). &quot;Creating wealth with free software&quot;.[http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/articles/creating_wealth_free_software]. Free Software Magazine. Retrieved 2012-04-25.&lt;/ref&gt; Today almost every organization has open source technology somewhere in their IT
environment, usually in the form of Linux. For example, &quot;most of the cloud infrastructure is based on the open source LAMP (Linux Apache MySQL PHP) stack&quot;&lt;ref name=opensource&gt;Yves de Montcheuil. Open source has become mainstream but still drives innovation. [http://www.zdnet.com/news/open-source-has-become-mainstream-but-still-drives-innovation/6361287]. Zdnet. Retrieved 2012-5-2&lt;/ref&gt;. &quot;It’s not only because open source technology works well in this context, but also because the open source licensing model makes it easier on cloud providers to scale their infrastructure&quot;&lt;ref name=opensource/&gt;. Linux is using the GNU GPL which is a form of copyleft. Copyleft requires all versions to be free, so Linux is still free though a programmer creates his own version of Linux.

== Academic ==
Some researchers care more credits than profits. Academic process is to promote innovation based on that point. Especially for students in high level education institutions, they particularly worry about their credits. Good credits not only help a master to graduate but also help him or her find a satisfying job or higher level education institutions. There is a new movement for &quot;open access academic journals&quot;. However, &quot;the idea that research should be freely available is easy to support in theory, but it is a transition that will require a shift in how research journals are financed&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Carolyn Y. Johnson. Harvard panel pushes benefits of free journals. [http://www.boston.com/yourtown/cambridge/articles/2012/04/28/harvard_pushes_back_against_academic_publishers_pricing_encourages_open_access/?page=2]. Retrived 2012-5-3&lt;/ref&gt;. Academic process is might one of the ways to help this movement. Researchers are more motivated by credits rather than profits. Nash Equilibrium Theorem is an example of an academic producing.&quot;Game theory, with the Nash equilibrium as its centerpiece, is becoming the most prominent unifying theory
of social science&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Charles A. H. and Alvin E. R. The Nash equilibrium: A perspective. [http://kuznets.harvard.edu/~aroth/papers/HoltRoth.nash_perspective.pdf]. Retrived 2012-5-3&lt;/ref&gt;. Nash also won 1994 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences for this great innovation.

Academic endeavors are covered under copyright law and treated like most IPs due to how most academic fields place a strong emphasis on authorship.  The manner in which this authorship is expressed varies between the academic fields however. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ams.org/profession/leaders/culture/culture&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9268280 &lt;/ref&gt; As the goal of academic endeavors is not mainly of a financial nature, as long as authorship is maintained there are typically no issues. In this vein, some universities have been pressuring for faculty to submit articles in open access journals. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.boston.com/yourtown/cambridge/articles/2012/04/28/harvard_pushes_back_against_academic_publishers_pricing_encourages_open_access/&lt;/ref&gt; Open access in this context means providing free, unrestricted access to peer reviewed academic journals. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/overview.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

== Artistic ==
Artistic incentives mean a person is working for love but is not for profit. Though some artists cannot make any money for their special type of arts, they never give up, because they love what they do. Those people are important for innovation. Every popular trend starts with an unknown thing. An information network example is Yahoo Answers which is a community for internet users. Some questions are solved without requirement of consulting professional people, so money is saved. Answers do not answer questions for money but for enjoying to help others.Moreover, another good example is nonprofit arts organizations. &quot;At present, there are more than 170,000 nonprofit arts organizations in the database&quot;&lt;ref&gt;DEBORAH A. KAPLE. Current Data Resources on Nonprofit Arts Organizations. [http://abs.sagepub.com/content/45/10/1592.full.pdf]. Princeton University. Retrived 2012-5-3&lt;/ref&gt;. The Santa Clara Vanguard is one of those organizations. &quot;The Santa Clara Vanguard has expanding outward from the drum and bugle corps activity to offer programs throughout the local community that support the arts and education while continuing to teach the fundamentals of excellence, tradition, and integrity that the Santa Clara Vanguard was founded with 45 years ago&quot;&lt;ref&gt;In the Community. [http://www.scvanguard.org/community/]. Retirved 2012-5-3&lt;/ref&gt;. Many significant artistic products disappeared if they are not supported by these non-profit art organizations. To improve employees' interest of their jobs is a good method to obtain innovation.   

Like the endeavors in academia, the driving force behind these projects has the main project goal be something other than financial gain.  For artistic endeavors, the main objective is art for art's sake.  An information network example is deviant art, a network where individuals are encouraged to post their artwork. &lt;ref&gt;http://about.deviantart.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prize incentives ==
Prizes are awards to be given to a person or a group of people to recognize and reward actions or achievements, which &quot;have been used throughout history as a means to foster innovation and solve problems&quot;&lt;ref name=insearch&gt;Josh Cleveland. &quot;In Search of Innovation: Prize Incentives for International Development&quot;.[http://www.nextbillion.net/blogpost.aspx?blogid=2122]. Nextbillion. Retrieved 2012-4-27.&lt;/ref&gt;. It is usually offered by wealth organization or government. An attractive prize can highly push people to work harder and better. If a prize is created to devote people to be innovative, then people are encouraged to create useful new things. Nobel Prize is a good example of prize incentives to encourage people to invent innovation. To earn Nobel Prize is almost a dream for every writer. A writer is somehow encouraged to be creative.  The classic example dates back to 1714, when the British government offered a prize for discovery of a method for determining longitude. &quot;Today, prizes have become an increasingly common tool, with recent examples including the Netflix Prize ($1 million for an algorithm predicting movie preferences)and Ashoka's Changemakers competition (grants for new development programs)&quot;&lt;ref name=insearch/&gt;

There are a wide variety of examples for prize incentives acting as the driving force for innovation within information goods.  The independent games festival encourages innovation in indie video games with its different type awards.  While a game may for example come up with innovative ways to utilize audio in video games for example. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.igf.com/02finalists.html&lt;/ref&gt;  It should be noted that the creators of the indie games still retain their IP, and thus could still go the traditional IP route even if the initial motivation was to win the award.  For a pure award incentive, the Open Source Awards promote projects that do not follow the traditional IP approach to innovation. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.packtpub.com/open-source-awards-home&lt;/ref&gt;

== Patronage ==
Patronage is the support, encouragement, privilege, or financial aid that an organization or individual bestows to another.  Royal writers and royal painters are good examples that artists are encouraged to innovate by patronage. They are supported by royal wealthy family.  &quot;The great artists of the Italian Renaissance were accountable to wealthy entities who became their patrons or gave them commissions&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Neal Stephenson. The lack of respect. [http://interviews.slashdot.org/story/04/10/20/1518217/neal-stephenson-responds-with-wit-and-humor]. Slashdot. Retrieved 2012-5-3&lt;/ref&gt;. Many North Korean painters are supported by governments. They do not paint for money but for their countries. Basically, most of their paintings advertise their governments' positive image. Thus, artists who are supported by patronage are somehow restricted to their products. Nowadays, patronage is less common than it was. Henry writes that &quot;the word ' patron ' in the present day has somewhat grown into contempt, because in former times it was too much the custom for pedantic dabblers in art to attempt to bring themselves into prominence with the public by pretending to foster the talent of students, or, by attracting them into their own exclusive circle, to shine with a borrowed light at a small outlay&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Henry C. Lunn. Patronage. [http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdfplus/3353557.pdf?acceptTC=true]. Musical Times. Retrvived 2012-5-4&lt;/ref&gt; .However, some new forms of patronage are invented as the development of internet continues. Kickstarter is a website which helps people find patronage. Patronage which is Non-IP approaches to innovation is still important. Neal indicates that &quot;the publishing industry still works for some lucky novelists who find a way to establish a connection with a readership sufficiently large to put bread on their tables, but this is not true for a great many other writers who are every bit as talented and worthy of finding readers&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Neal Stephenson. The lack of respect. [http://interviews.slashdot.org/story/04/10/20/1518217/neal-stephenson-responds-with-wit-and-humor]. Slashdot. Retrieved 2012-5-3&lt;/ref&gt;. Patronage becomes a helpful alternative for those unlucky talented artists. 

Whereas an IP-approach normally produces a mass market product which caters to all, products from a patronage approach typically cater only to the individuals that purchase them.  A form of patronage which still exists is that of an entity commissioning an artist online.  Commissioning an artist online may involve going to an art network like Deviantart or going to an individual's website. &lt;ref&gt;http://takusi.deviantart.com/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://flashygoodness.com/about/&lt;/ref&gt; Comicartcommissions.com is a network that pairs artists looking for commissions with entity's looking to commission. &lt;ref&gt;http://comicartcommissions.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Kickstarter ==
Kickstarter is a website that matches projects in search of funding with individuals who might be interested in providing those funds.  Essentially somebody makes their pitch on an idea they would like funding for on kickstarter and if the idea is popular it will receive money to “kickstart” that idea. A variety of project are represented in Kickstarter with examples being  card games and films. Basically Kickstarter is a funding platform. Moreover, &quot;on Kickstarter, book proposals have attracted from as much as $85,000 (for a memoir about psychedelic visionary Terence McKenna, to be written by his younger brother) to as a little as $324 (to commission original cover art for a self-published e-book)&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Laura Miller. [http://www.salon.com/2011/10/05/your_favorite_author_brought_to_you_by_a_wealthy_patron/singleton/]. 4 October, 2011. Retrieved on 24 April 2012. &lt;/ref&gt; Since more and more eBooks are available, some writers won’t be able to earn money by sales of their books. Though writers could obtain a lot by sales of books before, some of them have to choose this kind of form to support their life

In order to incentivize funding, rewards are given depending on how much money is given.  However, if the funding goal is not met no one gets charged and the project gets no money from kickstarter.  The funding goals share many similarities with provision point mechanisms. A provision point mechanism, also known as threshold payoffs or assurance contracts,  is a situation where a specific amount of money is announced to all the potential beneficiaries of the public good as the minimum amount needed to provide the good. &lt;ref&gt;Bagnoli, Mark and Lipman, Bart. 1989. Provision of public goods: Fully implementing the core through private contributions. Review of Economic Studies. 56, 583-601.&lt;/ref&gt; By combining a patronage like approach where many people fund a  project before it is complete and a provision point mechanism in the form of a funding goal; Kickstarter is able to mitigate some of the risks of producing innovative niche ideas and generally greatly rewards innovative ideas with mass appeal. 

Kickstarter is a sponsored closed network (the projects are monitored to make sure that not just any idea goes through).  Kickstarter is also a two sided platform; the two sides here are the people who fund the projects, and the people who need funding.   There are also definite network externalities on both sides of the network.  According to the Kickstarter staff, there are many people who browse Kickstarter in search of projects to fund, it would make sense that more projects being provided would give these browsers more variety to choose from.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kickstarter.com/help/faq/creating%20a%20project&lt;/ref&gt;  In a similar vein, if more individuals browse kickstarter to fund projects the more funds will be available to project makers.

==Copylefts==
In addition to copyrights, there are copylefts. Copyleft is a general method for making a program (or other work) free, and requiring all modified and extended versions of the program to be free as well (http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/). The simplest way to make a program free software is to put it in the public domain, uncopyrighted. This allows people to share the program and their improvements, which is especially useful in the software creation process, where anybody can add to a new program, which strengthens the overall network, giving the consumers high demand side economies of scale, because as more people add to the software, the better it becomes.

&quot;The first form of CopyLeft licensing is called the GNU General Public License (GPL)&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Brian Hu. CopyLeft. [http://e107copyleft.blogspot.com/p/examples-of-copyleft.html]. Retrvived by 2012-5-4&lt;/ref&gt;. It is originally used by Linux, and used by many softwares such as Mozilla, Java and so on. Sourceforge is a famous website that offers copyleft software. &quot;The second form of CopyLeft Licensing is the Creative Commons ShareALike License&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Brian Hu. CopyLeft. [http://e107copyleft.blogspot.com/p/examples-of-copyleft.html]. Retrvived by 2012-5-4&lt;/ref&gt;. This form is more common in art community.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Social networking is a phenomenon not relating to computers specifically, but made entirely possible by the likes of them.  A social network is a way to stay connected to other people from anywhere in the world at all times over the internet.  Social networking platforms vary by your preference of communication.  Some of the more popular social networking platforms include Twitter, which requires the messages its users broadcast to their networks to be under a certain(small) character limit; Myspace, which has adapted a more music-entwined approach to capture a certain demographic; Facebook, the successor of Myspace as the most popular and massive network; and internet monolith Google's G+ platform(a Facebook competitor focusing on dividing your network into specific groups).  All of the major networks are accessible from various sources such as a smartphone, a computer, even some TV's.

In addition to that Social Networking Sites are used to communicating with existing friends or making new friends, it also allows you to post photos, videos, music and other contents for friends. Furthermore, chatting with friends who are online is also possible through Social Networking Sites. On the other hand, today Social Networking Sites are even used as business marketing tool, by the help of which businesses, political candidates, emerging musicians, and other professionals or professional organizations make their presence online. Even, Social Networking Sites are designed for business networking which can in fact help to develop a business. LinkedIn is one of the Social Networking Sites used to for recruiting employees, finding new jobs, and building professional networks and other business related activities. Hence, today whole world is joining these Social Networking Sites with the help of which they can stay connected to friends or relatives residing in any corner of the world. Among all the Social Networking Sites Facebook has highest number of users today.

== Security risks associated with social networking ==
[[File:Facebook.svg|thumb|Facebook]]

Nowadays, nearly everyone has access to an ever-popular Facebook or Twitter account. Social networking makes it easy to post personal information to the web. Whether it be as little as posting a family picture or as much as posting a home address, any and all information must be posted with caution. One of the most simply (yet tricky for some) is to simply avoid adding too many personal details about yourself on the web.

Here are a few thoughtful links of security risks on social networks:

==Internet Edge Introduction==

What is Internet edge? Internet edge is considered a edge of a network and look at the electronic components with what we are using including computers, personal digital assistants (PDAs), cellphones, smartphones, tablets, and other devices that we use in our daily lives. The computers and other electronic devices that connect to the Internet are often known as end systems because they are situated at the edge of the Internet.

The end-to-end principle is a classic design principle of computer networking that states that application-specific functions ought to reside in the end hosts of a network rather than in intermediary nodes, provided they can be implemented &quot;completely and correctly&quot; in the end hosts. First explicitly articulated in a 1981 conference paper by Saltzer, Reed, and Clark, it has inspired and informed many subsequent debates on the proper distribution of functions in the Internet and communication networks more generally.

The Internet's end systems include desktop computers (e.g.,desktop personal computers(PCs), Macs, and Linux boxes), servers (e.g., Web and email servers), and mobile computers (e.g., portable computers, PDAs, and phones with wireless Internet connections).  With the accelerating rate at which technology is advancing today, gaming consoles (such as PlayStation 2/3 and XBOX360) as well as digital cameras are all connected to the Internet as end systems.  They allow users to interact directly with the Internet to send and receive data. Other end systems are not accessed directly by users, but do facilitate Internet communications. This includes servers for data such as email and web pages. Users connect with such end systems through their own computers, which contact the server to access and transfer information. The end user always interacts with the end systems. The Internet’s end systems include some computers with which the end user does not interact.

End systems are also referred to as hosts as they host application programs such as a Web browser programs. Hosts or end systems usually are further categorized into two groups: clients and servers. Clients tend to be desktop and mobile PCs, PDAs, and so on, whereas servers tend to be more powerful machines that store and distribute Web pages, stream videos, replay emails, and so on.


==Advantages of intelligent at the edge==
Nowadays, to have a better throughput performance, intelligence at the network's edge is needed. There are several advantages to show the importance of intelligence at the network’s edge.

Wireless controller is now becoming the bottleneck for throughput and security enforcement as throughput needs rise. By using the 11n access points, distributed intelligence allows more of the on-site data flow to be routed internally on the edge of the network without sending that data to the wireless controller and back. The ability of the &quot;spokes&quot; to communicate directly with one another along an optimal path increases, even prioritizing more critical data while providing full security and mobility services.

Furthermore, remote troubleshooting and advanced self-healing are greatly facilitated by the access points that distribute intelligence throughout the network. During outages, access points can also serve a bridging function to reduce latencies. Since security is as important to the organization as solid network coverage and availability, it is important to make sure that any distributed architecture has enough application awareness to be self-healing without dropping VoIP calls. It's also important to be able to deliver the same firewall capabilities as hub-and-spoke to avoid compromising quality of service (QoS). This helps maintain network services throughout outages, ensuring the organization and its assets continue to benefit from continued local QoS prioritization, authentication, security policies and direct routing as well as backhaul failover to 3G.

With distributed traffic management, a single controller can oversee up to eight times the number of access points. This frees up controllers to focus on large scale network and policy management as well as other services, resulting in a more efficient architecture. Access points with built-in sensors for security and troubleshooting can also eliminate extra installation and power costs that would come with a separate sensor network.

Furthermore, access edge switches are tasked with providing intelligence at the edges of your network. The modular design of these switches enables network administrators to first classify traffic, and then decide what action to take with that classified traffic. Traffic can be classified based on criteria such as: source/destination port, source/destination MAC address, Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN) ID, protocol, IP source/destination address, IP source/destination network, Type of Service (ToS)/Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP), TCP/UDP source/destination port, or TCP flags.

Classifiers can also be associated with a QoS policy to allow per-port or per-flow traffic shaping. This lets classified traffic be shaped in 64 kbps increments based on individual users or applications. This is especially popular in university housing scenarios, where traffic shaping on a per-port basis allows differentiated service and/or better control of bandwidth requirements at the edge of the network.

Moreover, greater intelligence at the edge of the network can also make IT budgets go further, offering advantages in both capital and operational expenditures. Adding 802.11n access points to the network can be less expensive than adding more controllers, and can actually result in significant savings since access points with greater intelligence can reduce the number of controllers needed.

In short, the advantages of having intelligence at network edge is obviously important and greatly providing better throughput to user and clients without compromising security or quality of service and driving up cost.




==Shared Access==

Access network referred to the physical links that connect an end system to the first router (edge router). Local telco referred to the local wired telephone infrastructure provided by a local telephone provider such as Telekom Malaysia and Digi Service Center in Malaysia. Central Office (CO) is a building where the telco switch located and each residence or customer will link to its nearest telco switch. 

'''Dial-up'''

Dial-up Internet access is set up when the PC is attached to a dial-up modem, which is in turn attached to the home’s analog phone line. Users dial an ISP’s phone number and make a traditional phone connection with the Internet Service Provider (ISP) modem. Dial-up internet access has two major drawbacks. It is very slow with a maximum rate of 56kbps. User can only choose either surf the Web or receive and make an ordinary phone call over the phone line at the same instant time. 

'''DSL'''

Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) internet access is obtained from the wired local phone access (i.e., the local telco). A telephone call and an Internet connection can share the DSL link at the same time because the single DSL link is separated into 3 channels (high-speed downstream, medium-speed upstream, ordinary two-way telephone). DSL has two major advantages over dial-up internet access. It can transmit and receive data at much higher rates. Besides that, users can simultaneously talk on the phone and access the Internet.

'''Cable'''

Cable Internet access makes use the cable television company’s existing cable television infrastructure. It is known as hybrid fiber-coaxial (HFC) access network because both fiber and coaxial cable are used in this system. Cable internet access is a shared broadcast medium. Therefore the transmission rate will be lower when there are several users download a video file simultaneously. 

'''FTTH/FTTP'''

Some local telcos provide high-speed Internet access over optical fibers which are known as Fiber-To-The-Home (FTTH)or Fiber-To-The-Premise (FTTP). Direct fiber is the simplest optical distribution network for one optical fiber link from the CO to each home so that user receives high bandwidth. Actually, each fiber leaving the central office is shared by many homes and it is split into individual customer-specific fibers when the fiber gets relatively close to the homes. 

'''Ethernet'''

Ethernet is a local area network (LAN) used to connect an end system to the edge router in corporate and university campuses. 

'''Wide-area wireless access'''

Wide-area wireless access networks enable users to roam internet on the beach, on a bus, or in your car. For such wide-area access, a base station is used over the cellular phone infrastructure within a few tens of kilometers. 

'''WiFi'''

WiFi is a wireless LAN access based on IEEE 802.11 technology which installed at everywhere such as universities, business office, cafés, airports, homes and even in airplanes. Wireless users must be within a few tens of meters of an access point that in turn is connected to the wired Internet. 

'''WiMAX'''

WiMAX, also known as IEEE 802.16, operates independently of the cellular network and provides speeds of 5 to 10 Mbps or higher over distances of tens of kilometers.




==Last mile evolution and problems==
The 'last mile' refers to the final connection, reaching the user, which enables the user to actually connect their computer to the Internet. In the year 1989, the first commercial dial-up ISP, “The World” started their business in United States; at the time, the only means of internet access for the general public was dial-up, by telephone line. In the early 2000s, this was followed by ADSL internet connections, which allowed the users to surf the internet at a higher speed. FTTH is the latest internet connection service provided by local ISP to their network. What are the differences between dial-up connection, ADSL connection, FTTH and others type of internet connection currently available?

'''Wired connections'''

'''Dial-up'''

From the word “Dialup”, users know they need to dial a number to make an internet connection to the outside world. Modern dial-up modems normally transfer at 56Kbps unless the ISP use compression techniques to exceed 56Kbps speed limit. During the dial-up process, we can hear an &quot;handshake&quot; noise.The noise takes place to established connection and information exchange with the local remote server. Several problems occur in dial-up connection; phone line during dial-up connection for voice service would be disturbed; only a computer can connect to the internet by using dial-up connection per phone line; it has low speed internet connection compared to the new ADSL connection.


'''ADSL'''

Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL) is a type of Digital Subscriber Line technology (DSL). The term “Asymmetric” in ADSL connection means the upload band and download band is unequal bandwidth. Normally ISP will allocate more bandwidth for the download band rather than the upload band because the clients usually browse web pages, download files, read email etc, which require the server to send data to their clients. ADSL or DSL has a connection speed ranging from 256Kbps to 20Mbps. ADSL also use the same infrastructure as dial-up connection. The unused bandwidth in the twin-pair copper wire phone line can be used simultaneously for transmission of data (internet) and voice or fax services at the same line. There are few problems associated with ADSL connection. Firstly, not every phone line is equipped for ADSL service and it maybe not be available for some rural areas. Secondly, it requires static IP address to send or receive data. This is the main problem that causes the run out of IPv4 address and the static IPs have high internet security risk. Finally, the ADSL has been replaced by optical fiber connection to counter the limitation of the ADSL bandwidth.


'''FTTH'''

Fiber to the Home (FTTH)has become popular in the city area in which it provide high speed internet access, IPTV and phone call services. Some ISP companies in Hong Kong, US and South Korea provide 1Gbps Internet connection to their network. FTTH connections are using optical fiber to replace the usual metal local loop used for the last mile telecommunications. FTTH lets their users experience same upload and download bandwidths. This means the FTTH internet connection is good for certain network applications especially P2P type file sharing. Until now, optical fiber connection still is the fastest internet connection between point-to-points. Unless scientists discover a new technology that can defeat the speed of the light.


'''Wireless connections'''

'''3G &amp; Wimax 4G'''

3rd generation mobile telecommunication (3G) is a mobile telecommunication services that fulfill the International Mobile Telecommunication-2000 (IMT-2000) standard. 3G and 4G Wimax are the evolution of 2G GSM network. Below are few examples of 2G networks until 4G networks:

'''2G'''- Fully digital 2G networks replaced 1G (analog) in the 1980s.

'''2.5G'''- known as General Packet Radio Service (GPRS),used for data transfer. Data transfer speeds up to 114Kbps

'''2.75G'''- known as Enhanced Data GSM Environment (EDGE), used for data transfer such as pictures sharing or browse internet. Data transfer speeds up to 384Kbps.

'''3G''' – speeds up to 2Mbps for stationary or walking users and 384kbps in moving vehicle. Provide better security than 2G network. Used for mobile TV, Videoconferencing and Video on demand.

'''3.5G''' – known as High Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA), evolution for mobile telephone data transmission. Speed up to 7.2Mbps.

'''4G''' – known as Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (Wimax). Offers speeds of up to 75Mbps, but in reality the speed needs to be split among the users. 

The biggest problem that occurs in the wireless channel is that the bandwidth needs to be shared among the users, leading to competition for bandwidth as a scarce resource. More simultaneous users lead to smaller shares of the bandwidth pie for all, and thus poorer service. Local ISPs usually attempt to contain the problem with fair usage policies; these set (and thereby cap) a quota of data usage for each user. Such measures are unpopular, and some ISPs are trying to provide (and advertise) solutions without such capping.

==Conclusion/Summary of Internet Edge==


Internet edge is considered as an edge of a network. Desktop computers, servers, and mobile computers are included as the Internet’s end systems because they are at the edge of a network. End systems run (host) application programs such as Web browser program, therefore they are also referred to as hosts. Hosts are divided into two categories which are clients and servers. The client-server model of Internet application is a distributed application because client program running on one end system (one computer) and server program running on another end system (another computer). Client components initiate requests for services, which provided by server components to one or many clients.


There are several advantages of intelligence at network’s edge. By using the 11n access points, the ability of on-site data flow is increased and prioritizing more critical data while providing full security and mobility services. Moreover, the access points also greatly facilitate remote troubleshooting and advanced self-healing. During outages, it can also serve a bridging function to reduce latencies. Furthermore, access edge switches are designed to enable network administrators to classify traffic first, and then decide what action to take with that classified traffic. Classified traffic is shaped in 64 kbps increments based on individual users or applications. This traffic shaping on a per-port basis allows differentiated service and/or better control of bandwidth requirements at the edge of the network. Additionally, it is less expensive by adding 802.11n access points to the network than adding more controllers and access points with greater intelligence can reduce the number of controllers needed. In short, intelligence at network edge is greatly providing better throughput to user and clients without compromising security or quality of service and driving up cost.


Access network referred to the physical links that connect an end system to the first router (edge router). Local telco referred to the local wired telephone infrastructure provided by a local telephone provider. Central Office (CO) is a building where the telco switch located and each residence or customer will link to its nearest telco switch. There are some ways to share the access network such as dial-up which is using the phone line to connect network, DSL which obtained from the wired local phone access, cable which is using both fiber and coaxial cable, FTTH which is provided high-speed internet access over optical distribution and Ethernet which is LAN used to connect an end system to the edge router. Besides that, other ways also enable to access the network like WiFi which is a wireless LAN access based on IEEE 802.11 technology, Wide-area wireless access networks which is enable users to roam internet in outdoor and WiMAX which operates independently of the cellular network in higher speed or distances.


In dialup connection, phone line for voice service can be disturbed; only one computer can connect to the internet by using per phone line; the internet connection speed is low compared to ADSL connection. For ADSL connection, not every phone line is equipped for ADSL service, it maybe not available for some rural area and it required static IP address to send or receive data. While users experience same upload and download bandwidths with FTTH. It is the fastest internet connection between point-to-point using optical fiber. Problem for wireless channel is the bandwidth need to be shared among the users. The speed is low when more users use the network at the same time.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Virtual Private Networks ===

A VPN is a secure pathway through a public network that is used to allow private access to an institutions network.  Many businessmen and women use this type of network to communicate with their company network securely using the internet. This communication is usually encrypted for the case that it ends up in the wrong hands. A VPN may be used to share data and give access to databases and printers.

[[File:VPN remote.jpg|thumb|VPN]]

VPN is a point-to-point connection across a private or public network, such as Internet. A VPN client uses tunneling protocols (special TCP/IP-based protocols) to make a virtual call to a virtual port on a VPN server.  Typically, a client initiates a virtual point-to-point connection to a remote access server over the Internet. The remote access server answers the call, authenticates the caller and transfers data between the VPN client and the organization’s private network. VPN protects any communication that is carried out over a public network such as the internet. They can also provide several types of data protection including: confidentiality, integrity, data origin authentication, replay protection, and access control.

Data shared across a VPN is encapsulated or wrapped with a header. The header contains routing information that enables the data to travel through the shared or public network to reach its destination. To emulate a private link, the data is encrypted for confidentiality. Packets that are intercepted on the shared or public network are indecipherable without the encryption keys.

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Keyboard input =

* glutKeyboardFunc
* glutSpecialFunc
* glutSpecialUpFunc
* glutGetModifiers() == GLUT_ACTIVE_SHIFT or GLUT_ACTIVE_CTRL or GLUT_ACTIVE_ALT

Beware: GLUT's special() callback is called repetitively when the press is hold down.

= Coordinates system =

There are several ways to position the (X,Y,Z) axis triplet.
[[File:Rechte-hand-regel.jpg|thumb|The right hand rule]]
* Z-is-up : used in Blender, this means (X,Y) is the ground, and Z is the altitude
* Y-is-up : used in OpenGL, this means (X,Y) is like a wall, so Y is the altitude, and Z is going closer/farther to that wall
* right-handed / left-hand : OpenGL and Blender use a right-handed coordinates system, which means you can represent it using your right hand, with X on the thumb, Y on the index, and Z on the middle finger. A left-handed coordinates system, as used by DirectX, can be represented similarly using the left hand.

Using the Blender Z-is-up coordinates system in OpenGL can be tempting, but introduces issues:
* .obj files are usually in Y-is-up, requiring changes when loading them (or when exporting them from Blender)
* the camera is in Y-is-up, so if you use a Z-is-up coordinates system, by default the camera is at (0,0,0) ''and'' it faces the ''bottom''.  This is quite confusing when rotating the camera, because, for instance, if your camera is looking on the horizon towards the Y axis, and you rotate on the Z axis to look left or right, you'll actually rotate the view on the Y axis (barrel roll).  When transforming the camera, you'd have to imagine that you shoot the video from your feet.
* other engines such as Irrlicht and Ogre also use Y-is-up
Consequently we'll stick with Y-is-up in this book.

= Positioning the camera =

There's no built-in concept of camera in OpenGL.  We have to somewhat cheat to implement it.

Our technique is the following: instead of thinking how to move our camera in a fixed world, we're thinking how to move the entire world around our camera.

For instance, moving the camera for 3 units on the X axis is the same as moving the whole world for -3 units on the X axis.  Same for all other axis and for rotations.

Keep this in mind when working with the camera.  The end-result will feel completely intuitive, but whenever you work with the camera, if you forget that we've been cheating in the first place, you'll get the wrong transformations.

= Camera control =

We'll start with an intuitive implementation:
* left/right rotates on the camera Y axis
* up/down moves forwards/backwards
* page_up/page_down rotates on the camera X axis
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
/* code here */
&lt;/source&gt;

To go forwards/backwards, we use &lt;code&gt;glm::translate&lt;/code&gt;.  There are two forms:
* &lt;code&gt;glm::translate(transformation_matrix, glm::vec3(dx, dy, dz))&lt;/code&gt;: applying &lt;code&gt;transformation_matrix&lt;/code&gt;, then move in (dx,dy,dz) expressed in the new coordinates system
* &lt;code&gt;glm::translate(glm::mat4(1), glm::vec3(dx, dy, dz)) * transformation_matrix&lt;/code&gt;: applying &lt;code&gt;transformation_matrix&lt;/code&gt;, then move in (dx,dy,dz) expressed in the coordinates system as it was before the translation
* in the case of a camera translation, don't forget that we cheat and move the whole world, not the camera; consequently the above meaning is reversed for the world2camera matrix.

For instance, if your existing &lt;code&gt;transformation_matrix&lt;/code&gt; rotates your camera 90° to the right, and then translate along Z:
* with the first form you will translate the camera's new left (along world's Z axis),
* while with the second form your will translate the camera forwards (along world's X axis).

-----

This implementation has usability issues: when rotating the camera left/right while it's bent, we're not used to rotate our entire body on this bended axis.  Instead, we're used to rotate just our head on the world straight Y axis. So we need to translate the world Y axis to the camera's local coordinates:
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
      glm::vec3 y_axis_world = glm::mat3(transforms[MODE_CAMERA]) * glm::vec3(0.0, 1.0, 0.0);
      transforms[MODE_CAMERA] = glm::rotate(glm::mat4(1.0), -delta_rotY, y_axis_world) * transforms[MODE_CAMERA];
&lt;/source&gt;

Last, let's implementing strafing:
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
/* code here */
&lt;/source&gt;

We analyze the object:
* Minimum coordinates in X, Y and Z
* Maximum coordinates in X, Y and Z
* We compute the size necessary for the object: &lt;code&gt;max-min&lt;/code&gt; in X, Y and Z
* We compute the center of the object: &lt;code&gt;(min+max)/2&lt;/code&gt; in X, Y and Z

We compute of cube around the object:
* We prepare a cube of size 1 (1x1x1), centered on the origin
* We scale it by the size of the object
* We center it on the object

To draw the cube:
* We draw the front face using 1 looping line
* We draw the back face using 1 looping line
* We draw 4 orthogonal lines to join both faces

= Intersection with surfaces =

As seen in [[../Scientific_OpenGL_Tutorial_05|Scientific tutorial 05]], you can improve situations where lines and surfaces are mixing, by using:
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
/* main */
    glEnable(GL_POLYGON_OFFSET_FILL);
    glPolygonOffset(1, 0);
&lt;/source&gt;

Keep &lt;code&gt;GL_POLYGON_OFFSET_FILL&lt;/code&gt; enabled even after you draw the lines, it needs to be enabled when drawing the surfaces as well.

[[File:OpenGL Tutorial Bounding box.png|thumb|Bounding box for a sphere]]
You can also increase the line thickness if need be:
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
    glLineWidth(2);
&lt;/source&gt;

'''''Risotto''''' is an Italian rice dish, most popular in the north of Italy. Historically, ''risotto'' is the name given to all recipes that use rice as the main component and are served as first dish in a traditional Italian lunch or dinner as usually pasta also is. This recipe is one of the many variations on the risotto base with seafood ingredients.

{{wikipedia|Risotto}}

==Ingredients==

* 400 grams (14 ounces) ''risotto'' [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]] (plump, medium grain rice that contains a lot of starch, the types Arborio, Carnaroli or Vialone Nano are traditionally best)
* 1 [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]]
* 2 cloves of [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]]
* 1 glass of dry white [[Cookbook:Wine|wine]]
* 300 g of [[Cookbook:Squid|squid]] tubes
* 300 g of peeled [[Cookbook:Prawn|king prawns]]
* 200 g of [[Cookbook:Scallop|scallops]]
* [[Cookbook:Parsley|parsley]]
* 25 grams (1 ounce) [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] 
* about a liter of fish [[Cookbook:Stock|stock]]/[[Cookbook:Broth|broth]]
* [[Cookbook:Vinegar|balsamic vinegar]]
* [[Cookbook:Oregano|oregano]]
* salt and pepper

==Preparation==

# Cut the squids into stripes or rings. In a bowl marinade the squids, the prawns and the scallops with some oil, balsamic vinegar, oregano, salt and pepper. Let it marinade for half hour in the fridge while you are cooking the rice..  
# Bring the fish stock to simmering point without letting the stock boil. The surface of the stock should just be moving a little. 
# Finely chop the onion and the garlic.
# In a large thick pot heat a thin layer of olive oil and let the onion sweat very gently as for a ''[[Cookbook:Soffritto|soffritto]]''.
# Add the rice and cook until it has a transparent look for not more than 2 minutes. Add some salt and pepper and the wine.
# As the wine cooks away you will see the remaining liquid getting thicker as it is absorbing the starch from the rice. When it is more or less gone, add some hot stock. Do not add too much stock all at once. The rice should never be submerged in stock. Keep stirring it and keep adding more stock as it cooks away. This should take about 15 to 20 minutes.
# Taste during the cooking to see if the rice is done. The rice should be soft, but have enough bite to it to feel the individual grains of rice. 
# Five minutes before the end of the cooking time for the risotto add the marinated rings of the squids, the scallops and the prawns. Finely chop the parsley and add before tuning off the heat.
# When it's done, stir in the butter in small chunks at the time, taste to get the amount of butter right. Season with more salt and pepper to taste. 
# Let it rest for a few minutes, and then serve.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This article is for slightly more advanced ASM programmers than the rest of this website.

By default, the SNES is limited to 16kB of sprite patterns, which is the same as:
512 8x8 sprites
128 16x16 sprites
32 32x32 sprites
8 64x64 sprites

As you can see, animated sprites can eat away the available memory pretty quickly.  This is where DMA comes in.  The only problem is DMA isn't all that fast.  You only have time to DMA up to 6kB during v-blank, and even less if you take into account scrolling and OAM updating.  For the purpose of this article, let's stick to 4kB.

How do we prevent DMAing over 4kB, regardless of what we throw at the screen?  We need to make the system know when to stop, and continue the DMA loading into the next frame.  How?  My solution is to divide the v-ram into 1kB slots.  I chose 1kB, because 1kB happens to be a row of 8 16x16 sprites.

&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
!apple = &quot;$0000&quot;
!banana = &quot;$0001&quot;
!table = &quot;$0080&quot;
!update_flag = &quot;$0100&quot;
!vram = &quot;$0101&quot;
!source = &quot;$0102&quot;
;================================================================
macro change_vram(source, vram)
php
rep #$20
sep #$10
lda &lt;source&gt;
ldy &lt;vram&gt;
jsr change_slot
plp
endmacro
;================================================================
change_slot:
cmp !table,y
beq redundant_vram_load

ldy #$04                          ;; to name another temporary register
lda #$80
sta $2115
lda #$01
sta $4300
lda #$18
sta $4301
vram_loop:
lda !update_flag,x

lda !apple
sec
sbc !banana
cmp #$10
bcc lag
jmp end_of_game_code
lag:
plp
rts
&lt;/source&gt;

All you have to do is jump to the &quot;update_vram_slot&quot; subroutine during vblank, and use the &quot;change_vram&quot; macro whenever you need to update an animation slot.

For example if you want update slot $0400 in vram from address $98a300 use this macro:

&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
%change_vram(#$98a3,#$04)
&lt;/source&gt;

This code isn't limited to just sprite animation, it also can be used for background animation and scrolling.

'''Barter''' is a type of [[w:trade|trade]] that doesn't use any [[w:medium of exchange|medium of exchange]], in which goods or [[w:service|service]]s are exchanged for other goods and/or services. It can be bilateral or multilateral as [[w:trade|trade]]. 

Barter and money have different means of balancing an economic exchange. Barter is used in societies where no monetary system exists. When there is one, it is also used, especially in economies suffering from a very unstable [[w:currency|currency]] (as when [[w:hyperinflation|hyperinflation]] hits).

== Transaction issues ==
Barter is possible when [[w:coincidence of wants|coincidence of wants]] of economic actors enables an exchange cycle between their bids. Before any transaction can be undertaken, each party must be able to supply something another party desires.  

– Some communities develop a system of intermediaries who can store, trade, and warehouse commodities, but who may suffer economic risk. 

– Others develop a system with a virtual value unit (&quot;barter dollars,&quot; for example) to measure and balance exchanges, very similar to a monetary system.

– Multilateral barter is more complex to settle but allows trades that would not be possible with bilateral barter. This complexity can be reduced by ''openbarter'' software.

– On the west coast of the United States the [http://www.geocities.com/theskillspool/index.html Beyond Barter] organization extends the concept to a system based on free sharing of services. Although there's no attempt to balance contributions in individual transactions, controls ensure that members are not overburdened.

== History of barter ==

To organize production and to distribute goods and services among their populations, many pre-[[w:capitalist|capitalist]] or pre-market economies relied on [[w:tradition|tradition]], top-down [[w:command|command]], or community [[w:democracy|democracy]] instead of market exchange organised using barter. Relations of [[w:reciprocity|reciprocity]] and/or [[w:redistribution|redistribution]] substituted for market exchange. Trade and barter were primarily reserved for trade between communities or countries. It is also used when the [[w:monetary system|monetary system]] failed to measure the economic value of goods.

Barter becomes more and more difficult as people become dispossessed of the means of production of widely-needed goods. For example, if money were to be severely devalued in the United States, most people would have little of value to trade for food (since the farmer can only use so many cars, etc.)

It is used on important transactions between firms or countries to exchange economic values, when monetary constraints are too expensive for the economic actors. 

A well-known example of multilateral trade is the [[w:triangular trade|triangular trade]]. 

Money used to be considered as simpler for small trades; but use of the Web has changed that perception, especially in respect to Swapping.

== In finance ==
In [[finance]], the word &quot;barter&quot; is used when [[w:corporation|corporation]]s trade with each other using non-money or &quot;near-money&quot; financial assets, such as U.S. [[w:Treasury bill|Treasury bill]]s.

== Swapping ==
Swapping is the increasingly prevalent informal bartering system in which participants in [[w:Internet communities|Internet communities]] trade items of comparable value on a trust basis.

While swapping is an excellent way to find and obtain items that are inexpensive, it relies upon honesty. A dishonest participant might arrange a swap, and then never complete their end of the transaction, thus getting something for nothing. This practice is called ''swaplifting'', a [[w:pun|pun]] on ''[[w:shoplifting|shoplifting]]''. The victim's recourse is often limited to [[w:shunning|shunning]] the swaplifter, or taking him to [[w:small claims court|small claims court]].

== Misuses of the word &quot;barter&quot; ==
As of 2007, it is popular (especially on UK daytime television) to use the word &quot;barter&quot; in place of &quot;haggle&quot;. ''To Buy Or Not To Buy'' uses the word in one of their catchphrases: &quot;Will you barter or scarper?&quot; It is commonly understood that the guests on the show will be paying solely with money and not, for example, offering them part exchange on their A reg Ford Cortina.</text>

==Introduction==

Zune (Aros MUI replacement) has a few features of MUI3.8 but many things have still to be done, compatibility checked and bug(s) fixed. 

Test all that native mui apps on os4/mos, and it will be the best test case for zune-mui3.8 compatibility. Like for example by Ibrowse, WookieChat, SabreMsn, Amirc and Lunapaint to trap inconsistencies. 



===MUI3.8===

Tabs don't work, the string acknowledge notification doesn't work, and the gui wants to resize by itself for no reason i.e. when entering text into the chat window, etc.. and refreshes itself continually for no reason? Or so it seems? .. 

Zune still doesn't support custom application screens. All the needed parts (PSI and muiscreen library) are already in place, now it's only a matter of connecting them. 

cause crashes - most notable are objects embedded in balance groups. 

NList classes don't appear to get minmax'ed so items get drawn at the original &quot;size&quot; still 
Some Zune classes call MUIA_ShowMe inside show method (maybe they shouldn't) which triggers a recalcdisplay method in window class. Which first hides objects. Does re-asking minmax, relayout, and show objects again. Here's one of the problem. show show &quot;recursion&quot;, etc, etc.

Trouble with boopsi gadget based classes (like prop) which then create boopsi gadget twice, ...

[http://sourceforge.net/projects/htmlview-mcc/ HTMLview MCC] is made portable and should be ported to AROS. 



===MUI4===

MUI4 was really extended or improved in many ways, but for applications like OWB, mainly dtpic.mui with alpha support, groups/tabs able to use groups as titles, list class much improved and adding proper methods for display/construction/destruction/whatever instead of hooks. There were also many improvements in family handling and much more.

===Issues===

There are some annoying stuff with MUI. Get() for instance, some values will not get() e.g. BOOL, WORD or strings unless you get the Exact correct data types right. Took days to work out why the values I set in GUI never matched up in what I saved.

Also, why are some useful macros in MUI are now obsolete?
Slider(x,y,z) is easy to use than MUI_MakeObject() or SliderObject() ... So I stuck with the obsolete stuff.
How do I stop the Zune SliderObject from displaying the current level as a number inside the slider? Setting MUIA_Slider_Quiet to TRUE when creating it doesn't seem to have any effect.
I've worked around this problem for now by subclassing MUIC_Prop and creating a Slider-like API on top of it.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">=&lt;center&gt;Attorney-Client&lt;/center&gt;=
=== Intent ===
Control the granularity of access to the implementation details of a class
=== Motivation ===
A &lt;code&gt;friend&lt;/code&gt; declaration in C++ gives complete access to the internals of a class. Friend declarations are, therefore, frowned upon because they break carefully crafted encapsulations. Friendship feature of C++ does not provide any way to selectively grant access to a subset of private members of a class. Friendship in C++ is an all-or-nothing proposition. For instance, the following class &lt;code&gt;Foo&lt;/code&gt; declares class &lt;code&gt;Bar&lt;/code&gt; its friend. Class &lt;code&gt;Bar&lt;/code&gt; therefore has access to '''all''' the private members  of class &lt;code&gt;Foo&lt;/code&gt;. This may not be desirable because it increases coupling. Class &lt;code&gt;Bar&lt;/code&gt; cannot be distributed without class &lt;code&gt;Foo&lt;/code&gt;. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
class Foo 
{
private:
  void A(int a);
  void B(float b);
  void C(double c);
  friend class Bar;
};

class Bar {
// This class needs access to Foo::A and Foo::B only.
// C++ friendship rules, however, give access to all the private members of Foo.
};
&lt;/source&gt;

Providing selective access to a subset of members is desirable because the remaining (private) members can change interface if needed. It helps reduce coupling between classes. Attorney-Client idiom allows a class to precisely control the amount of access they give to their friends.

=== Solution and Sample Code ===
Attorney-client idiom works by adding a level of indirection. A ''client'' class that wants to control access to its internal details, appoints an ''attorney'' and makes it a friend --- a C++ friend! The &lt;code&gt;Attorney&lt;/code&gt; class is crafted carefully to serve as a proxy to the &lt;code&gt;Client&lt;/code&gt;. Unlike a typical proxy class, &lt;code&gt;Attorney&lt;/code&gt; class replicates only a subset of &lt;code&gt;Client&lt;/code&gt;’s private interface. For instance, consider class &lt;code&gt;Foo&lt;/code&gt; wants to control access to its implementation details. For better clarity we rename it as &lt;code&gt;Client&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;Client&lt;/code&gt; wants its &lt;code&gt;Attorney&lt;/code&gt; to provide access to &lt;code&gt;Client::A&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Client::B&lt;/code&gt; only.

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
class Client 
{
private:
  void A(int a);
  void B(float b);
  void C(double c);
  friend class Attorney;
};

class Attorney {
private:
  static void callA(Client &amp; c, int a) {
    c.A(a);
  } 
  static void callB(Client &amp; c, float b) {
    c.B(b);
  }
  friend class Bar;
};

class Bar {
// Bar now has access to only Client::A and Client::B through the Attorney.
};
&lt;/source&gt;

The &lt;code&gt;Attorney&lt;/code&gt; class restricts access to a cohesive set of functions. The &lt;code&gt;Attorney&lt;/code&gt; class has all inline static member functions, each taking a reference to an instance of the &lt;code&gt;Client&lt;/code&gt; and forwarding the function calls to it. Some things are idiomatic about the &lt;code&gt;Attorney&lt;/code&gt; class. Its implementation is entirely private, which prevents other unexpected classes gaining access to the internal of &lt;code&gt;Client&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;Attorney&lt;/code&gt; class determines which other classes, member functions, or free functions get access to it. It declares them as &lt;code&gt;friend&lt;code&gt; to allow access to its implementation and eventually the &lt;code&gt;Client&lt;/code&gt;. Without the &lt;code&gt;Attorney&lt;/code&gt; class, &lt;code&gt;Client&lt;/code&gt; class would have declared the same set of friends giving them unrestrained access to the internals of &lt;code&gt;Client&lt;/code&gt;. 

It is possible to have multiple attorney classes providing access to different sets of implementation details of the client. For instance, class &lt;code&gt;AttorneyC&lt;code&gt; may provide access to the &lt;code&gt;Client::C&lt;/code&gt; member function only. An interesting case emerges where an attorney class serves as a mediator for several different classes and provides cohesive access to their implementation details. Such a design is conceivable in case of inheritance hierarchies because friendship in C++ is not inheritable, but private virtual function overrides in derived classes can be called if base's private virtual functions are accessible. In the following example, the Attorney-Client idiom is applied to class &lt;code&gt;Base&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; function. The &lt;code&gt;Derived::Func&lt;/code&gt; function gets called via polymorphism. To access the implementation details of &lt;code&gt;Derived&lt;/code&gt; class, however, the same idiom may be applied.

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;cstdio&gt;

class Base {
private:
  virtual void Func(int x) = 0;
  friend class Attorney;
public:
  virtual ~Base() {}
};

class Derived : public Base {
private:
  virtual void Func(int x)  {
    printf(&quot;Derived::Func\n&quot;); // This is called even though main is not a friend of Derived.
  }

public:
  ~Derived() {}
};

class Attorney {
private:
  static void callFunc(Base &amp; b, int x) {
    return b.Func(x);
  }
  friend int main (void);
};

int main(void) {
  Derived d;
  Attorney::callFunc(d, 10);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

=Structure=
'''Alphabet''' &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;  is a set consisting of two symbols so it is called binary alphabet:

&lt;math&gt; X =  	\left \{ 0,1 \right \} &lt;/math&gt;


'''Word''' c is a sequence of symbols ( string). It can be dsiplayed in two ways : &lt;ref&gt;[[w:Endianness|wikipedia : Endianness]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* a little-endian (least-significant-bit-first) : &lt;math&gt;c = c_0c_1 ..c_{n-1} &lt;/math&gt;
* a big-endian : &lt;math&gt;c = c_{n-1} ..c_1c_0 &lt;/math&gt;

When :
* &lt;math&gt;c_0&lt;/math&gt; is on the right side it is easier to treat it as a binary number
* &lt;math&gt;c_0&lt;/math&gt; is on the leftt side it is easier for machine 


'''Space of words''' &lt;math&gt;X ^ \omega&lt;/math&gt; denote the set of all infinite strings over the alphabet.

&lt;math&gt;X ^ \omega = \left \{ 0,1 \right \} ^ \omega &lt;/math&gt;


The strings (&lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;, 0, 1, 00, 01, 10, 11, 000, etc.) would all be in this space.  

&lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; represents the empty string

==Action==
[[Image:Least significant bit.svg|thumb|280px|right|The binary representation of decimal 149, with the lsb highlighted. The msb in an 8-bit binary number represents a value of 128 decimal. The lsb represents a value of 1.]]
Here is only one '''transformation ( action )'''  a  ona a input word c :

&lt;math&gt;c = c_0w&lt;/math&gt; 

where :
* &lt;math&gt;c_0\,&lt;/math&gt; is a lsb&lt;ref&gt;[[w:Least significant bit|wikipedia : Least significant bit]]&lt;/ref&gt; , first symbol ( here at the beginnig, but for binary notationit will be at the end of sequence)
* &lt;math&gt; w \,&lt;/math&gt; is a rest of the word c


Transformation is defined by 2 recursion formulae : 
* if the first symbol &lt;math&gt; c_0\,&lt;/math&gt; is zero then we change it to one and the rest of the word remains unchanged
* if it is one :
** we change it to zero 
** carry 1 to next column.&lt;ref&gt;[[w:Binary_numeral_system|Wikipedis : carry at Binary_numeral_system]]&lt;/ref&gt;
** aply action to the next column (symbol) until last column 

Formally:
:&lt;math&gt;
(c)^a = 
\begin{cases}

 ( 0w )^a = 1w \\
( 1w )^a = 0w^a 
\end{cases}

&lt;/math&gt;

or in other notation :

:&lt;math&gt; a( 0w ) = 1w \,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; a( 1w ) = 0a(w) \,&lt;/math&gt;

&quot;This transformation is known as the adding machine, or odometer, since it describes the process of adding one to a binary integer.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.math.tamu.edu/~nekrash/Preprints/img.pdf ITERATED MONODROMY GROUPS by VOLODYMYR NEKRASHEVYCH]&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;(c)^a = c + 1 \,&lt;/math&gt;


More explicitly :&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.math.uconn.edu/~teplyaev/research/NT.pdf%20 Groups and analysis on fractals Volodymyr Nekrashevych and Alexander Teplyaev]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt; a(x_1 x_2 . . . x_n ) = y_1 y_2 . . . y_n \,&lt;/math&gt;

if and only if

&lt;math&gt; ( x_1 + 2*x_2 + 4*x_3 + ...  + x_n*2^{n-1} ) + 1 = y_1 + y_2*2 + y_3*4 +... + y_n*2^{n-1} (mod 2^n )&lt;/math&gt;

Both '''input and output''' are binary numbers least-significant bit first. 



===Examples===

Word c is a sequence of n symbols ( from 0 to n-1) representing binary integer : 
:&lt;math&gt;c = c_{n-1} ..c_1c_0 = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} c_i 2^i &lt;/math&gt;


where &lt;math&gt;c_n&lt;/math&gt; is an element of binary alphabet X ={0,1}

without carry because lsb &lt;math&gt; c_0 = 0 &lt;/math&gt;: 
   0 
 + 1 
 ---
   1

Here lsb &lt;math&gt; c_0 = 1 &lt;/math&gt; then c_0+1&gt;1 so one has to carry 1 to next column

   1 
 + 1  
 ---
  10 


   10 
 + 01
 -----
   11
 
Carry in second column ( from right to left)

==Nucleus==
The nucleus of group G is :&lt;ref&gt;[http://arxiv.org/abs/1011.1817 | FROM SELF-SIMILAR STRUCTURES TO SELF-SIMILAR GROUPS DANIEL J. KELLEHER, BENJAMIN A. STEINHURST, AND CHUEN-MING M. WONG]&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\xi = \sum{ c_i 2^i |i \le 0}&lt;/math&gt;



which translates to the n-ary addition
:&lt;math&gt;\xi = \xi + 1 \,&lt;/math&gt;

'''Labels''' shows pairs of symbols : input/output

There are 2 '''vertices''' ( nodes, states of machine) : 1 and 0.

Vertices correspond to the states . 

&quot;The states of this machine will represent the value that is &quot;carried&quot; to the next bit position. 

Initially 1 is &quot;carried&quot;. 

The carry is &quot;propagated&quot; as long as the input bits are 1. 

When an input bit of 0 is encountered, the carry is &quot;absorbed&quot; and 1 is output. 

After that point, the input is just replicated.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.hmc.edu/~keller/ Robert M. Keller :  Finite-State Machines]&lt;/ref&gt;

I suspect a float precision issue causing the Matrix to get NaN values, similar to the one that made me clamp angle:

== Which data to apply in the Pythagore Theorem in order to compute z ? And is the ball centered around origin assumption has been made ? ==

It is said in this article to apply Pythagore theorem in order to compute z value :

&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle b \;=\; \sqrt{c^2 \,-\, a^2}. \,&lt;/math&gt;

I easily understand that c stands for z value, but what values must be applied to c and a in the Pythagore formula ?

I would also need to know if the assumption that the ball is centered around OpenGL origin has been made.

Thanks in advance

: Hi,
: In the formula, a is the click position along X in the Projection, b is the z coordinate, and c is the ball's radius.
: The ball is &quot;pressed&quot; on the screen, and its radius is 1, so its center is located at (0,0,-1) is View space (not sure what you call OpenGL origin).
: Does that make more sense? :) [[User:Beuc|Beuc]] ([[User talk:Beuc|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Beuc|contribs]]) 13:21, 9 October 2011 (UTC)

::Hi
::Thank you, now I've well understood for the formula.
::In fact, for the ball origin, it is possible to have the Ball centered at the origin if you set the camera location away from the origin (with GLU gluLookAt()), that's why I asked you that question.
::Thank you very much

''removed comment about ctrl+right because using ctrl+right breaks the use of uniforms in shaders (appears to be a bug in blender))''
: I don't have this issue - and ctrl+right is only about the display layout, not about features. That sounds quite strange. Did you report it to Blender?

:: Could you test the last code example on [[GLSL_Programming/Blender/Shading_in_View_Space]]? I have a student who wasn't able to make it work on Linux when using ctrl+right, i.e. the object stays black whatever uniform value is set. I tested it on Windows and it showed the same problem (if I use ctrl+right). The diplay layout should have no effect on features; thus, I'm rather sure that it is a bug. Unfortunately, I didn't have time to report the bug yet.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I found the definition of the image function hard to follow. Would it be correct to write the second half of it as follows? (in symbols of course): &quot;for S which is a subset of A, the function returns g(x) &lt;u&gt;which is a subset of B&lt;/u&gt;, such that every x is a member of S&quot; (addition underlined). This would make clear that g(x) refers to a set of values returned by g(-), not to the function g(-) itself. Of course we already said that the image function maps from subsets of A to subsets of B, but this small redundancy would help those of us who are not math pros. (Don't know if you've ruled out illustrations, but the picture in the Wikipedia article on Image (mathematics) immediately made clear what is meant.)

      <text xml:space="preserve">=&lt;center&gt;Address Of&lt;/center&gt;=
=== Intent ===
Find address of an object of a class that has an overloaded unary ampersand (&amp;) operator.

=== Also Known As ===

=== Motivation ===
C++ allows overloading of unary ampersand (&amp;) operator for class types. The return type of such an operator need not be the actual address of the object. Intentions of such a class are highly debatable but the language allows it nevertheless. Address-of idiom is way to find the real address of an object irrespective of the overloaded unary ampersand operator and its access protection. 

In the example below, &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; function fails to compile because &lt;code&gt;operator &amp;&lt;/code&gt; of &lt;code&gt;nonaddressable&lt;/code&gt; class is private. Even if it were accessible, a conversion from its return type &lt;code&gt;double&lt;/code&gt; to a pointer would not have been possible or meaningful.

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
class nonaddressable 
{
public:
    typedef double useless_type;
private:
    useless_type operator&amp;() const;
};

int main()
{
  nonaddressable na;
  nonaddressable * naptr = &amp;na; // Compiler error here.
}
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Solution and Sample Code ===
The Address-of idiom retrieves the address of an object using a series of casts.

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
template &lt;class T&gt;
T * addressof(T &amp; v)
{
  return reinterpret_cast&lt;T *&gt;(&amp; const_cast&lt;char&amp;&gt;(reinterpret_cast&lt;const volatile char &amp;&gt;(v)));
}
int main()
{
  nonaddressable na;
  nonaddressable * naptr = addressof(na); // No more compiler error.
}
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Known Uses ===
* [http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_47_0/libs/utility/utility.htm#addressof Boost addressof utility]
This function is already in the &lt;memory&gt; header of the new C++ standard C++11.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I was raised in Kinston, NC, where this recipe is &lt;u&gt;not&lt;/u&gt; considered real Eastern NC pork bbq sauce. King's Restaurant in Kinston and Wilber's Restaurant in Goldsboro, NC, offer what many consider the very best pork bbq anywhere. Both have sauces that are true Eastern NC sauces. Scott's BBQ Sauce, made in Goldsboro, is another excellent sauce. None of these sauces have any sugar, honey, molasses, or anything else as a sweetener. Each is a variation on the cider vinegar, salt, pepper, and spices theme. King's and Wilber's use a little water in their sauces, Scott's does not. 

It is also incorrect (ridiculous, even) to state that a whole hog must be cooked for it to be considered Eastern NC bbq. You can bbq pork without planning to feed 100 people. A butt, ham, or shoulder will feed smaller numbers, and can be just as tasty as cooking the whole hog. Cook it slowly over indirect heat with plenty of hardwood smoke, basting often with the sauce and occasionally with some bacon grease or drippings from the meat.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=&lt;center&gt;Computational Constructor&lt;/center&gt;=

=== Intent ===
* Optimize return-by-value 
* Allow Return Value Optimization (RVO) on compilers that cannot handle Named Return Value Optimization (NRVO)

=== Also Known As ===

=== Motivation ===

Returning large C++ objects by value is expensive in C++. When a locally created object is returned by-value from a function, a temporary object is created on the stack. The temporaries are often very short-lived because they are either assigned to other objects or passed to other functions. Temporary objects generally go out-of-scope and hence destroyed after the statement that created them is executed completely. 

Over the years compilers have evolved to apply several optimizations to avoid creation of temporaries because it is often wasteful and hampers performance. Return Value Optimization (RVO) and Named Return Value Optimization (NRVO) are two popular compiler techniques that try to optimize away the temporaries (a.k.a. copy elision). A brief explanation of RVO is in order.

'''Return Value Optimization'''

The following example demonstrates a scenario where the implementation may eliminate one or both of the copies being made, even if the copy constructor has a visible side effect (printing text). The first copy that may be eliminated is the one where &lt;code&gt;Data(c)&lt;/code&gt; is copied into the function &lt;code&gt;func&lt;/code&gt;'s return value. The second copy that may be eliminated is the copy of the temporary object returned by &lt;code&gt;func&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;d1&lt;/code&gt;. More on RVO is available on [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_value_optimization Wikipedia]

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
struct Data {
  Data(char c = 0) 
  { 
    std::fill(bytes, bytes + 16, c); 
  }
  Data(const Data &amp; d) 
  { 
    std::copy(d.bytes, d.bytes+16, this-&gt;bytes);
    std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;A copy was made.\n&quot;; 
  }
private:
  char bytes[16];
};

Data func(char c) {
  return Data(c);
}

int main(void) {
   Data d1 = func(‘A’);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Following pseudo-code shows how both the copies of &lt;code&gt;Data&lt;/code&gt; can be eliminated. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
void func(Data * target, char c) 
{  
  new (target) Data (c);  // placement-new syntax (no dynamic allocation here)
  return;                 // Note void return type.
}
int main (void)
{
   char bytes[sizeof(Data)];                   // uninitialized stack-space to hold a Data object
   func(reinterpret_cast&lt;Data *&gt;(bytes), 'A'); // Both the copies of Data elided
   reinterpret_cast&lt;Data *&gt;(bytes)-&gt;~Data();   // destructor
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Named Return Value Optimization (NRVO) is a more advanced cousin of RVO and not all compilers support it.  Note that function &lt;code&gt;func&lt;/code&gt; above did not name the local object it created. Often functions are more complicated than that. They create local objects, manipulate its state, and return the updated object. Eliminating the local object in such cases requires NRVO. Consider the following somewhat contrived example to emphasize the ''computational'' part of this idiom.

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
class File {
private: 
  std::string str_;
public:
  File() {}
  void path(const std::string &amp; path) { 
    str_ = path;  
  }
  void name(const std::string &amp; name)  {
    str_ += &quot;/&quot;;
    str_ += name;
  }
  void ext(const std::string &amp; ext) {
    str_ += &quot;.&quot;;
    str_ += ext;
  }
};

File getfile(void) {
  File f;
  f.path(&quot;/lib&quot;);
  f.name(&quot;libc&quot;);
  f.ext(&quot;so&quot;);
  f.ext(&quot;6&quot;);

  // RVO is not applicable here because object has a name = f
  // NRVO is possible but its support is not universal.
  return f; 
}

int main (void) {
  File  f = getfile(); 
}
&lt;/source&gt;

In the above example, function &lt;code&gt;getfile&lt;/code&gt; does a lot of ''computation'' on object &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; before returning it. The 
implementation cannot use RVO because the object has a name (&quot;f&quot;). NRVO is possible but its support is not universal. Computational constructor idiom is a way to achieve return value optimization even in such cases.

=== Solution and Sample Code ===

To exploit RVO, the idea behind computational constructor idiom is to put the computation in a constructor so that the compiler is more likely to perform the optimization. A new four parameter constructor has been added just to enable RVO, which is a ''computational constructor'' for class &lt;code&gt;File&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;getfile&lt;/code&gt; function is now much more simple than before and the compiler will likely apply RVO here.

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
class File 
{
private: 
  std::string str_;
public:
  File() {}
  
  // The following constructor is a computational constructor
  File(const std::string &amp; path, 
       const std::string &amp; name,
       const std::string &amp; ext1,
       const std::string &amp; ext2) 
    : str_(path + &quot;/&quot; + name + &quot;.&quot; + ext1 + &quot;.&quot; + ext2) { }

  void path(const std::string &amp; path);
  void name(const std::string &amp; name);
  void ext(const std::string &amp; ext);
};

File getfile(void) {
  return File(&quot;/lib&quot;, &quot;libc&quot;, &quot;so&quot;, &quot;6&quot;); // RVO is now applicable 
}

int main (void) {
  File  f = getfile(); 
}
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Consequences ===

A common criticism against the computational constructor idiom is that it leads to ''unnatural'' constructors, which is partly true for the class &lt;code&gt;File&lt;/code&gt; shown above. If the idiom is applied judiciously, it can limit the proliferation of ''computational'' constructors in a class and yet provide better run-time performance.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Circular Motion==,br&gt;
[[File:Circular motion vectors.svg|thumbnail|right|&amp;theta; = angular displacement&lt;br&gt;r = radius/position vector&lt;br&gt;P = position of the object along the path&lt;br&gt;v = linear velocity&lt;br&gt;&amp;Omega; = angular velocity along axis of rotation&lt;br&gt;a = centripetal acceleration]]

Circular Motion is a motion of an object along a circular path. If the speed of the body remains constant throughout the motion, the object is said to perform a uniform circular motion. 
For an object in uniform circular motion along a circular path of radius R and &lt;math&gt;\vec{r}&lt;/math&gt; be the position vector of the object with the center of the path as the and &lt;math&gt;\hat{r}&lt;/math&gt; being the unit vector along it and T be the time taken to traverse the path once (period), the total linear distance covered in one period is (the circumference of the circle)
: &lt;math&gt;s = 2 \pi R&lt;/math&gt;

The speed (or linear velocity) is then given by
: &lt;math&gt;v = \frac{s}{T} =  \frac{2 \pi R}{T} = 2 \pi fR\qquad\qquad\ldots\left(f=\frac{1}{T}\,=\textrm{frequency}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

The linear velocity is a vector quantity whose direction at any given instance is tangential to the circle at that point.
The angular velocity around the circle is
: &lt;math&gt;\vec{\omega} = \frac{\vec{r}\times\vec{v}}{\left|\vec{r}\right|^2}&lt;/math&gt;
Due to the vector product, the angular velocity vector is perpendicular to the plane of motion.

With circle of radius R = 1
: &lt;math&gt;\omega = 2 \pi f &lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==ElectroMagnet Introduction==
It's been observed that Current carrying conductor does exhibit a Magnet's characteristic

==ElectroMagnet==
The magnetic field of Earth and the planets is explained as ElectroMagnet by my own theory. The magnetic field of the Earth and the planets is generated by electric currents. But, all published theories to explain the magnetic field of a planet are wrong. There is no known theory able to explain the obvious connection with the rotation, including why the direction of rotation and field approximately match. The rotation of the planet is obviously the cause of the magnetic field. Popular theory not even explain the polarity of the field. Despite the lack of evidence, outlandish theories about the magnetic pole reversals are common. In fact, the polarity is clear from the rotation and can therefore cannot change. The correct explanation is actually surprisingly easy. The cause is simply the electric current generated directly by the rotation of the planets, and the charge separation of free ions by gravity. Positively charged ions  are usually heavier than negative charged ions and are therefore shifted to the rotation axis. We first consider only the negative charges, the electrons, of the Earth, neglecting the positive charges of the atomic nuclei. In 24 hours the total charge of the electrons crosses once through a cross section of the Earth. The mass of the Earth is at first approximation two times the mass of the protons, since there are about as many neutrons almost as heavy. Then the current caused by the rotation of the electrons around the axis of the Earth within 24 hours is easy to calculate. &lt;math&gt;
\left( 
\frac{ mass \, of \, Earth} {2 \times mass \, of \, proton} 
\right) \times \left( \frac{charge \, of \, electron}{24 h } \right)
= -3.3 \times {10} ^ {27} \, A
&lt;/math&gt; Since the Earth is electrically neutral overall, a current of exactly equal magnitude is produced by positive charges. The magnetic fields  generated by both currents cancel each other almost completely. But, since the positively charged ions, however, are slightly shifted by gravity towards Earth's axis, the remaining effect of the negative charges causes Earth's magnetic field.

It's been observed that 

# Any Coil conductor when conducts current does attract metal just like the Lodestone Magnet . Hencr the name [[ElectroMagnet]] . Current carrying conductor does exhibit the characteristic of a magnet
# When place a metal material in the turns of current conducting Coil of several turns the material become a magnet . Unlike ElectroMagnet, when the current is turn off or when the material is taken out of the coil's turns the material still retain its magnetic hence the name [[Permanent Magnet]]
: [[File:Electromagnetism.svg|200px]]

==ElectroMagnet Characteristics==
* Magnetic field
: The [[Magnetic field]] is made up of Magnetic field lines that travels from North Pole to South Pole that is from Positive terminal to the Negative terminal . When current is zero, ElectroMagnet does not attract metal or Magnetic field does not exist when there is no current flow . The Magetic Field Strength is the product of The Coil's Inductance and Current . 
: B = L I

* Magnetic Poles
: A magnet has two &quot;Poles&quot; namely [[North Pole]] and [[South Pole]] correspond to the Current Polarities .  North Pole correspond to Plus polarity . South Pole correspond to Minus polarity

      <text xml:space="preserve">==ElectroMagnet/Coil of several Turns==
When a coil of several turns is connected with Electric source, Magnetic Field exist and has the same form as Magnetic Field of Natural Magnet. Current conducting Coil of several turns generates Electromagnetic Field of expanding Elliptical lines. 
: [[File:VFPt cylindrical coil real.svg|200px]]

==ElectroMagnet's Characteristics==
===Magnetic Poles===
The polarities of the electric source form a Magnetic Poles . The Positive Terminal correspond to North Pole and Negative Terminal correspond to South Pole . 
===Magnetic Field===
Magnetic Field is made up from Expanding Magnetic Field Lines running from North Pole to South Pole . The Magnetic Field Strength is directly proportional to Current in the coil and the inductance of the coil and can be calculated by mathematical formula
: B = L I

Where
: I is Current measured in Ampere
: L is Inductance measured in Henri

===Magnetic Field Force===
The Magnetic Field Force is directly proportional to Magnetic Filed Strenght and the length of the Magnetic Field Line and can be calculated by mathematical formula
: F = B l

===Magnetic Voltage Induction ===
Magnetic Voltage Induction on a Coil
: &lt;math&gt;B = L I&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{dB}{dt} = L \frac{dI}{dt} +  I \frac{dL}{dt} = L \frac{dI}{dt} + 0 &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{dB}{dt} = L \frac{dI}{dt} &lt;/math&gt;

''Change of Magnetic Field strenght is proportional to Inductance of the coil and change in Current flow through the coil''


Magnetic Voltage Induction on a Coil's Turn
: &lt;math&gt;\phi = N B&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{d\phi}{dt} = N \frac{dB}{dt} +  B \frac{dN}{dt} = N \frac{d\phi}{dt} + 0 &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{d\phi}{dt} = N \frac{d\phi}{dt} &lt;/math&gt;
''Change of Magnetic Flux strenght is proportional to Inductance of the turns and change in Magnetic Flux through the coil''

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It computes arc tangent. It returns the principal value of the arc tangent of x, expressed in radians.
In trigonometrics, arc tangent is the inverse operation of tangent.
Note that because of sign ambiguity, function cannot determine in which quadrant the angle falls only by its tangent value. To determine quadrant, we can use [[Wikipedia:atan2|atan2]].
Return value of this function is principal arc tangent of x, in the interval [-pi/2,+pi/2] radians.


==Syntax==
&lt;source lang=c&gt;
#include &lt;math.h&gt;
double atan ( double x );
&lt;/source&gt;

Here, x is Floating point value.


==Example==

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;math.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

#define PI 3.14159265

int main(void)
{
  double param, result;
  param = 1.0;
  result = atan(param) * 180 / PI;
  printf(&quot;The arc tangent of %lf is %lf degrees\n&quot;, param, result );
  return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

==Output==
The arc tangent of 1.000000 is 45.000000 degrees.

== diffusion of innovation ==

Might not exactly belong in this section, but certainly something about diffusion of innovation belongs somewhere in this book. One place to consider starting: [[Communication_Theory/Diffusion_of_Innovations]]. [[User:TDang|TDang]] ([[User talk:TDang|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/TDang|contribs]]) 17:12, 12 October 2011 (UTC)

== TDang review April 2012 ==

I'm reviewing [https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikibooks/en/w/index.php?title=Strategy_for_Information_Markets/Non-IP_approaches_to_innovation&amp;diff=2313864&amp;oldid=2313861 this version]. I'll likely be more critical than complimentary, because (a) that's the way I am and (b) that's what will help improve things. Please don't take the criticism-over-compliments to mean I have a wholly negative view.

Make sure to check the [[Talk:Strategy_for_Information_Markets#review_thoughts_April_2012|all-purpose review thoughts]] as well.

* The ''theme'' of the introduction is good, but it needs to be thought out more carefully:
*# ''&quot;guarantee profits&quot;''--clearly it doesn't guarantee profits, for instance if the IP is terrible or there's a better substitute.
*# ''&quot;comes at a cost, and which may de-incentivize innovation given the additional costs&quot;''--this isn't clear. Maybe it can't be clear until ideas are more developed later, in which case it should be removed. Or maybe it just needs to be clarified?
* ''Open Source''
** Overall, this section needs to be thought about (maybe researched) more carefully.
** ''public source''--this doesn't mean anything that I'm aware of, perhaps you mean &quot;public domain&quot;?
** ''&quot;Open source owners still have the right to exclude someone to access or edit it.&quot;''--in many cases, that's not true, and it's certainly misleading. I think it's best to pull it out or explain better.
** Worth mentioning Copyleft-type licenses here, and maybe another major success like Linux or Apache.
* ''Academic''
** ''&quot;Nash Equilibrium Theorem is finished in Nash’s graduate report.&quot;'' This needs to be phrased differently, maybe &quot;As an example of an academic producing ...&quot;
** ''Wolfram Alpha''--I believe that's a for-profit and IP-protected project.
** Many/most academic papers are copyrighted currently. However, the profitability of the paper is usually not the primary concern of the author.
** This section very much needs references.
** This could be connected to a new movement for &quot;open access academic journals&quot; (http://www.boston.com/yourtown/cambridge/articles/2012/04/28/harvard_pushes_back_against_academic_publishers_pricing_encourages_open_access/)
* ''Artistic''
** Again, this section very much needs references.
** The internet was initially developed by the U.S. government, not artists.
** You'll need some reference talking about how manga artists do it not-for-the-meny (or use a different example with a reference)
** deviantart is a good example.
* ''Prize Incentives''--This is a good start. One thing to be careful of is that it may be mixing up things where there are '''both prizes and IP''', such as the Indie games competition, where there are prizes, but the creators still own the IP to their work. It's OK to have both of those things active at once, but it needs to be clear what's a &quot;pure&quot; non-IP example and what's mixed.
* ''Patronage''--Go [http://interviews.slashdot.org/story/04/10/20/1518217/neal-stephenson-responds-with-wit-and-humor read this], mainly the part starting at &quot;2) The lack of respect..&quot;. Normally, I wouldn't suggest using Slashdot as a reference, but in this case, it's referencing Neal Stephenson (a successful author) writing about the current way of publishing, and talking about Patronage.
** Otherwise, again, it needs references.
* ''Kickstarter / Provision point''
** ''&quot;this approach is a modern day version of patronage&quot;''--it works very differently from traditional patronage, though, where the creation of the work is supposed to glorify the patron as well as the creator. It's hard to argue that in a project crowdfunded by 15,000 people he work glorifies all 15,000.
** ''&quot;For instance, if more projects are introduced then there will be more variety for funders to choose from.&quot;''--You might be onto something, but it's not obvious.
** The point of provision point mechanisms is to counter the voluntary contribution / public goods problem. Describing this doesn't make sense without talking about it in those terms, and providing references.
* ''Diffusion of innovations''--This looks like a good start for something, but not this page. Can you move it to its own page?
* ''References''--The references currently there look good, but I've noted a lot of places above where references are needed.
* ''Public goods''--The nature of encouraging innovation is getting past the public goods problem. Intellectual property is one way to get past that problem. All the alternatives need to be considered in light of the same problem.
*# One possibility is something like a provision point mechanism which explicitly recognizes the public goods problem, but handles it a different way.
*# Other possibilities consider the public goods problem in different ways.
*# Patronage implies that a patron may get non-financial utility (prestige) out of funding creative works.
*# Creators may have non-financial motivations to create (art for the love of it, impressing people of romantic interest).
*# There may be financial motivations which aren't captured by IP. Open-source software is often developed by for-profit businesses just to help them run their business, or because they provide a complement to the software.
*# Academic, open-source, and many artistic communities are often described as having a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gift_economy#Information_gift_economies gift economy].

      <text xml:space="preserve">In this chapter, we use Newton's Laws to see that accelerations actually come from forces applied to an object.  In the chapters on one and two dimensional motion, &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; was simple a &quot;given&quot; quantity.  It simply existed in the equations of motion and you were allowed to give it any value.  In this chapter, we will see that accelerations come from '''forces'''.   Forces are pushes or pulls on objects that you witness everyday (push a door to open it, pull on your book to lift it, push a cell phone button to click it).  With the exception of gravity, forces are always &quot;contact forces&quot; meaning a force must actually touch an object to exert its influence on it. Forces also require an agent, meaning that you should always be able to identify what (the agent) is producing the force. Forces are also vectors, meaning their strength (push or pull) can be in any direction. The SI unit of force is aptly named the Newton, and is symbolized by &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;''N''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;.

== Newton's Laws ==
You probably know that Newton's Law says &lt;math&gt;F=ma&lt;/math&gt;, but this is not always the most useful equation to try and use in a physics course.  &lt;math&gt;a=\frac{F}{m}&lt;/math&gt; is better, but still isn't quite right. It is more correct to say that &lt;math&gt;a=\frac{\Sigma F}{m}&lt;/math&gt;, which still isn't fully correct.  The best version is  &lt;math&gt;{\vec a}=\frac{\Sigma {\vec F}}{m}&lt;/math&gt;, stressing the vector property of forces. Be sure you fully understand what this last version means and how to use it. &lt;math&gt;{\vec a}&lt;/math&gt; is the acceleration, &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the object's mass and &lt;math&gt;\Sigma{\vec F}&lt;/math&gt; is the sum of all forces acting on the object.

== Types of forces == 

We will only be concerned (in this chapter) with three forces: weight, tension, and normal.

=== Weight ===

Weight is &lt;math&gt;w=mg&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is an object's mass and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is the Earth's acceleration of gravity of &lt;math&gt;9.8&lt;/math&gt; m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The weight &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; of a body is equal to the magnitude &lt;math&gt;F_g&lt;/math&gt; of the gravitational force on the body. Do not confuse mass and weight; they are not the same thing and be sure you know the difference between them. Mass is also known as object's inertia, or resistance to want to change its current state of motion. A person who has mass 80 kg, has mass 80 kg on Earth, and on Jupiter. However, the person's '''weight''' on Jupiter is substantially greater due to the magnitude of the gravitational force on Jupiter.

=== Tension ===

If a cord is attached to an object, and then the cord is drawn taut, the force experienced by the object is called tension. The tension vector has the same direction as motion vector, meaning that tension is only experienced when an object is pulled, never when it is pushed.

=== Normal Force === 

Normal is the force an object feels when it is sitting on a surface, is always perpendicular to the surface, and is not always equal to &lt;math&gt;mg&lt;/math&gt;.

== The key point ==

The crux of this entire chapter is &lt;math&gt;\Sigma {\vec F}&lt;/math&gt;, because it requires three hard steps. The first, which most students have great difficulty with, is to identify all forces acting on an object. The second is to correctly draw these forces, each pointing in the proper direction, as they act on the object (even more difficult for most students). The third is to realize that &lt;math&gt;\Sigma{\vec F}&lt;/math&gt; which is only usable when you break it up into component form, or &lt;math&gt;\Sigma F_x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Sigma F_y&lt;/math&gt;.  Your working equations for this week are then &lt;math&gt;a_x=\Sigma F_x/m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a_y=\Sigma F_y/m&lt;/math&gt;.

== Connections with kinematics (an object's observed motion) ==

The connection points with the chapters on one and two dimensional motion are that these accelerations, which come from forces, are the same ''a'''s that go into the equations of motion for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, &lt;math&gt;x=x_0+v_0\Delta t+\Sigma F_x\Delta t^2/(2m)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v_x=v_{0x}+\Sigma F_x\Delta t/m&lt;/math&gt;. Be sure these make sense to you and do not casually read over the &lt;math&gt;\Sigma F_x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Sigma F_y&lt;/math&gt;. Know what they mean: Using Newton's law is a way of finding the acceleration on an object, and this really means that all forces acting on an object need to be broken up into their &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; components, properly signed (+ or -), then added together along a given axis to then find a&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; and a&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In the previous chapter, three forces were discussed: weight, tension and normal force. In this chapter we will discuss in detail friction, drag, and centripetal acceleration. All of these forces are commonly observed in motion, and there are several real world examples of them. For instance, a race car must be engineered so that it encounters minimal friction with the track, as well as minimal air drag as it races. However, the tires of the car must be designed so that some friction is encountered. If the tires were frictionless, the car would not be able to slow down when making a high-speed turn, and would end up crashing.

==Types of Forces==
In this chapter, we will focus on three other forces: friction, drag, and circular motion.

=== Friction ===

Friction is a force that always opposes all motion; it always acts in a direction exactly opposite to that in which an object is moving (or trying to move), and typically comes when the object rubs or drags against another object as it moves.  It is defined as &lt;math&gt;{\vec f}=\mu{\vec N}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the coefficient of friction, and &lt;math&gt;{\vec N}&lt;/math&gt; is the normal force acting on the object. There are two types of friction, static and kinetic, also known as sliding friction. Static friction is the amount of initial force required to move an object, and kinetic friction is the amount of force required to sustain motion in an object. Because of this, static friction is always greater than or equal to kinetic friction.

=== Drag ===

Drag is like friction in that it always acts in a direction opposite to that in which an object is moving, but comes from fluids such as air and water, through which an object might be moving. This relationship is documented in the equation &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;D-F_g={\vec F}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;, because the vectors representing drag and motion are in opposite directions. Since drag occurs in the presence of fluids, air resistance is a form of drag. Drag is related by the equation &lt;math&gt;D=\frac{1}{2}CpAv^2&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is the drag coefficient, &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is the effective surface area that encounters the resistance, &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is the fluid density, and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is the object's speed.

=== Circular Motion===

Imagine a person whirling a yo-yo around in circles. The yo-yo has a string of length 10 cm, and a constant speed. While the speed is constant, the velocity however, is not. This is because velocity has a direction, and in circular motion, the direction is always changing. An easy way to understand this is to think of a circle with several points on it. Using the points, draw tangent lines on the circle. These tangent lines represent the different velocities, all of which have varying directions, even though their speed may be the same. Remember that speed is the magnitude, or absolute value of velocity. A general equation gives the ''centripetal acceleration'' in terms of the velocity and the radius: &lt;math&gt;a = \frac{v^2}{R}&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Ground Mode ==
Ground mode is when the player is standing or walking on the ground.  In ground mode, the following routine is performed:

1) Check to see if jumping button is pressed

2) If so, jump to &quot;initiate_jump_mode&quot; routine

3) Check collision with the tiles below

4) If all tiles underneath player are empty, jump to &quot;initiate_fall_mode&quot; routine

=== Initiate Jump Mode ===
1) set &quot;y_velocity&quot; to &quot;take_off_velocity&quot;

2) set &quot;jump_mode&quot; flag

=== Initiate Fall Mode ===
1) set &quot;y_velocity&quot; to #0

2) set &quot;jump_mode&quot; flag

== Jump/Fall Mode ==
Jump/Fall mode is when the player jumps or falls.  In jump/fall mode, the following routine is performed:

1) increment &quot;y_velocity&quot; by #gravital_acceleration

2) add &quot;y_velocity&quot; to &quot;y_coordinate&quot;

3) if &quot;y_velocity&quot;&gt;0, then go to &quot;fall_mode&quot; routine

=== Fall Mode ===
1) checks for collision between player and tiles

2) If collision is detected, follow &quot;land_on_ground&quot; routine

==== Land on Ground ====
1) reset &quot;jump_mode&quot; flag

2) pop the sprite up to the top of the ground tile

This kebab is prepared by marinating the meat overnight, and grilling it on open fire. It is usually served with Polo(white rice) or Naan (bread).

==Ingredients==
* Olive oil
* 3 [[Cookbook:Onion|Onions]]
* [[Cookbook:Garlic|Garlic]]
* Half teaspoon saffron
* Salt
* Black pepper
* 1kg [[Cookbook:Lamb|Lamb]]

==Procedure==
The marinade is prepared by the mixture of half cup size olive oil, three onions, garlic, half teaspoon saffron, salt and black pepper. One kilogram of lamb is cut into 1 cm thick and 4–5 cm long pieces. It should be marinated overnight in refrigerator, and the container should be covered. The next day, the lamb is thread on long, thin metal skewers. It is brushed with marinade and is barbecued for 5–10 minutes on each side

This kebab calls for ground lamb or beef, adding black pepper, sumac, turmeric, very finely minced onion, and not too much salt. It should actually change the color of the meat, slightly yellow from the turmeric. Let it marinate in the fridge, covered, for at least four hours or overnight.

It is to be grilled like a burger. Served on Polo (White Rice) or Naan(Bread), accompanied by grilled tomatoes and onions cooked on the grill next to the kebab. Sumac is usually served as a tableside garnishing spice</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{C Programming/Navigation|Mixing languages|Code library}}

Since the C Programming-Language was not created with Object Oriented Programming in mind, it has no support for classes, inheritance, polymorphism and other OO Concepts. Neither does it have its own Virtual Table, which is found in object-oriented languages such [[C++ Programming|C++]], [[Java Programming|Java]] and [[C_Sharp_Programming|C#]]. Therefore, it is nearly impossible to use an object-oriented programming paradigm with only C's language features and standard library. Since C was never intended to be an OOP Language, lack of Object-Orientation cannot be called a weakness or a flaw in the programming language itself, but it does sometimes limit the use and functionality of the language.
In most cases, however, object-orientation and most OO Concepts can be achieved using third-party libraries. There are many third-party libraries designed to add support for object-oriented programming in C. The most general-purpose and widely used among these is the GObject System, which is part of Glib. The GObject System comes with its own virtual table. To create an object in C using the GObject system, it has to be sub-classed from the GObject struct. 

==Object-Creation==
In this example a new object will be implemented directly derived from GObject. For simplicity, the object is named ''MyObject''.

===Declaring An Object===

To create a simple &lt;u&gt;object&lt;/u&gt;, two structs must be declared. The ''instance'' and the ''class''. They are usually declared in this manner:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;

/* in myobject.h */
typedef struct _MyObject MyObject;
typedef struct _MyObjectClass MyObjectClass;

struct _MyObject
{
  GObject parent_instance;

  /* instance members */
};

struct _MyObjectClass
{
  GObjectClass parent_class;

  /* class members */
};

&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

===Boiler-Plate Code===

Since the GObject System is just a third-party library and therefore cannot make any changes to the C Language itself, creating a new object 
requires a lot of boiler-plate code. 

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;

/* in myobject.h */
#define MY_TYPE_OBJECT                   (my_object_get_type ())
#define MY_OBJECT(obj)                   (G_TYPE_CHECK_INSTANCE_CAST ((obj), MY_TYPE_OBJECT, MyObject))
#define MY_IS_OBJECT(obj)                (G_TYPE_CHECK_INSTANCE_TYPE ((obj), MY_TYPE_OBJECT))
#define MY_OBJECT_CLASS(_class)          (G_TYPE_CHECK_CLASS_CAST ((_class), MY_TYPE_OBJECT, MyObjectClass))
#define MY_IS_OBJECT_CLASS(_class)       (G_TYPE_CHECK_CLASS_TYPE ((_class), MY_TYPE_OBJECT))
#define MY_OBJECT_GET_CLASS(obj)         (G_TYPE_INSTANCE_GET_CLASS ((obj), MY_TYPE_OBJECT, MyObjectClass))      

&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;


===Defining The Object===

Before use, the newly created object must be &lt;u&gt;defined&lt;/u&gt;.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;

/* in myobject.c */

G_DEFINE_TYPE(MyObject, my_object, G_TYPE_OBJECT);

&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

===Static Functions===

There are a few &lt;u&gt;static&lt;/u&gt; functions that may or may not to be defined, depending on your object. For a minimal object these ones are compulsory:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;

/* in myobject.c */
static void my_object_class_init(MyObjectClass *_class) 
{
     /* code */
}

static void my_object_init(MyObject* obj)
{
     /* code */
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;


===The Constructor===

There is no internal way of &lt;u&gt;allocating memory&lt;/u&gt; for an object in C. Therefore an &lt;u&gt;explicit&lt;/u&gt; constructor must be declared for the new object.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;

/* in myobject.c */

GObject* my_object_new(void)
{
     return g_object_new(MY_TYPE_OBJECT , 0);
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;


===Object-Usage===

Although creating the object using its own pointer-type is perfectly valid, it is recommended to use the pointer-type of the object  at the top of the hierarchy i.e the furthest off base class. The newly created object may now be used like this:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;

/* in main.c */

/* Note: GObject is at the top of the hierarchy. */

/* declaration and construction */
GObject* myobj = my_object_new(); 

/* destruction */
g_object_unref(myobj);

&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

==Inheritance==
===Concept===
Inheritance is one of the most widely used and useful OO Concepts. It provides an efficient way to reuse existing code by wrapping it up into an object and then sub-classing it. The new classes are known as derived classes. Many object hieriarchies can be created using inheritance. Inheritance is also one of the most efficient ways of abstracting code.

===Implementation===
In the GObject System, inheritance can be achieved by sub-classing &lt;u&gt;GObject&lt;/u&gt;. Since C provides no keyword or operator for inheritance, a derived object is usually made by declaring the base instance and base class as a ''member'' of the derived instance and derived class respectively. In C code:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;

/* derived object instance */
struct DerivedObject
{
     /* the base instance is a member of the derived instance */
     BaseObject parent_instance;
};

/* derived object class */
struct DerivedObjectClass
{
    /* the base class is a member of the derived class */
    BaseObjectClass parent_class;
};
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;</text>

==Introduction==

Essentially the first phase of the bounty is to try and get all the resources that bare &quot;ACPI&quot; exposes usable in AROS (that can be used at least), and the second phase to add proper AML support so that we can fully utilise ACPI. 

First of all,  we  now  have  working acpi.resource. It's currently responsible  for  gathering  ACPI tables from the system and verifying their  consistency.  Verified  data  can  be queried from the resource using  a  simple API. The API is designed to provide a framework which would  assist  in parsing tables by consumers. I know, the API is very raw and incomplete. I am populating it when a need for it arises. 

Second, we now have ACPITool. It's a diagnosis program. It looks like PCITool  and  displays  the  available info. Currently i wrote parsers only  for  MADT  and  FADT  tables.  The tool correctly displays their contents  in  human-readable form, as well as some general information about ACPI itself. 

Third,  on  x86-64  we  already have secondary cores starting up into idle loop.  Processors are managed by kernel.resource, and it already provides  information about their number. processor.resource uses this information  and  provides  it  to user software in abstract form. For example,  if  you  run  ShowConfig,  it will display how many CPUs you have.  However  only  bootstrap  CPU  will have information filled in. There's  currently no way to run code on a secondary core, and this is out of scope of the task. 

Things that won't happen:

1.  Bounty  specs says ACPITool should tell who uses the information. There is no such mechanism and it's against of Amiga-family OS concept to register who uses some component. Anyone can OpenResource(&quot;acpi.resource&quot;) and use it. 

However i have a list of components using acpi.resource:
* kernel.resource uses APIC data to register and run CPUs. Registered by kernel.resource. processor.resource displays  this information. processor.resource is abstracted, it doesn't report IDs. In AROS, it would be enough to identify a CPU by its number. 0 is boot CPU. kernel.resource already has a function to give a number of CPU on which it was executed. 
* exec.library  ShutdownA()  currently  uses  acpi.resource for cold reboot,  existing  functionality  is  enough  for  this.  It  will be refactored soon, but the idea will stay the same. 
* battclock.resource uses century register number from FADT.
* vgah.hidd will be aware of &quot;No VGA&quot; flag in FADT. 
* pciusb.device  will  detect MacMini via ACPI, and will not require &quot;forceusbpower&quot; argument on this machine. The list can be expanded, i just don't know what other hardware is prone to power bug. 
* PS/2  driver  can  be  made  aware  of &quot;No PS/2&quot; flag... However i wouldn't  like to dive into existing code and refactor it first. However promise to refactor the PS/2 driver in a reasonable time. looked at doing it in a similar fashion in the past but decided against it since it was a &quot;hack&quot; and not the way this stuff is meant to be accessed (which requires a proper acpi aml parser). Power off requires AML. Reboot doesn't, reset register definition is part of FADT. It just needs to set up AROS by retrieve the basic hardware settings and resources exposed in the acpi tables, since we don't have access to the information provided from the DSDT etc (due to lack of AML parser). 

2. IRQ routing. It's rather complex task by itself. And i would leave configuring  IRQs  for  some  other  task. It can be ACPI phase II or something else, like &quot;Multi-processing support&quot;. The basic idea is to implement  a  standalone MP analog of exec.library and be able to run tasks  on  secondary  cores. This will not be an SMP, but it will be a step towards. And it could be used in CPU-intensive applications, like video  players, by running some dedicated task on an available core. since the ACPI resource should be setting up the system with information that is available from ACPI without the need for AML. BTW, this also should include configuring AROS to use HPET which is exposed through ACPI tables.
his means that HPET support needs to be  implemented.  Currently  timer.device  can  work  only with legacy timer. 

Doing this will require to distribute interrupts between processors. I think  new  components  should  be  developed  for  this  task. kernel.resource  is  a microkernel, it should not grow fat, and only a minimal  MP  support  should stay there (identification, IPI, probably that's all). 

3. The specification says &quot;Information should be stored in Amiga-like manner&quot;.  IMHO  on  this  level there's no need to do this. There's no need  to  convert tables into something else, because tables are there anyway, and it's very easy to manage them using an appropriate memory. Introducing  additional  structures  on top of these tables would just waste  RAM,  giving  nothing  new, like bootloader.resource which is currently  superseded  by  kernel.resource's KrnGetBootInfo() (except command  line  parsing).  IMHO  providing  some abstracted Amiga-style information  is a job of higher-level components where appropriate. An example  is  processor.resource whose data do not depend on where it is  taken  from.  ACPI  is  ACPI,  it's  nothing  more,  it's architecture-specific by design. 
But, as i said, there is Amiga-alike API for browsing tables. You can find  the  table  you need by ID, and you can enumerate data stored in array  via  hook.  I'll  also  add  one  more function for enumerating multiple  tables  with  the same ID (for some tables it's valid case), and add taglists with options, like &quot;Fetch DSTD with OEM ID foo&quot;, this 
is also going to be useful. 



==Reference==

CPUS in SMP systems should be registered in some manner, and each set to run an idle thread except the BOOT CPU. 
IMHO halting the CPU is not the same as running an idle thread. The  boot  CPU  aiso has idle loop in cpu_Dispatch(). It is basically while  (no_task_to_run) halt;. This also halts the CPU, just processes interrupts. 

Why  have  two  ways  of  representing  the  same information?  Isn't  current API convenient? You can check for current MADT usage in kernel.resource. You don't go through tables yourself, and you don't go through data structures in a table yourself. 

That is the job of the ioapic. Other than setting up the ioapic to handle routing etc, it has very little (if any) reason to be accessed. However,  what  to  actually do with interrupts? I believe by default they  are  sent to all CPUs. Or only to boot CPU. BTW  is  it  relevant  for  now  at all, since only boot CPU actually processes the hardware? 
they  are  sent to all CPUs. Or only to boot CPU. They default to only the boot AP, and can be configured in many ways (including to the least active AP - which is IMHO the most desirable way to have IRQ processing handled). 
* Disable legacy PIC.
* Reconfigure PCI devices to use APIC interrupts.

Resources having to parse all the information themselves is going to be more costly than exposing it in an AmigaOS-like manner. They don't parse all tables. They ask acpi.resource: &quot;Give me this  table,  and locate these structures in it&quot;. You get exactly what you wanted to, nothing more. 

Define idle thread then. A task which idles on the core - and allows us to see exactly how much time the core has been idle, to gauge processor load etc. 

acpi.resource installs  ShutdownA()  replacement  using SetFunction(). The goal is to  prevent  exec.library  from  bloat.  Because  i  already had a EFI version  of  reboot  routine, now i added ACPI.

Something like mpexec.library. It could contain a legacy-free version of SysBase for each CPU. And run task scheduler on them. The core of this should be handled in the current scheduling code, by using a local (per apic) instance of this task, instead of using the execbase version.  I had changed the scheduler todo this in my old code via TLS, and it appeared to work fine on the boot processor - but I hadn't yet gotten to launching the scheduler on the AP's, since I am not entirely sure of how the scheduler should be launched correctly and suspect it needs each core to have a fake vblank interrupt to trigger the &quot;engine&quot;. 

I had also added the aforementioned changes to the scheduler to handle per-task time usage accounting (and interrupt handlers for all the apics vectors, which provide some very interesting details about whats going on from the apics p.o.v. 

That IRQ routing is not trivial, is not reason/justification to ignore it - the bounty requirement explicitly mentions it since the ACPI resource should be setting up the system with information that is available from ACPI without the need for AML. 
Agree about IRQs then...So, let's define what needs to be done 
1. Disable legacy PIC.
2. Reconfigure PCI devices to use APIC interrupts.
Thats sounds about correct - the IRQ handling code needs to use APIC code (which is currently in kernel resource I believe) instead of PIC code (and should default to PIC unless other options are found), when ACPI resource determines we have better than PIC available.  If IOAPICs are found (via the necessary tables) then we need to configure those to route IRQ delivery, which would preferably be to the least active core - but that would need &quot;fixes&quot; to most of the current interrupt handlers so that they lock access to the hardwares resources at the least.


In fact, SysBase-&gt;IdleCount and SysBase-&gt;DispCount  are  working  now, so it's possible to measure usage at least in percents. FYI DispCount and IdleCount are not enough to calculate the CPU usage. You need to measure a time which cpu spends in idle mode and compare it against total time. Look for sam440/efika for more details where it remembers values of time base counter at certain points. yes, for each task it remembers amount of time cpu is busy with it. In same way idle time is remembered.  Each second it compares amount of time spent in idle mode.

 Therefore, CPU usage (in %) is defined as (idle_time * 100) 


How is usage measured on classic amigaos? If I would write such utility for classic, would create a task with lowest possible priority with tc_Switch and tc_Launch set. Would measure how much time CPU spends in it and would compare it against system time.</text>

==Background==

[[File:Alzheimers brain.jpg|thumb|right|170px|The effects of Alzheimer's Disease on the brain]]Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dementia Dementia]. AD initially causes short term memory loss, confusion, indecision and gradually, recall memory.&lt;ref name=&quot;BHC&quot;&gt; Better Health Channel (2010). &quot;Alzheimer's Disease Explained&quot;. ''Mental Health Research Institute''. http://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/bhcv2/bhcarticles.nsf/pages/Alzheimer%27s_disease_explained?open&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;LSMD&quot;&gt; Heywood, K.M., Gretchell, N. (2009). &quot;Life Span Motor Development Fifth Edition&quot;. p270&lt;/ref&gt;As the disease progresses it causes long term memory loss such as forgetting family members, severe personality changes, loss of speech, severe lack of independance and eventually death.&lt;ref name=&quot;BHC&quot; /&gt; AD is much more common in adults over 65 however it can occur at any age.&lt;ref name=&quot;AlAus&quot;&gt;Alzheimer's Australia (2005). &quot;Alzheimer's Disease&quot;. ''Alzheimer's Australia''. http://www.fightdementia.org.au/common/files/NAT/20100805-AANO-1-12-Alzheimers-disease-Helpsheet-final.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Over 1 in 25 Australians over 60 and 1 in 4 Australians over 85 suffer from AD.&lt;ref name=&quot;LSMD&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AlAus&quot; /&gt; There are many theories as to why Alzheimer's Disease occurs though none have been proved. The most common theory for AD is that the protein [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyloid_beta Amyloid ß] forms 'plaques' over the brain which slows neural transmission within the brain, leading to nerve death.&lt;ref name=&quot;PAL&quot;&gt;Gerrig, R.J. ''et. al.''., (2008). &quot;Psychology and Life Australian Edition&quot;. p237&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AlAus&quot; /&gt; While medical treatment has been particularly ineffective for AD, exercise has been proven in many cases to have slowed or prevented AD.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mice&quot;&gt;Adlard, P.A., Perreau, V.M., Pop, V., Cotman, C.W. (2005). &quot;Voluntary Exercise Decreases Amyloid Load in a Transgenic Model of Alzheimer's Disease&quot;. ''The Journal of Neuroscience''. Vol. 25 (17), p4217-4221. http://www.jneurosci.org/content/25/17/4217.full&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Nancy&quot;&gt;Larson, N.F. (2010) &quot;Exercise may reduce Alzheimer's disease brain changes&quot;. ''Washington University School of Medicine''. http://www.physorg.com/news205430929.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exercise as Treatment==

[[File:Elderly exercise.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Resistance training can be useful to improve strength]]As the full extent of how and why AD occurs is not known, medical treatment for AD has not been very effective. Despite this, many sources have reported that exercise can delay or prevent the effects of AD. This may be due to the increase in blood flow to the brain, which prevents plaques from forming by removing Amyloid ß.

===Recommendations===

The main purpose of exercise is to maintain balance, strength, proprioception, coordination and reaction time through the following recommendations. Exercise should be light at first to prevent injury.&lt;ref name=&quot;NIA&quot;&gt;Rodgers, A.B., (2009). &quot;Exercise &amp; Physical Activity: Your Everyday Guide from the National Institute on Aging&quot;. ''National Institute on Aging''. http://www.nia.nih.gov/HealthInformation/Publications/ExerciseGuide/default.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
* Exercise should be done for at least 30 minutes per session, at least 4 times per week.
* Exercise should consist of both aerobic training for cardiovascular fitness, and resistance training for muscle strength.
* Resistance exercises with a chair is a convenient way of exercising at home (see the further reading section).
* Walking, swimming and gardening are also convenient and effective methods of exercise.

[[File:Older adult exercise with tin can..jpg|thumb|left|200px|Household items such as tin cans are suitable substitutes for weights]]

===Considerations===

AD may accompany other chronic diseases such as arthritis, hypertension or diabetes. If the individual is suffering from another chronic disease, exercise should be modified to accommodate the limitations associated with that disease. &lt;ref name=&quot;NIA&quot; /&gt;

==Further Reading==

For further information visit the Better Health Channel website and search for Alzheimer's Disease: http://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/ or the Fight Dementia website: http://www.fightdementia.org.au/default.aspx

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;NOINCLUDE&gt;
{{CPTPageNavigationU2|
 | Prev = Input and output devices
 | Next = Output devices}}
{{displaytitle|title=Hardware Devices: Input devices}}
&lt;/NOINCLUDE&gt;
Pay special attention to devices with an {{Font color||#ff9933|orange}} background, you need to be able to describe exactly how they work!
{{Dbox|Input Device|Devices that send data or instructions into a computer}}

====[[w:Mouse_(computing)|Mouse]]====
Enables the user to execute commands or issue instructions to the computer by controlling a pointer on the screen.

====[[w:Keyboard_(computing)|Keyboard]]====
[[File:Qwerty.svg|center|400px]]
The keyboard is one of the most popular ways of inputting information into a computer. The basic mechanical keyboard relies on springed keys being pressed down to complete an electrical circuit.  This circuit then transmits a binary signal (commonly using [[w:ASCII|ASCII]]) to the computer to represent the key pressed.
[[Image:Chiclet keyboard medium.png|thumb|600px|center|Stylised cross-section of a [[w:Chiclet_keyboard|Chiclet keyboard]] (there are other technologies out there used to make keyboards).  The bottom right hand button has been pressed, completing the circuit shown in red.]]
There are many different keyboard layouts, with differences between languages and countries. The most popular layout is the [[w:QWERTY|QWERTY]] keyboard. Other layouts include:
* [[w:Keyboard_layout#AZERTY|AZERTY]] - for countries such as France and Belgium
* [[w:Keyboard_layout#QWERTZ|QWERTZ]] - for countries such as Germany and Austria
* [[w:Keyboard_layout#Arabic|Arabic]] - different values to most keys
* [[w:Keyboard_layout#Ukrainian|Ukranian]]
* [[w:Keyboard_layout#Chinese|Chinese]] - laid over a QWERTY keyboard
There are variations QWERTY keyboard with the [[w:Keyboard_layout#United_Kingdom|UK]] and the [[w:Keyboard_layout#United_States|USA]] having very slight differences in layout.  There also variations in English language keyboards such as the [[w:Dvorak_Simplified_Keyboard|Dvorak]] layout, which followers claim to be superior to QWERTY.
[[File:QWERTY keyboard.jpg|center|thumb|QWERTY keyboard]]

====[[w:Speech_recognition|Voice recognition]]====
Microphone connected to software that converts human speech into commands or text.
'''Pros'''
{{Plus|Natural interface with a computer allowing for new users to execute commands without having to learn complex command set}}
'''Cons'''
{{Minus|Speech recognition might not recognise the difference between similar words i.e. &quot;their&quot; and &quot;they're&quot; or be able to understand regional accents}}
[[File:Microphone.svg|center|thumb|microphone]]

====&lt;span style=&quot;background: #ff9933;&quot;&gt;[[w:Digital_camera|Digital camera]]&lt;/span&gt;====
[[File:Reflex_camera_numeric.svg|400px|center]]
# Light is focused through the lens onto the image sensor at the back of the camera
# The image sensor is made up of an array of Red, Green and Blue photosensors, called a [[w:bayer_filter|Bayer filter]].  Each sensor will only record values for that particular colour.
&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Shades_framed_aa.jpg|This image
Image:Bayer_pattern_on_sensor.svg|went through this
File:Bayer_pattern_on_sensor_profile.svg|like so
&lt;/gallery&gt;
And became these:
&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Shades bayer r.png|Red
Image:Shades bayer g.png|Green
Image:Shades bayer b.png|Blue
&lt;/gallery&gt;
3. The different colour arrays are combined to form an image and makes this:&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Shades_framed_bayer.png|Combined image
Image:Shades_framed_dc.jpg|Applying an algorithm to merge cells
Image:Shades_framed_aa.jpg|''Notice it is not quite the same as this Original''
&lt;/gallery&gt;
4. Once the RGB values have been captured, they can then be stored digitally using SD or compact flash cards. Save formats include [[w:JPEG|JPEG]] or [[w:TIFF|TIFF]].

'''Pros'''
{{Plus|You can preview images taken without having to get them developed}}
{{Plus|You can apply filters and images to add special effects}}
'''Cons'''
{{Minus|Some people argue that the quality of photos taken using the traditional film medium is better}}
[[File:Camara2sig.JPG|center|thumb|Camara2sig]]

====&lt;span style=&quot;background: #ff9933;&quot;&gt;[[w:Barcode_reader|Barcode reader]]&lt;/span&gt;====
Used in supermarkets, keeping track of produce etc.  They allow for quick reading of product details so that prices and information can be retrieved and/or stock levels updated.  However the amount of data stored in a barcode is very limited
[[File:Barcode EAN8.svg|thumb|center|barcodes are very common]]
# A laser is directed towards the barcode, scanning across it and the reflected light is captured by the reader
# The intensity of light reflected back is read by a sensor in the bar code reader
#* High intensity = white bar
#* Low intensity = black bar
# The pattern received is translated into a code which gives the identity of the barcode being scanned
# This code is checked against a product database and the product details displayed
[[File:Plessey barcode values.svg|thumb|center|400px|Plessey code is one way to encode barcodes]]
To make sure that the number you have received is correct barcodes employ check digits.  Read on to find out more

'''Pros'''
{{Plus|Cheap to produce as all you need to do is print a black and white image}}
{{Plus|Quick to read, and with multi-direction scanners, can be read from different angles}}

'''Cons'''
{{Minus|Only a limited amount of data can be stored}}
[[File:Barcode-scanner.jpg|center|thumb|barcode reader]]

====[[w:Optical_Mark_Recognition|Optical mark reader]]====
Used in things like multi choice question papers.  The student would be given a selection of answers and then mark the ones they thought correct with a pen or pencil.  When finished, the forms would be fed into a machine that would look for black marks.  The position of these marks correspond to answers and the form could be marked at some speed.
[[File:LegacyStyleOMRFormSm.jpg|center|thumb|multi choice exam paper ready for OMR]]

====[[w:Optical_character_recognition|Optical character reader]]====
Used in scanning printed or written text into a digital format.  Used by Amazon and [[w:Google_Books|Google]] to scan books.
[[image:book scanner.svg|thumb|center|Sketch of a typical manual book scanner]]

====[[w:Magnetic_stripe_card|Magnetic stripe reader]]====
Used to read data from bank cards and access cards.  Data is stored in the magnetic, generally black, strip on the back of these cards
[[Image:CCardBack.svg|thumb|center|225px|An example of the reverse side of a typical credit card:

Green circle #1 labels the [[w:Magnetic stripe#Financial cards|Magnetic stripe]]]]

====[[w:Smart_card|Smart card reader]]====
Used in bank cards, often known as part of 'chip and pin'.  More secure than Magnetic stripes though more expensive to produce.

[[File:Carte_vitale_anonyme.jpg|center|thumb|250px|A smart card. The 3 by 5 mm security chip embedded in the card is clearly visible on the left hand side. The contact pads on the card enables electronic access to the chip.]]


====&lt;span style=&quot;background: #ff9933;&quot;&gt;[[w:Rfid|RFID reader]]&lt;/span&gt;====
Used to read data without physical contact.  Examples include the London [[w:Oyster_card|Oyster Card]] System.  Where the card has a Radio Frequency Identification(RFID) chip.

[[File:CPT Hardware-Input-RFIDcard.svg|center|thumb]]

# The card is then placed above a reader and the magnetic field produced by the reader creates a current in the card's circuitry (no physical contact is required)[[File:CPT_Hardware-Input-RFIDprocess_magnetic_field.svg|center|250px]]
# This current powers a small radio transmitter that transmits a radio wave with the details about the card to the reader [[File:CPT_Hardware-Input-RFIDprocess_transmit_data.svg|center|250px]]
# If the details of the card are legitimate (checked on database) then it lets the person through the gate[[File:CPT_Hardware-Input-RFIDprocess_check_details.svg|center|250px]]
'''Pros'''
{{Plus|Can be read without physical contact (health and safety concerns)}}
{{Plus|Fast way to pay for things}}

'''Cons'''
{{Minus|Thieves could read your card remotely, stealing your details}}
{{Minus|Having multiple RFID cards together, means that they can interfere with each other and none of them can be read}}
[[File:Oyster card partially destroyed.jpg|center|thumb|200px|A damaged card, revealing the microchip in the lower right corner, and the aerial running around the edge of the card.]]
[[File:Canary wharf ticket barrier.jpg|thumb|center|Oyster card readers on London Underground ticket barriers at Canary Wharf.]]

=== Touch sensitive ===
More and more devices are relying on touch technologies.

====&lt;span style=&quot;background: #ff9933;&quot;&gt;[[w:Touchscreen|Touch-sensitive screen]]====
# Each of the four corners of a screen emits a uniform electric field which covers the screen
# When you place your finger on or near the screen it disrupts this field and draws current
# measuring the amount of current pulled from each corner you can triangulate the position of the finger
[[File:TouchScreen_capacitive.svg|center]]

'''Pros'''
{{Plus|Natural, intuitive interface with devices}}
{{Plus|The ability to remap screen functions to suit the task (for example bringing up a keyboard when necessary}}
'''Cons'''
{{Minus|Cold weather can effect the functioning of touch screens}}
{{Minus|Won't work through gloves, as this stops your fingers conducting electricity}}

[[File:Phone-htc-nexus-one.svg|300px|center]]

====[[w:Graphics_tablet|Graphics tablet]]====
Used in the design and architectural industries.  This allows for people to draw on the tablet in a natural way (as they would with a pencil and paper) and for their drawing to appear on the computer.

{{CPTQuestion|Why might it beneficial for professional photographer to use a digital camera instead of a film camera?}}
{{CPTAnswer|
Digital images allow you to edit and manipulate them, adding software filters.  Digital cameras allow you to take pictures and preview the results, discarding those that you don't want.  Film cameras wouldn't show you the image until you had developed it, and such a process is very expensive

{{CPTAnswer|A touch screen phone would allow you to have a keyboard on the screen that could be hidden when not needed.  Meaning the screen space can be used for other purposes

Some people might prefer the hardware keyboard as they like to feel the response of keys being pressed and improve their typing (advances are being made in haptic technology to bring this to touch screens)
}}
{{CPTQuestion|Describe the functioning of a touch sensitive screen:}}
{{CPTAnswer|
# Each of the four corners of a screen emits a uniform electric field which covers the screen
# When you place your finger on or near the screen it disrupts this field and draws current
# Measuring the amount of current pulled from each corner you can triangulate the position of the finger

=== Scanners ===
Several of the scanners featured here record biological (bio) measurements (metrics) about human beings.  Physical data such as finger prints are unique to each person.

====&lt;span style=&quot;background: #ff9933;&quot;&gt;[[w:Flatbed_scanner|Flatbed Scanner]]====
Flat bed scanners are used to convert images and text into a digital format.
[[File:CPT_Hardware-Input-scanner-flatbed.svg|thumb|400px|center|The main components of a flatbed scanner]]
# Place the object you want to scan on the glass pane, face down
# the light moves to the start of the document and illuminates a slice
# The slice is reflected into the CCD where it's image is stored
# the light and mirror move down to the next slice and so on
# once all the slices are completed they are put together into a digital image
[[File:Scaner.jpg|thumb|center|Flatbed Scanner]]

====[[w:Fingerprint_scanner|Fingerprint Scanner]]====
[[Image:Fingerprint picture.svg|thumb|center|A finger print]] The ridges and troughs on a person's finger and toes are unique to that person. Using a scanner a finger print pattern can be recorded and compared to others on a database, allowing a computer to match finger prints from crimes to a suspect, or to allow people into restricted areas.

====[[w:Retinal scan|Retina Scanner]]====
[[Image:Fundus photograph-normal retina EDA06.JPG|thumb|center|The blood vessels in a normal human retina form a unique pattern for each person]]
Retina scanners are used to record the pattern of blood vessels at the back of someone's eye. As everyone has different pattern of vessels,  retina scanners can be used to uniquely identify people.

====[[w:Iris_recognition|Iris Scanner]]====
[[File:Humaniris.jpg|thumb|center|Iris patterns can be different colours and form a unique identifier for each person]]
By taking a picture of the blood vessels and colouring of someone's eye, we can get a unique pattern that can be used to identify individuals.  People might try and circumvent this by using contact lenses

=== Check digits ===
{{Dbox|[[w:Check_digit|Check Digit]]|an additional digit added to a data string and depending on that string, used for checking that the string has been sent correctly}}  
With input devices we have a lot of data being sent into the computer, with image capture devices we could be talking about billions of ones and zeroes.  How can we make sure that they all get from the input device to the computer safely, without becoming corrupted?  There are many error checking methods out there and you will cover some of them in more detail in Unit 1, however, for the moment we will learn a little about check digits:

An example of using check digits (The exam will not expect you to know this technique) is the final digit of a [[w:Universal_Product_Code|Universal Product Code]] computed as follows:

# Add the digits (up to but not including the check digit) in the odd-numbered positions (first, third, fifth, etc.) together and multiply by three.
# Add the digits (up to but not including the check digit) in the even-numbered positions (second, fourth, sixth, etc.) to the result.
# Take the remainder of the result divided by 10 (modulo operation) and subtract this from 10 to derive the check digit.
{{CPTExample|title=Example: Check Digits}}
For instance, the UPC-A barcode for a box of tissues is &quot;036000241457&quot;. The last digit is the check digit &quot;7&quot;, and if the other numbers are correct then the check digit calculation must produce 7.  
# Add the odd number digits: 0+6+0+2+1+5 = 14
# Multiply the result by 3: 14 * 3 = 42
# Add the even number digits: 3+0+0+4+4 = 11
# Add the two results together: 42 + 11 = 53
# To calculate the check digit, take the remainder of (53 / 10), which is also known as (53 modulo 10), and subtract from 10. Therefore, the check digit value is 7. Correct!
{{Robox/Close}}

{{CPTExercise|title=Exercise: Check digits}}
{{CPTQuestion|Calculate the check digit for the following food item &quot;01010101010&quot;:}}
{{CPTAnswer|1=
# Add the odd number digits: &lt;math&gt;0+0+0+0+0+0 = 0&lt;/math&gt;
# Multiply the result by 3: &lt;math&gt;0 * 3 = 0&lt;/math&gt;
# Add the even number digits: &lt;math&gt;1+1+1+1+1 = 5&lt;/math&gt;
# Add the two results together: &lt;math&gt;0 + 5 = 5&lt;/math&gt;
# To calculate the check digit, take the remainder of (5 / 10), which is also known as (5 modulo 10), and subtract from 10 i.e. (10 - 5 modulo 10) = 5. Therefore, the check digit value is 5.
# If the remainder is 0, subtracting from 10 would give 10. In that case, use 0 as the check digit.
}}
{{CPTQuestion|Did the following barcode scan correctly: &quot;01234567890 '''6'''&quot;?}}
{{CPTAnswer|1=
# Add the odd number digits: 0+2+4+6+8+0 = 20
# Multiply the result by 3: 20 * 3 = 60
# Add the even number digits: 1+3+5+7+9 = 25
# Add the two results together: 60 + 25 = 85
# To calculate the check digit, take the remainder of (85 / 10), which is also known as (85 modulo 10), and subtract from 10 i.e. (10 - 85 modulo 10) = 5. Therefore, the check digit value is 5.
# If the remainder is 0, subtracting from 10 would give 10. In that case, use 0 as the check digit.
Therefore the check digit given, 6, shows that the code is incorrect.

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to [[Help|help]] you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* Make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window (if javascript is enabled on your browser) that will insert it too (looks like part of a signature). This will let others know who left it, and make it easy to reply back to you.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]] (global to the system) or in a page on your own userspace.
* Remember to use [[Commons:Main Page|Commons]] project for image uploading.
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* Wikibooks are open-source textbooks. ([[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]]).
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer since things work a little different here.
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]].
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Help us by participating in policy and guideline creation.
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to keep a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you have questions, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or [[User_talk:Panic2k4|ask me personally on my talk page]]. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be a good idea to add that page to your &quot;[[Special:Watchlist|watchlist]]&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there. You can do that by clicking the tab labeled &quot;watch&quot; at the top of the page.

&lt;small&gt;&lt;small&gt;(This is not an automated message, I'll be watching during a time for any reply you make to it...)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

Good luck!  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 18:27, 11 October 2011 (UTC)

@Panic2k4
Sorry, I didn't notice the small text. Thanks for the warm welcome. I have one small question. After how long is the PDF Form of a wikibook updated? I have written an article for the book &quot;C Programming&quot; (Object Oriented Programming : Gobject) and it hasn't yet been added to the PDF Version. Maybe there is some quality assurance checking or something. Secondly, what exactly are the disadvantages of using your real name on the wikibooks account?

Pay special attention to devices with an {{Font color||#ff9933|orange}} background, you need to be able to describe exactly how they work!

{{Dbox|Output Devices|Device that a computer sends data or instructions to}}

=== Visual display units ===

====[[w:Cathode_ray_tube|Cathode-Ray Tube]]====
A cathode ray tube is a [[w:Visual_display_unit|Visual Display Unit]]. You might know them as the old 'fat' televisions and monitors that have mostly been superseded by LCD screens.

'''Pro'''
{{Plus|the image on a CRT can be viewed from a wide range of angles}}
'''Cons'''
{{Minus|Heavy, large and power hungry compared to LCD screens}}
[[Image:CRT color enhanced.png|center|thumb|250px|Cutaway rendering of a color CRT: &lt;br /&gt;'''1.'''&amp;nbsp;Three Electron guns (for red, green, and blue phosphor dots)&lt;br /&gt;'''2.'''&amp;nbsp;Electron beams &lt;br /&gt;'''3.'''&amp;nbsp;Focusing coils &lt;br /&gt;'''4.'''&amp;nbsp;Deflection coils &lt;br /&gt;'''5.'''&amp;nbsp;Anode connection &lt;br /&gt;'''6.'''&amp;nbsp;Mask for separating beams for red, green, and blue part of displayed image &lt;br /&gt;'''7.'''&amp;nbsp;Phosphor layer with red, green, and blue zones &lt;br /&gt;'''8.'''&amp;nbsp;Close-up of the phosphor-coated inner side of the screen]]

====&lt;span style=&quot;background: #ff9933;&quot;&gt;[[w:Flat-screen_computer_monitor|Flat Screen (LCD)]]&lt;/span&gt;====
[[File:LG L194WT-SF LCD monitor.jpg|thumb|center|A 19-inch [[w:LG|LG]] flat-panel [[w:LCD monitor|LCD monitor]].]]
LCDs are Visual Display Units. Most modern Televisions and Monitors are are liquid crystal displays (LCD).  An LCD screen is made up by an array of pixels or picture elements, each pixel contains Red Green and Blue and there is a back light that shines through the pixel, creating an image
[[File:LCD-normal.png|80px|center]]
To change the image displayed on the screen will require different combinations of Red, Green and Blue pixels.  To do this the pixels are sandwiched between two [[w:Polarization_(waves)|polarized]] grills.
[[File:CPT-Outputs-VDU-LCD-open.svg|300px|center]]
These grills are controlled by an electric current and when current is applied, the grids go perpendicular to each other, blocking out all light from a particular colour.
[[File:CPT-Outputs-VDU-LCD-green.svg|300px|center]]
Applying different current patterns to different pixels means that you can choose whether each pixel displays Red, Green or Blue, thus building an image:
[[File:LCD_pixels.jpg|300px|center]]

'''Pros'''
LCD screens have several benefits over traditional CRT screens:
{{Plus|Smaller and lighter than equivalent sized CRT}}
{{Plus|More energy efficient than CRT}}

'''Cons'''
{{Minus|viewing angles of LCD screens can be smaller than an equivalent CRT.  This means the viewers can't see images from the side of the screen}}
{{Minus|[[w:Defective_pixel|Dead pixels]] can plague LCD Monitors, where the grills governing the colour of an individual pixel get stuck and fix that pixel to always displaying a certain colour or no colour at all}}
[[File:Lcd_display_dead_pixel.jpg|thumb|center|150px|an example of a dead pixel]]

====[[w:Plasma_screen|Plasma Screen]]====
Plasma screens are Visual Display Units. They are generally more expensive than LCDs and CRTs, and offer similar performance to an LCD.  They are power hungry and  used mainly for large television sets

=== Sound output ===
Speech output might include [[w:Speech_synthesis|speech synthesis]], [[w:Headphones|headphones]] or [[w:Computer_speaker|speakers]]
[[Image:Logitech-usb-speakers.jpg|thumb|center|300px|A pair of speakers for notebook computers, runs off USB]]
=== [[w:Electronic_paper|Electronic paper]] ===
[[File:Amazon_Kindle_3.JPG|thumb|150px|center|Amazon Kindle using an e-paper display]]
Electronic paper is made up of tiny plastic balls that have different colours on each side (black and white).  Applying an electrical current to the 'paper' flips the balls to make the pattern of a picture and an image is displayed.  The image stays there until you apply another current. This is used in modern e-book readers such as the Amazon Kindle and in other devices such as phones
[[File:Kindle 3 texture (crop).jpg|thumb|center|If you look closely you can see the 'ball's on the Kindle 3]]
[[Image:E-ink.svg|thumb|center|500px|Appearance of pixels]]
'''Pros'''
{{Plus|Images are easy to read in sunlight, unlike most electronic screens}}
{{Plus|You only need to use electricity to change the image, not maintain it, meaning batteries last longer than LCD screens.  In some cases batteries may last weeks, whilst an LCD equivalent would only last a day or two}}

'''Cons'''
{{Minus|The refresh rate of screens is too slow to show moving images}}
{{Minus|Ghosting might occur, where the shadow of old images remains on the screen after you have refreshed}}

=== Printers ===
There are several different types of [[w:Printer_(computing)|Printer]]s, the one's you need to know are below

====&lt;span style=&quot;background: #ff9933;&quot;&gt;[[w:Printer_(computing)#Impact_printers|Impact Printer]]&lt;/span&gt;====
Impact printers rely on a forcible impact to transfer ink to the media, similar to the action of a typewriter. All but the dot matrix printer rely on the use of formed characters, letterforms that represent each of the characters that the printer was capable of printing. Impact printers varieties include, typewriter-derived printers, teletypewriter-derived printers, daisy wheel printers, dot matrix printers and line printers. Dot matrix printers remain in common use in businesses where multi-part forms are printed, such as car rental services, this allows several sheets of paper to be written to with one strike of the printer head, it also allows for carbon paper to be written to through sealed envelopes:
[[File:CPT-Outputs-Printers-Impact-MultiPart.svg|center|400px]]

Dot matrix printers use a print head containing a line of pins.  The number of pins can vary from 7 into the dozens.  As the print head passes over the paper the pins impact on the ink ribbon forming characters on the paper line by line.

[[File:Druckkopf.jpg|center|thumb|Inkjet heads: &lt;br&gt; Disposable head (left) and &lt;br&gt; Fixed head (right) with ink cartridge (middle)]]
Inkjets are examples of non-impact printer.  They operate by propelling variably-sized droplets of liquid or molten material (ink) onto almost any sized page. They are the most common type of computer printer used by consumers.
# The paper is fed into the printer
# The print head contains one or more cartridges of ink of different colours (some only have black ink)
# The print head moves from one side to another, each cartridge spraying tiny particles of ink onto the paper to form the correct pattern
# After one line is finished the paper is fed through a little more, and the next line printed

Lasers are examples of non-impact printers. A laser printer rapidly produces high quality text and graphics.  They work in the following way:


# The drum is given a negative charge
# This charge is erased in the correct places by the laser to create the image using the [[w:Photoelectric effect|photoelectric effect]]
[[File:Laser printer-Writing.svg|center|400px]]
#&lt;li value=&quot;3&quot;&gt; The drum is coated in [[w:Toner|toner]], a negatively charged fine dust, which is repelled by the charge on the drum. Only in the uncharged areas does the toner apply&lt;/li&gt;
# The drum rolls over the paper and transfers the toner onto it(if your printing gets jammed the paper might have this dust on it which comes off on your hands)
# The paper is then put through heated rollers which melts the toner and seals it to the paper, thus finishing the image.

====[[w:Plotter|Plotter]]====
Plotters were an alternate printing technology once common in engineering and architectural firms. Pen-based plotters rely on contact with the paper, but not impact, per se, and special purpose pens that are mechanically run over the paper to create text and images.  They were particularly adept to printing vector graphics, though they have generally been replaced with wide-format conventional inkjet/laser printers.

# Paper is placed in the plotter.
# The plotter arm selects a pen of the correct colour
# the arm then moves the pen to the area where printing needs to start.
# the pen is lowered onto the paper and the arm moves it drawing a continuous image.
# The pen raises and lowers depending on what needs to be drawn, the plotter can also select from a group of colour pens

(some plotters involve keeping the pens stationary and moving the paper instead)

{{Plus|cheap to run}}
{{Plus|can produce very precise technical drawings}}

'''Cons'''
{{Minus|there may be issues around the colour pens available, it is hard to combine colours as you would in an inkjet}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">The invention of the automobile in the late 1800s was a breakthrough in the world of transportation.  It allowed people the option to get where they wanted to go quicker than using a horse and carriage.  In its early stages, cars were very expensive and it wasn’t until 1908 when Henry Ford developed a way to make cars using assembly lines that cars were able to be sold much cheaper than they had been previously.  Since this time, automobile technology has gone places Henry Ford probably never saw coming.  While technology has led to cars being built to higher safety standards, motor vehicle fatalities continue to occur as they did in the early days of the automobile.  By looking at the life cycle of the automobile, as well as the amount of motor vehicle related fatalities that have occurred each year since 1899, the periods of birthing, growth, maturity and decline can be found for this mode of transportation.  This provides an understanding of how technological advances and production of automobiles has either helped or hindered the safety of this mode since its creation.
__TOC__
The number of motor vehicle fatalities in the United States based on historical NHTSA and FHWA data was obtained and is shown in Table 1.  This data is plotted along with S-curves used to estimate the periods of birthing, growth, maturity and decline.  In this case, the data was broken up into two sections, the first being the number of fatalities from 1899 to 1962 as this represented the periods of birthing, growth and maturity.  Another phase representing decline was seen between 1963 and 2009.  The plot representing the number of motor vehicle fatalities between 1899 to 1962 can be seen in Figure 1.  

[[File:Fatality Rate Data (1899-2003).jpg|470px|thumb|none|Table 1: Fatality Rate Data (1899-2003)]]

[[File:Motor Vehicle Fatalities from 1899 to 1962.jpg|470px|thumb|none|Figure 1: Motor Vehicle Fatalities from 1899 to 1962]]

The data was then used to estimate a three-parameter logistic function of the form:

S(t) = K/[1+exp(-b(t-to)]  , where S(t) is the predicted number of fatalities.

Here, K, is the saturation status level.  Since the data has already entered a phase of decline, K, is simply the highest fatality rate.  This occurred in 1962 when the fatality rate was 39,980.  A K value of 39,900 was used as it gave a better fit of the curve than using a K value of 39,980.  Once a K value was determined, a calculation was done in preparation for performing the regression of the data.  This calculation was used to estimate the dependent variable and was of the form:

Y = LN(Fatalities/(K - Fatalities)), where “Fatalities” is the number of fatalities from the data.

Next, a regression was performed using the “data analysis” tool in Microsoft Excel to help assess the accuracy of the fit of the predicted model to the actual data.  The results of this analysis are shown in Tables 2, 3, and 4.

This analysis gives the intercept of the predicted model.  In this case, the intercept was -284.6.  The analysis also gives an estimate of the coefficient, b, which is used in the equation to predict the number of fatalities.  For the time period of 1899 to 1962, b, was estimated to be .14736.  

An estimate of the inflection time, to, or the year in which ½ K was reached was also needed.  This was found by the following equation:

to = Intercept / -b

In this case, to, was estimated to be 1931.46.

Once all the variables were found to solve for S(t), predicted fatality rates could be determined for each year between 1899 and 1962.  The resulting data is plotted in red in Figure 1.  It forms an S-curve that fits the actual data as accurately as possible.  The accuracy is based on the statistical information presented in Tables 2, 3, and 4.  A K value of 39,900 provided the highest R-squared value of 0.814491.  Typically, the closer an R-squared value is to 1, the more accurate the model represents the data.  In this case, there are most likely outliers in the data that affect the R-squared value.  It can be seen that the actual data itself does not perfectly follow an S-curve shape, so clearly, modeling an S-curve will not perfectly overlap the data.  In this case, an R-squared value of .814491 is probably as good as one would expect given the data.  From Table 4, it can be seen that the t-statistics were higher than 2, which means the results were statistically significant at the 95% confidence interval.  Overall, this model seems to reflect the actual data.

Now that the results are known, the predicted model can be used to estimate the phases of birth, growth and maturity.  From the availability of the data, the birth is shown to be in 1899, which is the first instance of fatality rates being recorded in this analysis.  Since to was found to be 1931, this means that there was a period of growth from 1899 to 1931.  The highest K value was found in 1962, which means that from 1931 to 1962, there was still a period of growth.  However, this growth was slower than before 1931.  This slower growth led to the number of fatalities reaching a point of maturity in 1962.

These periods of increasing and decreasing fatality rates can be attributed to changes in technology as well as in the sales of automobiles.  For instance, as more and more people began purchasing vehicles it would be expected that a higher number of fatalities exist due to the increased amount of vehicle traffic as well as simply having a higher population of motor vehicle owners.  After 1908, when Henry Ford started using the assembly line to mass-produce the cars allowing them to be sold for less money, there was an increased number of people purchasing and traveling by motor vehicle.  This helps explain the phase of growth in motor vehicle fatalities.   
The 1930s began a phase in which safety started to become a focus in car manufacturing.  The use of seatbelts was being advocated in the 1930s along with the use of padded dashboards to assist in safety in the event of a crash.  (Georgano 1992)  Mercedes Benz patented the safety cage in the 1940s.  (Car Safety Features n.d.)  This added safety focus helped make cars safer to drive and probably contributed to the slower rate of fatalities between 1931 and 1962.  However, even though the cars were being made safer, the drastically increasing number of drivers is what kept the number of fatalities large.  From the data, it can be seen that motor vehicle fatalities reached its maturity in 1962. 
  
The phase post-1962 saw an overall decline in the number of motor vehicle fatalities. The plot representing the number of motor vehicle fatalities between 1962 and 2009 can be seen in Figure 2.

[[File:Motor Vehicle Fatalities from 1962 to 2009.jpg|thumb|470px|none|Figure 2: Vehicle Fatalities from 1962 to 2009]]

A similar analysis involving fitting an S-curve to the data and finding a model of best-fit was done again for this phase of the motor vehicle fatality rates.  The results of this analyis are shown in Tables 5, 6, and 7.  In this case, K, was determined from the plot and after testing different values of K, the line of best fit occurred when K equaled 55,000.

This analysis gives the intercept of the predicted model.  In this case, the intercept was 96.008.  The analysis also gives an estimate of the coefficient, b, which is used in the equation to predict the number of fatalities.  For the time period of 1962 to 2009, b, was estimated to be -.047487.  

An estimate of the inflection time, to, or the year in which ½ K was reached was also needed.  This was found by the following equation:

to = Intercept / -b

In this case, to¬, was estimated to be 2021.77.

Once all the variables were found, S(t), or predicted fatality rates could be determined for each year between 1962 and 2009.  The resulting data is plotted in red in Figure 2.  It forms an S-curve that fits the actual data as accurately as possible.  The accuracy is based on the statistical information presented in Tables 5, 6, and 7.  A K value of 55,000 provided the highest R-squared value of 0.48108.  Typically, the closer an R-squared value is to 1, the more accurate the model represents the data.  In this case, there are so many twists and turns in the data, that trying to fit an S-curve just doesn’t match up that well and therefore, the R-squared value is affected.  In this case, an R-squared value of .48108 is probably as good as one would expect given the data.  There are many reasons for the non-linearity or constant declining trend in the actual data including changes to driver safety and changes in motor vehicle technology which created periods of increasing and decreasing fatality numbers within this overall phase of motor vehicle fatality decline.

Throughout the 1960s changes were being made and technology was improving to make cars safer to drive.  One such change was the new standard in the United States that windshields had to have a deformable polymer layer so that in the event of a crash, a person riding in the vehicle would not go sailing through the windshield and be cut by the glass.  The 1980s saw a drastic increase in car manufacturers using airbags even though they were invented in 1952.  (Car Safety Features n.d.)  These added safety features as well as cars being made with lighter weight materials is what contributed to the decline in fatal accidents in the U.S.

Policy changes since 1962 also affected the decline in the number of fatalities.  New York passed the first law requiring seatbelts to be worn in 1984.  This is now a law in every state in the U.S.  Also, in various states, lowering the blood alcohol level and implementing harsher penalties for drunk driving has led to an increase in safety on the roads.  These policy changes and advances in technology help explain the overall declining trend in motor vehicle related fatalities.  While this trend is declining, it is known that accidents will continue to occur until technology advances a lot more, it is unrealistic to assume that the number of fatalities in a given year will ever be zero.

Now that the birth, growth, maturity and declining phases have been identified, it is worth taking a deeper look at this mode of transportation to learn more about the impact it has had on the transportation system and commuters in the United States since its creation in the late 1800s.  The invention of the internal combustion engine in the early 1800s led to the invention of the automobile as it is known to consumers today.  What is referred to as the “Otto cycle” is the four-cycle engine invented by Alphonse Bear de Rochas in 1862.  This process brought gas into the cylinder, compressed it, combusted the compressed mixture and then exhausted it.  Vehicles, which used this technology, ran on petroleum-based fuel, which is what we still use today.  (Bottorff n.d.)  Automobiles are now equipped with more safety features and are built more lighweight then when they were first invented.  A car’s engine runs on a mixture of gasoline and air after getting an initial spark from the car’s battery which gets powered when a driver turns the key and ignites it.  The car moves forward based on the energy it gets as the gas burns and moves the car forward.  The car’s transmission passes all the energy from the engine to the four wheels.  (Brain n.d.) A driver can steer the car in whichever direction they so choose adding to the convenience of this type of mode.

==The Automobile as a New Mode==
The main advantages to automobiles are that they offer passengers the option to commute from point A to point B on their own time.  Unlike taking trains, planes or boats, lightrail systems or other modes, you can hop in a car at essentially anytime and get anywhere fast.  Owning an automobile in todays society allows people to live in more suburban areas and still easily commute to a job in the city or at a distance farther then where they could easily get by walking, biking or taking the bus.  Another advantage to the automobile is it allows people to easily haul items they might not be able to take on a bus or other mode of transportation.  The main market for automobiles in the United States is primarily people over age 15 seeing as this is generally the age you can start driving.  Since automobiles are expensive to purchase and maintain, a more reasonable market for automobiles would be working adults.

==Before the Automobile==
Prior to the advent of the automobile, people were primarily making shorter trips via horse drawn wagons and carriages.  The limitations to the horse drawn carriage was that they could only travel up to 10 miles per day so it was a slow commute.  (Economy 2010)  Other options for transportation were boat, or train systems.  The limitations to these other transportation systems were that they typically only traveled through large cities where they could connect to ports or in the event of the train, they could only travel to areas in which rail tracks had been previously built.  These options didn’t offer that much convenience for taking shorter trips or travelling to smaller towns most likely not connected to train tracks.    

In the beginning, cars were seen as a novelty item that only the rich could afford.  It wasn’t until Henry Ford and his assembly line that cars were made for the masses and could be sold at much lower prices.  (Davis 1976)  Ford also built up his company by paying his employees higher wages so that they could buy a car from the company.  Cars allowed people who had never been beyond their hometowns the option to get out and see the country.  For people who had a car, it wasn’t even about the destination, it was about taking the drive itself as this was scene as something new and exciting that people had never done before. 
 
In the early 1900s, the market for transportation was evolving as people were looking for more independent and faster ways to commute.  People were looking for jobs outside their communities and were curious to explore.  As people saw others driving cars, they quickly learned the ease of access having an automobile provided.  Once cars became more affordable due to the assembly line style of production, more people were financially able to purchase an automobile.  

Having an automobile stirred interest in new possibilities for people.  For the first time, people were able to look for work outside their small towns.  This meant they could have easier access to nearby towns to get supplies their town didn’t have.  People could reach regional hospitals and attend schools in bigger towns so people were becoming more educated.  Since people no longer needed to live close to railroad lines, small towns started to grow and develop. 

==Invention of the Automobile==
As demand increased for automobiles, there was a technological shift in not only how cars were produced to provide more cars to be made each year, but technological advances led to better and more efficient vehicles being made.  Attempts at automobiles using various technologies such as steam powered self propelled engines were being toyed with since the late 1700s to the mid 1800s.  However, the very first car which more closely resembles the vehicles we know today was built in 1885 by Karl Benz who was an engineer from Germany.  His design was a three wheeled machine with a single-cylinder engine.  Not too long after this design was laid out, a four wheeled car was on the market.  It wasn’t until 1891 however, that  an engineer from France came up with the design to have the engine at the front which would drive the rear wheels through a clutch and a gearbox.  (Bridgeman 2002)  Once the main structure of the automobile was laid out, the next question became what type of engine would be used.  

In 1885, Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach from Germany designed an effective carburetor.  (Bridgeman 2002)  This led to the creation of the first true gasoline engine and it is not that far off in design from those that power cars today.  Another advancement in technology came in the early 1900s when the steering wheel was standardized.  The pairing of early ideas for improvements of automobiles from engineers from across Europe was what led to the working model that Henry Ford later used.  However, he added an assembly line building procedure which would expedite the process and allow for the cars to be sold at much cheaper prices because building the cars could be done by people not as highly skilled.  Each person working could focus on one single area or part of the vehicle versus having someone try and build an entire car.    

Shifts in the initial design of the automobile started to take place as inventors, engineers and designers learned from mistakes in the past and looked for ways to make improvements.  Since the faster and  more dependable cars were running on gasoline, the petroleum industry had to be advanced to keep up with the demand.  Ways to produce gasoline and improvements in heat-tolerant oil lubricants were being studied as more and more vehicles on the road meant an increased demand in gasoline.  The 1930s mixed existing technology with the automobile when car radios were installed in vehicles.  Car heaters were also introduced in the 1930s which was a relief for people driving in colder climates.  The number of cars on the road in 1910 was 458,000 as compared to 26,750,000 on the road in 1930.  (Sass 2010)  This meant improvements and advancements in engineering vehicles were being well received by the buying public.   
 
The 1940s and 1950s brought about changes in safety of operating vehicles when turn signals and seatbelts were implemented.  The 1950s also saw the use of gearboxes, disk brakes, electric windows, radial tires, and power steering.  (Cars Auto and Car Information from the People History Site n.d.)  As more technology was being used in cars, car prices increased.  In the 1920s, a new car cost only $290.  In 1947, the average cost of a new car was close to $1,300 and by 1955; the cost had risen to as much as $1,900.  (Sass 2010)  However, more people had jobs and were making more money than they had been in the recession in the 1920s so people were still buying vehicles even though they were costing more money.

Advancements continued, and in the 1970s four wheel drive and airbags were added.  This was also the time a new breed of car manufacteurers from Japan entered the automobile market.  At first, Japanese cars were built really cheap and were of poor quality.  Japanese auto makers quickly learned that the buying public demanded higher standards in automobile production and they soon learned from their mistakes.  Today, makers such as Toyota and Honda are among the world leaders in car sales and are leading the way in current advancements in hybrid technology.  (Cars Auto and Car Information from the People History Site n.d.)  This will continue to be an area of focus for the automobile industry as gasoline and petroleum are becoming a scarce commodity and are getting to be too expensive to be relied upon as the main source of fuel for the future.

After each oil crisis, the cost of petroleum increases and people shift their focus on ways to eliminate the use of petroleum in the industry.  Over the last 20 years, these types of world events have led to cars becoming smaller and improvements in the fuel economy of vehicles have been demanded by the public.  Overall, cars have become more fuel efficient.  One of the main reasons is that engineers have been able to stop the engine from running when the car is stationary and the use of hybrid technology now allows the car batteries to charge while in motion.  The use of hybrid technology is also greatly helping reduce the amount of pollution cars exert into the environment.  All the changes that have happened in the past century with car engineering, including changes to the safety and comfort of operating vehicles has led to the designs we have today.

==Early Market Development==
The initial market niche for the automobile was primarily only the wealthy.  This new mode of transportation at the time was considered to be the replacement for the horse drawn carriage but was not viewed as a primary means of transportation for everyone.   Limited resources meant your average person could not afford an automobile.  It wasn’t until Ford came out with his Model T, that the world saw its first economy car, or one which more people could afford and use as a reasonable mode for travel.

As people realized the speed and efficiency the automobile provided, they understood that they could get around the city faster with the use of the automobile.  The automobile served existing transportation markets better in that it provided speed and convenience by allowing passengers the option to travel at much greater speeds than the horse drawn carriage provided.  Early automobiles that didn’t have windshields meant a lot of dust and debris flying in passengers eyes.  (Davis 1976) This type of problem led to the creation of a pavement industry.  The advancement of automobiles was soon followed by the development of paved roads and road network systems as people quickly realized that driving cars on unpaved roads meant a really bumpy ride.  Traveling on smoother roads was another way existing markets were better served.  

There were many new markets which were also served due to the development of the automobile industry.  People in smaller towns and communities who were using only horse drawn carriages were not afforded the chance to get out and explore connecting communities as it took too long to travel places with that mode.  Having an automobile meant people could get out and see their country more than they ever could before.  They could travel easier and farther than with horses.  People could now vacation and camp because they could pack more items in their vehicles and get to locations farther away from their communities.  The use of the automobile helped create other industries which made use of the automobile and thus assisted in market development.  For instance, fast food industries developed with drive thrus geared towards servicing peole driving automobiles.  In 1909, for the first time ever, an automobile hearse was used in a funeral procession.  Before this time, horse-drawn carriages had always been used to carry the body of a person who had passed away.  Another example was police and highway patrols using automobiles to respond to emergencies quicker than they had been able to previously.  The market developed even more since towns began to grow and jobs opened up far from large cities.  People could then commute to work via the automobile and not have to rely on only finding jobs in the cities.

==Policy in the Birthing Phase==
In order to really develop as a transportation mode that could service the masses, policy changes had to be put in place to aid in the organization of the automobile system.  Some policies were carried over from previous transportation networks, however, because the automobile was so different from previous modes, a lot of policies had to be envisioned.  One policy that was carried over from a former mode was the idea that cars would drive on the right or left side of the road.  Earlier horse and carriage networks may not have had well defined rules for sharing the road as they may have even went off road, there was still some sense of organization on the road to avoid collisions.  This same idea was carried over to automobile networks.  However, more stringent protocols were required since these new motor vehicles were more dangerous than a horse and carriage.  Likewise, road maps similar to maps that were established for railroad networks were developed for automobiles especially when more highway systems started to be developed.  Highway systems were set up similar to roadway systems in that they were designed to connect major cities.

Many policies and agencies needed to be created to organize the automobile network.  New laws were put in place to keep people safe on the roads.  For instance, the first speed limit was put in place in Connecticut.  In 1901, you could go no faster than 10 mph in cities, 15 mph in villages and 20 mph in rural areas in Connecticut.  (Speed n.d.)  This soon spread to other states implementing similar laws to keep drivers safe on the roads.  

Agencies were created to help implement safety on the roads and deal with automobile related policy.  In 1902, the American Automobile Association (AAA) was created.  AAA was created in Chicago primarily because groups of motor clubs felt there was inadequate attention being paid to roads and highways suitable for automobiles.  In 1905, AAA put out a serious of road maps so people could navigate their way around the country.  (AAA n.d.)  In 1936, it was AAA who published the first driver education program to teach high school students the rules of the road, however rules were in place since 1910 in the United States regarding needing a drivers license to operate a motor vehicle.  The first licensing law for motor vehicles was implemented in New York and was initially applied to professional chauffeurs.  It wasn’t until 1913 in New Jersey that all drivers were required to pass a mandatory exam before receiving a license.  (New York Times 1913)  AAA also began a pedestrian safety program with a grant from the Automotive Safety Foundation and in 1938, published a study to try and reduce the amount of pedestrian fatalities and injuries.  

In addition to AAA, government organizations were developed such as the state Department of Transportation organizations who were responsible for implementing and maintaining roads and motor vehicle safety standards for each state.  In addition, an extensive network of signs and traffic signals contributed to an intricate language that drivers quickly adapted to.  Stop signs and red lights soon became signals that cars needed to stop.  These types of rules of the road allowed for safer driving and kept some order on the crowded roads and highways.
In relation to the plot produced in the beginning of this report, the birthing phase, or the start of motor vehicle related fatalities started almost simultaneously with the birth of the automobile.  Early automobiles were built with no real safety features and heavy metals so when accidents occurred, there was little to protect passengers.  Advancements in safety features and the use of lighter weight materials over the years has helped address these issues.

==Growth of the Mode==
The automobile industry has shown significant growth due to innovative technology and high demand by the public.  This has been helped by both the private and public sectors.  When automobile manufacturers run out of industry supported research and development, it is up to federal policies and investments to re-ignite the flame and inspire creative and innovative options that will ensure cars keep their competitive advantage over other modes of transportation.  

Innovation in the automobile industry can arise from a few main sources.  Automotive assemblers such as General Motors, Ford and Toyota can spark innovation from within.  Firms may choose to support the auto industry with components and subsystems.  (Klier and Sands 2010)  Universities as well as public and private research can help accelerate the development of technology as well.  The problem with some of these sources is their interest in the overall industry.  For example, a firm might focus on the needs of the market and build automobiles that would sell in large quantities at high prices so that they would make a lot of money.  This is not in the best interest of the industry however, as it is more important to invest in new technologies that will help mold automobiles into something newer and better instead of something shinier or bigger.  

The private sector of the automobile industry extends far beyond the automobile makers themselves.  Private sector efforts encompass an auto makers entire supply chain.  (Klier and Sands 2010)  In order to overcome some of the externalities associated with the private sector, the government is often needed to step in and implement policies that will better benefit the public.  One of the government policies that has been adopted includes research on more fuel efficient vehicles.  

Sometimes however, federal policy and programs can limit advancements in technology.  For instance, federally funded programs don’t always sufficiently target the research and development capabilities of the supply base.  (Klier and Sands 2010)  An example of this is the U.S. Council for Automotive Research which was established in 1992.  This private-public research partnership was established to further research collaboration between the Big Three automakers.  The problem with this is that the supply base often has no access to the new research and innovation ideas so they are never able to be implemented.  Another issue with this is that this type of partnership doesn’t always drive cutting edge innovations.  In most cases, car manufacturers tend to introduce innovation in production vehicles only if they will in turn make a lot of money from the design.  In order to maintain the growth of vehicles it is important to spur innovation that will allow the market to stay globally competitive.  

While there are drawbacks to federal involvement in the auto industry, the federal government has done a lot to help further the growth phase of this industry.  During the 1960s the government created vehicle safety and emmission-control laws and the average fuel economy rules in the 1970s.  These efforts led to the use of seatbelts, the introduction of the catalytic converter and more fuel efficient engines.  (Klier and Sands 2010)  These contributions helped improve the safety and performance of vehicles and helped grow the industry.

==The Mature Phase==
After the growth phase comes a maturity phase, or a period of time when growth levels off and a peak is reached.  It is during this phase that the government will typically correct flaws in the market and promote new technologies.  The firm can either invest in new ideas or exploit ideas in an attempt to spark growth.  The market will then play out in response to changes by the government or firm.  

During the mature phase of the automobile industry, attempts were made by the government to try and make the market more competitive.  In 2007, Congress passed the Energy Independence and Security Act which was intended to increase fuel efficiency requirements for new vehicles. (Klier and Sands 2010)  While this is a step towards making the U.S. automobile industry more competitive with the rest of the world, it does not come close to what Western Europe and Japan are doing in terms of research and development on fuel efficiency.

Often times consumers demand or want to see changes made but are constrained by lock-in conditions in which a customer is dependent on vendors for their products and don’t really have a choice but to settle for what is being offered to them in the current market.  An example of this could be with new features on the dashboards of cars.  Often times parts on the dashboard are designed to be interchangeable.  However, sometimes vendors will sell unusual sized parts or out of the ordinary items which won’t fit with the cars design.  This is where the U.S. Department of Transportation steps in to ensure this doesn’t happen and that the consumer isn’t being taken advantage of.
In order to get around vendor lock in type situations and spark innovation in mature phases, the government should look to provide more incentives for the consumer.  For example in regards to vehicles with better fuel economy, the government could implement a gasoline tax which would encourage the use of more fuel efficient vehicles because people would not be happy paying more at the pump.  

In order to further re-invent the automobile industry, the government should also continue to support new research.  The government can initiate research by direct grants and by working closely with other federal agencies to ensure they have the support they need for research and development.  It is important for the government not to pick winning solutions, and instead fund a variety of competing technologies so that the best alternative or innovation can rise from the pack.  (Klier and Sands 2010)  Another proposed idea is that the United States Department of Transportation should develop a facility to test new automotive technologies, which are submitted by manufacturers at the prototype stage.  This would provide car manufacturers with an early indication of potential new technologies and make information on innovative parts more accessible to car manufacturers in the United States. 

==Conclusions==
Since its birth in the late 1800s, the automobile industry has experienced periods of growth and maturity.  Advances in technology have allowed this to remain a primary mode of transportation for commuters in the United States.  Early technology has changed significantly to keep up with market development.  While there have been motor vehicle fatalities that have happened since the birth of the automobile industry, fatalities have been in a general trend of decline for the last 40 years.  Improvements in safety and vehicle design have kept people safe and kept the market interested in the industry.  Only time will tell if the steps government and the private sector today are enhancing technology and innovation to keep the automobile a competitive mode in the transportation industry.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Often beginners end up with so much advice that it may feel as it is a life-and-death decision. However, within broad limits, as a beginner it does not matter what boots you have provided that they are comfortable and fit well. They should be snug in the heels and support the ankles to prevent them from caving in. Most important of all though, is that they help you to feel confident. That will help you more than anything else. Provided you are not in pain and are well supported and comfortable, practice and
effort will make a far bigger difference than the exact type or brand of boot.

=== Selecting new boots ===

Intermediate and advanced boots and blades are sold separately and mounted by the skate shop. Beginner boots may be sold in
pre-assembled sets, but avoid those that have the blades riveted to or molded into a plastic sole. For adults, the boots should fit
snugly on your feet such that the tips of your toes just brush or can stretch to reach the toe of the boot. Good quality beginner
boots are moderately stiff to provide adequate support, and the more advanced boots get progressively stiffer.

The advantage of stiff boots is that they may last many years and provide good support. Their disadvantage is that they have a long and perhaps painful break-in period and they are more expensive. If you buy boots too advanced for your level, you may find them virtually impossible to break in. Lighter boots on the other hand are more comfortable and break in faster. They also wear out faster.

Before choosing boots, here is a checklist of some questions to ask yourself. The boots you buy will depend entirely upon the
answers:
*How much do you enjoy skating? Do you feel that in time you will be skating daily or is it something you just want to do once a week or so?
*How long do you envision yourself skating? Do you think you have found a sport that will keep you happily exercising for the next 20 years?
*What are your future expectations?. Many skaters who initially cannot imagine ever doing a three-turn progress farther than they ever imagined. Ask yourself what your dreams are.

If you feel that you could easily end up skating every day, you will probably want to skate for the next 20 years, and in your
fantasies you are landing double jumps, then the cost of your boots will in all likelihood be the least expense you have to worry
about over the next three years. And a good boot will probably last that long.

Whatever make of skating boots you buy, it is most important that the boots fit properly (your foot should be held firmly by the
boot) and show first class workmanship. When trying on boots, wear the same socks/tights that you will skate in. Thick socks are not a good idea as they will allow the foot to move in the skate. The construction of the boot tongue is also important, since a
relatively stiff padded tongue will stay in place and keeps the pressure of individual laces injuring your feet. Some tongues have
a padded lambs wool lining, but tongues of higher level skates are generally padded with a foam rubber. The foam rubber should be
about 3/8 - 1/2 inches thick and fairly stiff with small pores.

It is difficult to relate the size of the boot to your shoe size as this varies from one manufacturer to another. Ask to be measured by a competent vendor. They should have you sit and put a little pressure on the measuring board. Try on the boots before having the blade mounted, and do not hesitate to try others if you are not entirely satisfied with the fit.

Custom fitted boots are usually not necessary for starting skaters unless your feet and ankles are shaped unusually or have been injured, you require extra support for your weight or are skating very frequently.

=== Breaking in new boots ===

Wearing brand new boots for the first time can be painful. Here are some tips to help relieve the pain and shorten the process:

*Wear thin socks. Basically, you want the socks to slide against the leather. Thin polyester socks are good in this respect. Skate for short periods at first paying attention to the way your feet feel and stop if there is chafing or irritation. Never ignore discomfort because it can turn into blisters and infection.

*If the top rim of your boots rubs your legs, buy some cloth medical tape and moleskin to protect the irritated areas. Silicon gel ankle sleeves or pads (e.g., Bungapads) are excellent to prevent blisters, lace-bite and protect chafed skin. If the finish of the rim feels rough, it is possible to smooth it by sanding it carefully.

*You can get boots &quot;punched out&quot; or stretched where they are hurting your feet, customizing them to some degree (this leaves marks on the leather which almost disappear in time). Some skate shops can do this.

*Do not lace the boots right to the top at first. 

* To make the boots fit the contours of your ankle bones, find a wooden dowel (''e.g''. broom handle) about the diameter of the projections of your ankle joints and cut two lengths equal to the width across each ankle. Using tape and a marker, mark the location of your ankle bones on each boot (on top of the tape). Then, when not wearing the boots, insert the dowels, lining them up with the marks, and lace the boots up tightly. Similarly, a shoe tree or other solid object placed in the toe will help to relieve pressure on the toes.

* If the boots feel very uncomfortable, you can try to accelerate the break-in process by wetting the leather: For example, putting on wet tights or socks and wearing the boots while not skating, or taking a couple of damp hot hand towels put them in the boots for a few minutes, then remove the towels and wear the boots for a while. However, be aware that wearing the boots while not skating can lead to an incorrect break-in pattern (since you apply most pressure on different points when you are skating than when walking or sitting in the boots).

=== Maintenance ===

Boots are expensive and deserve all the care you give them. Be sure to dry the entire sole of your boot off immediately after leaving the ice and do not store them in a closed bag. When not in use, always remove them from the skate bag and leave the skates in the open so that the air can thoroughly dry them, otherwise the leather will start to decay. Scratches and nicks in the boots
should be attended to before water penetrates the leather.

==== Waterproofing ====
Waterproofing should be applied to the entire sole before the blades are mounted, and reapplied periodically. If leather gets wet and cannot dry out, it will start to rot and then will not hold the blade screws. A variety of types of waterproofing are available at skate shops. Here are a few ideas:

*A sole enamel can be used. It comes in black and neutral. Depending on the amount of skating you do, it may need to be reapplied monthly. It will build up and occasionally must be sanded or scraped off, then reapplied.
*A variety of bee wax or similar wax-like products are popular. They are applied then melted in with a hair dryer. Wax must be reapplied more frequently than enamel but is very easy to use. There is no sanding or buildup. After repeated use, the soles may develop a grayish cast.
*Another suggestion is polyurethane varnish thinned down so it soaks into the fresh leather. Applied in many thin coats, it is said to require very little follow-up maintenance.
*Shoe polish is a very effective water proofer but must be used very regularly.
*On white uppers, black streaks can be easily removed with a solvent made for this purpose. Use a buff type liquid polish on white boots. For black boots, use a black liquid or canned shoe polish.

==== Re-plugging the screw holes ====

You should periodically check the screws which hold the blades on, especially when the skates are new and make sure they are tight. If a screw is stripped or will not stay tight, water is probably getting inside the screw hole and the leather of the sole itself causing the holes to expand and soften. What you should do is bring your skates to a reputable skate shop and have them take the blades off, sand off the top layer of enamel, re-plug the holes, and re-coat the soles before putting the blades back on. They will put screws in new holes wherever possible. If the soles are really rotted out, then your only option other than replacement is to send them back to the manufacturer to get new soles or buy new boots.

Repeated removal of the screws is undesirable. The threads in the holes will strip after a few remove/mount cycles. Then you will have to use different holes, and if they are all stripped, you need to repair the holes. Although it is best to leave this kind of maintenance to the sharpener, you can plug the hole yourself in an emergency: Take a piece of leather lace and cram it into the hole together with lots of leather or hide glue. If you do not have any leather laces, slice off a little piece of a wooden matchstick, put the matchstick into the hole, and replace the screw.

If the the screw is really rusted or seems rounded off, get a new one. You might have to drill or poke a starter hole for the new screw. In this case it is better to let your skate shop can do the dirty job for you.

=== Selecting used boots ===

*The boot must support you, otherwise you will be expending most of your energy just holding your ankles straight. Grasp the boot by the top of the ankle and hold it sideways (parallel to the floor). If it droops, it will not provide you the ankle support you need, so do not buy it. 

*Look at the condition of the boot - it should be leather and not some kind of plastic or pseudo leather with a cloth lining. There should be no cracks or tears in the leather, though some creases are fine.

*Your best bet is to check any rinks in your area; see if the skate shop, rink office or pros/instructors have any used boots for sale. If there is a bulletin board or skate club, check any advertisements or advertise that you are looking for size-N skates.

=== When to replace your boots ===

There are some relatively objective signs that a boot has worn out or is being used beyond it's limitations and others that are
purely subjective or require reference to a coach. Certainly, a skate is finished if the leather in the boot has started to wear
out, if there are fissures in the inner lining, rips or tears in the outer boot or a cracked or crumbling sole that does not hold screws.

Judging when a boot no longer offers adequate support is more difficult. If the top flops over of its own accord, it is obvious,
but more subtle signs are when the normal creases which afford forward flexibility begin to look like accordion pleats that go all the way around the skate; this a sign that the boot is free to flex sideways at the ankle.

Some more subjective signs are the feeling that you need to tighten the laces more to make things work, even though they are
still tight, or the feeling that your foot is free to slide around in the skate, or your heel lifts even when the laces are tight. You might also feel that you are having trouble keeping your ankles erect or holding clean edges on tight edges, turns, spins or jump landings.

On the final front, your coach/instructor may make observations that your boots are not doing their job or suggest that it is time to upgrade. This may be based on close observation or rule-of-thumb. Asking your instructor is always a good idea, while talking with other skaters can either be helpful or lead to a lot of confusion.

Keep in mind that boot requirements are highly relative. Given the model of boot that you have and the amount of wear you have put on them, they may be entirely adequate for what you are doing, or they may be an obstacle to further progress. A recommendation on buying new skates might differ depending on whether you are skating recreationally and just interested in picking up some jumps, or planning to go to multi-rotational jumps as quickly as possible to get into serious competition. Also, the recommendation for a petite woman would be different from that for or a mid-sized or larger man.

=== Lacing ===

Getting your skates laced properly will enhance your balance and control and make your skates more comfortable. 

*First, loosen the laces completely and position your foot when lacing; do not just step in the skate and lace it up, but set your heel firmly in the rear when tightening the eyelet area up.
*Second, you do not have to lace all areas equally tightly. Put in overhand twists (like the first step of tying the bow) at strategic places to keep the laces from &quot;evening out&quot;. Remove the slack through the first 3 or 4 holes but do not tighten too much or you will stop blood circulation to your feet. 
*Tie a twist (optional), then lace tightly for the rest of the holes to hold your ankle firm. At the top of the holes tie a double twist, and cross-lace the hooks (that is, lace them so they are crossed at the hooks). For the last two hooks, lace fairly loosely so you can bend your ankle.
*When breaking in new skates, you can leave the top hooks unlaced and skip the top hole to make them more comfortable and start a crease in the leather at the ankle.

==== Preventing lace bite ====

Lace bite arises from pressure of the laces over the extensor ''hallucis'' tendon, which runs from the front of the lower leg to the base of the big toe. Lace bite can result in the appearance of cysts and bumps and, in the long term, the development of tendinitis. Silicon sleeves or pads applied over the tendon are very effective to prevent or alleviate the problem. If
you start experiencing this problem as the boots age, you can also get the boot tongue rebuilt by the boot manufacturer.

=== Skates for children===

Every parent has had the experience with buying shoes or other clothing for a growing child and having them no longer fit after only a few weeks  due to a growth spurt. Unfortunately, feet grow erratically, and the growth is not
always accompanied by an increase in height. You must avoid buying children's skates too loose, they will interfere with the skating and may actually be dangerous because of lack of support. They may also repeatedly raise blisters. On the other hand, if they become too small and have your skater continue to skate in them, either the child will quit, or the skating will suffer, or the feet will suffer, perhaps permanently.

To check the fit of the skates your child has now, ask her or him to put their skates on loose and push their foot right to the front of the boot. If you can put an index finger between his heel and the back of the boot, he has enough room to grow. When he skates, check to see if his skates are perfectly upright.

The only way to lessen the economic impact of keeping children's feet in skates that fit is to buy used skates on consignment, or at skate swaps, and to sell your outgrown skates as well. Used children's skates are very available and usually in far better shape than used adult skates. Get the children's coach to help you select them.

You can buy gender neutral brown boots if you plan to have the skates passed on from girl to boy or vice-versa.

==== New designs for figure skating boots ====

Despite a more rigid construction to withstand repeated jumping and a gradual introduction of new materials to make the boot lighter, the figure skating boot design has not changed radically for over a century. Several causes are mentioned:

*Leather gradually molds to the foot and the combination of suppleness and rigidity helps acquire the fine control of the skate required for complex footwork
*Traditional figure skating boots conform to the sport aesthetics. Imagine how a pretty sequined dress with go with metal buckled shiny x-treme plastic boot...
*When asked for advice about equipment, coaches and experienced skaters tend to suggest established &quot;tried and tested&quot;. Few are willing to try anything new that does not provide an obvious and immediate advantage.

A recent development that is enjoying certain popularity is a boot with a hinge at
the ankle, allowing a larger motion range that the traditional boot. The design allows skaters to point their toes further down during a jump and absorb a greater part of the impact with the toe-pick, decreasing the load by an estimated 20-30% on the knees, hips and lower back. 

Although hinged boots have been developed for freestylers, ice dancers mention that they create a more attractive line than the traditional boot when the free foot is pointed; note that because the ankle piece has a rubber edge that has to stretch as the foot is pointed, it requires strong calves to achieve maximum extension.

It has been suggested that the ankle hinge might require a technique readjustment on the part of the skater, because the
increased motion range at the angle may affect weight shifting to different parts of the blade during footwork. On the other hand, an adaptation period is usually the norm when changing to new
skates.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Alkaline batteries are a type of primary batteries. The alkaline battery gets its name because it has an alkaline electrolyte of potassium hydroxide, instead of the acidic ammonium chloride or zinc chloride electrolyte of the zinc-carbon batteries.
[[File:Rechargeable alkaline battery.jpg|thumb|Rechargeable alkaline battery]]

==History==
The alkaline dry battery was invented by Lewis Urry in 1957.

==Advantages and Disadvantages==
===Advantages===
* Alkaline batteries have longer shelf life than other batteries of the chloride type electrolyte batteries.
* They have a much higher energy density compared with other batteries. This allows the battery to produce the same energy while lasting longer than other   batteries.
* The rechargeable alkaline battery can be used hundreds of time if recharging is done after the battery has been used to only 25 percent of its capacity.
* Costs of an alkaline battery are much lower than the other more sophisticated ones containing nickel and cadmium.
* Alkaline batteries can be disposed off as normal waste and do not require any special disposal techniques.
* Alkaline batteries function well even at very low temperatures.
* Alkaline batteries can be stored at room temperature for two years and retain 90 percent of their original capacities.

===Disadvantages===
* Alkaline batteries are bulkier than other lithium batteries which give much higher energy.
* Alkaline batteries have a high internal resistance. This reduces the output.
* A defective battery charger can cause the alkaline batteries to explode. 
* Alkaline batteries kept in devices that are not used for a long time, can leak and thus completely ruin the device itself because of the corrosive nature of the leaked material.
  
==Safety concerns==
* Potassium hydroxide is contained within the cells of alkaline batteries. The potassium hydroxide can leak out of the battery cell if they are damaged or mishandled, causing severe chemical burns if the substance comes into contact with your skin or eyes.

      <text xml:space="preserve">If rental skates are available the best path is to go with rentals for at least a half-dozen sessions until you are reasonably
sure that you are making progress and intend to keep skating long enough to justify the investment. The only contrary objection would
be if the rental skates at your rink are in really horrible shape, in which case you may want to check if the shop or any rink/club
bulletin board has used skates for sale. If you find you enjoy skating and you want to do it regularly, it is best to invest on your own equipment.

If you cannot make your mind whether you would like to buy figure or hockey, do not worry too much, as you can learn basic on both types of skates. Once you can do more than skate around in one direction you will find out if you prefer an aggressive style of skating, with lots of quick stops and starts and sharp changes of direction or if you prefer the fluidity of figure skating. If you like jumping or spinning you should definitely get figure skates.

Although in beginner figure skates the boots and blades are often sold as a unit, advanced ones are purchased separately.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Definition and Use in Classical Economics==

:The concept of self-interest and its application in classical economics is distinct from that of the related notion of selfishness. Although often used interchangeably in everyday speech, within economics these terms can mean very different things. In ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments'', intellectual father of capitalism Adam Smith explains the difference between the two words in terms of their effect on society. Smith argues that society benefits when an individual acts in one’s own self-interest, while selfish actions result in the creation of one individual’s happiness at the cost of another’s&lt;ref name =&quot;reference Smith&quot;&gt;Smith, Freidman, and Self-Interest in Ethical Society. Harvey S. James, Jr and Farhad Rassekh. http://ehis.ebscohost.com.ezproxy2.library.arizona.edu/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=61430ecc-94b9-44fd-8fdb-df0abaf8f4e6%4 Business Ethics Quarterly, Jul., 2000, vol 10, no. 3, p. 659-674.&lt;/ref&gt;.


:In order to grasp the idea of self-interest, one could examine the actions of homo economicus, a hypothetical figure within classical economics whose actions are completely rational. Homo economicus is said to operate according to the self-interest axiom, which is “the assumption that individuals seek to maximize their own material gains in &lt;br/&gt;interactions and expect others to do the same”&lt;ref name = &quot;reference two&quot;&gt;. Irrational Economist, The: Making Decisions in A Dangerous World. Written By: Erwann Published By: Perseus Book LLC Published in 2010 MIL EAN/ISBN:9786612461712 Pub e-EAN/ISBN :9780786746262 Hardcover EAN/ISBN: Paper EAN/ISBN: 9781586487805 LC Class: HB3730- Business cycles. Economic fluctuations.&lt;/ref&gt;. Thus , according to the axiom of self-interest, a rational man will always behave in ways that maximize his own well-being &lt;ref name = &quot;reference two&quot;/&gt;.

==Self-Interest in Behavioral Economics==

:As a field of study, behavioral economics developed out of the inability of classical economics to adequately predict the actions of individuals. The discipline integrates psychology, sociology, and pure economic theory with the intention of creating a more accurate understanding of how humans make economic decisions&lt;ref name = &quot;reference three&quot;&gt;Thaler, Richard H. and Sendhil Mullainathan. “How Behavioral Economics Differs from Traditional Economics”. Library of Economics and Liberty. 2008. Accessed 9 October 2011 from http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/BehavioralEconomics.html&lt;/ref&gt;. Behavioral economics challenges the axiom of self-interest by investigating circumstances in which individuals are motivated by factors other than self-betterment. The following sections will explore instances of human behavior that differ from the predicted rational decisions of homo economicus.

==The Extent of Self-Interest==
:While classic economic theory describes individuals as being primarily motivated by self-interest,  behavioral economics argues that  psychological and societal influences hinder one’s ability to pursue their own self-interest&lt;ref name = &quot;reference three&quot;/&gt;. In his thought-provoking work ''Predictably Irrational'', Duke University professor of psychology and behavioral economics Dan Ariely discusses the results of his research into the limitations of self-serving behavior. Intrigued by the large gap between financial losses due to robberies and losses caused by employer fraud, Ariely conducted a series of experiments at large universities across the United States. One experiment, originally performed at the Harvard School of Business, was designed to investigate how the opportunity to act in one’s own self-interest influences behavior&lt;ref name =&quot;reference four&quot;&gt;Ariely, Dan. Predictably Irrational. New York: Harper Collins, 2008. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;.
:The study tested four groups, the first of which was asked to complete a fifty question multiple choice test, transfer their answers to a bubble sheet, and report their score to the administrator, who would give the subject ten cents for each correct answer. Each successive group encountered the same multiple choice exam, but was tempted to cheat in some way. Group Two was given a bubble sheet that had the correct answers pre-bubbled in, Group Three was able to shred their test and just hand in the pre-answered bubble sheet, and Group Four was given the opportunity to destroy both their bubble sheet and their exam and then remove the appropriate amount of money from a jar at the front of the testing room&lt;ref name= &quot;reference four&quot;/&gt;.
:The results from the above experiment were as follows: Group One averaged a score of 32.6 questions out of 50, Group Two reported 36.2 correct answers, Group Three averaged 35.9, and Group Four claimed to answer 36.1 correctly. Perhaps what is most intriguing about this data is that it suggests that individuals, when given the opportunity, will act in their own self-interest, but only to a certain extent. Subjects in Group Four could have easily reported perfect scores and collected $5.00 from the jar, yet they only boosted their earnings by an average of $.35&lt;ref name= &quot;reference four&quot;/&gt;. Ariely’s research suggests that there is some factor other than self-interest that influences the decision-making process.

==Reputation and Conscience==
:Within social situations, perhaps two of the greatest influences on behavior are peer judgment and the desire to maintain a reputation. According to professor of moral philosophy Francis Hutcheson, self-interest is counter-acted by the need to be accepted by others&lt;ref name=&quot;reference six&quot;&gt;Whybrow, Peter C. American Mania: When More is Not Enough. New York: W.W. Norton and Company, 2005. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;. In addition to his above-mentioned work on the extent to which individuals will pursue their own self-interest, Dan Ariely conducted an experiment at the University of California in Los Angeles to investigate how imposed value systems affect behavior.&lt;br /&gt;
 
:Ariely’s study was simple in its design: three groups, each subject to different testing conditions,  took a ten question multiple-choice exam. Group One served as a control group and was not given the opportunity to cheat on the test, while groups Two and Three received a pre-bubbled answer sheet. Members of Group Two were given the additional instructions to construct a list of ten books they read over the summer before attempting the questions. Similarly, subjects in Group Three were prompted to list the Ten Commandments before beginning the test&lt;ref name =&quot;reference four&quot;/&gt;

:The results of this investigation suggest that humans ''do'' respond to external judgment, or at the very least ''perceived'' social judgment. Group One, the control group, established an average score on the exam of 3.1. Group Two, likely because of their access to the correct answers, obtained a slightly higher score of 4.1. One may have postulated that Group Three would also achieve an above-average score, as they had been given the pre-bubbled answer sheet as well. However, this group only managed to answer 3 out of the ten questions correctly. In his work ''Predictably Irrational'', Dan Ariely postulates that being forced to recall socially constructed systems of morality effectively strengthens one’s conscience&lt;ref name =&quot;reference four&quot;/&gt;. In other words, reminding individuals of appropriate ethical conduct increases the probability that they will adhere to these behaviors, despite the fact that they may conflict with their own self-interest.

==Cross-Cultural Evidence Against Self-Interest==
:Thus far, our discussion of the self-interest axiom has relied entirely upon experiments which took place within the United States. Although there is certainly value in investigating the behavior of individuals within a capitalist society, failing to consider other societies would result in an extremely narrow understanding of human nature. This section will seek to explore how self-interest manifests itself in societies whose economic and social structures differ from those of the United States. &lt;br /&gt;
:In the mid 1990s, a group of curious behavioral economists designed and conducted a cross-cultural experiment that investigated the degree to which members of other societies pursue their own self-interest. The experiment consisted of three simulations in fifteen small-scale societies around the world. The societies chosen spanned four continents and represented a wide variety of economic systems, ranging from nomadic herding to slash-and-burn horticulture &lt;ref name= &quot;behavior&quot;&gt; Henrich,Joseph Robert Boyd, Samuel Bowles, Colin Camerer, Ernst Fehr, Herbert Gintis, Richard McElreath, Michael Alvard, Abigail Barr, Jean Ensminger, Natalie Smith Henrich, Kim Hill, Francisco Gil-White, Michael Gurven, Frank W. Marlowe, John Q. Patton and David Tracer (2005). “Economic man” in cross-cultural perspective: Behavioral experiments in 15 small-scale societies. Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 28, pp 795-815 doi:10.1017/S0140525X050000142&lt;/ref&gt;.
:The first simulation is more commonly referred to as the Ultimatum Game.  The game is played with two players, the first of which is given the ability to divide a sum of money and offer a portion to player two. Player two can then either accept player one’s offer, in which case both players receive their money, or player two can reject the offer, in which case both players leave empty-handed. Game theorists argue that, if a completely rational individual were to play the Ultimatum Game, as player one they would offer the lowest portion of the money and as player two they would accept any non-zero offer. From the point of view of this rational player, simply leaving the game with more than they entered makes them better off. When the Ultimatum Game is played in the United States, the average offer made by player one is between 43% and 48%. In this study, the mean offer ranged from 26% to 58%. Several societies also had curious reactions to certain offers. For example, the Machiguenga, a hunter-gatherer society, rejected only one offer, even though three-quarters of all offers made were below 30%. Also interesting is the way in which the Au and Gnau of Papau New Guinea rejected both extremely low and extremely high offers, perhaps suggesting that the latter divisions were too fair &lt;ref name= &quot;behavior&quot;/&gt;.
:The next simulation used is similar to the Ultimatum Game, but player two is not able to reject the offer. This game is often used to remove the possibility that players are making offers out of fear of rejection. American subjects playing this game have a modal offer of 0%, which is consistent with the predicted “rational” division.  Of the fifteen societies studied, only two exhibited behavior similar to that of Americans &lt;ref name= &quot;behavior&quot;/&gt;. These results indicate that something other than self-interest is affecting the way in which members of other societies make economic decisions.
:The last simulation explores how individuals behave when their own interests interfere with those of society. These interactions are known as Public Goods Games, and the primary simulation used in this study was the Voluntary Contributions Game. In the Voluntary Contributions Game, each player receives an endowment at the beginning of the round. Players must then choose how much of this sum they wish to contribute to a communal pot, the contents of which are doubled and then redistributed at the end of the round. Completely rational players would choose to donate nothing to the community and earn money off the generosity of other players. Some societies, such as the Orma and Huinca, defy this behavior with modal contributions at 100% and 40%-50%, and with no instances of defection &lt;ref name= &quot;behavior&quot;/&gt;. Such evidence suggests that the axiom of self-interest cannot adequately predict the general behavior of all cultures.

Although the GObject is not technically part of the C Programming Language, it is a very important library that is being used by a lot of C Projects , and it decreases the limitations of C to some extent. It also gives the reader a wider understanding of C. Therefore I think this book should cover at least the basics of Object Oriented Programming using the GObject System.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The Invention of Calculus ==

Despite currently being a near-universal component of mathematics, computer science, natural science and engineering education, the basic ideas of calculus only came into being in the 17&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century in Europe. This work was predominantly done by two men: Sir Isaac Newton&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, James. Calculus: Early Transcendentals, 7th ed.&lt;/ref&gt;, an English scientist most famous for his three laws of motion and law of gravity, and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, a German who is far less famous in the non-scientific community. They developed their ideas independently, although this has been disputed by parties from both countries, as both countries wished to take credit for the discovery. However, many textbooks today credit both men.

Newton invented his version of calculus in 1666&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, James. Calculus: Early Transcendentals, 7th ed.&lt;/ref&gt; while Cambridge University was closed during the Plague. Despite entering the school with little knowledge of mathematics, he attended the lectures of Isaac Barrow, where he learned, among other things, of the methods Barrow used to determine tangent lines. These methods would prove influential on Newton, who would later develop his own methods as part of his differential calculus. During this break from Cambridge, Newton continued his research, making many of his notable discoveries all in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, James. Calculus: Early Transcendentals, 7th ed.&lt;/ref&gt; These include his three laws of motion, how to represent functions as sums of infinite series, the universal law of gravitation (now superseded by Albert Einstein's General Theory of Relativity), and an explanation of the dispersion of light to form a rainbow. Newton's version of calculus was heavily applied to develop his laws of motion, although they may be re-formulated without the use of calculus. 

Newton's Second Law of motion, for example, was originally written '''F''' = d'''p'''/dt (in modern notation), where p stands for the momentum of an object (then called &quot;the quantity of motion&quot; by Newton.) This was the form Newton used to solve his problems, including a proof of Kepler's laws of planetary motion. The formula may be simplified to the better-known (and more commonly used in the most elementary mechanics) form '''F''' = m'''a''' by the following argument. 

Suppose a point particle of mass m is pushed by a net force '''F''' in a given direction. Then '''F''' = d'''p'''/dt. But this mass is constant, so it is unaffected by the motion of the object. Assuming the relativistic effects are negligible, '''p''' = m'''v''', so dp = d(m'''v''') = m (d'''v'''). Then, factoring out the m, d'''p'''/dt = m[(d'''v''')/dt]. However, this is simply the formula for instantaneous acceleration, so '''F''' = m'''a'''. Newton never wrote his equation in this form, leaving force as the time derivative of momentum instead. 

Newton's notation was significantly different from that in common use today, as was the name for the science he invented: &quot;the science of fluxions.&quot; Instead of the (now) common f'(x) notation for the derivative of f with respect to x, Newton employed a notation that used dots over the heads of a variable that was to be differentiated. This notation had some notable flaws; they can conflict with the use of the arrow notation for vectors and also give no indication of what variable is to be differentiated with respect to. Newton, however, used this notation for derivatives with respect to time. 

\dot{x} was the symbol Newton used to denote the derivative of x with respect to time. The second derivative, as occurs, for example, in the definition of acceleration, was written \ddot{x}. Though this may be extended to include an arbitrary number of derivatives, its use has fallen out of style, except in mechanics, and both Lagrange's f'(x) notation and Leibniz's notation df/dt are more frequently used today in most branches of mathematics. Newton's notation was not wholly consistent; his &quot;dot&quot; notation was developed after writing ''Principia Mathematica,'' his best-known work, and he used geometrical arguments and none of his dot notation to explain the planetary motions he described therein&lt;ref&gt;Isaac Newton. Wikipedia page.&lt;/ref&gt;

Newton's work has come under a considerable amount of critisiscm. Notably, Newton's 1st law of motion, the law of inertia, has been attacked for being stolen from the work of Galileo; his corpuscle (particle) theory of light has been revoked both by Christian Huygens' wave theory and later by quantum mechanics, and, as previously mentioned, his laws of gravitation have been replaced by the theory of relativity. Newton's calculus, in the eyes of some pure mathematicians, was also riddled with errors. At the time, much of this controversy centered around Newton's use of infinitesimals. [Additional work needed on clarification of Newton's use of infinitesimals.]

When we study the trends in the periodic table, we cannot stop at just atomic size. In this section of the chapter, we will begin an understanding of an important concept, namely ionization energy and recognize its trend on the Periodic Table.

==Lesson Objectives==
* Define ionization energy.
* Describe the trend that exists in the Periodic Table for ionization energy.
* Describe the ionic size trend that exists when elements lose one electron.

==Ionization Energy is the Energy Required to Remove an Electron==
Lithium has an electron configuration of 1''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2''s''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Lithium has one electron in its outermost energy level. In order to remove this electron, energy must be added to the system. Look at the equation below:

:{| style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot; cellpadding=&quot;3&quot;
| &lt;math&gt;\text{energy} + \text{Li}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow\,\!&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\text{Li}^+ + e^-\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;1s^22s^1\,\!&lt;/math&gt; || &amp;nbsp; || &lt;math&gt;1s^2\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
|}

With the addition of energy, a lithium ion can be formed from the lithium atom by losing one electron. This energy is known as the ionization energy. The '''ionization energy''' is the energy required to remove the most loosely held electron from a gaseous atom or ion. &quot;In the gaseous phase&quot; is specified because in liquid or solid, other energies get involved. The general equation for the ionization energy is as follows.

:&lt;math&gt;\text{energy} + \text{A} \rightarrow \text{A}^+ + e^-\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

The higher the value of the ionization energy, the harder it is to remove that electron. We can see a trend when we look at the ionization energies for the elements in period 2. Table 10.7 summarizes the electron configuration and the ionization energies for the elements in the second period.

|-
| Beryllium (Be) || [He]2''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; || 899 kJ/mol
|-
| Boron (B) || [He]2''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2''p''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; || 801 kJ/mol
|-
| Carbon (C) || [He]2''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2''p''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; || 1086 kJ/mol
|-
| Nitrogen (N) || [He]2''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2''p''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; || 1400 kJ/mol
|-
| Oxygen (O) || [He]2''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2''p''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; || 1314 kJ/mol
|-
| Fluorine (F) || [He]2''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2''p''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; || 1680 kJ/mol
|}

When we look closely at the data presented in Table 10.7, we can see that as we move across the period from left to right, in general, the ionization energy increases. At the beginning of the period, with the alkali metals and the alkaline earth metals, losing one or two electrons allows these atoms to become ions.

:{| style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot; cellpadding=&quot;3&quot;
| &lt;math&gt;\text{energy} + \text{Li}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow\,\!&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\text{Li}^+ + e^-\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\text{energy} + \text{Mg}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow\,\!&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\text{Mg}^{2+} + 2e^-\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;[\text{He}] + 2s^1\,\!&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow\,\!&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;[\text{He}] + e^-\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;[\text{Ne}] + 3s^2\,\!&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow\,\!&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;[\text{Ne}] + 2e^-\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
|}

As we move across the period, the atoms become smaller which causes the nucleus to have greater attraction for the valence electrons. Therefore, the electrons are more difficult to remove.

A similar trend can be seen for the elements within a family. Table 10.8 shows the electron configuration and the first ionization energies (''IE''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) for some of the elements in the first group, the alkali metals.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;margin:10px auto;&quot;
|+ Table 10.8: Ionization Energies for Some Group 1 Elements
! scope=&quot;col&quot; | Element
! scope=&quot;col&quot; | Electron Configuration
! scope=&quot;col&quot; | First Ionization Energy ''IE''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;
|-
| Lithium (Li) || [He]2''s''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; || 520 kJ/mol
|-
| Sodium (Na) || [He]3''s''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; || 495.5 kJ/mol
|-
| Potassium (K) || [He]4''s''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; || 418.7 kJ/mol
|}

Comparing the electron configurations of lithium to potassium, we know that the electron to be removed is further away from the nucleus. We know this because the ''n'' value is larger meaning the energy level where the valence electron is held is larger. Therefore it is easier to remove the most loosely held electron because the atom is larger with a greater shielding effect which means that the nucleus has less control over potassium's outer electron, 4''s''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

Therefore ''IE''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; for potassium (418.7 kJ/mol) is less than ''IE''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; for lithium (520 kJ/mol).

If a second electron is to be removed from an atom, the general equations are the following:

:{| style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot; cellpadding=&quot;3&quot;
| &lt;math&gt;\text{J} + \text{energy}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow\,\!&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\text{J}^{1+} + e^-\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
| style=&quot;padding-left:25px;&quot; | &lt;math&gt;IE_1\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\text{J}^+ + \text{energy}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow\,\!&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\text{J}^{2+} + 2e^-\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
| style=&quot;padding-left:25px;&quot; | &lt;math&gt;IE_2\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
|}

Since there is an imbalance of positive and negative charges when a second electron is being removed, the energy required for the second ionization (''IE''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) will be greater than the energy required for the first ionization (''IE''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;). Simply put, ''IE''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ''IE''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ''IE''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ''IE''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.

==The Charge on the Nucleus Increases and Size Decreases==
So if we look at the ionization energy trend in the Periodic Table and add it to the trend that exists with atomic size we can show the following on our Periodic Table chart.

[[File:Ionization energy - atomic size.svg|500px|center]]

But why does the ionization energy increase going across a period and decrease going down a group? It has to do with two factors. One factor is that the atomic size decreases. The second factor is that the effective nuclear charge increases. The '''effective nuclear charge''' is the charge experienced by a specific electron within an atom. Remember, the nuclear charge was used to describe why the atomic size decreased going across a period. When we look at the data in Table 10.7 again, we can see how the effective nuclear charge increases going across a period. Table 10.9 shows the effective nuclear charge along with the ionization energy for the elements in Period 2.

|}

The electrons that are shielding the nuclear charge are the core electrons, or in the case of Period 2, the 1''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; electrons. The effective nuclear charge is the difference between the total charge in the nucleus (the number of protons) and the number of shielded electrons. Notice how as the effective nuclear charge increases, so does the ionization energy. Overall the general trend for ionization energy is shown below.

[[File:Ionization energy periodic table.svg|500px|center]]
{{High School Chemistry/Example|Sample Question}}
What would be the effective nuclear charge for Cl? Would you predict the ionization energy to be higher or lower than fluorine?
----
'''Solution''':

Chlorine has the electronic configuration of [Ne]3''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;3''p''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;

The effective nuclear charge is 7, the same as fluorine. Predicting the ionization energy would be difficult with this alone. The atomic size, however, is larger for chlorine than for fluorine because now there are three energy levels (chlorine is in Period 3). Now we can say that the ionization energy should be lower than that of fluorine because the electron would be easier to pull off the level further away from the nucleus. (Indeed, the value for chlorine is 1251 kJ/mol).

==Some Anomalies With the Trend in Ionization Energy==
There are a few anomalies that exist with respect to the ionization energy trends. Going across a period there are two ways in which the ionization energy may be affected by the electron configuration. When we look at period 3, we can see that there is an anomaly observed as we move from the 3''s'' sublevels to the 3''p'' sublevel. The table below shows the electron configurations for the main group elements in period 3 along with the first ionization energy for these elements.

|}
|&lt;div style=&quot;padding-bottom:65px;&quot;&gt;[[File:Al Mg comparison.svg|150px]]&lt;/div&gt;
|}
In the table we see that when we compare magnesium to aluminum the first ''IE'' decreases instead of increasing as we would have expected. So why would this be so? Magnesium has its outermost electrons in the ''s'' sublevel. The aluminum atom has its outermost electron in the 3''p'' sublevel. Since ''p'' electrons have just slightly more energy than ''s'' electrons, it takes a little less energy to remove that electron from aluminum. One other slight factor is that the electrons in 3''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; shield the electron in 3''p''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;. These two factors allow the ''IE''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; for Al to be less than ''IE''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; for Mg.

When we look at the table below, we can see that the ionization energy for nitrogen seems out of place.

While nitrogen has one electron occupying each of the three ''p'' orbitals in the 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; sublevel, oxygen has two orbitals occupied by only one electron but one orbital containing a pair of electrons. The greater electron-electron repulsion experienced by these 2''p'' electrons allows for less energy to be needed to remove one of these. Therefore, ''IE''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; for oxygen is less than nitrogen.

==Lesson Summary==
* Ionization energy is the energy required to remove the most loosely held electron from a gaseous atom or ion. Ionization energy generally increases across a period and decreases down a group. The effective nuclear charge is the charge of the nucleus felt by the valence electron.
* The effective nuclear charge and the atomic size help explain the trend of ionization energy. Going down a group the atomic size gets larger and the electrons can be more readily removed, therefore, ionization energy decreases. Going across a period the effective nuclear charge increase so the electrons are harder to remove and the ionization energy increases. Once one electron has been removed, a second electron can be removed but ''IE''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ''IE''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. If a third electron is removed, ''IE''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ''IE''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ''IE''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and so on.

==Review Questions==
# Define ionization energy and show an example ionization equation.
# Draw a visual representation of the periodic table describing the trend of ionization energy.
# Which of the following would have the largest ionization energy?
#: (a) Na
#: (b) Al
#: (c) H
#: (d) He
# Which of the following would have the smallest ionization energy?
#: (a) K
#: (b) P
#: (c) S
#: (d) Ca
# Place the following elements in order of increasing ionization energy: Na, O, Ca, Ne, K.
# Place the following elements in order of decreasing ionization energy: N, Si, S, Mg, He.
# Using experimental data, the first ionization energy for an element was found to be 600 kJ/mol. The second ionization energy for the ion formed was found to be 1,800 kJ/mol. The third ionization energy for the ion formed was found to be 2,700 kJ/mol. The fourth ionization energy for the ion formed was found to be 11,600 kJ/mol. And finally the fifth ionization energy was found to be 15,000 kJ/mol. Write the reactions for the data represented in this question. Which group does this element belong? Explain.
# Using electron configurations and your understanding of ionization energy, which would you predict would have higher second ionization energy: Na or Mg?
# Comparing the first ionization energy (''IE''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) of calcium, Ca, and magnesium, Mg, :
#: (a) Ca has a higher ''IE''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; because its radius is smaller.
#: (b) Mg has a higher ''IE''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; because its radius is smaller.
#: (c) Ca has a higher ''IE''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; because its outer sub-shell is full.
#: (d) Mg has a higher ''IE''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; because its outer sub-shell is full.
#: (e) they have the same ''IE''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; because they have the same number of valence electrons.
# Comparing the first ionization energy (''IE''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) of beryllium, Be, and boron, B:
#: (a) Be has a higher ''IE''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; because its radius is smaller.
#: (b) B has a higher ''IE''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; because its radius is smaller.
#: (c) Be has a higher ''IE''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; because its ''s'' sub-shell is full.
#: (d) B has a higher ''IE''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; because its ''s'' sub-shell is full.
#: (e) They have the same ''IE''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; because B has only one more electron than Be.

==Vocabulary==
; effective nuclear charge
: The charge on the atom or ion felt by the outermost electrons (valence electrons).
; ionization energy
: The energy required to remove an electron from a gaseous atom or ion: energy + J → J&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; (first ionization energy).

      <text xml:space="preserve">The [[w:New York City Subway| New York City subway]] system has an illustrious history since its inception in the early 1900s.  From its modest beginnings in 1904 with one line opening, the New York City subway has become the largest subway system in the world completing 1.6 Billion trips a year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mta.info/nyct/facts/ridership/index.htm MTA Ridership] MTA.info (12th October 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;  It is hard to imagine for all of those who have taken the subway in New York City, but the 1.6 Billion trips that we see today is only 80% of the total rides seen in the years 1929 and again in 1945, despite being a significantly smaller system.  This case study will focus on the birth of the New York City subway system, including what policies were instituted to get it off the ground, then onto the growth phase seen between 1910 till 1919, and finally mark its peak in 1929 and what caused the system to level off at 2 Billion trips served in that year.

==The Subway from 1904 till 1945==
When analyzing the total rides made within the New York City subway system, the argument can be made that from 1904, when the first subway line became operation, till 1929 encompasses the entire life cycle of the mode of transportation: the birth, growth and mature phases are all encompassed.  While a peak is seen at 1929 with roughly 2 billion rides made that year, there is a decline in the 1930's (due to the [[w: Great Depression| Great Depression]], with a resurgence during the 1940's, eventually hitting to peak of 2 billion rides made.  Below is a table of total rides made on the New York City Subway:

From this data, we can use a three parameter logistic model as follows:


&lt;math&gt;R(t) = K/[1+e^{(-b(t-t_0)}]&lt;/math&gt;


Where R(t) are the total rides with respect to the year, t, K is the carrying capacity of the system (in our case, the maximum number of rides), t&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[w: inflection point|inflection point]], and b is the exponential coefficient.  To find each of the three parameters, the natural log of both sides is taken and a [[w:linear regression|linear regression]] is run to best fit for the b and t&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; parameters.  To estimate for K, the New York City subway reached a maximum of roughly 2 billion rides, to which the value was rounded up to 2.1 billion rides.  The following was the equation to which a linear regression was run on Microsoft Excel:


&lt;math&gt;Y = \ln\left(\cfrac{R(t)}{(K-R(t))}\right)= bt-bt_0&lt;/math&gt;


Two regression were run: first on the data between 1904 and 1929, the second on the data between 1904 and 1945.  After running both regressions, the data ending in 1929 had an [[w:R squared|R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]] value of 0.95 compared to the data ending in 1945 had an R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of 0.82.  The logic for limiting the regression to 1929 was that for the exceptional circumstances the Great Depression appeared to have on the system; the birth and growth phases are accurately predicted by the logit model using the 1929 model and the mature phase could be seen as starting in 1929 when the peak rides were first made.  While the R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; value would be higher for the 1929 model if the data between 1929 and 1945 was considered, ultimately it seems as though the Great Depression was the primary factor as to decreasing ridership (as seen by the return to 2 billion rides made in 1945) and therefore will be treated as &quot;outlier&quot; data points.

Using the 1929 data set, b is found to be 0.215, and t&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; was found to be 1916, which is indicated by the purple line in figure 1.  When considering the history of the subway line, as explored in this article, 1916 does historically line up as being an inflection point for the New York City subway.  Considering the fit of the model for the first two phases and how the model lines up with the data in 1945, it can be said that the New York City subway system has experienced an [[w: Logistic function| S-shaped curve]] so often seen for transportation modes.


The three phases have been broken down by color code in figure 1: green representing the birth phase, yellow the growth phase, and orange the mature phase.  While the dates set for each of these phases were subjective, each were decided because of historical context.  The birth phase started in 1904 with the first subway line in operation and lasted until 1910 when the [[w:Dual Contracts|Dual Contracts]] was signed between the two major rail lines and the municipal government.  The Growth Phase was from the signing of the Dual Contracts till the point when subway hit its peak in 1929.  The mature phase spanned from 1929 till 1945, when it went through a decline and rebirth up to 1945.  The purple line represents 1916, which was the calculated inflection point: when the rate of growth went from increasing to decreasing.  This article pertains specifically for this period - for further reading, please refer to [[Transportation Deployment Casebook|Transportation Deployment Casebook's]] chapter Ridership On New York City Subways.

==The Beginnings of Subway Transit==
While the first subway rail line opened in October of 1904, above ground rail in New York City began in 1868 with the [[w:IRT Ninth Avenue Line|IRT Ninth Avenue Line]].  Operated by steam locomotives, there were several companies owning a few lines apiece both in [[w:Manhattan|Manhattan]] and [[w:Brooklyn|Brooklyn]].  However, after the turn of the century, the rail lines would be consolidated into two companies: the Interborough Transit Company ([[w:Interborough Rapid Transit Company|IRT]]) and the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company ([[w: Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company|BRT]]), with the IRT dominating the Manhattan market and the BRT dominating the Brooklyn market.  The above ground lines weren't the only forms of commuter transportation.  For long distance commuting, i.e. from Connecticut and Long Island, there were well established rail lines such as the [[w:Long Island Railroad|Long Island Railroad]] (LIRR) and the [[w:New York Central Railroad|New York Central Railroad]] (NYC).  Both allowed people access into New York City through Grand Central Station - at the northern extent of the [[w:Central Business District|CBD]].  Yet, both lacked the ability to move people from Grand Central further south, which left service open for the IRT, or for people to come in from southern Brooklyn, which left service open for the BRT.

Which ever gaps that were left by rail were filled in by pedestrian traffic, cars, buses, and earlier on horse-drawn rail.  For the CBD of New York, described as any part of the Manhattan south of 59th Street, all the different modes of transportation were crowding the narrow streets of New York City.  Even when the first above ground rail opened up in 1868, people were planning for an underground subway line to alleviate commuter congestion.  For example, one engineer by the name of A. P. Robinson predicted, with consideration to population trends and the increasing density, that there would be 200 million trips made in 1880 - the actual number would eventually be 288 million.&lt;ref name =&quot;Walker&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Fifty Years of Rapid Transit|last=Walker|first=James Blaine|year=1918|publisher=The Law Printing Company|location=New York City|chapterurl=http://www.nycsubway.org/articles/fifty_years_03.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was through his predictions that he thought that subway system should be constructed in order to alleviate future congestion problems that were bound to plague the city.  As you can tell, the subway system had been a point of discussion since before the [[w: American Civil War|Civil War]], yet it wasn't able to get the green light from the City of New York until 1898.  At that point, the IRT and BRT were begging to expand their operations.  The next chapter discusses what changed over the 35 years when the first elevated lines were created to push the city to making the rail run under the city.

==The Advent of Subway in New York city==
The first subway line took 6 years to complete, beginning in 1898 when the city finally approved to franchise seven new subway stations to the IRT, continuing to groundbreaking in 1900, till the first train ran the tracks in 1904.&lt;ref name = &quot;Walker&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;IRT&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last = [[w:Interborough Rapid Transit Company|Interborough Rapid Transit Company]]| title = The New York Subway: Its Construction and Equipment | year = 1991 | isbn = 0823213196 | publisher = Fordham University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While the project itself took 6 years, in reality the battle to construct a subway system in New York City start much earlier and took many factors.  This article will highlight the three of them: the success of the elevated rail, the new technological advances, and the increasing population.

===Elevated Rail===
For all intents and purposes, the elevated lines in both Manhattan and Brooklyn were a success.  With the eventual formation of the BRT in 1896 and the IRT in 1900,both were able to standardize their lines for their particular train.  Both companies would also hold relative monopolies over the other: while the IRT would control trips within Manhattan, the BRT line controlled all of the commuter elevated rail in Brooklyn and had a few access points into Manhattan.  Furthermore, by being distinct lines, they did not have to offer their customers transfers from one line to another, maximizing their profits for those force to take the rail.

Ridership was expanding and the rail operation companies were able to supplement the governments in order to franchise new station construction.  Throughout the late 1800's, elevated rail companies vied for access into downtown/midtown Manhattan, extending their lines to areas with relatively low population density.  Through the success of these companies and with the experience in handling the City of New York, they felt confident in lobbying the government for a more ambitious project.  They knew that they could leverage the municipal government into franchising new stations for them and derive profits from the growing populations moving into areas that they were building out to, including Harlem and The Bronx.

===New Technologies===
There were major technological advances that were revolutionizing cities across the world.  While J.P. Robinson drew up schematics for what a subway in New York could look like, many new advances allowed for both easier construction of the subway and operations.  First and foremost, the [[w: electric locomotive|electic locomotive]] was invented and began to be deployed worldwide by 1902.  Unlike the [[w:London Underground|London Underground]], which required significant ventilation due to the steam engine usage, the electric train could be fed energy from their power station (the IRT would build its own power station to supply it energy - [[w:IRT Powerhouse| IRT Powerhouse]](http://www.nycsubway.org/articles/powerplant.html)).  Since there wasn't the necessity to keep the tunnels well ventilated, these tunnels could be built deeper underground (when [[w:cut-and-cover|cut-and-cover]] couldn't be done).  While the technology was available for the engineers to construct tunnels deep underground, it was only done when cut-and-cover could not be done: either when they had to tunnel through rock or go under the [[w:East River|East River]].  [[w:steel|Steel]] and [[w:Concrete|concrete]] were relatively new materials that enabled engineers to not only support their structure more soundly with less space, but it enabled them to build the tunnel out to support four lanes of track.  Ultimately, the four lanes of track not only increased the potential capacity, but allowed for express line services, increasing the utility of the subway lines.  Lastly, tunneling became much more sophisticated allowing for the engineers to build a tunnel under the East River to [[w:The Bronx|The Bronx]] and for in circumstances when cut-and-cover couldn't work.&lt;ref name =&quot;IRT&quot; /&gt;

===Increasing Population===
Over the 35 years since the first rapid transit bill was vetoed by the New York governor,&lt;ref name=&quot;Walker&quot;/&gt; the population of New York increased at an astronomical pace: from 1870 till 1900, the population grew from 1,478,000 to 3,437,000.  Denser living brought about by the invention of the [[w:elevator|elevator]] and building [[w:skyscraper| skyscrapers]] required more rail transit for those living within the cities.  With the elevated lines at full capacity and the roads clogged with traffic coming from a myriad of sources, people were demanding transportation solutions; one which subways could provide.  Furthermore, places that elevated rail lines had supplied service to without significant populations were now bustling with people.  The best example of this is The Bronx, which in 1870 had a population of 37,000: at this point was still considered the hinterlands to lower Manhattan and downtown Brooklyn.  By 1900, the population had grown to 200,000 and were bustling to do business within lower Manhattan.  [[w:Harlem|Harlem]] is another example of this, where in the years leading up to the elevated lines coming in were farm land.  The elevated rail lines had allowed people to live further away from the city center, but new transportation strategy was needed to address these issues.

==Policies in the Beginning: 1898 till 1910==
By 1898, when the municipal government of New York City decided to finance a subway rail line, the government had two major things to consider: one, its prior relationship with the various rail companies, and two, how it will distribute the subway project.  Up to this point, rail projects were done as follows: either the city would build the rail and lease it out to private operating companies or private operating companies would lobby the government to build a rail and allow them to operate them by paying for a portion of the capital costs.  In 1898, the city had decided to finance the former and allow the elevated rail lines to bid for the contract.  In 1900, the Manhattan lines had consolidated to what became the IRT and won the contract to operate the first line which was to run from City hall to 145st in The Bronx. The terms of the contract stated that IRT leased the track for 99 years, and for that time would pay a portion of the operating costs directly to the city - much like they constructed past contracts with elevated rail companies.  There are two major things to consider: one, they did not include a clause on how much the rail could charge to use the subway, and two, they did not include within their contract a way for the government to funnel any profits the company made off of the subway.  Funding was especially problematic because of stat law which required the debt of a city to be no higher than 10 percent of their budget, which was set by the state government.  That meant that the initial subway project would have to remain under $30 million, and that funding would have to stream in on a year to year basis.&lt;ref name=&quot;Walker&quot;/&gt;  This caused some friction not only between the municipal government and the state, but also within the newly formed municipal government.  Up until 1898, Manhattan and Brooklyn were two separate cities vying for the same economic pie.  With the [[w:City of Greater New York|consolidation of the five boroughs]], they now had to work together within the same municipal government to get money for their borough.

Overnight the subway became a huge success.  As seen in figure 1, the total trips made by the single line increased from 73,000,000 to 138,000,000 within a full year of operation.  While the line had opened up in 1904, plans to extend the original stations continued until 1906 which opened up more areas that had seen this population boom.  By 1908, before which the IRT and BRT companies had been &quot;legalizing&quot; routes that could be constructed in the future, ridership had skyrocketed to 550,000,000 rides.  The newly formed Public Service Commission (the successor of the Rapid Transit Commission, which had been dissolved due to not approving of more projects sooner) began approving numerous projects: extensions to the existing line, creating a subway line in Brooklyn, etc. By 1909, engineers had looked over all the plans the new Public Service Commission had approved, to which the new lines would add 47 miles of track and cost $147 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;Walker&quot;/&gt;  Clearly they were not to make the same mistakes as their predecessors!  As noted earlier, the city was bound to stay under a certain debt threshold, and these new ambitious projects would be above and beyond what they could pay for themselves, so they began to negotiate with the two major lines how they were going to divide up the responsibilities towards this monumental project.

==The Growth of the Line: The Dual Contracts==
In December of 1910, negotiations began between the major rail companies, and the city for how the system was going to expand going forward.  The negotations proved to be very difficult since all three parties (the IRT, the BRT and the City) had their own agenda.  Gaining access into Manhattan was the primary goal for the BRT heads since this was more and more becoming the destination for commuters.  While the IRT tried to block this, the city government was more interested in unifying the two systems and allowing for greater access between the two systems.  The city government knew that this was the time they had the greatest leverage over the rail companies, which they saw as getting a great deal up to this point.  There were four major points that the city looked to get during these negotiations:

# Set fares across the entire system
# Take a portion of the profits the companies were taking in
# Split up Queens between the two rail lines
# Have full control over the track within 10 years time

Each of these points were a significant change in policy up until this point.  In dictating the fare price, the city government was ensuring that these companies couldn't take full advantage of the newcomers to the city who had no choice but to live on and work along the rail lines.  In the final deal, the fare would be set on 5 cents (one note for some perspective, when A.P. Robinson designed his system in 1864, he set the fare prices to 7 cents) and was not to change with inflation. One caveat the companies were able to exploit was that transfers were not honored from one train to another.  The second point was also crucial: this marked the beginning of the government getting into the rail business: they saw these companies getting rich seemingly overnight and wanted a piece of the action.  The third point was a negotiation currency that the city used to appease one company or the other.  Ultimately, the next frontier in lines would be in Queens and both companies wanted some portion of the lines that fed those areas.  Finally, and most importantly, the deal was to include a provision where the city would be allowed to own the lines within 10 years time if they so chose.&lt;ref name=&quot;Walker&quot;/&gt;

In 1913 the deal was signed and the most ambitious transportation project within New York City began.  The total cost of the project would be $347 million, where the city would contribute $150 million, $56 million from IRT in construction, another $21 million from IRT in equipment, $34 million from BRT in construction, and another $26 million from BRT in equipment.  When completed, the line would triple in capacity to supply roughly 1 billion trips to 3 billion trips, adding 334 miles of track to the already existing 303 miles of track.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = The Dual System of Rapid Transit| url=http://www.nycsubway.org/articles/psc_dual_system_rapid_transit_1912.html| accessdate = 11 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Obviously, the ramifications of the Dual Contracts was enormous.  The city had been able to unite the two lines, allowing for greater integration in the system as a whole.  Ridership was steadily increasing and only started showing signs of slowing by 1916, breaking the 1 billion rides per year in 1917, 1.5 billion in 1922 and capping off at 2 billion in 1929.  Furthermore, the city was able to recoup more of its losses through deriving some of the profits from the companies and began drawing up plans for its own subway line, the Independent Subway System ([[w:Independent Subway System|IND]]).

Unfortunately, not all parties benefited from this equally.  In terms of splitting up Queens, while the city had made it so both IRT and BRT had to share the two lines built, both of the lines were built to IRT specifications.  This meant that in order for a BRT customer to get to Queens, they must switch trains at Queens Borough Plaza - the new hub for Queens travel.  For both companies, problems arose with the fixed fare price.  Since the fare did not change with respect to inflation, both companies lost huge amounts of revenue at the end of [[w:World War I|World War I]] due to the extreme inflation seen post war, even with the increasing ridership both during and afterwards.  This would actually push the BRT into bankruptcy in 1923, but got reincorporated as the Brooklyn-Manhattan Transit Corporation ([[w:Brooklyn-Manhattan Transit Corporation|BMT]]).  The Dual Contracts had both brought about the greatest expansion in history, which could not have been achieved by either of the major rail companies at the time, but also set the stage for eventual decline.

==Market Saturation: The Unrealized 2nd Ave Line==
By 1929, the market for rapid transit had reached saturation within New York City.  At that point all of the lines agreed upon in the Dual Contract had been completed and the city was looking for future projects to start construction on.  When the city began proposed its list of future construction projects, most of the construction was to extend lines out into Queens and to interconnect the IRT and BMT lines.  Most projects never came to realization, though, due to the Great Depression.  While some of the smaller projects were completed over the period of a decade, the only major project to come to completion was the [[w:IND Eighth Avenue Line|IND Eighth Avenue Line]]: the first publicly owned subway line in New York City.  Up to this point, the city was still only obtaining a fraction of the profits that IRT and BRT/BMT lines had been getting for decades and decided that it would build its own, rather extravagant, line.  In 1925, construction had begun and wouldn't be complete until 1933 due to its complicated design which included [[w:flying junctions|flying junctions]] and a highly integrated system.  These costs would triple the amount of debt held by the government: the project cost $191 million and was entirely financed by the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Crowell | first = Paul | title = Gay Midnight Crowds Rides First Trains in New Subway | newspaper = The New York Times | location = New York| date = 10 September 1932 | url = http://www.nycsubway.org/articles/nytimes-1932-indopen.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Almost on cue, the Great Depression eliminates any chance the IND line had on making profits, to which by 1940 the IRT and BMT were bought out by the municipal government.  Neither the IRT or the BMT could cope with both the loss in ridership and the inability to change the fare price.  Within 30 years, the subway industry that began from a $30 million project, garnered over $347 million in investments

While the IND was able to come to fruition, a subway running on what was the 2nd Avenue elevated rail line never came to fruition.  Yet, because of its continued stay in the limelight, 70 years after it had been proposed, the [[w:Second Avenue Subway|Second Avenue Subway]] has begun construction in 2010.  In many ways, the line came to symbolize how people viewed the subway system in New York City: a project that was never finished.  Even so, people are skeptical about whether it is absolutely necessary in what is already the largest subway network in the world; in a lot of ways the system won't be adding something as monumental as the IND line or the lines made during the Dual Contract phase.  Yet after all the cuts the system had to make in the post War period, in the dog days of the 70's and 80's for the New York City subways were crime and graffiti were rampant, people are looking for hope that once again the New York City subway system is going through a regrowth phase, starting with the Second Avenue subway.

      <text xml:space="preserve">TOR only published instructions for the [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TransparentProxy VPN mode in Linux ], which is called transparent proxy, routing all network traffic via TOR transparently.

It is not advised to use Vidalia as it does not have sufficient system privileged by default.  First install TOR use one of the several distribution specific ways.  By default, TOR runs as daemon and have root privilege. 

In Ubuntu for example, add the following lines to /etc/tor/torrc:

:VirtualAddrNetwork 10.192.0.0/10
:AutomapHostsOnResolve 1
:TransPort 9040
:DNSPort 53

This will instruct TOR to forward redirected traffic at port 9040, and forward domain name server requests at port 53.  TOR will fail if it has insufficient privilege for the DNS port.  You can use any existing DNS server by omitting the DNSPort line, but this is not as secure as TOR.

To redirect all the applications' network traffic, there is the Linux firewall iptables:

:sudo iptables -t nat -A OUTPUT -p tcp -m owner --uid-owner bob -m tcp -j REDIRECT --to-ports 9040
:sudo iptables -t nat -A OUTPUT -p udp -m owner --uid-owner bob -m udp --dport 53 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 53
:sudo iptables -t filter -A OUTPUT -p tcp -m owner --uid-owner bob -m tcp --dport 9040 -j ACCEPT
:sudo iptables -t filter -A OUTPUT -p udp -m owner --uid-owner bob -m udp --dport 53 -j ACCEPT
:sudo iptables -t filter -A OUTPUT -m owner --uid-owner bob -j DROP

This will work unless you have a very old Linux distribution.  Only the first command is necessary to test the VPN functionality, redirecting all network traffic to port 9040, where TOR is listening.  The redirection ONLY applies to user named bob.  Once redirected, you need to restart TOR:
:/etc/init.d/tor restart
You can then login in as bob and fire up the browser for example, and check your external IP at any of the many proxy test sites.

User bob can be yourself.  In this case you need to reset iptables to the previous state when you don't need TOR VPN.  The other way is to login in as a different user whenever you need TOR VPN, where the redirection is setup to be &quot;permanent&quot;.

Redirection of DNS port 53 is optional, but more secure.  Even observers at your ISP will not know what websites you visited.  The other firewall rules block other traffic to prevent leaking.

The rules can be stored in a shell script and executed whenever TOR VPN is needed.  The default firewall rules will apply after system reboot.  To setup a user with TOR VPN always on, copy the above script to (for Ubuntu):
:/etc/init.d/bobsvpn

To further prevent DNS leak, in Ubuntu, you need to change the file content at /etc/resolvconf/run/resovl.conf to
:nameserver 127.0.0.1
This will force ALL users to use TOR as the DNS server. After changing network settings, sometimes you need to refresh the network interface:
:sudo ifdown -a
:sudo ifup -a
Naturally TOR DNS will be slower and you will want to keep the original resolv.conf file when not using TOR.

The firewall rules cannot be undone directly.  To avoid system reboot, you can store the firewall state before using TOR:
:sudo iptables-save &gt; rulefile
and restore the rules after using TOR:
:sudo iptables-restore &lt; rulefile

It is possible to grant priviledge to users who cannot become superuser, and to grant scripts superuser privilege without asking for password.  You can only edit the config file by:
:sudo visudo
If you make any mistakes, you may have to reboot in recovery mode, as root, to correct it.  Safe scripts can be given the permission not to ask for su password by adding the line:
:bob ALL = NOPASSWD:/home/bob/bin/scriptX, /usr/bin/scriptY

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
The United States Post Office (USPS) services 151 million delivery points in the United States. &lt;ref name=“USPSDeliveries”&gt;{{cite web |url=http://about.usps.com/who-we-are/postal-history/delivery-points-1905-2010.htm |title=Delivery Points, 1905 to 2010, in Millions |month=January |year=2011 |publisher=Historian, United States Postal Service |accessdate=7 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This network of mailboxes, post offices, sorting facilities, and delivery trucks provides the means for any individual or business to ship goods or information from one destination to another. As electronic means of transmitting information increase in availability and decrease in cost, it is reasonable to expect that this physical postal network will decline in relevance over time.  This article examines historical data on the number of post offices in the United States and the volume of mail handled by the post office to identify a birth, growth, maturity, and decline lifecycle for the postal service mode of transport.

===Postal Service as a transportation mode===
Centralized postal service is a coordinated transport system that physically moves goods and information between destinations.  It is essentially a freight system that is accessible to any individual or business. 

Monopoly and service obligation

====Sub-modes: Post offices vs. home delivery====
The postal service's deployment model originally was a network of post offices and transshipment in between them.  Post office customers were responsible for bringing mail to the post office and for picking up their letters and parcels from general delivery to their local post office.

In the 1860's, the postal service started to deploy home/business delivery within urbanized areas. This enabled the closing of post offices, as there was less demand for customer assistance in the post office. Each post office as able to serve a larger area and population base because a network of carriers was deployed to distribute the mail to people's homes and offices.

In the 1890's, the post office began to experiment with rural home delivery to see if it would be feasible. By 1901, rural home delivery was the postal service's official policy.  At this point, the number of post offices in the United States began to contract as larger and larger portions of the country were connected to this home delivery network.

This shift from an exclusively post office-oriented network to an expanded point-to-point network connecting all residents is essentially a mode shift within the postal system.  It altered the primary role post offices played in the system, shifting their role from a public face and a distribution point to a logistics center coordinating postal carriers,  The average number of people to post office continued to increase with population growth and post office consolidation.

===Enabling modes===
Postal service evolved over time to incorporate technological advancements.  What started as a horse and carriage operation incorporated river boats, railroads, highways, and eventually air freight.  

===Competing modes===
Technological advancements in information technology are supplanting much of the postal service's information-transporting function. The number of pieces of mail handled each year started declining in 2006. When averaged across the population, the number of pieces of mail handled per person has been in decline since 2000. 

== Data ==
===Independent &amp; Control variables===
&lt;math&gt;T = &lt;/math&gt;Time in years, 1790 to 2010
&lt;math&gt;P = &lt;/math&gt;Population, 1790 to 2010 &lt;ref name=&quot;Census&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.census.gov/history/www/through_the_decades/fast_facts |title=US Census History: Fast Facts |accessdate=7 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Census2&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.census.gov/popest/archives/1990s/popclockest.txt |title=US Census Historical National Population Estimates, July 1 1900 to July 1 1999 |accessdate=7 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Census3&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.census.gov/popest/intercensal/national/nat2010.html |title=US Census National Intercensal Estimates, 2000 to 2010 |accessdate=7 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Census4&quot;&gt;Pre-1900 Intercensal population estimates constructed using linear projection: &lt;math&gt;C_{Y+1} = C_Y + (C_{Y+10} - C_Y)/10&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dependent Variables===
&lt;math&gt;PO = &lt;/math&gt;Number of post offices, 1790 to 2010&lt;ref name=&quot;USPSdata&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://about.usps.com/who-we-are/postal-history/pieces-mail-1789-2010.htm |title=Pieces of Mail Handled, Number of Post Offices, Income, and Expenses, 1789 to 2010 |month=January |year=2011 |publisher=Historian, United States Postal Service |accessdate=7 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;M = &lt;/math&gt;Number of pieces of mail handled, 1847 to 2010&lt;ref name=&quot;USPSdata&quot; /&gt;

===Constructed Dependent Variables===
* Number of post offices abandoned &lt;math&gt;(PO_A)&lt;/math&gt;
For 
&lt;math&gt;T &gt; 1901&lt;/math&gt;, 
&lt;math&gt;PO_A = PO_{max} - PO&lt;/math&gt;
* Post offices per 10,000 people &lt;math&gt;(PO_{p10k})&lt;/math&gt;: 
&lt;math&gt;10000 * PO / P&lt;/math&gt;
* People per post office &lt;math&gt;(D)&lt;/math&gt;: 
&lt;math&gt;D = P / PO&lt;/math&gt;
* Pieces of mail handled per person &lt;math&gt;(H)&lt;/math&gt;: 
&lt;math&gt;H = M / P&lt;/math&gt;

===Linear Transformations===
Dependent variables &lt;math&gt;(DV)&lt;/math&gt; were transformed to facilitate using a linear regression model.

&lt;math&gt;Y_{DV} = \ln {\left \lbrack Measure / (MaxDV - DV) \right \rbrack}&lt;/math&gt;

== Methodology ==
===Model 1: Dependent variable as a function of time in two phases===
* Model 1a: Birth, growth, and maturation phase, all years prior to &lt;math&gt;Y_{Max}&lt;/math&gt;
* Model 1b: Maturation and decline phase, all years following &lt;math&gt;Y_{Max}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;Y_{DV} = 
\begin{cases}
 f(T), &amp; \text{while }  T &lt; Y_{max}\\
 f(T), &amp; \text{while }  T &gt; Y_{max} \\
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;


Dependent variables tested using this model:
* Pieces of mail handled, &lt;math&gt;Y_M&lt;/math&gt;
* Number of post offices, &lt;math&gt;Y_{PO}&lt;/math&gt;
* Number of post offices abandoned, &lt;math&gt;Y_{PO_A}&lt;/math&gt;, [decline phase only]
* Number of post offices per 10,000 people, &lt;math&gt;Y_{PO_{p10k}}&lt;/math&gt;
* People per post office, &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt;
* Pieces of mail handled per person, &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;

===Model 2: Dependent variable as a function of time, controlling for population===
* Model 2a: Birth, growth, and maturation phase, all years prior to &lt;math&gt;Y_{Max}&lt;/math&gt;
* Model 2b: Maturation and decline phase, all years following &lt;math&gt;Y_{Max}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;Y_{DV} = 
\begin{cases}
 f(T, P), &amp; \text{while }  T &lt; Y_{max}\\
 f(T, P), &amp; \text{while }  T &gt; Y_{max} \\
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;


Dependent variables tested using this model:
* Pieces of mail handled, &lt;math&gt;Y_M&lt;/math&gt;
* Number of post offices, &lt;math&gt;Y_{PO}&lt;/math&gt;
* Number of post offices abandoned, &lt;math&gt;Y_{PO_A}&lt;/math&gt;, [decline phase only]

==Results==
===Descriptive Statistics===
As evident in the Descriptive Statistics table, both the number of post offices and the volume of mail handled have already peaked.  Post offices peaked in 1901 when USPS made rural home delivery standard practice.  Volume of mail peaked more recently in 2006.  Post offices per 10,000 people was highly volatile in the 1800's as USPS rolled out home delivery incrementally.

[[File:Descriptive Statistics Population &amp; USPS Data.png|650px|Descriptive statistics for population, mail handled, post offices, and constructed variables]]

Notably, both mail handled per person and post offices per 10,000 people peaked before the absolute measures of mail handled and post offices.  Even before the rural home delivery policy in 1901 that precipitated the closure of many post offices, fewer post offices were needed to serve the same number of people.  This could be explained by urban home delivery, increased efficiency of operations, or better supporting transportation infrastructure.  Mail volumes per person peaked in 2000 and has been declining.  This can reasonably be explained by shifting information technologies and the rise of electronic transmission supplanting physical print material delivery.

===Correlations===
All of the variables presented in the Dependent Variable Correlations table have a statistically significant correlation with year, population, and transformed population.  The direction of these correlations is not unexpected: mail volume has increased dramatically over time and with increasing population, while the number of post offices has declined.  The average number of people each post office serves is positively correlated with population both due to the declining number of post offices and the ever-increasing population.  

[[File:Dependent Variable Correlations.png|400px|Correlations between absolute dependent variables, transformed dependent variables, and independent variables (year, absolute population, transformed population)]]

===Regression Models===

====Pieces of mail handled over time====
[[File:Mail Volumes Actual and Projected.png|thumb|upright=2]]
The mail volumes over time models demonstrate the significance of a growing market in the deployment of this particular transportation &quot;mode&quot;.  While mail volume has a strong and statistically significant coefficient in Models 1 and 1a, controlling for population in Model 2a eliminates the effect of time.  Model 2a fits the growth phase of these data quite well, with an &lt;math&gt;R^2&lt;/math&gt; value of 0.977.  &lt;math&gt;T_0&lt;/math&gt; values for Model 1 and Model 1a are reasonable given the parameters of the data and the qualitative history of USPS and competing modes.

[[File:Regression Mail volumes over time.png|x150px]]

Since the peak volumes of mail handled occurred in 2006, there were not enough data points to conduct a meaningful analysis of the decay phase while controlling for population.  Even though Model 1b has t statistic values with a magnitude greater than 2, this model should be considered with caution because it only contains 4 years of data.  Conversely, since the decay phase is only evident in the final 4 years of data, the overall models (Model 1 and Model 2) fit the data almost as well as the growth-specific models (Model 1a and Model 2a).

The &lt;math&gt;T_0&lt;/math&gt; value for Model 1b reinforces the decay model's weakness: 2010 is the final year of available data, so it is unreasonable to expect with any certainty that 2010 will indeed be the inflection point on the decay curve.  The decay model assumes that mail volumes will ultimately drop to zero as other modes replace it quickly, while it is easy to imagine the postal service retaining modest importance as other modes slowly substitute in.

====Number of post offices over time====
Unlike the mail volumes model, post offices peaked in 1901 and the overall models are not a very good fit for the data, with &lt;math&gt;R^2&lt;/math&gt; values below 0.355.  The coefficients are not consistent with our knowledge of the post office trends: Models 1 and 2 have positive coefficients for time, when it is evident from the graph in the descriptive statistics that the number of post offices has been in decline for over a century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Descriptives&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Descriptive_Statistics_Population_%26_USPS_Data.png |author=J. E. Schoner |title=Descriptive Statistics |month=October |year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Regression Post offices over time.png|x150px]]

Both the growth and decay models fit the data much better than the overall models.  The coefficients in Models 1a and 1b are consistent with the expected direction of influence and have strong t-statistics.  Controlling for population in Models 2a and 2b strengthens the coefficients for time, and they remain statistically significant.  Controlling for population also improves the model fit slightly for both the growth and decay phases.

While the decay model failed for mail volumes, the decay model for post offices uses a much longer trajectory of data and is consistent with the slow fizzle of post office coverage over time, rather than the precipitous drop the mail volume model predicted.

The &lt;math&gt;T_0&lt;/math&gt; values for Models 1a and 1b are reasonable given the parameters of the data.

====Number of post offices abandoned or closed over time====
[[File:Post Office Decay Models Curve Types.png|thumb|upright=2]]
[[File:Post Office Decay Models Actual vs. Projected.png|thumb|upright=2]]

These data only required Models 1b and 2b because post office closure did not start until after the number of post offices peaked in 1901.  

[[File:Regression Post offices closed or abandoned over time.png|x150px]]

This model fits the post office data much better than simply the number of post offices from 1901 to 2010.  Model 1b has &lt;math&gt;R^2&lt;/math&gt; values of 0.941 for the post office closure data and 0.747 for the number of post offices data.  Model 2b has &lt;math&gt;R^2&lt;/math&gt; values of 0.965 for the post office closure data, again compared to 0.790 for the number of post offices.

As apparent in the Curve Types image to the left, when transformed and adjusted to the same scale, the closed/abandoned curve more closely resembles the S-Curve function we are using to predict the birth, growth, and maturity cycle.  The curve representing the actual number of post offices remaining is the inverse of this graph, with steep changes occurring while the closed/abandoned curve is in the more gradual birth and maturity phases.  The next image plots these data alongside the projected values using the regression coefficient and calculated &lt;math&gt;T_0&lt;/math&gt; from Model 1b.


====Ratios of volumes and facilities to population models====
The final three dependent variables tested are all ratios of mail volumes or post office facilities to total population, so Models 2, 2a, and 2b controlling for population have been eliminated.

=====Post offices per 10,000 people=====
[[File:Regression Post offices per 10,000 people over time.png|x120px]]

=====People per post office=====
[[File:Regression People per post office over time.png|x120px]]

=====Mail volumes per person=====
[[File:Regression Mail volumes per person over time.png|x120px]]


==Discussion==
These experiments suggest that while the S-Curve model of predicting transportation mode deployment as a function of time fits relatively well, population growth is also a significant driver of deployment.  Controlling for population directly through the regression model or indirectly by testing the rate of mail volumes or post office facilities to population facilitated in isolating the effects of population versus time.  

The post office facility models best demonstrated the S-curve deployment pattern.  The growth models for &lt;math&gt;T &lt; 1901&lt;/math&gt; for number of post offices had high &lt;math&gt;R^2&lt;/math&gt; values.  Controlling for population increased the strength of the regression coefficient and the &lt;math&gt;R^2&lt;/math&gt; value.  The decay model for closure/abandonment of post office facilities best modeled the shift to home delivery and then technological mode shift.  Controlling for population decreased the regression coefficient but still improved the &lt;math&gt;R^2&lt;/math&gt; value.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Rail was the primary mode of mass transit and commercial transportation in the United States in the mid-19th century and reached peak usage in the early 20th century.   The first iteration of American railroads was the early tramways in New England in the early 19th century.  This system was mostly used for industrial purposes and did not carry human passengers.  Early tramways featured freight cars on inclined grades that were moved by horses as part of a cable system.  The tramways were located around quarries, mines, and factories to haul minerals, lumber, coal, and other goods.  Payloads were moved along tracks called gangways by horses and in later years by precursors to the locomotive.  Technological innovations to the locomotive increased the load volume each car carried and the rise in speed due to improvements in steam engine technology shortened the travel time from origin to destination.  Additional backing from municipal and state governments in the mid-19th century focused toward promoting the expansion of rail networks and tended to eliminate funding for canals.   

==Main Advantages of Rail==

Rail held several improvements over canals:
	
* Railroads provided more options for direct routes to urban areas and markets than canals 
* Railroads were available for service throughout the year compared to canals  
* Winters were especially difficult on canals in the northern United States 
* Railroads carried more tonnage as the technology matured   
* Improvements to existing canal networks were marginal 
* The widespread adoption of railroads improved existing technologies 

==Primary Markets==
The primary markets for rail were ports and industrial centers that gave entrepreneurs greater access to natural resources.  Business owners embraced the ability of railroads to carry raw goods more quickly than canals to processing centers, refineries, and other finishing shops.  As the rail network expanded the business of rail became lucrative.  Cornelius Vanderbilt began buying railroad lines in 1862 after he sold his steamboat business.  John I. Blair constructed network of railroads throughout the Midwest, including the Union Pacific, which served as an important section of the transcontinental railway line.  These two men are among the wealthiest citizens in United States history.  &lt;ref&gt;The New York Times. &quot;The Wealthiest Americans Ever.&quot; 15 July 2007. New York Times. 1 October 2011 &lt;http://www.nytimes.com/ref/business/20070715_GILDED_GRAPHIC.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Birth of American Railroads==
The rail network in the United States was expanding in the late 19th century because the innovation of streetcars and heavy rail was superior to canals.  The canal system began as a means to expand the enterprise of the gentry in early colonial America.  When remarking on a proposed canal from Philadelphia to the Ohio River during a legislative session in 1790 the Governor of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Thomas Mifflin, noted that route was “’a natural avenue from the shores of the Atlantic to the vast regions of the western territory,’ connecting ‘the extreme members of the union,’ and offering rewards beyond imagination.”&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, Ronald E. Canals For A Nation: The Canal Era in the United States 1790-1860. Lexington: The University Press of Kentucky, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;  The early canals were mismanaged and routinely ran out of funding before projects were completed.  

The Industrial Revolution brought the use of machinery into American commerce.  Investors wanted improvements in cargo volume and lower travel time from factory to market for their goods.  Modern factories of the time reduced production time for many goods and made workers more productive.  With more goods available for sale due to the innovations of the Industrial Revolution businesspersons looked to expand the scope of their market segments.  Improvements to the steam engine enabled capitalists to broaden the areas that they were able to sell their products.  Canals were effective for simple fur traders and for small agrarian areas but did not have the capacity that the growing industrial movement required for their businesses to grow.  Railroads filled this market niche and would later become the supreme transportation mode in the United States.

Railroads surpassed canals as the major transit choice for long distance travel though there was initial opposition.  Towns and canal owners resisted the new locomotive technology deeming it unsafe for widespread use.  Proponents of railroads included corporations that were looking to build economies of scale and towns that were in favor of the connections to order industrialized areas

==Growth of the Railroad==
The beginning of the second half of the 19th century marked a boom period for rail construction in the United States.  Track designers and railway entrepreneurs sought capital infrastructure investments from banks and other financiers.  Railroads became the first means of mass transportation.  By the 1850s there were large numbers of people travelling throughout the eastern United States.  The railroads may be considered the first instruments that produced a recognizable American character and society.&lt;ref&gt;Daniels, Rudolph. Trains Across The Continent: North American Railroad History. 2nd edition. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;



During the growth phase of the American railroad network there is a clear delineation before and after the Civil War in terms of the total amount of track.  The antebellum period from 1830-1859 was a time when the build out phase of railroads began to spread across the country.  The average volume of track in a given year in the United States was 13,015 kilometers.  The Civil War years may have affected railroad expansion considering the total volume of track was roughly the same from 1861-1865 with an average of 53,311 kilometers. From 1866-1877 the average volume of track rose to 96,388 kilometers.  

Figure 2 shows the annual increase in track volume.  There is a low amount of annual construction from 1830 to 1848.  From 1849-1856 there is a surge of railroad construction peaking in 1856 with an increase of 5,896 kilometers over the previous year.  There is a drop in rail construction through the end of the Civil War in 1864.  From 1865 through 1871 there is a large spike in rail construction each year with the zenith in 1871 when 12,243 kilometers of new rail was built.  Annual rail construction fell 75% overall from 1872 through 1877.

Before the Civil War there was an average of 1551 kilometers per year of railroad construction.   The post-Civil War average was 5917 kilometers per year.  This figure represents a 281% increase.  Figure 3 is instructive of the growth period for the American railroad network.  From 1880-1890 the US Census reports an increase of 73% in the number of locomotives in operation.  Freight locomotives increased by 69% and passenger locomotives rose by 80%.  White discovered that the bonded debt of American railroads rose from $416 million in 1867 to $2.23 billion in 1874 and $5.055 billion in 1890.  Most of the funds were delivered through domestic investors but there was increasing investment from entities in Great Britain, Germany, and the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;White, Richard. &quot;Information, Markets, and Corruption: Transcontinental Railroads in the Guilded Age.&quot; The Journal of American History 90.1 (2003): 19-43.&lt;/ref&gt;

Report on Transportation Business in The United States at the Eleventh Census: 1890, Part I.-Transportation by Land. Part I. United States Department of the Interior. Washington: Government Printing Office, 1895.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

==Mature Phase==
Near the end of the 19th century arguments were made for the nationalization of railroads due to economic reasons.  The rationale was that a fully developed railroad system was essential to the future success of the United States.  Improvements in the East would lead to control the food supply of the world as a result of the reduction of carriage on wheat and corn from Chicago to New York.  That reduction would enable domestic producers of grains and various goods to undersell Russia in Europe while wheat farmers in the Dakotas and Minnesota would see a rebirth in demand for their exports.&lt;ref&gt;Latcha, J. A. &quot;Railroads versus Canals.&quot; The North American Review 1 February 1898: 207-225.&lt;/ref&gt;  Figure 4 shows the continued expansion of the American railroad network though nationalization of passenger rail would not occur until well into the 20th century.  The expansion peaked in 1916 with a total of 409,177 kilometers of railroad track in the United States.  After 1916 the volume of rail slowly declines during the Great Depression era and the decline picks up steam as the United States approaches World War 2.

Figure 5 shows the annual change in track volume from 1890 through 1945.  There is a sharp drop in annual track construction beginning in 1906.  Railroads were becoming phased out in favor of automobiles as there is hardly any new rail construction after 1917. The period between the two world wars shows the outright elimination of rail or the addition of only several hundred kilometers per year.  Each year after 1930 confirms a negative change in track volume.

[[File:PA5232Figure5.png|500px|thumb|none|Figure 5&lt;ref name=&quot;The Bureau of the Census&quot; /&gt;]]

Evidence for the decline of railroads in the United States can be found by studying the number of railways in operation.  The number of railways grows from 1890-1907 reaching a maximum of 1,564.   The total number of railways in operation in 1945 fell to 517; a 67% decline.

[[File:PA5232Figure6.png|500px|thumb|none|Figure 6&lt;ref name=&quot;The Bureau of the Census&quot; /&gt;]]

==Conclusion==
The railroad network in the United States is not as prominent in the early 21st century as it was in the same period of the 20th century.  Changes in American lifestyle such as the dominance of the automobile and the adoption of the Interstate Highway Act of 1956 continued to linger over the railroad industry.  High-speed rail (HSR) may be a mode that will emerge into national prominence.  Federal spending must increase for this to occur because state and municipal governments do not have funding capabilities for HSR projects on their own.

The personally owned automobile has become a symbol of power, convenience, and economic well being in the industrialized world since its creation. Despite its popularity, growing environmental concerns over automobiles and their reliance on internal combustion engine (ICE) platforms has provoked researchers and manufacturers alike, to seek alternatives modes of transport.  One alternative, the hybrid electric vehicle (HEV), has garnered notable support in the United States since being first introduced in 1999 (Heffner et al, 2005).  

HEVs differ from conventional vehicles by utilizing a combination of electric and ICE components.  More specifically, HEVs use batteries, electric motors, regenerative breaking and reduction of engine idling time to enhance a conventional internal combustion engine (Reynold and Kandlikar 2007).  The parallel use of conventional and alternative technologies utilized in HEVs make them fuel efficient and desirable for those consumers seeking an environmentally friendly vehicle.   When compared to conventional vehicles, HEVs have lower emissions of pollutants and greenhouse gases (Bitsche and Gutmann, 2004).  

The perceived positive environmental impact of owning a HEV has created a growing consumer market in the United States (Heffner et al, 2005).  How large this market becomes is a point of significant debate within the automobile industry (Keefe et al 2008).   By looking at the annual new HEV sales in America, a clear life cycle of birth, growth, and maturation emerges.  Unless significant changes are made in what is currently the period of maturation for this mode, HEVs will remain a niche vehicle, eclipsed by the conventional automobile.

== Calculations ==
===Sales Data===
The annual new HEV sales and total passenger vehicle sales data for the United States was obtained from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) and is depicted below in Table and Figure 1.   

[[File:Total_Passenger_Vehicle_&amp;_HEV_Sales_in_the_United_States_(1999-2009).jpg‎|500px|thumb|none|Table 1: Total Passenger Vehicle &amp; HEV Sales in the United States  (1999-2009)]]

[[File:Passenger Vehicle &amp; HEV Sales in the United States (1999-2009).jpg|500px|thumb|none|Figure 1:  Total Passenger Vehicle &amp; HEV Sales in the United States  (1999-2009)]]

The substantial growth of HEV sales at the turn of the 21st century lead some experts to predict that HEV would capture 4% of the total vehicle market by 2012 (Haan et al, 2006).  However, current trending solidifies the belief the HEV's market share is minuscule when compared to the total vehicle sold in the United States (Jones, 2003).

===Saturation Calculations===
Proceeding calculations adapted from Levinson UM Twin Cities PA 5232 Assignment.

The data obtained from the BTS was utilized to estimate a three-parameter logistic function of the form:

S(t) = K/[1+exp(-b(t-to)] , where S(t) is the predicted number of HEV sales .

In the equation, K represents the saturation point (maturity in the life cycle).  To determine which value of K would best fit the S-curve of HEV’s life cycle, the following formula was used:

Y = LN(Sales/(K - Sales)), where “Sales” is the data represented in column 3 of Table 1.

[[File:Table 2 Calculation for Regression-predicted HEV Sales.jpg|500px|thumb|none|Table 2:  Calculation for regression-Predicted HEV Sales]]

{{BookCat}}
The K estimates displayed in Table 2 were inputted into the StatPlus regression analysis tool for Microsoft Excel to determine the slope (b) and tnought (to) for the equation: 

S(t) = K/[1+exp(-b(t-to)].  

&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
The K value of 370,000 had the highest correlation coefficient and R^2 of the values tested from Table 2.

==Before the Modern HEV==
The United States has a storied transportation history that has significantly shaped the urban and rural landscapes of today.  Today’s American urban centers offer a variety of bus, rail, and air travel services for its travelers.  However, the extent to which public transportation systems are available varies drastically throughout the United States.   As a result, many Americans rely on the internal combustion engine vehicle (ICEV) and the nation's mature road infrastructure for their transportation needs.  The demand for this travel mode is substantial:  roughly 17 million 'light-duty' vehicles are sold annually in the United States (Keefe et al, 2008). 

The conventional ICEV is powered by the burning of fuel to create the energy needed to propel the car forward (Reynolds and Kandikar, 2007).  This process is hardly efficient:  only 15% of the energy burned is used for moving the vehicle forward, the rest is lost in idling and engine inefficiencies (Berensteanu and Li, 2011).  The environmental ramifications associated with ICEVs range from carbon dioxide emissions to a greater dependence on foreign oil imports (Demirdoven and Deutch, 2004).

The excessive inefficiencies in fuel consumption and energy transfer has created a demand for an alternative energy platform to propel the automobile into the future.  However, one only needs to look to the past for inspiration for alternative vehicle platforms.  The electric vehicle (EV) was invented in 1834 and was widely deployed throughout England, America, and France by the late 1800s (Chan et al, 2002).  However, with the birth of the ICEV and its extended range and dependability, EVs largely disappeared as a mode of transport by the 1830s (Chan et al, 2002).  But, with renewed vigor towards producing more efficient vehicles, EVs were redeployed to the American market again in the mid-to-late 1990s (Jones, 2003).  However, the historical range and dependability limitations of the EV continue to plague its use in the automobile market.

==Birth of the Today's HEV, 1999-2003==
===Invention===
Despite the EV's failure to capture a large consumer base, manufacturers were determined to offer a technologically advanced yet fuel-efficient vehicle.  This determination led to the creation of the modern HEV.  It is important to note, that like EV technologies, the concept and creation HEV automobiles has been around since the late 19th century.  In addition, HEV technologies have been utilized by varying degrees via public bus services throughout the past century.  But for the purposes of this project, the author's reference to HEV is directed to the privately owned and operated, modern HEV.  

HEVs vary from EV and ICEV technologies by utilizing a rechargeable battery that captures energy loss typical in ICEVs and provides that energy for propulsion whenever the ICE proves to be inefficient (Beresteanu and Li, 2011).  While in motion, the ICE recharges the car's battery, successfully extending its range while maintaining fuel efficiency (Demirdoven and Deutch, 2004).  The hybrid motor's ability to alternate between the ICE and the electric motor, creates an operating sweet spot that cuts emissions while maintaining fuel efficiencies (Jones, 2003).  

The HEV's batteries are the key technological component and are essential for the HEVs long term success  (Chalk et al, 2006).  The way in which the ICE and the battery system is arranged within the vehicle platform can be broken into four categories. According to Chan et al:

*Series Hybrid System:  Simplest of the four and generally the least efficient.  ICE mechanical output is converted into electricity using a generator (2002).
*Parallel Hybrid System:  Allows the ICE and the electric motor to deliver power together or individually to propel the vehicle forward (2002).
**Parallel hybrid systems are the most common and cost-efficient of the HEV arrangements (Bitsche and Gutmann, 2004).
*Series-Parallel Hybrid System:  Combination of the Series and Parallel systems with an added mechanical link (2002).
*Complex Hybrid System:  More complex then the other three systems and is characterized by the bidirectional power flow of the electric motor (2002).

===Early Markets===
The first successful mass produced HEV in the world, the Toyota Prius, was first deployed in  Japan in 1997 (Jones, 2003).  Two years later, the Honda Insight became the first HEV sold in America.  That subsequent year, the first shipments of the Toyota Prius arrived in limited quantities to the United States (See Table 1 &amp; Table 7).  The limited production runs of these HEVs did not deter consumer interest.  In particular, the Prius developed a culture niche by offering early consumers the ability to 'make a statement' of social responsibility and healthy living via their ownership of the vehicle (Heffner et al, 2005).   Despite its increase in pop culture identification, by the turn of the 21st century, consumers remained limited on their HEV model options.  From 2000 to 2003, only two vehicles, the Toyota Prius and the Honda Insight, were offered for sale in the United States (Reynolds and Kandikar, 2007).

===Role of Policy===
Despite the environmental and fuel efficiency advantages offered by the mode, the HEV market had two notable challenges to overcome.  First, the cost of the HEV is more expensive than ICEVs of comparable size and class.  Secondly, a pattern of slow growth is typically observed when new technologies are introduced into a mature system.  Thus, consumer confidence was needed to spur the growth of HEV sales in America.  Starting in 2000, federal, state, and local governments implemented a wide set of incentives used to offset the higher cost of the HEV and instill consumer confidence in the new technology (Keefe et al , 2008).  Although the incentives were generous, they did not fully offset the cost of the price differential between HEVs and ICEVs of comparable size and class.  

The federal government incentive for encouraging HEV purchases was in the form of a tax deduction.  Starting with the Honda Insight, the government offered a $2,000 tax deduction for any newly purchased HEV (Beresteanu and Li, 2011).  This incentive would stand until being converted into a tax credit under the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (Ghallagher and Muehlegger, 2007).

State purchase incentives varied in generosity, duration,  and creativity.  Ghallagher and Muehlegger observed that:

*Nine states offered single rider occupant access to HOV lanes during peak traffic hours (2007)
*Eight states offered their own income tax credits of varying amounts (2007).
*Four states offered registration, excise tax exemption, or rebate (2007).  
*Numerous major metropolitan areas offered parking fee reductions or exemptions (2007).

==Growth of the HEV, 2003-2007==
With the aid in consumer confidence, purchasing incentives, and overall popularity, HEV sales continued to rise in America.  To meet that growing demand and to capture a larger market, auto manufacturers began diversifying their product lines.  Ford expanded the HEV market by introducing the first SUV in 2004 and brought the total number HEV models for sale in the United States to four (Keefe et al (2008).  In subsequent years, six more models from added to the market.  By 2007, a total fifteen HEV models from manufacturers ranging from Saturn to Lexus were available on the U.S. market (Bernesteanu and Li, 2011).  This substantial growth caused some analysts to predict that the total HEV market share of the passenger vehicles would top 4% by 2012 (Haan et al, 2006).

Federal, state, and local incentives continued but with some notable changes.  

In 2006, the federal income tax deduction of $2,000 was converted into a tax credit of up to $3,400 for HEVs purchased after December 31, 2005 (Beresteanu and Li, 2011).  This tax credit varied upon model, fuel efficiency, and the number of vehicles sold by the manufacturer (Beresteanu and Li, 2011).  Additionally, on a case-by-case basis, state and local HEV incentives were assessed, discontinued, or improved during the time. These fiscal incentives and regulatory pressures continued to spur HEV market growth (Keefe et al, 2008).  

The federal, state, and local incentives were not the only fiscal influence that spurred HEV growth, from 2003-2007, gas prices rose considerably in the United States.  Gallagher and Muehlegger suggest that high gas prices played a larger role in HEV purchases then the state and federal incentives did (2007).  Beresteanu and Li go further by hypothesizing that without the increase in gas prices witnessed during this period, that HEV purchases would have been reduced by nearly one-third in their case study area (2011).

==Maturation of the HEV, 2007-present==
The HEV market in the United States is the largest in the world with cumulative sales topping two million units.  Despite the impressive growth over the past decade, the HEV market remains a niche that has fully matured.  Despite diversifying the number of HEV models to dozens of models,  consumers are  not adopting this mode at the rates that experts were hoping for.  According to researchers, HEVs cost too much to be worth the initial investment (Lave and MacLean, 2001).  Others suggest that barring the invention of a more cost efficient battery (Chan et al, 2002) or a more lucrative federal rebate program (Beresteanu and Li, 2011), HEV sales will not reach the levels once predicted.  

The author maintains that HEVs sales will continue to mature and decline for the following reasons:

*ICEVs are becoming more fuel efficient and as a result, are becoming more attractive to fuel conscious consumers.
*The initial capital investment is not recouped over the span of ownership.
*Reliability and maintenance concerns continue to deter buyers.
*Gas prices have continued to lower since 2007.

==Introduction to Streetcars==
Three different technologies were used by street railways in the Twin Cities between 1872 and 1954: horsecars, cable cars, and electric streetcars. The power was the biggest difference between these three; otherwise they were relatively similar technologies. The street railways in the Twin Cities ran on standard gauge (1435mm) rails. Some of the suburban lines ran on ballasted rails on private right of way, but for the most part the streetcars operated on embedded rails in mixed traffic. Electric power was generated at several steam and hydroelectric power plants in Minneapolis and Saint Paul. Several small substations converted the electricity to 600 V DC&lt;ref name=diers&gt;Diers, J. and Isaacs, A. (2007). Twin Cities by trolley: the streetcar era in Minneapolis
and St. Paul. Univ Of Minnesota Press.&lt;/ref&gt; that was used to power the cars via overhead catenary. 

For passengers, the advantages of streetcars were the speed of travel, low cost, and the number of destinations available. From the perspective of the operating company, the advantages were the efficiency of vehicles on fixed rails and the ability to operate on schedule despite muddy streets and winter weather. 

The main market was the working classes. The rich have always had transportation choices, from horses and carriages in the early years to automobiles later on. The working classes could not afford these options and did not purchase automobiles en masse until after World War I. Streetcars provided frequent service throughout the day and were used for both work and shopping trips. Twin City Rapid Transit (TCRT) actively developed a market for leisure trips to resorts out in the country and profited from special event services to downtown nightlife, sports games, and the Minnesota State Fair.

==Before Streetcars==
At least in the Twin Cities, not much existed before the first horsecar line developed in 1872. At the 1870 Census, Minneapolis (including the City of Saint Anthony, with which it merged in 1872&lt;ref name=kieffer&gt;Kieffer, S. (1958). Transit and the Twins: A Survey of the History of the Transportation Company in Minneapolis and Saint Paul: an Analysis of the Role of Public Transportation
in the Growth of the Twin Cities. Twin City Rapid Transit Co.(Minneapolis).&lt;/ref&gt;) had a population of 18,079 and Saint Paul had a population of 20,030. Minneapolis and Saint Anthony had only been incorporated since 1858, and Saint Paul had been incorporated since 1849. The Mississippi River was the primary means of transportation at this time, and it was very effective at bringing settlers to Minnesota as well as carrying furs, lumber, and flour away. However, navigation was difficult above the confluence with the Minnesota River, short of Minneapolis, and the river was not a practical solution for intracity travel. A few people might have used horses and carriages to get around town, but most people just walked everywhere. This limited the size of both cities, since workers needed to locate within a reasonable walking distance of their jobs.

The first rail line, the Chicago and Rock Island, was built into the area in 1854. The first line connecting Saint Paul to Minneapolis, the Minnesota and Pacific, was completed in 1862&lt;ref name=kieffer /&gt;. At this point, it would have been possible to travel from Minneapolis to Saint Paul by train, but the line was built with freight opportunities in mind. This connection encouraged the cities to grow toward each other and sparked the development of Minneapolis as a milling center. These developments, as well as the rapid growth of the Minneapolis-St. Paul area from a couple thousand settlers in 1850 to about 40,000 people in 1870, encouraged local politicians and business leaders to plan for future growth. Saint Paul granted its first horsecar franchise to a group of businessmen in 1866, and Minneapolis did the same in 1867 although neither started operation right away&lt;ref name=kieffer /&gt;. On July 15, 1872, the opening day for Saint Paul's first horsecar line, the Saint Paul Pioneer wrote that the city &quot;has seen the necessity of streetcars to reduce its length and breadth of 'magnificent distances.'&quot;&lt;ref name=kieffer /&gt; This quote reflects the realization that both cities needed a faster mode of intraurban transportation in order to expand beyond what have become their central business districts today.

==Invention of Streetcar Technology==
Streetcar service began in 1872 with horsecars. By this point, horsecars were a mature technology, having started in New York in 1831.&lt;ref name=diers /&gt; They were a hybrid of other technologies, using the horses that were already owned to pull stagecoaches and omnibuses but running on rails instead of a carriage base for a smoother ride. Horsecars in the Twin Cities ran on tracks fashioned out of iron straps attached to wooden stringers,&lt;ref name=diers /&gt; usually at a narrow gauge of 1067mm. This led to economies of scale later on since these rails were being produced in massive quantities. The cars themselves were 3 meters long and the driver sat outside on a platform. The passenger compartment had straw on the floor and a small stove, but was notoriously cold in winter.&lt;ref name=kieffer /&gt; Cars frequently derailed due to the track conditions. Additionally, the use of horses caused problems. They were expensive to care for, had to be switched out after 4-5 hours due to fatigue, left manure on the streets, and had to be replaced when they died from disease or old age.

Although steam power was used on mainline railroads at this time, it was considered undesirable for use on street railways due to the noise, soot, and potential to spook horses. Nevertheless, the Minneapolis, Lyndale, and Lake Calhoun Railway built a steam powered line from downtown Minneapolis to Lake Calhoun in 1879, which was later extended to Lake Minnetonka. The steam engine was enclosed in a box in an attempt to address concerns, but it was still disliked and the steam trains were retired in 1890. (The line itself was taken over by the Minneapolis Street Railway Company in 1887.)&lt;ref name=kieffer /&gt; 

The next technology to enter the market was cable cars. Cable car technology was invented in California for use in gold mines and was first applied to street railways in San Francisco in 1873.&lt;ref name=diers /&gt; Downtown Saint Paul is in a low-lying area surrounded by hills. Many of these were too steep for horsecars, so the first cable route was built in 1887 up Selby hill.&lt;ref name=kieffer /&gt; Another line was built on E 7th Street in 1889. Most of these lines were removed a few years later, although the section up Selby hill stayed until a tunnel was complete in 1906. Cable cars were powered by a central power plant and could climb steep hills, but had a number of disadvantages as well. The cable ran in a slot below the tracks and cars could grip or release the constantly running cable to control speed. Although having one central power plant was good for efficiency, one cable break or a problem at the power plant would shut the whole line down. There were problems with snow and ice getting into the cable trench, and the cable cars were not very fast.

Electric power was the next advancement, and it went through several revisions before it was implemented in the Twin Cities. Ernst Werner von Siemens presented a third-rail powered locomotive in 1879 in Berlin. This was a successful technology, and third-rail power is used today in subway systems around the world. However, it was unsuitable for streetcars due to the danger to horses and pedestrians.&lt;ref name=crosby&gt;Crosby, O. and Bell, L. (1893). The electric railway in theory and practice. WJ Johnston
Co.&lt;/ref&gt; Charles Van Depoele in Minneapolis, and others around the country, tested electric cars with overhead power in the 1880s. None of these were very successful until Frank Sprague solved both the power collection and electric motor questions in 1885. His design collected power from a single overhead wire and transmitted the power from the motor to the axle through gears and bearings (as opposed to belts and chains, which were prone to breaking).&lt;ref name=diers /&gt;&lt;ref name=crosby /&gt; A demonstration line was built on 4th Avenue S in Minneapolis in 1889. It was so successful that both cities converted their horsecar lines to electric power between 1889 and 1892, switching to standard gauge (1435mm) in the process. The Minneapolis and Saint Paul Street Railways were also consolidated into Twin City Rapid Transit (TCRT) in 1891 to help obtain financing for electric conversion.&lt;ref name=diers /&gt; Electric power was 600 V DC, supplied by coal-fired steam or hydroelectric plants. As the system expanded, the power plants switched to AC transmission since DC can only be transmitted over short distances. Substations were built around the city to transform the AC from the power plants to the 600 V DC for the streetcars. After this point (1892), the technology remained more or less the same. The rolling stock consisted of 13.1m long cars with controls at one end and air brakes (after 1902). The vast majority of cars owned by TCRT throughout its history were homebuilt in its Snelling Shops.&lt;ref name=diers /&gt;

==Early Market Development==
During the market development phase, the streetcar lines served the entire urbanized area of Minneapolis and Saint Paul and extended beyond it in places. It is hard to identify a &quot;market niche&quot; during this period because the system served the entire city and could conceivably have been used for any trip purpose where the origin and destination were both in the same city. In 1890, the systems in Minneapolis and Saint Paul were connected with a line along University Avenue, capturing the market for travel between the cities.&lt;ref name=diers /&gt;

Functional enhancement was important throughout the lifecycle of the streetcar, but especially in the early period. As can be seen in Figure 2, there were four years between 1880 and 1900 that had a net loss of track. While the loss in 1891 was part of the shift from horsecars to electric streetcars, the losses in the other years were due to reconfigurations of service. The street railways were the first urban mass transit in the area, and the Twin Cities essentially developed around streetcar lines. Most of the streetcar lines were radials out from downtown along a particular street or set of streets. TCRT (and its predecessors) generally paired two radial lines together to form a route. This was so that cars operated through instead of terminating in downtown. Turnarounds and layovers could then be done at the ends of lines, which were not as busy as downtown. However, these line pairings changed over time.&lt;ref name=diers /&gt; Geography, service frequency, and logical destination pairs were considered for service pairings. As the service pairings changed over time, some downtown links were no longer needed and were subsequently abandoned, while others were added.

Functional development was key to the development of the region and the success of the streetcar system. Thomas Lowry, the businessman who merged the Minneapolis and Saint Paul Street Railways into TCRT, also had real estate interests. As a result, streetcar extensions were done with land development in mind and often occurred before the surrounding land developed. In other words, streetcar development led land development, and streetcar lines have also been shown to be a significant predictor of residential density.&lt;ref name=xie&gt;Xie, F. and Levinson, D. (2010). How streetcars shaped suburbanization: a granger causality analysis of land use and transit in the twin cities. Journal of Economic Geography, 10(3):453.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to 'streetcar suburb' development, TCRT attempted to capture the leisure market by developing lines to Excelsior, White Bear Lake, and Stillwater. The company built amusement parks on Big Island in Lake Minnetonka and at Wildwood on White Bear Lake. It also operated ferries and sightseeing tours on Lake Minnetonka. TCRT lines served the Minnesota State Fairgrounds as well as the baseball stadiums for the Minneapolis Millers and Saint Paul Saints. The company ran special event trips to serve these events and carried a significant portion of the people attending.

==The Role of Policy==
Since the horsecar companies in Saint Paul and Minneapolis were founded about 40 years after the first horsecar company, they had the opportunity to learn from established systems. Due to the status of the horsecar as a hybrid mode, it is likely that the first systems drew from the operational policies of stagecoach lines as well as from railroads. By the time of the conversion to electric power, TCRT owned many of the same assets as a railroad (rolling stock, tracks, shops) and its management were also involved with railroads. Lowry was the president of the Soo Line Railroad at the same time TCRT was converting to electric streetcars.&lt;ref name=diers /&gt; Because of the similarities of these organizations and the familiarity Lowry and other management had with railroads, TCRT developed the same kind of hierarchical structure.

The Minneapolis and Saint Paul companies began as separate entities, but followed a similar process. The Minneapolis Street Railway Company organized in 1873 and started building track. It was granted a franchise by the City of Minneapolis in 1875, and this was confirmed by the Minnesota Legislature in 1879.&lt;ref name=kieffer /&gt; The franchise agreement with the city specified the locations of the lines it was to build, the types of service, and set deadlines. The agreement gave the company a monopoly, but set fares and required the company to maintain the city streets around the tracks. These agreements could be, and were, renegotiated as conditions changed. However, TCRT never managed to get out of the fixed fare and street maintenance clauses, although it would have liked to.

==Growth of Streetcars==
The growth of streetcars was mostly fueled by private investment. In the horsecar period, the Minneapolis Street Railway Company chose not to pay dividends, opting to reinvest all of its profits in system expansions. The system grew very quickly during this period and regularly expanded into undeveloped areas in an attempt to spur development. Therefore, the franchise agreement with the city served mostly as a minimum level of service. The companies were interested in expanding well beyond what the contract required, but had to maintain service on their original lines. In general, the cities were supportive of system expansions because they allowed the population to spread out. As a result, the Twin Cities became characterized by houses and small apartment buildings instead of the large tenements typical of eastern cities like New York.&lt;ref name=kieffer /&gt;

However, when the conversion to electric power began, both cities required their street railway companies to electrify all the lines in a short period of time. Both companies took on debt to do this, and merged to form TCRT in 1891 as a way to get financing from eastern capitalists.&lt;ref name=kieffer /&gt; The conversion to electric power would have happened anyway, but it might have taken longer without the contractual requirement. It was certainly a good investment, as companies throughout the country that switched from horse to electric power observed an increase in gross receipts of 30-300%.&lt;ref name=crosby /&gt; An analogy could be drawn to the conversion of railroads from steam to diesel or electric power. The most important lines switched over early on, but less important lines kept the old source of power for years after the first conversions. TCRT would have been unlikely to keep horses around for very long since they were expensive to operate, but the company might have tried to avoid taking on so much debt without the public intervention.

==The Mature Phase==
As the system matured, it began to feel pressure from automobiles and two clauses of its municipal contracts: set fares and street maintenance. Henry Ford developed his first car in 1896 and others soon followed. The car was initially a toy for the rich, but as it became mass produced it turned into a commodity that more and more people could afford. The automobile competed directly with the streetcar for passengers, but the increased prevalence of automobiles also made streetcar operation more difficult because of the increased traffic on the roads.&lt;ref name=diers /&gt;

The fixed fare policy took away the flexibility of TCRT to set its own price. These types of price controls were common at the time and applied to railroads as well. For a period of several years, the fare was set at 5 cents. This meant that, even if ridership stayed the same on a particular line, it became less and less profitable as inflation increased the operational expenses. Fare increases had to be negotiated with the Railroad and Warehouse Commission and the Commission often refused.&lt;ref name=v1&gt;on Streetcar, M. M. M. C. A. C. and matters, B. (1952a). Reports. Number v. 1 in Reports.&lt;/ref&gt; When a fare increase was refused, TCRT had to respond by trying to increase ridership, or cutting service and deferring maintenance.

Finally, street maintenance became a burden in the later years. In the 1870s or 1880s when the contracts were first developed, most streets were unpaved so the street maintenance clause meant that TCRT was responsible for maintaining its own tracks and plowing the streets after winter storms (extensions were used to plow the right lane since streetcars typically ran in the left lanes). However, the way these clauses were written meant that TCRT was required to remove its tracks and replace them at its own expense if the city decided to pave a street.&lt;ref name=v3&gt; on Streetcar, M. M. M. C. A. C. and matters, B. (1952b). Reports. Number v. 3 in Reports.&lt;/ref&gt; This was a significant expense when Minneapolis and Saint Paul began to pave all their streets. It became even more expensive as automobile traffic increased, since streets needed to be repaved more often. On at least one occasion, the conversion of 6th Avenue N to Olson Memorial Highway, TCRT refused to replace its tracks and converted the line to buses instead.&lt;ref name=diers /&gt;

A report to the Mayor of Minneapolis in 1952 summarized the problems facing the streetcar system. Cars had taken riders away and increased the level of traffic congestion. The streetcar equipment was outdated and needed reinvestment. The franchise agreements had been developed very early on and now severely limited the actions TCRT could take to improve profitability. Finally, traffic patterns had changed faster than the company could reconfigure its network.&lt;ref name=v1 /&gt; The rapid development of suburbs after World War II was primarily responsible for this. This report and a subsequent one recommended changes to the regulatory framework and suggested other changes like distance-based fares.&lt;ref name=v1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=v3 /&gt; They recommended regulation on a metropolitan, as opposed to a municipal level, which was later implemented in the form of the Metropolitan Council.

The streetcar network is gone now, so the system cannot be reconfigured to meet the needs of transportation in 2011 and beyond. However, some of the lessons from streetcar operations are applicable to its successor, buses, and others can be applied to efforts to reestablish a rail transit network in the Twin Cities. First, government policies should be reevaluated periodically to see if the are still applicable to the current market. Policies developed at a time when streetcars had a monopoly on urban transportation hurt their ability to compete when the monopoly eroded away. Transit systems are publicly owned today, making negotiations about government policy a little easier. Next, infrastructure costs should be assessed in an equitable manner. In its last few years, TCRT was essentially subsidizing car travel by paying to relay its tracks every time the road was repaved, and by continuing to plow snow in winter. When it was the primary user of the roads, it made sense for TCRT to pay for maintenance and plowing. As cars became the dominant user, the costs should have been shifted to car owners, but they weren't. Today, transit mode share is very small in the Twin Cities. If an effective transit system is a priority, then the subsidy on car travel should be reduced by increasing car-related taxes or implementing road pricing. It makes very little sense for government to be subsidizing car travel and simultaneously trying to convince people to take other modes.

The data set used in this analysis is a shapefile of historical transit routes in the Twin Cities produced by the Metropolitan Council.&lt;ref&gt;Available at: http://datafinder.org/metadata/HistoricalTransitRoutes.htm&lt;/ref&gt; This file has separate records for each link in the regional transit network from 1872 to 1954 showing the year the link opened and the year it shut down. Horsecars, cable cars, streetcars, ferries, and 1948 bus routes are included. The bus routes were eliminated for this analysis since they were a replacement technology, but the ferries were left in since there were relatively few of them and they developed and were operated in conjunction with the streetcars. Using the shapefile, the length of each segment was computed and the file was dissolved by starting year, then by ending year to obtain the length of track added or subtracted from the system each year. The track kilometrage in the system is displayed in Figure 1 and the change each year is shown in Figure 2. These values represent centerline mileage, so two tracks on the same street are not double counted. This measure might be more accurately described as system extent as opposed to kilometers of track.

The curve parameters are shown in Table 1. Because streetcars have gone through birth, growth, maturity, and decline already, K, the carrying capacity, was already known to be 602.162km. A three parameter logistic function of the form &lt;math&gt;S(t)=\frac{K}{1+e^{-b(t-t_{0})}}&lt;/math&gt; was fitted to the data. This was done in two phases: one representing system growth to maximum extent (before 1931), and the second representing system decline (after 1931). A least squares regression was used to determine the optimal value of b and to find &lt;math&gt;t_{0}&lt;/math&gt;, the inflection point using the relation &lt;math&gt;t_{0}=\frac{intercept}{-b}&lt;/math&gt;. For the growth phase, b was found to be 0.161 and the inflection point was in 1899. For the decline, b was determined to be -0.0586 and the inflection point was in 1974.

The S-curve for the growth period seems to be a good fit. The &lt;math&gt;r^{2}&lt;/math&gt; value was 0.928, the t-statistic for the intercept was -27.0, and the t-statistic for b was 27.1. Knowing that the maximum &lt;math&gt;r^{2}&lt;/math&gt; is 1.0 and the level of significance for the t-statistic is greater than 2, the curve is a reasonably good fit and the estimated variables are statistically significant. Qualitatively, the curve follows the data very well in the birth and maturing stages, but not as well in the growing stage. The rapid growth of the system in the 1880s seems to have happened around 5-10 years before the curve predicted it would. The halfway point, 300km, was reached in 1890 as opposed to the inflection point of 1899 suggested by the regression. By the 1900s and 1910s, network growth lags slightly behind what the curve predicted. However, we can also see that TCRT made major capital investments about once every ten years in this period: large sections of new track opened in 1905, 1906, 1913, and 1914. Given that new lines tended to open in fairly large segments, we would not expect the data to follow the curve exactly. With a sufficiently large sample size, like all street railroads in the United States, the data should be smoother and might fit the curve better. On the other hand, some of the anomalies are caused by external factors, such as the financial markets. The slowdown in the early 1890s, odd because it occurs right where the logistic curve predicts the highest rate of network expansion, can be explained by the Panic of 1893 which made financing for large capital expenses nearly impossible to find.&lt;ref name=diers /&gt;

On paper, the curve for the decline period is also a very good fit. The &lt;math&gt;r^{2}&lt;/math&gt; value was 0.928, the t-statistic for the intercept was 16.28, and the t-statistic for b was -16.02. The &lt;math&gt;r^{2}&lt;/math&gt; value is exactly the same, while the t-statistics are lower but well above the statistically significant threshold. Qualitatively, the curve is not such a good fit because it is nowhere close to the starting and ending points. However, because these are only two points, the least squares method favors a curve that best matches the rest of the data. Looking at what actually happened, a negative exponential function might better represent the decline. In any case, the regression produced a curve that represents the slow decline of the system in the 1930s and 1940s. The facts that this curve's inflection point is in 1974 and that it would never go down to zero   suggest that TCRT's streetcar network was abandoned prematurely. This view has been held by several analysts, and is supported by the fact that several of the managers who oversaw the conversion to buses (including Fred Ossanna and Barney Larrick) were later convicted of fraud and sent to prison.&lt;ref name=diers /&gt; Canals and railroads, which are other examples of mature transportation systems, declined to about half of their maximum extent and have continued to operate. It might have been possible for TCRT to cut some services and continue to operate the most profitable lines, but public opinion in the 1950s was not very supportive of transit and especially not of streetcars.&lt;ref name=diers /&gt; &lt;ref name=kieffer /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">The invention and introduction of the automobile changed the world forever.  Today it is hard to imagine what life would be like without modern vehicles.  Our commutes to work, vacations, foods and goods would be drastically changed.  Having a personal vehicle is often part of the imagined “American Dream” and is a necessity in most American’s lives.  This mode of transportation was introduced to the masses in the early 1900s and has grown to become a part of the daily lives of Americans.

The automotive industry took off in the early 1900’s but has slowed in the 2000’s.  This mode of transportation has recently reached the maturity phase.  By looking at the number of passenger vehicles in the United States we will analyze and discuss the life cycle of this transportation mode including its birth, growth and mature phases.  We will identify these phases and comment on what was caused and affected by these changes in passenger vehicle prevalence. 

== Qualitative ==
=== Birth ===

In the 1800s transportation for an individual was limited.  Most people walked or used horses for their day to day travels, and carriages and sailing ships were used for longer distance trips.  In the mid 1800’s steam boats were introduced to the United States.  This decreased the travel time of goods and individuals and helped create powerful port cities along the United States waterways.  Trains and railroads were also invented and implemented in this time.  Railroads were initially used for passenger travel and cut not only the travel time of a passenger’s trip but the risk involved in taking the trip.  Crossing the country now took days instead of weeks and involved little exposure to the wilderness and natural elements.  Although both were monumental innovations the appearance of the automobile in the early 1900’s may be the biggest change the world has seen in transportation &lt;ref name=&quot;R4&quot; /&gt;.

The automobile can be defined as any self propelled vehicle.  Although horse powered vehicles existed and wind powered land vehicles had been designed, the first documented automobile using this definition was created in 1796.  The vehicle, designed by Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot, was very large, steam powered and could travel up to 6 km/hr.  Shortly after this, gasoline and electric vehicles were developed.  These technologies evolved and were used on roads up until the late 1800’s &lt;ref name=&quot;R3&quot; /&gt;.

The automotive industry took off in the 1900’s and the United States became the world leader for most of the twentieth century.  In the beginning automobiles were very difficult to make and many companies who entered this industry did not last long.  Many companies assembled vehicles from parts made by different manufacturer and produced very few vehicles during this time.  In 1913 the Ford motor company developed the assembly line approach to manufacturing cars which greatly reduced the labor and time needed to manufacture a vehicle.  This in turn reduced the cost of the final product, from $950 for a Ford Model T in 1909 to $360 in 1916, and madeowning a vehicle obtainable for the average American &lt;ref name=&quot;R3&quot; /&gt;.

Personal vehicles were enticing to the average American for a number of reasons.  Current railroads could only go where tracks had been laid and lacked the freedom that an automobile allowed.  Different transit options that had developed, such as the street car, held a similar constraint of only operating on a specified route or electric track.  Both cost a trip fare and operated on a set schedule which may not work for an individual.  A vehicle allowed for more freedom for when and where a motorist wanted to travel.  A vehicle also allowed an individual to purchase a cheaper home on the periphery of a city and commute for work.  This created modern suburbs.

Although roads and turnpikes existed for carriage use before 1900, paved roads were not prevalent in the United States until the introduction of the automobile.  With the introduction of railroads, roads were used even less and many were not maintained.  The growth of the road system was dependent on the growth of the automobile industry and vice versa in the early 1900’s.  More roads allowed better access to more locations for the automobile consumer and more automobiles justified more investment into the road system.  Before this time states and cities were responsible for the financial aspects of building and maintaining a road because they were the ones who benefited from them.  By 1920 all states had some type of road organization that saw to the financing, building and maintaining of a road system. The federal government took an interest in a national road system in the 1910’s when they passed the Post Office Appropriation Act and the Federal Aid Road Act which organized a national system and designated funding.  In 1956 the Federal Aid Highway Act and the Highway Revenue Act designated funding for an upgraded national road system.  The government was interested in such a system to move troops and other defenses across the nation quickly.  This road network became the current Interstate Highway System &lt;ref name=&quot;R3&quot; /&gt;.

=== Growth ===

The United States Army made use of automobiles during World War I which increased demand and pushed innovation.  After the assembly line method of production became standard other companies became involved in the market.  This gave the consumer more variety to choose from which increased competition.  The 1920’s saw many innovations in automobile technology.  Mechanical brakes were installed on vehicles, four wheel drive was created and safety glass that was harder to break was used in vehicles.  Passenger comfort was also considered when upgrading a vehicle.  By the end of the 1920’s most vehicles were enclosed and some even had heaters.  Because of these types of innovation a new class of luxury cars identified itself above standard vehicles as a status symbol for some.  Companies needed to come up with new innovations such as this to compete for the growing demand &lt;ref name=&quot;R6&quot; /&gt;.

After World War I the great depression hit which caused smaller companies to close down.  Because of the large investments needed to get an automobile plant and assembly line running many large companies became the front runners of the industry.  The 1920s and 1930s was when the Big Three in the United States, Ford, General Motors and Chrysler, began to dominate the market.  Ford was already a powerhouse in the automobile industry.  During this time Chrysler took over multiple companies including Maxwell Motor Company and the Dodge Brothers Company.  General Motors became more efficient by reorganizing it management structure and taking over Buick, Cadillac and other smaller firms.

The market still saw innovation in the types of automobiles being offered.  The body of vehicles became more designed during the 1930’s and aerodynamics where considered.  Car radios, automatics transmission and larger engines, up to a V-16, were also on the market in the 1930’s.

Both during and after World War II the economy bounced back from the great depression and consumer demand for personal vehicles increased.  With the new interstate highway system in place there were few constraints on where a motorist could travel.  The market seemed almost as big as how many drivers were in the United States.  Early vehicles were wearing out and some consumers had already “used up” multiple vehicles.  The used car market began.

A few other factors influenced the growth of the number of passenger vehicles in the United States during the beginning of growth period.  Using credit and payment plans to finance a vehicle were used early on as a way to make the personal automobile more affordable for the masses.  In an example of a positive feedback loop, many commercial businesses were being designed to be accessed by passenger vehicles such as malls and drive through restaurants.  People would buy vehicles to utilize these businesses thus increasing the demand for the type of business &lt;ref name=&quot;R6&quot; /&gt;.

The amount of growth begins to decrease in the 1960s.  This is in part due to the fact that those who needed a personal vehicle had probably already purchased a vehicle.  There were less first time vehicle owners than before.  The Vehicle Air Pollution and Control Act of 1965 set a limit for automobile emissions.  This and other safety requirements for vehicles may have caused an increase in cost due to the added features which would lessen the number of vehicles sold.  The 1970’s and 80’s saw an economic depression in the United States that would also slow the consumption of personal vehicles as individuals look for cheaper modes of transportation.  Many of the countries automakers were affected by the economic troubles and downsized their plants and employees.  Some needed to be bailed out by the federal government to continue to function in the US market  &lt;ref name=&quot;R7&quot; /&gt;.  The last big innovation in passenger vehicles occurred in the 1980s.  The creation of computers allowed this technology to be used in vehicles.  Passenger vehicles now had automated computer systems built in that could monitor vehicle functions and aid technicians in diagnosing malfunctions. 

=== Maturity ===

The market reached maturity in the mid 1990’s when the rate of growth of number of passenger vehicles slowed considerable.  Although small innovations in aesthetics, comfort and safety features are still being developed, few innovations affect the entire industry such as those during the birth and growth phase.  Some industry changing technologies are being researched within the market of passenger vehicles, such as long lasting electric cars and high fuel efficient vehicles, but no other mode of transportation looks to be competing with the passenger vehicle in the near future.  

If these new technologies were perfected and made efficient enough to compete with the combustible engine, a new growth segment of the mode may occur.  The costs, both initial and operational, of the vehicle containing the new technology would have to be comparable to current combustible engines.  This could also occur if the world runs out of fossil fuels and then a new or modified mode would arise to take the passenger vehicles place regardless of cost.

The companies in the automotive industry are moderately set.  No new companies have entered the market in decades, although foreign made vehicles are competing now more than ever with American products.  The Big Three are still the same as in the 1930s, and even though they have had some economic troubles, the government helps support them because their collapse would have large negative effects on the national economy &lt;ref name=&quot;R3&quot; /&gt;.

“Lock-in” has constrained adaptations in the passenger vehicle.  Road design is highly regulated on a national level.  The design of the standard road sets a vehicles width, speed and other design features.  Federal laws on safety and emission standards have made some vehicle features standard that may not have been present without the requirement laws.  Consumer expectations also create a type of “lock-in”.  If a new vehicle or feature varies too widely from the current alternative, consumers may be hesitant to switch to the new product.  New features may also cause issues regarding the maintenance of a vehicle if a mechanic is unfamiliar with the technology.

[[File:Hmwk3 1 data.png|frame|none|Table 1: Number of Passenger Vehicles in the United States per year &lt;ref name=&quot;R1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;R2&quot; /&gt;]]

The data from this analysis comes from two sources.  The 1960 to 2008 data comes from the Research and Innovative Technology Administration of the Bureau of Transportation Statistics.  This is a federal government organization that collects and distributes different transportation statistics.  The 1895 to 1929 data comes from a picture of a document, possible an almanac, which lists the number of passenger cars.  This picture is posted on railsandtrails.com, a small website made by a transportation enthusiast.  Although not knowing the source of this data may cause some uncertainty of the results, the data fits the expected curve formed by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics data.  Accurate data could not be found for 1940 or 1950.  It is estimated that the number of passenger vehicles in the United States still grew during these times although some lasting effects of the Great Depression may have slowed the market in the 1940s. 

=== Method ===
[[File:Hmwk3 chart.png|500px|thumb|none|Figure 1: Number of Passenger Vehicles in the United States with Best Fit Curve]]

The fit line was found using the equation Passenger Vehicles=K/(1+e^(-b(t-t_0)) ) where K is the saturation level, b is a coefficient, t is the year and t0 is the point of inflection on the curve.  An initial estimate K,b, and t0 were chosen and then the Solver analysis in Microsoft excel was used to change K and b to minimize the difference in the found and calculated number of vehicles.  The inflection point to was estimated to be around 1962.  Once solver had been ran the values for K and b were about 137 million and -.093 respectively.

A regression analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel.  This analysis found that R2 was .96 which means that the fit line is a good fit to the actual data.  There are two points on the graph that a discrepancy between the fit and data line can be seen.  Again, accurate data from 1940s and 1950s could not be found which may cause the difference seen at the beginning of the growth period.  The actual data exceeds the estimated data in the late 1980s and early 1990s on the chart and varies some from there.  This is where the mode reaches maturity.  This may be due to some settling into maturity.  The economy was good during this time which may have spurred market growth.  The drop could be due to the increasing awareness of environmental issues with vehicle emissions. 
 
=== Birth ===

By looking at the chart Number of Passenger Vehicles in the United States, the birth phase can be seen from 1895 to about 1920.  Although the automobile existed before 1895, they were not produced for consumers in the United States until about this time.  During this time the market for vehicles was being established as people became accustom to a technology that was unlike anything they had seen.  Paved roads were being built which would allow a vehicle owner to travel to more places.  

=== Growth ===

The growth begins a bit before 1920 which coincides with the creation of the assembly line and subsequent drop in price of the automobile making it a commodity priced for the average American.  The growth continues to be positive until the early 1960s and then slowly decreases until the 1990’s when there is a drastic decrease in growth.  Many factors contributed to the growth of the number of passenger vehicles in the United States at this time.  During this time major innovations in automobile technology were invented.  Personal automobiles were being marketed to Americans successfully as a must have item.  The middle class in the United States was getting larger and moving outside of the city to where a vehicle was one of few options for transportation needs.  

=== Maturity ===

The mature phase seems to start around 1990.  During this time the market had become saturated.  Most people who wanted vehicles had them, and no drastically new innovations occurred which made previous models obsolete.  New vehicles were still being sold when new drivers came of age and old vehicles wore out or were destroyed but at a much slower rate than before.  Household incomes have still not increased enough to make owning multiple vehicles an option for most Americans.

It is doubtful that the number of passenger vehicles will see a decay phase.  Americans have become dependent on personal vehicles and many would consider it a large cut in their standard of living to do without.  Unless a new mode of transportation is created, passenger vehicles are probably here to stay in the United States.

== Conclusion ==

Using the fit equation Passenger Vehicles=K/(1+e^(-b(t-t_0)) )  as  Passenger Vehicles=137000000/(1+e^(-.0925(t-1962)) ) provides a good fit for the number of passenger vehicles in the United States, shown by an R2 value of .96.  The data shows a mature mode of transportation with a birth, growth and mature phase.  This shows that passenger vehicles have probably completed their life cycle.  Many real life events in the United States throughout the century support this fact including changes in production, cost and distribution.  Unless enormous technological advances in passenger vehicle technology or the world runs out of fossil fuels, it is likely that the number of passenger vehicles in the United States will stay relatively steady for years to come.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== '''The use of Resistance Training in the Prevention and Treatment of Osteoporosis in the Elderly''' ==
&lt;small&gt;
==== What is Osteoporosis? ====
It is the decrease in bone density that enhances bone fragility and increases the risk of fractures and falls in the elderly. &lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; Bone re-absorption outweighs bone deposit as a result of osteoblasts becoming less effective due to aging, adding to age related bone loss. The composition of the bone matrix remains normal, it is bone mass that is reduced and becomes porous and light.

==== Possible Causes ====
The elderly are effected due to:
:* Inadequate physical activity - which causes a decrease in bone mineral density 
:* A poor diet
:* Previous chronic disease or injury [[File:Bone density scanner.jpg|thumb|right|125px|Bone Density Scanner]] 
:* Genetic factors such as race, frame size and/or family history may also have a negative effect

==== Diagnosis ==== 
First your GP will assess your risk factors for osteoporosis, including age, medical history and lifestyle.
Osteoporosis is diagnosed through a bone density test (Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry; DXA).&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; - ''(See picture right)'' 
It measures the density (strength) of your bones, usually at the hip and spine. The result from this test is called a T-score. This score will either be: Normal: (higher than -1), Osteopenia: (low bone density): between -1 and -2.5 or Osteoporosis: (-2.5 or lower) &lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;

==== Prevention Methods ====
'''The first indicator of osteoporosis is often a fracture. This is why prevention strategies are ESSENTIAL.'''  
:* Have a healthy dietary intake – in particular calcium and protein intake. 
:* Regular participation in physical activity, most importantly resistance training (''Refer to Table 1'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
:* Quit smoking and decrease alcohol consumption
:* Increasing your exposure to limited sunlight to correct any vitamin D deficiencies, or with supplementation
:* Falls prevention measures (as falls can lead to fractures)

==== Treatment ====
:* Medication to stop further bone loss and prevent fractures &lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; (Bisphosphonates,Strontium Ranelat and Monoclonal Antibodies (denosumab))
:* Hormone Replacement Therapy - Slows loss of bone but does not reverse osteoporosis
:* Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulator (SERMS)&lt;sup&gt;2,4,5&lt;/sup&gt; - Mimics estrogen bone sparing properties without targeting breasts or uterus.
:* Calcium and Vitamin D supplements &lt;sup&gt;2,5&lt;/sup&gt; 
:* Drinking fluoridated water - helps to harden the bones


==&lt;big&gt; Resistance Training in the Prevention and Treatment of Osteoporosis &lt;/big&gt;==

Regularly performed resistance training can offset the age related declines in bone health by  maintaining or increasing bone mineral density. &lt;sup&gt;3,6&lt;/sup&gt; Resistance training may also reduce the risk of osteoporotic fractures by improving dynamic balance, muscle mass and overall level of physical activity. &lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; Benefits increase with additional hormonal and nutritional factors &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

==== Recommendations &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; ====
[[File:TwoDumbbells.JPG|thumb|right|70px|Dumbbells can be used for resistance exercise]]
:*Pre-existing medical conditions, exercise progression and nutritional status should be evaluated and risk factor questionnaire. 
:*Exercise should focus on all areas of the body.&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
:*Less intensive exercise to start with. E.g. Using own body weight over a shorter period initially. 
:*Progress into more intense exercises such as use of medicine balls and free weights. 
:*Depending on individuals' capabilities, can add high velocity and power. 
:*An increase of daily physical activity levels in areas such as transport, walking up stairs.
==== Table 1. Resistance Training Program &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ==== 
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Intensity!! Frequency !! Duration !! Progression !! Goals !! Considerations
|-
| 15 reps of 8-10 exercises || 2 days per week || 1 or 2 sets up to 30-60 mins || Add a set after initial 2 weeks || 3 – 4 days per week at 10-12 reps per set || Avoid spinal flexion. Use slow and controlled movements. Target legs and back.
|}

==== Safety Considerations &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; ====
:*Warm up &amp; down 5-10 minutes before each exercise session, incorporating low to moderate activity, including stretching  
:*Allow 48-72hrs recovery between sessions, which will also lessen the likelihood of over-training
:*Arrange a motion for each exercise that is pain free.
:*Ensure they have had advice from medical staff and quality supervision by an instructor or medical professional.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== History ==
The early 1800s, brought a revolution to transportation that changed how the world fundamentally worked. Rail technology not only made commerce incredibly more efficient, it made people many times more mobile than ever before. Rail companies represent one of the first examples of corporate structure. A fundamental portion of these corporations was rooted in passenger rail service (White 15).

== Beginnings ==
Passenger rail technology evolved rapidly both in structure and in purpose. Cars that transported people exclusively began looking much like carriages and carts. By 1870, the passenger car fleet began to take shape and specialized to meet specific needs of the customer. In this decade, cars were predominately coach style with baggage cars being used concurrently (Solomon 53). Sleeper cars also began to find their niche with travelers taking advantage of the quickly expanding rail network.

== Development ==
1880 saw the fleet of passenger cars specialize even further as it expanded. As travelers began to travel longer distances and as rail attracted a more diverse range of classes, cars were created that catered to the entertainment and daily needs of customers (Railroad Facts 34). This decade saw the development of both Parlor and Diner cars. Parlor cars were required to provide the male gentry a place to commune and smoke tobacco. Diner cars allowed passengers to eat in a more formal setting than the coach cars (Yenne 103).

== Guilded Age ==
At the peak of passenger car era in 1930, 63,900 vehicles were in use (Moody's 58). Rail was the dominate transportation mode of the day and the diversity and size of the passenger car fleet reflected this reality. At this point, business men could work on the train while traveling in office cars. Mail cars had also been widely deployed as a way for the Postal Service to increase efficiency while subsidizing the rail companies for providing service, especially in remote areas (White 354).

== Decline ==
After 1930, the number of passenger cars began to decline dramatically. People in the U.S. traveled less, in general, during WWII and mode substitution became prominent in the post-war period. Automobiles and the interstate highway system eliminated demand for most short and mid-range trips. The aviation industry then eliminated the demand for long-range trips, especially from the profitable business classes (Moody's 804).

== Predicting Passengers ==
Predicted Passengers is calculated using the formula: S(t) = K/[1+exp(-b(t-t0)] K represents the theoretical saturation level and is 63900 in the case of passenger cars. T(0) is the theoretical year at which half of K is reached. The value is 1888 in this scenario. 

[[File:Passenger Car Table.png|thumb|none|500px|Actual Number of Passenger Cars and the Predicted Number of Cars]]

== S-Curve ==
This graph shows the actual historical number of passenger cars in deployment in comparison to the predicted number of cars using the formula above. The model appears to very closely predict the actual levels of deployment from the historical data. Using this model, we can generally identify the major life-cycle stages of the technology. 1840 to 1860 marks the “birth” stage of the technology as it was slowly implemented and fine-tuned. 1860 to 1900 saw the widespread adoption of the technology at a break-neck pace and can be considered the “deployment” phase. 1900 to 1930 is where the technology came of age and reached “maturity” as very few cars were produced while maintaining very high overall numbers. 1930 to 1970 witnessed a wholesale abandonment of the technology and marks the “decline” stage.

[[File:Predicted Graph.png|thumb|none|500px|Graph Comparing Actual and Predicted Number of Passenger Cars]]

== Natural Log ==
The natural log of actual numbers of passenger cars is necessary to run more complex regressions of the data. This shows a smoother curve of the data graphed a section before.

[[File:Natural Log.png|thumb|none|500px|Natural Log of Actual]]

== Regression Statistics ==
The regression add-in on Microsoft excel was used to generate evaluation statistics of the data. With an R-squared statistic above .9 and a very high t-statistic, this model shows a very close fit to the data set. This means that the deployment of rail passenger cars statistically behaved in a very predictable matter until maturity.

[[File:Birth to Maturity.png|thumb|none|500px|Birth to Maturity]]

When the same regression is run on the decline of the technology, somewhat different results emerge. The R-squared comes in high at .82 and the t-statistic large but almost half of the opposite side of the curve. This small but noticeable difference can be attributed to the rapid mass adoption of alternative modes which caused the decline to happen at a much faster rate than the implementation of passenger cars.

[[File:Maturity to Decline.png|thumb|none|500px|Maturity to Decline]]

== Conclusions ==
The number of passenger cars in the U.S. followed a typical life-cycle for a transportation technology and fits closely with regression models. It grew slowly in the beginning years as the technology as the early-adopters did fine-tuning and costumers became comfortable with what it had to offer. Passenger cars then exploded in popularity and became widely adopted as the standard for travel in the U.S. In the time around WWI, its adoption continued to grow but at a slowing rate as the mature technology reached its natural limitations. After 1930, other modes emerged in direct competition with passenger rail cars. Automobiles and passenger planes emerged as more attractive technologies and a mass substitution took place causing the number of passenger rail cars to decline rapidly.

It will be interesting if this technology re-emerges as a viable mode. Deployment of roads has been in the “mature” phase for a few years and the market appears to be searching for a substitution. High speed rail has been all the rage among transportation planners as a high-capacity alternative to highways. Only time will tell if HSR catches in the U.S. and the passenger rail cars see a new age of glory.

      <comment>/* Invention of the Accessible Buses */  Corrected typo, author intended &quot;while&quot; not &quot;will&quot;.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The market for handicap accessible public transportation, specifically flexible modes of transit like buses, have arguably been a public concern since the dawn of that mode of transportation.  In America the first large scale demand for accessible public bus transit likely emerged following the waves of disabled veterans returning home from World War II.  This surge in potential users coupled with a rapidly shrinking network of inner city trolley services created a niche in the transportation market that would take another 50 years to fill.  In 1990 the Americans with Disabilities Act was passed created a federal mandate enforceable by law, that would further strengthen the steps many municipalities had taken to provide accessible public bus transit for their residents.

==Quantitative Analysis==

The life-cycle of the handicap accessible bus is unique in that it modified an already existing mode of transportation rather than creating an entirely new mode.  The birth of this mode was not simply a response to the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1991 as one might think.  The Americans with Disabilities Act only accounts for the about half of the total growth in handicap accessible buses in service as of 2006.  Analysis of the data shows a likely inflection point (the time when the mode goes from growth that is constantly increasing to growing but slowly decreasing) of 1995.65, a time only a few years after the Americans with Disabilities Act was passed.

In fact this mode owes its birth to a growing market of handicapped users that pre-dates the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1991.  This indicates that municipal transit agencies where recognizing the need to provide transit services to disabled citizens long before the federal mandate made by the ADA and FTA.  As shown in the data in figure 1 there is a relatively steady rate of growth (the growth phase) from 1993 to 2001, although it is likely that the growth phase began prior to the 1991 ADA regulations.  At the end of the curve you can see the mode begins to enter its mature phase around 2002 at which point the number of accessible buses only increases by about two thousand a year.  

[[File:Life-Cycle and Regression Analysis of ADA Accessible Buses.jpg|thumb|Figure 1]] 

In figure 1 the regression line very accurately depicts the trajectory of the data as indicated by the R-squared value of 98.386.  This model predicts the mode will reach capacity at around 74,300 accessible buses nationwide.  Given the current trend of this line it is likely that this figure will be reach within the next decade however a rapidly expanding elderly population in the United States may push actual figures beyond the predicted capacity.

==Qualitative Analysis==

===Essential Technological Characteristics===

There is a long list of characteristics and measuring associated with providing equal accessibility to bus transit users that include physical changes to equipment and instructional changes for operators and users.  Part 38 of the Americans with Disabilities Act (Appendix 1) lists these and other specification as part of the accessibility standards for buses:

* Audible &amp; visual stop announcement (Section 38.37)
* Safety lighting (Section 38.31)
* Visual route identification &amp; audible announcement (Section 38.39)
* Harnessing, adaptable seating (Section 38.23)
* Hand rails, railings (Section 38.23.13 &amp; 38.29)
* Clear paths of travel and turning(Section 38.23)
* Right to assistance (ADAAA)
* Kneeling buses, ramps, &amp; lifts (Section 38.23)
* Handicap seating policies and signs (Section 38.27)

===Advantages===

Providing accessible buses for transit users has several benefits and drawback, for both the system and its users, some of which are clearer than others.   Perhaps the clearest advantage to providing handicap accessible buses is the resolution of the moral imperative this practice provides.  Because many disabled individuals rely on public transportation as their primary, and in some cases their exclusive mode of transportation, provisions for their use of this public amenity provides for the public good.  It also dramatically increases the productive capacity of these individuals by providing them more flexible and reliable access to sources of employment, shopping, recreation, and other resources.  It is also important to remember that these amenities provide access to public transit for those who are temporarily disabled, increasing the flexibility of the system to provide for a wider range of users. 

Another important advantage is the potential to increase transit ridership.  With public transportation systems across America constantly working towards increased ridership, both to cover operational costs and promote expansion of transit networks, those with permanent and temporary disabilities represented an untapped source of potential users.  Knowing that mobility can be impaired in a range of ways, it is logical that a disproportionate number of this demographic group has some reduced capacity to provide directly for their own transportation, due either to physical or mental impairments.  These barriers, discrimination in the job market, and other factors that economically disadvantage the disabled, make owning a specialized (adapted to enable a disabled driver) automobile even more difficult, further increasing their reliance on and need for accessible public transportation.

There are of course costs to increasing the capacity and ridership of any public transit system.  The foremost drawback is the initial cost of retrofitting existing buses already in service to accommodate the disable.  Additionally there are increases in costs associated with designing and building the complicated systems needed to make new modern buses and their stops handicap accessible.  Increasing accessibility will also inevitably result in reductions in system efficiency, with handicapped riders requiring longer boarding times, extra time for route and stop identification, and in some instances the need for driver assistance (securing wheelchairs, etc.).  

===Primary Markets===

The primary user market for accessible buses is those individuals with permanent physical disabilities requiring some assistance in boarding, seating, and off-loading.  Other markets include those who are mentally impaired, those with temporary disabilities, the elderly, and those who have other mobility barriers such as child strollers and shopping carts.  Geographically these buses tend to service the densest centers of population, typically central cities and areas of low income levels.  Additionally the expansion of transit services has given rise to handicap accessible Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) bus lines extending into suburban rings.  

===History of Other Handicap Accessible Transit Options===

The appearance of alternative modes of accessible public transportation is unique in their collinear evolution.  Since its inception, ADA regulations have required the modification of all modes of ‘public’ transportation for equal accessibility.  This created an environment of rapid collinear modification that essentially impacted all modes simultaneously in the United States.  Prior to ADA regulation, there was very little in the way of accessible public transit options due in large part to the high cost of retrofitting existing stations, vehicles, and other infrastructure.

Perhaps one of the most recognizable modes of handicap accessible transportation came with the advent of the van and mini-van in the 1960’s and 1980’s.  The introduction a private automobile with a sizable interior space resulted in the subsequent appearance small companies that emerged to modify these vehicles for handicap use.  The high cost of modifying these vans for handicap use has been a consistent barrier to access for this mode of transportation.  Because of the high cost of ownership small businesses and public services emerged to provide ‘by request’ service for those who could not afford their own vehicles.  Facilities with high levels of handicapped users such as nursing homes, hospitals, etc. also became early users of these limited modes of handicap transport.  The limited capacity of these vehicles, often limited to a single handicapped passenger, was another limiting factor to this mode capturing more of the market.

An important emerging market trend is the coming of ‘age’ of the baby-boomer generation.  As this large generation ages, their physical ability will continue to decline, a trend that will put increasing pressure on the existing accessible public transportation system.  Further compounding this trend is the increasing life-span of the average American, increasing levels of obesity, and to some degree the new generation of disabled veterans emerging for the decade long War on Terror.  Certainly these phenomena working in concert with local conditions will drive increases in system capacity and innovation.

===Invention of the Accessible Buses===

The principle technological innovations for improving accessibility have focused on both physical and operational improvements to buses.  Early bus modifications focused on improving movement in and out of the vehicle first with lifts and then with lowering.  Early lifts were of two primary types, integrated stair assemblies and dedicated.  Each of these early access technologies had drawbacks.  Integrated stair lifts occupied the stair space during deployment, preventing boarding by other passengers until loading is complete.  This type of lift is also difficult to deploy manually and been notorious for mechanical failures.  Alternatively dedicated lifts, while being more reliable and providing simultaneous boarding capacity, occupy large amounts of space in the bus that would otherwise be used of seating.  New boarding innovation has focused on level boarding.  Level boarding buses use a combination of sliding ramps and air suspension to temporarily low the bus to boarding level using the ramp to compensate for large grade and slope variations.

Other technological innovations have focused on conveyance of information to and from disable riders.  Stop request systems feature standardized mechanisms, multi-sensory indicators, and multiple initiation mechanisms allowing disabled users to recognize their stop, and access the indicate mechanism to convey their intent to disembark.  These include but are not limited to:

* Braille stop request button
* Audible signals from the driver
* Audible and visual station/stop name indicators
* Audible and visual stop indicators
* Multiple level stop indicator mechanisms

Signage standards for bus stops are also required to comply with ADA standards as shown in figure 2.

[[File:ADA Sign Requirements.jpg|thumb|Figure 2]]

Integration has also been a key sector of innovation for making accessibility improvements to buses that do not sacrifice efficiency.  For example most new buses have handicap seating areas that are integrated into the seating configuration of the bus.  This provides a handicap spot when needed and allows for standard seats to be folded down in place when the area is not in use for handicap seating.

Policy changes have also made for more efficient and standardized boarding and seating for all users.  The gentlemen’s rule is now a standardized policy for most transit authorities throughout the nation allowing handicapped riders to load first, disembark first, and sit in front of the bus.  ADA policy also dictates that drivers are required to provide assistance for boarding, seating, stop indication, and disembarking.

All of these innovations have been geared to increase efficiency while still providing a level of service equal to the typical able-bodied user.  One key distinction made by ADA regulations is that there should be no limitation to accessing public services like transportation, meaning that all users should be able to access all of the benefits of the transit service at the same level regardless of physical or mental status.  The requirement to avoid differentiation in service has impaired past transit efficiency, steering many agencies towards integration of technologies and standardization of processes as a means of streamlining the accommodation process.

===Early Market Development===

The transit market for disabled individuals was a wholly under-served market for decades.  This market has several segments, each requiring specific service provision to meet ADA guidelines.  Broadly these categories of users can be defined as follows:

; Mobility Impaired
: Primary needs include boarding and departure assistance, as well as restraint assistance
; Sensory Impaired
: Primary needs include stop and information indication and information
; Mentally Impaired
: Needs vary widely, but informational conveyance is a typical concern
; Elderly: Not necessarily disabled or impaired, but may need some assistance.
: Needs vary, but boarding and departure assistance and seating provisions are common
; Temporarily Impaired or Encumbered
: Seating provisions and in some cases boarding and assistance needs are common

Functional enhancement as required by the ADA, has serendipitously provided better transit service for temporarily impaired and encumbered users by mandating technological improvements that would have not been economically justifiable in other circumstances.  Similar benefits have also been extended to the elderly as a result of ADA requirements making public buses easier to enter and exit as well as providing priority seating.  

===The Early Role of Policy===

Although guidelines from the ADA and Federal Transit Administration do not require the immediate conversion of buses, the data shows that just a few years after the Americans with Disabilities Act is passed there are very high levels of accessibility across all bus types by 1993, as seen in figure 2.  This indicates that many municipalities had already begun the conversion process prior to the ADA requirements as a means of meeting the needs of local residents.  This is particularly true for the smaller and more flexible buses, seen in figure 3, which had in many cases already been converted for on demand handicap transport and para-trans operations by the mid-1990s.  Newer bus technologies like articulated buses had much lower levels of initial compliance with these standards, but rapid reconfiguration coupled with the mandate that new orders must meet with ADA guidelines resulted in a rapid increase in the percentage of accessible articulated buses by the year 2000.

[[File:Historic numbers of ADA Bus.jpg|thumb|Figure 3]]  

Because ADA regulations are the principle driver of change for this mode of transportation, and because the United States has such a strong focus on equal rights it is unlikely that policies were derived from other modes or countries.  Policy creation has instead been a continual process of innovation and refinement, often driven by the users (disabled users) who encounter new or persistent obstacles in their day to day activities.  ADA policies are created through an iterative process which looks like this (ADA, 2010):

* A user, agency, or other entity encounters an obstacle or anticipates a future problem and initiates the formal process.
* Guidelines, regulations, or changes are then published in the Federal Register
* These guidelines, regulations, and changes are then subject to a period of public comment and agency review.
* Final Rule is published in the Federal Register.

Nearly all accessibilities policies are sanctioned by government through ADA regulations.  As the mode of accessible buses continues into maturity operational changes and technological advancements can arise from embedded policies as long as they comply with federal regulation.  These regulations apply to any entity that is receiving Federal financial assistance from the Department of Transportation or any public entity that provides designated public transportation or intercity or commuter rail transportation, any private entity that provides specified public transportation; and any private entity that is not primarily engaged in the business of transporting people but operates a demand responsive or fixed route system (FTA, 2007).

===Growth Phase of the Accessible Public Buses===

The growth in this particular mode of transportation has been almost entirely driven by public sector involvement.  The high cost of technology per user in this market has been a barrier to entry for large scale deployment of accessible route-based bus transit outside the public sphere.  Although the public sector is the primary market actor, private sector participants may provide services provided they follow FTA and ADA guidelines according to FTA sections 37.7 which states that requirements apply to all over-the-road buses acquired by public entities or by private contractors to a public entity (FTA, 2007).  This and other details in sections 37 and 38 of the FTA/ADA regulations are important to the evolution of this transit mode because of their use in litigation action against both public and private entities.  

Lawsuits against both public and private bus service providers have had many functional impacts on the system as a whole.  A few examples of important precedent cases for litigation against both public and private transportation providers and their importance are listed below:

; Olmstead v. L.C.
: Relevance: The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) bars the unnecessary segregation of people with disabilities in state institutions
; Larry Beauchamp -vs- Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transit Authority
: Relevance: A case where plaintiff claimed ADA discrimination from an on-demand transit service offered by a private company as a supplement to the regular transit service provided by a city.

Litigation has become a primary mechanism for ADA standards enforcement for several reasons.  First the scope of ADA regulation is massive and would be impossible to enforce through agencies monitoring alone.  Second the ADA regulatory system can only be called on to ensure that initial design standards are met, any changes after initial inspection typically require a complaint report to trigger additional inspection and corrective action.  Third the ADA regulatory system by its nature has built in compliance monitors in the individuals it protects.  Users conducting their day to day activities function much more efficiently as standard monitors because of anonymity (not associated directly with the ADA or FTA), local knowledge, and repeated exposure to chronic offenders.  

Although this monitoring function acts as an effective monitoring for compliance mechanism it has also become a contentious issue over what has been viewed by some parties as over-litigation.  Business and small business owners maintain that this litigation is placing undo financial strain on their business do to legal and compliance costs.  In many instances their chief complaint is that the regulations are too complex and that compliance is difficult and expensive to achieve and maintain, especially for small businesses that are unfamiliar with ADA regulations.  These costs represent a significant barrier to entry for many private agencies attempting to provide regular or supplementary on-road transportation services. 

===Maturation of Accessible Bus Transit===

As the mode has matured and litigation concerns persist, attempts by the ADA, FTA, and private consultancies has been made to provide design and regulatory guidance for transit system operators in order to alleviate some of the complexities associated with the ADA and FTA regulation.  Additionally transit agencies themselves have in many cases created internal positions for ADA accessibility experts to ensure that all facets of the transit system comply with regulation.  Enforcement and maintenance of standards have also become inter-agencies roles as transit and planning authorities educate operators, assessors, and transit police on ADA requirements.

Although the standardization of accessibility technologies has made systems easier to use and understand these same standards have also resulted in the stagnation of technological innovation in signaling, signage, and loading mechanisms.  This standardization has undoubtedly permeated bus manufactures seeking economies of scale.  This combined with a relatively saturated market for accessible buses creates an environment which does not promote innovation in these technologies.  That said, the focus on expanding public transit networks in major metropolitan areas coupled with a figure of one fifth of the America’s population being disable (a number that is projected to continue to rise in the coming years) it is quite probable that we may see a market revitalization in the coming years.

===Opportunities===

While the accessible bus market is relatively mature in its life cycle there are still steps to be made in improving the system.  One key area of improvement is a more complete provisioning for the conveyance of information.  Specifically there are no regulations governing the conveyance of transit system specific information such as route and scheduling information.  This makes understanding the operation of system routes more difficult or impossible for those who are visually impaired.  Currently most systems rely on interaction between the driver and the disabled individual to convey bus number, where it goes, whether the bus is on time, crowding conditions on the bus, availability of other buses nearby that may better fit the user’s needs, etc.  This issue could be at least partially resolved with multi-sensory data conveyance tools.  Opportunities exist to integrate these tools with other high-tech bus management systems like GPS tracking and real-time updating station schedules.  

The maturity of the system, and the constant monitoring and threat of litigation has resulted in an environment that has necessitated the rapid maturation of handicap accessible buses in the U.S.  Technological advancement in accessible buses has therefore been largely the result of regulatory requirements rather than market forces.  The rapid rate of technological advances that punctuated early system improvements is likely to continue to decline while system operational and informational advancements are likely to yield the remainder of accessibility gains in the future for this mode.

==Conclusion==

As the average age and rate of obesity of U.S. citizens continues to climb over the next few decades it will be interesting to watch how accessible bus systems adapt to handle inevitable increases in demand over the coming decades.  It may be that significant system changes will not come until the mode itself is changed in some dramatic way, i.e. double decker buses may allow for advancements in different loading system technology.  Information technology may also improve system efficiency by conveying information more effectively allowing disabled rider to make more efficient system choices and transit operators to anticipate handicap user needs.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{book title|History of the Automobile: Ownership per Household in U.S. By Shuling Tang}}

==Technology Description==
The automobile is a four-wheeled vehicle used for transporting passengers with its own internal combustion engine. Although latest automobiles may be completely electric or use a hybrid power of both electricity of gasoline, the majority of them generate power solely from burning gasoline. It is usually capable of running at around 80 mph nowadays, subject to road conditions and speed limit. 

As one of the major transportation modes, automobiles are suitable for traveling at a distance beyond the reach of walking and biking. They are often compared with public transit including buses, trains and subways. The most significant advantage of automobiles over public transit is its high level of freedom. Automobile drivers are not constrained by fixed timetables, bus stops, and train stations. In contrast, they can stop and go wherever whenever they want. They can avoid the frustration of waiting. The freedom and better mobility create more job opportunities and recreational travelling for the owners. Automobiles also provide more comfortable ride than the public transit with private space and radios while public transit can be very crowded thus uncomfortable during rush hours. There are disadvantages associated with automobile as well. Automobile drivers may experience frustrations with congestion while subway and train riders are not affected. Public transit also saves the time and energy in searching for parking spots. In addition, automobiles usually raise greater safety and environmental concerns. 

With its high upfront capital cost and continuing spending in fuel, repair, and maintenance, automobiles are much more expensive than public transit. From the U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics data for the year 2000, transportation accounts for 19%, or $7,417 of the entire average household expenditure. Of that, private vehicles consume $6,990 (94%)($1,291 in gasoline and $3,418 in vehicle purchases).&lt;ref name=&quot;T2&quot; /&gt; The data not only show the high cost associated with purchasing and owning an automobile but also show the predominant place automobile is in people’s daily life. The target market of it aims at middle and upper class who can afford a car and those who have no access to public transit but live far away from their work or school. In terms of travel distance, extremely short distance that can be done by walking or biking does not require an automobile. Despite the fact that people do drive long distance for recreational purpose from time to time, airplanes provide a better service regarding speed and comfort at this realm. Therefore, automobiles serve somewhere in between, which is a range of distance that is too far to walk and too short to fly. 

==Identification of Developmental Phases==
===Method===
In order to find the S-curve and developmental phases for automobiles in the United States, data of the number of private vehicles in the United States were obtained from the Federal Highway Administration, U.S. Department of Transportation’s document “Highway Statistic Summary to 1995”. Yet since the population is growing in the United States, the increase in vehicle ownership in the States does not tell much about the development phases of this transportation mode. Thus, data of the population of the United States were also obtained from the U.S. Census Bureau for the period from 1925 to 1995. With the assumption that the average number of people per household is four, the data for average vehicle ownership per household (VOH) were obtained by dividing the total number of private vehicles by the population of the United States each year multiplied by a factor of four. And the VOH vs. year were plotted. 
To fit the real data, the following equation was used: 

:S(t) = K/[1+exp(-b(t-t0)]

where
:K: saturation level, which in this case, highest average number of vehicles owned per household in the United States
:b: adjustment parameter
:t0: the time when the growth rate reaches maximum and starts to slow down

The three parameters were adjusted to fit the existing plot as good as possible. The linear regression analysis was utilized. Because the guess function is not linear, it was rewritten into a linear form. The derivation is shown below: 
*S(t) = K/[1+exp(-b(t-t0)]
*1+exp(-b(t-t0))=K/S(t)
*exp(-b(t-t0)=K/S(t) – 1
*LN(EXP(-b(t-t0)))=LN(K/S(t)-1)
*-b(t-t0)=LN(K/S(t) - 1)
In a linear format, we have: 
*Y=LN(VOH/(K-VOH))=bt-bt0.
Several different K values were used to carry out a set regression analysis aiming to get R as close to 1 as possible. b is the X variable 1 value given in the regression analysis report. And the value of t0 can be calculated by dividing the intercept value by minus b. 
The tool Solver in Microsoft Excel was also used to minimize sum of square differences between the predicted and actual values to obtain the optimal parameters. The results were same.

[[File:Number of Automobiles per Household vs. Year.png]]
*Figure 1: Vehicles per Household vs. Year

The K value is approximately 2.54 when the error is minimized, which means that the model estimate the maximum number of vehicles per household in the United States will not exceed 2.54. t0 is about 1955, representing the year at which the growth rate reached maximum and started to decline. With the optimal parameters, if the prediction line is extended into the future, VOH will reach the maximum around the year of 2100.

==Analysis==
===Before the Advent of Automobile===
Prior to the advent of the automobile, people took animal powers for granted for short distance travel.&lt;ref name=&quot;T1&quot; /&gt; Shorter trips were made via horse driven wagons and carriages. The most important disadvantage of such travel mode is that it is very slow. Horses need rest, thus making long endured trip impossible. Although trains are much faster, railroads primarily only go through and stop at large cities. They don’t offer convenient service to go to smaller towns and take shorter trips.

The slow speed of the existing carriage was obviously constricted by the limitation of horses’ strength. With the rise of the steam engines by James Watt, engineers have attempted to apply the technology to small vehicles as early as 1769, though limited by technological issues.&lt;ref name=&quot;T7&quot; /&gt; As people have seen the rise of motorized trains, the desire for higher speed travelling not just limited on tracks but wherever they can grew. When the internal combustion engines came along in the beginning of the 1800s, engineers have been trying to motorize vehicles with them in order to achieve high speed. The successful results have led more and more engineers working to incorporate combustion engines with wheels to make a horseless carriage. 

===Invention===
Automobile is a combination of various type of technology. During its early period, it was basically a horseless carriage: similar kinds of wheels and shape. The biggest different is the power source where animal power is either replaced with steam powered engine or internal combustion engine or electricity, which all require technological expertise in physics and chemistry. In addition, without pulling the rope to tell horses to turn, automobiles were steered with a tiller. Steering wheels were invented later and became standard. The process of combining all the pieces together to make the automobile to work as a unity requires even more advanced mechanical expertise.

Early innovations with steam powered vehicles were hindered by a lack of capital. British engineer Richard Trevithick’s steam powered vehicle was capable of running at a speed up to 12 mph reliably. But he did not have financial support from investors to do further research and development. Similarly, the American engineer Oliver Evans obtained the exclusive rights to operate steam-powered vehicles from Maryland Legislature. Yet he couldn’t raise the $3,000 startup fund to launch his steam-powered wagon company because the onlookers thought the vehicle would be too slow.&lt;ref name=&quot;T8&quot; /&gt; Electric automobiles were quite popular for some time around the 1900. But soon the requirements for charging facilities, which were virtually nonexistent at that time and the excessive weight of the batteries outweighed the advantages. In comparison, gasoline can be supplied by any stores and was cheap then. As a result, gasoline automobile was adopted as standard.&lt;ref name=&quot;T8&quot; /&gt;

Many minor shifts from the original design came from practical experience. The first long distance travel was made by Karl Benz’s wife, Bertha Benz. Karl Benz, who was generally considered as the inventor of the first modern automobile, was trying to perfect everything before the next step, which made his wife frustrated enough to take the first trip with the her husband’s design. Her experience during the trip provided great insights into how to improve the initial design: she needed to buy gasoline to finish the trip; she needed to push the car uphill because it didn’t have enough horsepower; she needed to use her hatpin to unclog the fuel line; she improvised an insulator to solve the short-circuited ignition problem; she also needed to replace the leather on a brake shoe.&lt;ref name=&quot;T9&quot; /&gt; All these incidents contributed to improvements in various aspects including gears, material, engine, ignition, and etc. It was exactly these small improvements that added up to the existing predominant technologies such as new ignition technology, brake system, fuel tank, low gear for climbing hills and so on.

Initially automobiles were only meant for the wealthy as they were expensive to make. Henry Ford applied the supply chain production process to his Model T automobile, which significantly cut both cost and production time down to the point that everyone can have an automobile. And the improvements were sustained: in 1913, the cost of the Model T Touring car was reduced to $600 with 250,000 production that year; The cost was reduced further to $360 and the year’s production exceeded 700,000 during 1916; By 1927 when Ford stopped making model T, the cost was below $300 and over fifteen millions were sold.&lt;ref name=&quot;T3&quot; /&gt; Automobile manufacturers all over the world quickly adopted and further improved this process. For example, Japan modified the mass production to a more flexible one. The dramatic improvements in production process contributed to the quick growth that came later. 

===Early Market===
According to Flink, the major competition for automobile at its birth phase came from the cheaper and more reliable railroad and water transportation in the United States, which were heavily subsidized by the government. Also the improvement progress for public roads was very slow. In addition, the automobiles were quite expensive at first. Only the wealthy people can afford it. It was not until Ford introduced the supply chain mass production method to dramatically decrease the cost and time that his Model T became readily available for purchase at an affordable price to more people. 

With more improvements in speed and efficiency, more and more people began to appreciate the advantages of travelling in an automobile: it provided great freedom with much higher speed than the old carriage so that they can travel a decent amount of distance quickly and continuously. During the 1920s, a lot of refinements took place to make automobile ride more comfortable. The introduction of ethyl additive for gasoline in 1923 boosted both performance and fuel economy. Some sedans even began to load a heater. Automatic chokes, easy-shifting synchromesh transmissions and etc. made driving easier.&lt;ref name=&quot;T10&quot; /&gt; Better technology attracted more customers and more drivers in turn spurred the demand for improving roads and constructing new roads. Enhanced infrastructure for automobiles served the existing market in return while making the automobile an even more appealing transportation mode.

===Policy in the Birthing Phase===
The policies regarding the birth of automobiles were not all pleasant, especially in England. Under the horse-drawn transportation interests, the turnpike trusts that were in charge of the highways charged discriminatory tolls against motorized vehicles. In 1865 Parliament passed representing the railroad owners the notorious Locomotive Act, the Red Flag Act. It limited the speed of what they referred to as “road locomotives” to 2 mph in towns and 4 mph on the highway.&lt;ref name=&quot;T8&quot; /&gt;

When automobiles became more accepted, policies regarding the operational standard began to emerge. To ensure safety, the American adopted drive-on-the-right-side policy to avoid collision, which would be hard to change once the habit had been established. Speed limit was also introduced, varying by road types and states. Toll roads were applied to automobiles as well in order to finance part of the road construction and maintenance. Traffic signs were adopted and standardized using minimal words and mostly symbols to convey ideas easier. Any change in the existing acknowledged commonsense would arouse confusion to the drivers and may cause accidents.

The government also promoted automobiles by investing in transportation infrastructure, building new roads and improving existing ones. Such emphasis on automobiles would attract more demand for automobile while making the country “run on gasoline”. 

===Growth Phase===
In the growth phase, people’s perception towards automobiles has been clearly established. The wait-and-see mentality switched to reasoning of the necessity of owning an automobile as the primary transportation mode. Meanwhile, the government invested massive amount of money in infrastructure construction including the interstate highway system, which to some extent provided an indirect subsidy to the automobile industry. The technology established itself a convenient and efficient way of travelling, drawing huge demand. In addition, there weren’t much competition to it. The airplanes were still at its birth phase. The automakers all over the world were spending extravagantly into improving the technology and marketing. All the conditions contributed to the predominant place automobiles stand in the U.S transportation system. The federal government also provided generous funding into automobile-related university research programs aiming to further advance the technology. 

The drawbacks associated with such quick expansion in the auto industry were significantly increased carbon emission and fatality in the United States.  In the 1970s, the federal government began to control automobile design by implementing tight laws to control emissions and to improve safety, which caused a bit of chaos in the automobile industry in the mid 1970s.&lt;ref name=&quot;T10&quot; /&gt; This act led to researches in both the industry and universities to improve automobile’s fuel economy with the determination for sustainable development.  

===Mature Phase and Future===
After the growth phase, the automobile almost reached its peak as a transportation mode in the United States, as what was shown in the simulation. The results showed that there is still space for growth yet slow and minimal. In this period, dramatic improvements are highly unlikely while only polishing of the existing system can be achieved. However, in this specific case, because I measured the number of automobiles per household, there still exists demand for automobiles with the population growth. The industry will not die unless that there comes an alternative that will replace automobiles entirely. 

Automobile companies all over the world are pouring in huge amount of capital to improve fuel performance. Among them, the Japanese automaker giants Toyota, Honda and Nissan are especially notable. Toyota’s Prius has been the most popular hybrid vehicle that touted a 50 plus MPG. Nissan also rolled out its electric car Leaf recently. Alternative energy such as solar power can be taken into consideration as the future power source for the automobiles. The U.S. transportation infrastructure is so heavily dependent on gasoline that people often raise concern for the fuel run-out in the future and they also propose the possibility of using public transit to replace parts of the interstate highway system, especially the high speed rail technology. However, the lock-in effect made the possibility of using the new high speed rail technology widely in the United States quite slim.  

During the economic depression from 2007, the government nationalized General Motors and Chrysler in order to save the American auto industry and protect the existing markets and customers based on the reasoning that automobiles have become an indispensable part of the American daily life. The future of automobile in the United States may not change much in terms of design and technology, yet new type of uses such as Zipcar may change the way we think of automobile ownership and the future trend of it.

The Interstate Highway System (officially known as the Dwight D. Eisenhower National System of Interstate and Defense Highways – after the president who signed the authorizing bill) is a network of approximately 46,750 miles of grade-separated, limited-access freeways and highways&lt;ref&gt;Federal Highway Administration. Annual Highway Statistics for 1996 through 2008, (VM-3). Washington, DC&lt;/ref&gt;.  It began with the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956, which authorized construction of the system, and was intended to connect most major cities and regions in the United States.  Today, the Interstate Highway System connects all 48 contiguous states. 

==Life-cycle Pattern:  Vehicle Miles Traveled==
===Life-cycle===

Like many transportation and infrastructure systems the Interstate Highway System follows a roughly S-curve shaped pattern of development.  Its lifecycle can be divided into three distinct phases of birth, growth, and maturity.  In the initial birth of the new transportation technology growth is slow as its role is clarified and norms are established.  Once the benefits of the technology begin to be more widely understood, the technology enters a growth phase where expansion occurs rapidly.  Investment, public or private, increases and the system gains many new entrants.  After the system reaches its maximum extent, it enters the maturity phase of its growth.  Typically consolidation occurs, and inefficient or superfluous routes are discontinued.

===Methodology===
[[File:Annual Vehicle-Miles Traveled - U.S. Interstate Highway System.png|thumb|Vehicle-miles traveled, observed data and predicted values along S-curve]]&lt;ref&gt;Federal Highway Administration. (1997, July).  Highway Statistics Summary to 1995, (V-20: VM-203, II-4: MV-200). Washington, DC: Teets, Mary K., Editor&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Federal Highway Administration. Annual Highway Statistics for 1996 through 2008, (VM-3). Washington, DC&lt;/ref&gt;

An analysis of the annual vehicle-miles traveled on the Interstate Highway System shows that it follows this pattern of development.  Fitting the S-Curve requires an initial single variable linear regression to determine the b-value coefficient used in the logistic function of the S-Curve.  The regression is of the form:
	Y=bX+c; where Y=LN(Vehicle-miles/(K-Vehicle-miles)), and X=Year
K is the maximum extent of the technology, in this case estimated to be 750,000 vehicle-miles
Once b is found, it can be used to determine the inflection point (t0=Intercept/-b), and the estimated extent of the technology using the S-Curve.  The function is of the form:
	S(t)=K/[1+exp(-b(t-t0)], where t=time, t0=inflection point, and K=saturation point&lt;ref&gt;PA 5232 HWA 3; University of Minnesota - David Levinson&lt;/ref&gt;

==Birth of the Interstate Highway System (1956-1970)==
===Existing Modes===

Prior to the construction of the Interstate Highway System in 1956, rail was still the most dominant form of long distance transportation for both freight and passenger travel.  However the automobile had been replacing rail travel steadily since the middle of the first decade of the 1900s.  Rail volume was declining for most of this period, with brief upticks during World War I and World War II due to rationing of car parts, particularly rubber, metals and fuel.  However despite these brief setbacks, automobile growth continued to grow rapidly.  In 1900, there were approximately 8000 passenger cars in the United States.  By 1930 this number had grown to just over 23 million and by 1955 there were 52 million automobiles on the road&lt;ref&gt;Federal Highway Administration. (1997, July).  Highway Statistics Summary to 1995, (V-20: VM-203, II-4: MV-200). Washington, DC: Teets, Mary K., Editor&lt;/ref&gt;.  

The rapid growth of the automobile put considerable stress on the existing roadways in the United States.  These roadways were largely one or two lanes, were not grade separated and maintained and funded by states and local municipalities.  As such they were unequipped to deal with the growing volume of vehicle use, both in terms of personal automobiles and shipping via trucks.  In 1953, the Bureau of Public Roads released a report saying that only 24% of interstate roadway was adequate to meet the demands of current traffic levels&lt;ref&gt;Weingroff, Richard F., (1996). Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956: Creating the Interstate System. Public Roads, 60 (1)&lt;/ref&gt;. In the 1930s and 40s some regionally contained limited-access divided highways were being constructed and enjoying a large degree of success, notably the Pennsylvania Turnpike which was the first of its kind to be constructed in the United States.

===Planning the Interstate Highway System===
[[Image:Highways1955.gif|thumb|right|1955 map: The planned status of U.S. highways in 1965, as a result of the developing Interstate Highway System]]
The success of the early limited-access highways increased pressure on the Federal government to begin the development of a national highway system that could support the growing automobile traffic in the United States.  Both President Franklin D. Roosevelt and Congress began exploring the idea of a network of superhighways in the late 1930s and early 40s.  Roosevelt, fearing a return of the Great Depression after WWII, wanted to incorporate the construction of the superhighway network into his broader public works investment plans as a means of providing jobs for returning war veterans and other people out of work&lt;ref&gt;Weingroff, Richard F., (1996). Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956: Creating the Interstate System. Public Roads, 60 (1)&lt;/ref&gt;.  In 1938, Congress passed the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1938, which directed the chief of the Bureau of Public Roads to conduct a feasibility study of six interstate toll road corridors&lt;ref&gt;Federal Highway Administration. Origins and Construction of the Interstate System. Washington DC: Mertz, W. Lee., Author&lt;/ref&gt;.  The study found that in all likelihood, the amount of traffic across these routes would not be sufficient to support a toll road, and that government funding would have to support them in some capacity&lt;ref&gt;Weingroff, Richard F., (1996). Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956: Creating the Interstate System. Public Roads, 60 (1)&lt;/ref&gt;.

Although the idea of an interstate highway system garnered a great deal of support in Congress, and was popular among the public, little progress was made on the matter because the massive investment in the war effort took priority over large infrastructure investments at home.  In 1944, the second Federal-Aid Highway Act designated 65,000km of interstate highway system to be selected by the various state highway departments.  However no special funding was authorized for the construction of the system, resulting in resistance from states that did not want to reallocate federal aid away from local needs.  The first federal authorization of funds specifically for the construction of the interstate highway system came in 1952, with $25 million from the federal government on a 50-50 matching basis&lt;ref&gt;Weingroff, Richard F., (1996). Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956: Creating the Interstate System. Public Roads, 60 (1)&lt;/ref&gt;.

Finally in 1956, a comprehensive program was enacted to begin construction in earnest.  President Dwight D Eisenhower, an even stronger advocate for the system than President Roosevelt was, recognized the importance of a national system of interstate highways.  In 1919 he was a participant in the Army’s first transcontinental convoy from Washington, DC to San Francisco.  The journey suffered a series of mechanical difficulties and infrastructure failures and took over two months to complete. This experience, as well as his experience with the German Autobahn during World War Two had convinced him of the value of the interstate system.  In addition to President Eisenhower’s support, the postwar affluence of the United States had increased pressure even further on existing highways and the ramping up of the Cold War provided a national defense justification for the system.  In short, by 1956 the Interstate Highway System was an idea whose time had come.

===The Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956===

The modern Interstate Highway System began with the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956, which was approved by the Senate on June 26th by a vote of 89-1 and signed on June 29th by President Eisenhower&lt;ref&gt;Weingroff, Richard F., (1996). Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956: Creating the Interstate System. Public Roads, 60 (1)&lt;/ref&gt;.  The act authorized 42,500 miles of interstate highway system to be completed by 1975.  All interstate highways were to be constructed using very high standards.  It was designed to have no intersections and traffic signals, and to be grade-separated at traffic and rail crossings and in urban areas.  Grades and curves were designed to reduce or eliminate blind hills and safe navigation at high speeds&lt;ref&gt;Cox, Wendell &amp; Love, Jean. (June 1996). 40 Years of the US Interstate Highway System: An Analysis. American Highway Users Alliance. http://www.publicpurpose.com/freeway1.htm#intro (accessed 10/2011)&lt;/ref&gt;.  The act stated that construction and maintenance was to be funded by a user fee federal gasoline tax.  The federal tax was planned to provide 90% of the construction cost, with the remainder coming from the states, mainly in the form of their own user fees.  To that end, the federal gasoline tax was increased by one cent.

==Growth of the Interstate Highway System (1970-1995)==
===Expansion===

Following its authorization in 1956, the Interstate Highway System grew rapidly, both in terms of absolute length and in terms of traffic volume.  By 1960, more than 10,000 miles had opened, doubling in five years to 20,000 open miles in 1965 and reaching 30,000 miles in 1970&lt;ref&gt;Cox, Wendell &amp; Love, Jean. (June 1996). 40 Years of the US Interstate Highway System: An Analysis. American Highway Users Alliance. http://www.publicpurpose.com/freeway1.htm#intro (accessed 10/2011)&lt;/ref&gt;.  By 1994 the system was approaching its current size in terms of mileage (approximately 42,000 miles), yet it only made up 1.1% of the total mileage extent of transport systems in the United States.  Despite its relatively tiny total mileage, it carried approximately 23% of the market share of all transportation systems.  The rapid changeover from other modes to the Interstate Highway system reflects its usefulness, particularly between cities.  The interstate highways have reduced average travel times between cities by an estimated 20% and some much higher, for example travel time from Atlanta to Birmingham has been reduced by approximately 40%&lt;ref&gt;Cox, Wendell &amp; Love, Jean. (June 1996). 40 Years of the US Interstate Highway System: An Analysis. American Highway Users Alliance. http://www.publicpurpose.com/freeway1.htm#intro (accessed 10/2011)&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Engineering the Interstate Highway System===

As previously mentioned, the United States did have some limited-access highways built before the construction of the Interstate Highway System.  These parkways and freeways, like the Pennsylvania Turnpike, were largely modeled on the German Autobahn.  The interstate system followed suit, integrating the higher design standards, wider shoulders, more steeply curved surface, and separate grades; the interstate system actually incorporates much of the Pennsylvania Turnpike, as well as some other early limited-access highways. 

In order to successfully complete the system, highway engineers needed to implement newly advanced technologies and improve on many existing ones.  Asphalt had improved greatly in World War II, largely because of the requirements of military aircraft runways.  Highway engineers developed larger equipment, such as electronic leveling controls and extra-wide lane finishers to pave two lanes at a time&lt;ref&gt;Hoel, Lester A. &amp; Short, Andrew J., (May-June 2006). The Engineering of the Interstate Highway System: A 50-year Retrospective of Advances and Contributions. TR News, 244, 22-27&lt;/ref&gt;.  Other major advancements in road technology include drainage, the movement from clay culverts to metal and concrete, and bridge spanning technologies like pre-stressed concrete and segmental construction.

==The Mature Interstate Highway System (1995-Present)==
===Impact===

The impact the Interstate Highway System has had on the social, economic, and cultural life in the United States in undeniable.  By significantly reducing travel times, especially across large distances, it has helped the truck shipping industry develop into its modern form.  Freight costs have been reduced substantially, with tractor-trailer operating costs estimated to be 17% lower on interstates than on other highways&lt;ref&gt;Cox, Wendell &amp; Love, Jean. (June 1996). 40 Years of the US Interstate Highway System: An Analysis. American Highway Users Alliance. http://www.publicpurpose.com/freeway1.htm#intro (accessed 10/2011)&lt;/ref&gt;.  Improved freight shipping translates into inventory benefits for retailers who practice “just-in-time” delivery, and also reduces costs passed on to consumers in the form of shipping.  

Reductions in travel costs as a result of the Interstate System have also had an impact on land-use and development in the United States.  The development of the interstate system coincides almost directly with the growth of “suburban sprawl”.  While there are likely many factors at work behind increased suburbanization, data suggests that the interstate highways are at least partially responsible.  There are some estimates that indicate that if the Interstate Highway System had never been built intra-city commutes would double, while suburb to suburb commutes would be halved&lt;ref&gt;Baum-Snow, Nathaniel. (2010). Changes in transportation infrastructure and commuting patterns in U.S. metropolitan areas, 1960-2000. Paper presented at the American Economic Association Meetings, Atlanta&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Funding===

Through 1996, close to the final extent of mileage construction, the Interstate Highway System had cost $329 billion dollars (1996 dollars), making it one of the largest infrastructure investments in human history, and the largest in U.S. history.  Its original cost was estimated to be $41 billion in 1957 dollars, fairly close to its total cost of $58.5 billion adjusted to 1957 dollars&lt;ref&gt;Cox, Wendell &amp; Love, Jean. (June 1996). 40 Years of the US Interstate Highway System: An Analysis. American Highway Users Alliance. http://www.publicpurpose.com/freeway1.htm#intro (accessed 10/2011)&lt;/ref&gt;.

Interstate construction and maintenance is funded primarily through user fees in the form of gasoline taxes.  The federal government’s contribution is around 93% supported by the gas tax.  State and local contributions vary, but generally come from property taxes or some means other than a user fee&lt;ref&gt;Federal Highway Administration. Funding for Highways and Disposition of Highway-User Revenues 2007. (HF-10). Washington, DC&lt;/ref&gt;.  There is very little money allocated to the expansion of the Interstate Highway System for at least two reasons.  The first is that the system has reached its planned extent, and while there are some other expansions slated, the bulk of the work has been done.  The second is the increased maintenance costs associated with the expansion of the suburbs.  As development springs up along the interstate highways, maintenance costs of those stretches increase through higher use, increased access points, and more grade-separated crossings.

===Future Prospects for the Interstate Highway System===

While the Interstate Highway System has reached maturity, it is not going to be replaced any time soon.  There is currently no transportation technology that has the capacity to provide the level of service, at the level of cost, that the Interstate Highway System does.  There may be some upgrades in electronic systems or “smart roads” to take advantage of the possible computerization of personal automobiles and freight trucks.  Depending on how that technology develops, the Interstate System could experience a second life-cycle process that capitalizes on the significant increases in capacity, speed and overall efficiency a fully computerized highway system could provide.

= Communism as Classless Society =

Communism requires a completely classless society, however by having a ruler, dictator etc. you create a class of those who rule, and those who do not. Communism using Russia as an example, there were a handful of people who had tremendous amounts of power, which is the very thing communism hoped to fight in capitalism. Communism is then closer to Anarchy than Socialism, and Anarchy has never existed for any extended period of time.

= Atrocities Committed by Communist Dictators =

In an attempt to create a Utopian Society, these are statistics on what you find in communism. First we will stop at Russia, under the rule of Jospeh Stalin a very important communist ruler, he had over 25 million people killed during his reign&lt;ref&gt;[[#Yakovlev2002CenturyofViolence|Yakovlev (2002) ''Century of Violence'']] p. 234: &quot;My own many years and experience in the rehabilitation of victims of political terror allow me to assert that the number of people in the USSR who were killed for political motives or who died in prisons and camps during the entire period of Soviet power totaled 20 to 25 million. And unquestionably one must add those who died of famine—more than 5.5 million during the civil war and more than 5 million during the 1930s.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;, more than Hitler, who killed nearly 18 Million people.

= Requiring a Highly Moral Society =
else everyone would take advantage

= Where Do Rights Come From? =
if they come from the state, then can they take them away. Decide one is not human? 

= Goals of Communism =
Abolishment of family, freedom of religion, etc. . Communism takes control of all newspapers, all media (control of what is written, what is shown on television etc.) in which there is no freedom, not even the freedom of private property.

==The Model==

[[File:Subway Ridership.jpg]]

The data used for the model was annual ridership in New York’s subway system from 1901- 1998. The data came from the Metropolitian Transit Agency (MTA). Due to the length of the mode timeline there were issues finding a line to fit the data. Attempting to capture the two periods two lines were chosen. The first line is a good representation of the growth cycle but the second was not a good fit. There is a leveling off period after the growth and decline but then there are some spikes at later periods. It is possible ridership variations in the mature stage are being effected by gas prices, economic conditions, and other factors causing the ridership to fluctuate.

==History==

===19th century New York City- Before the Subway===

During the 19th century New York City was quickly becoming a very large and overcrowded city. Immigration from Europe brought a steady flow of new people into the area causing the population to skyrocket during this time. With the massive growth came larger problems from the flow of immigrants into the city. Housing, overcrowding, and sanitation were growing challenges for New York, especially in the neighborhoods that housed tenements for the new immigrants. 

'''Available Modes of Transport	'''

The large number of immigrants moving into the city also created congestion on New York’s multi-modal roads. At that time “Manhattan’s roads were packed with pedestrians, horses, wagons, omnibuses, and the most common form of public transit, horsecars moving over rails in streets” (Derrick, 2001). So we can see that at this time there were a large number of people that needed to move around the city and a variety of rather inefficient ways to do so. The modes listed above were not practical for the overcrowded tenement districts. They were all slow modes of transport, they were competing for space, and each mode had a very limited carry capacity. 

===Horsecars===

The above quote describing horsecars as the most popular mode is important to note. Public health and sanitation were important issues at that time and having to clean up after the horsecars would not have been helping the problem.  Since none of these forms of transport were very efficient there was also no reason for those living in the crowded area to move because it would be very difficult to travel to and from work.  The horsecar system was overcrowded enough that it was not worth pushing forward. Instead of expanding that system reformers began to look to new ways to transport people (Derrick 2001).

===Reformers find housing solutions in Rapid Transit development===

Since there was no good way to get further than a couple miles it made sense to look for ways to move people longer distances so they could spread out the housing. Early housing reformers in New York were looking for solutions to the growing housing problem. Clearly the United States did not want to limit immigration when it was trying to grow but New York City was having a difficult time with the population growth. In the 1860’s reformers began to believe that if public transit improved people who had the means could move out of the city. While reformers began to advocate for improving transit, “ the vision of rapid transit as a means to improve the daily lives of working-class families and protect public health and safety was not to be achieved for more than fifty years” (Derrick 2001). It is not surprising that a project of this scale would take so long to come to fulfillment. 

==Main Markets==

===The first few years===

When reformers first thought of improving transit to move people it was related to issues of overcrowding. The subway was first created to help move the population around so the tenements would not be so crowded. Prior to the subway workers had to live within walking or easy travel distance so that they could easily get to work. When the first line opened it carried “short-haul” passengers around Manhattan and Downtown Brooklyn and was very popular right from the beginning (Derrick 2001).

===Now===

The subway continues to be a large part of the public transit networks. The subway provides 24 hour a day service to the boroughs it serves. According to the MTA’s fugures it has the largest rolling stock number in the world.  All this means that the market for the subway is quite large. Commuters, tourists, and others enjoy the services provided by MTA and that is why they continue to expand. (MTA)

===Technology===

The first subway to be operated electric opened in the 1890’s in London. At this time technology was consistently improving in all manners and New York was quick to research all the new technologies available. Electricity and developments in motors, braking, and other advances were quickly improving the efficiency and safety of subway. (Derrick 2001). They needed the speeds to be improving and technology to be advancing to make the large project worth their while.
At the time it was very important technologies to build the tunnels and operate railways were consistently improving. New York City had many technological and engineering issues they had to work through while completing this project. 

===Subway Cars===

The New York City subway designers had a specific list of considerations when searching for the perfect vehicle to ride on the underground railway. These included:

“High schedule speeds with frequent stops.
Maximum carrying capacity for the subway, especially at times of rush hours, morning and evening.
Maximum strength combined with smallest permissible weight.
Adoption of all precautions calculated to reduce possibility of damage from either the electric circuit or from collisions.
The clearance and length of the local station platforms limited the length of trains, and tunnel clearances the length and width and height of the cars.”(Fordham University 1991). 

After looking at the different options available to them by visiting other railways in the U.S. and overseas they decided upon a car model that would work for their needs and quickly put it into a testing period on a different rail line. Some of the specialized features included steel under frames, emergency brakes, and safety features for any electrical malfunctions that might occur. Safety and efficiency were definitely the driving goals in the design and building of these cars. 

===Tunneling Technology===

Another technological feat for this project was the development of the tunnels for the railway. While this was not the first underground subway in the world, London was before them, there was still a lot of work to be put into tunnels. Much of the route already had a considerable amount of stuff under the roadway that needed to be worked around. Due to the placement of the tunnel buildings, pipes and ducts, and more had to be redone to successfully build the tunnels (Fordham University 1991) They were also trying to cause as little disruption as possible to the roads and piping and therefore kept learning about and improving on construction practices while building. 

==Policy==

As New York was rapidly growing from immigration movement in the 19th century there was a significant market for those trying to move out of the tenement slums. Overcrowding in the neighborhoods and on the current public transit systems made it so that they needed to create rapid transit much earlier than they did. By the time the Subway was first opened in the early 1900’s the market they had built for was ready to move outward and use the new form of transit. While the opening was able to allow people to move outward from the densest area it did not stop the continued rise in New York’s population. New York at that time had the most crowded population in the world. People were still immigrating from Europe and rural areas and therefore as soon as the subway opened it was already overcrowded and in need of expansion. (Derrick 2001) 

===Creation of Interborough Rapid Transit===

When the idea of the subway was first considered there were many groups interested in the policy and politics of the line development. One of the largest barriers to construction was the financial cost of the project. The elevated lines in use nearby were nowhere as costly to build as the estimated construction costs that would be needed to develop the subway. There were many different opinions on who should own, who should pay, who is in charge, etc. In the late 1890’s with some help of a private investor the money and approval finally came through. It was at that time that the Interborough Rapid Transit Company was created to be in charge of the line. (Derrick 2001)

===Line Expansion===

Before the first lines were even completed they were already arguing about how to expand the system to reach a larger market and further lessen congestion. According to Derrick, “ How to proceed with the expanding rapid transit network became the biggest political issue in New York during the 1905 and 1909 municipal elections” ( Derrick 2001). At the time there was rapid transit being developed in Brooklyn and then the Manhattan to Bronx line. The Rapid Transit Board wanted to develop a plan that could be implemented as resources became available for the project. The main goal of all lines was to lessen overcrowding in the tenement neighborhoods. There was also a desire to connect the Brookln Rapid Transit Company (BRT) lines with the Interborough Rapid Transit (IRT) lines. 

==The Subway in the 2000s==

===Declining Revenue===

For as long as the Subway has been around there have been issues arising over how to pay for it. During the spring of 2008 Metropolitan Transit Agency (MTA) raised fares so they could make needed improvements to the subway. Shortly after announcing the fare increase would go to specific announced improvements they had to take it back because the finances of the agency were not stable enough to go ahead with the plans. (Neuman 2008) At that time the city was experiencing declining income from the recession and feeling the effect that the layoffs were having on the budget. One way proposed to pay for the improvements was through a congestion pricing policy being enacted in New York. As the New York Times article writes, there was a negative reaction to this idea and a congestion-pricing plan was not pursued past the planning stage. 

===Line expansions===

In the mid 2000’s, the MTA looked at and began plans for expanding several lines that were reaching their limit of passenger carrying capacity. The Second Ave Subway expansion has been in the process of being done for several years. The project is expensive but will allow a much higher volume of passengers. The project even before construction was awarded an Environmental Protection Agency award for the sustainability of the design. It will use some newer techniques to make the expansion less damaging to the environment and have lower energy costs. (Binns 2004) Environmental impact is important in an expansion of this size and therefore should be seen favorably by transit riders and those concerned with the environment. They might save money by the design more cost effective but they are also benefiting by the positive press associated with green design efforts. 

===Improving Technology===

Going off of the green design in the planning of the expansions we might add that New York has also experimented with the use of solar panels on some station roofs. “It will provide a maximum of 65 percent of the station’s electricity during sunny summer days and an average of 15 percent over the course of a year” (Hansen 2005). That station, which operates 24 hours a day, can save money and promote the environment to try and attract visitors to that station. MTA has also tried to make other improvements to make riding the subway easier and more enjoyable to ride. According to the MTA webpage 90% of trips made on the subway now are made with the MetroCard. The card is used as a stored value card that riders can use to ride subways or buses. Also in recent years there have been improvements so that “All subway cars and buses are air-conditioned and either new, remanufactured, or overhauled” (MTA) The improving technology and upgrades to the stations and trains will hopefully continue to improve ridership.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''''Fear the disappearance of Engineering Education'''''

===DIY U by Anya Kamenetz quotes===
:&quot;The face to face experience, like a live concert, remains valuable as one item on an expanding menu.&quot; 
:&quot;Research shows hybrid beats online only and class only approaches.&quot; 
:&quot;Learners .. publish portfolios of meaningful work that help jobs find them.&quot; 
:&quot;Higher Ed provides .. content, skills, socialization and accreditation. The web can make each of these more accessible, higher quality and even free.&quot;

===MOOC===
Massive Open Online Courses ([[:wikipedia:Massive_open_online_course|MOOCs]]) are going to disrupt higher education as we know it.

===Introduction to Engineering===
The course introduction to engineering can be a model for future face to face education and all other engineering courses. Engineers don't take a course in shovels. Yet aren't English and math such courses? What makes engineering courses unique? Where did the &quot;typing class&quot; go? The course &quot;Introduction to Engineering&quot; is the only course where face to face components are absolutely necessary. This paper is about learning to use a shovel only when digging holes. It is about recognizing problems of the world, not individuals. 

Edison created the first quadrature telegraph mux; solved the powered telephone transmission problem; created the first music recording/playing device; created the light bulb and electricity distribution infrastructure; and created the created the first 35mm film camera. So do freshman engineering students. Freshman engineering students want to change the world too. Let them.

===Student Support Service Bloat===
Schools have moved way beyond protecting fingers from damage. Today education is capturing and holding onto every possible social improvement in a bewildering mosaic that is crowding out engineering, creating a nation addicted to education and turning first year engineering courses into personal growth seminars. Some call Academic Support Services, &quot;Faculty Harassment Service.&quot; Academic Support Service bloat is the major cost of tuition bloat (DIY U page 53). Here is the evidence:
*Clean engineering project space (rather than cluttered mess of creative in-progress engineering)
*Must write objectives, assignments on the board
*Must accommodate infinite variety of special needs 
*Trash, recycling, cleaning, tool safety inspection
*When door to classroom can be open, door stop confiscation
*Four types of Disaster drills practiced regularly
*Fear of student escalation
*Soda brand drinking enforcement
*Parking lot vagabond prevention
*Airspace enforcement, no parachutes, kites, quadcopters, UAVs or weather balloons
*Beautiful facilities, no playing in fountains, no antennas on the roof, no parachutes dropped from the parking garage, no zip lines, no parking spaces for projects
*Centralized Video Camera control
*Work Study, Student Government, Purchasing, Service Learning
*Disneyland line management throttle 
*Speaker competition, 
*Fund raising pre-approval, 
*Project Funding Accountability Expansion
*Scholarship, Internship, Mentorship fairness
*External, non-engineering project approval to prevent &quot;boys and toys&quot; appearance
Faculty use to have voice. Now they have 10 month contracts. Service opportunities turn into control points.

      <comment>/* Bill Me Later: A PayPal Service */ Fix heading formatting</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">If you are bored of paying for purchases the old fashion way you can use PayPal to pay for the purchases. PayPal is an electronic service that takes your purchases from either your Debit or Credit Card. In order to use the service you need to register for an account at www.paypal.com. Once you have registered an account you can log in at any time to add funds, edit your preferences, and keep track of your orders by viewing them from the history tab. You can link multiple funding sources to your account so if you are low in one account they will automatically take the funds from the other source that you have listed. More businesses in today’s market will only allow PayPal because it is a reliable source to make your purchases. I have been using the site for several years and always have received notifications through my email stating the purchase was paid and will be shipped shortly.

[[File:PayPal logo.svg|thumb|PayPal logo]]

As a middleman financial broker, PayPal makes its profit by charging a percentage of the money it transfers for you. PayPal is free for buyers and for sending money to someone else. Once a buyer sets up a PayPal account, then it costs nothing to send money to a seller. The funds are withdrawn from the user’s credit card or bank account. PayPal commonly charges money receivers (sellers) a 30 cent fee + (1.9% to 2.9%) surcharge.  PayPal only charges you to receive funds. If you are sending money to a friend or a family member (someone who is not a registered seller), you can opt to pay the PayPal fee yourself.

===Bill Me Later: A PayPal Service===
Do you like shopping online? And, sometimes there's not enough money in the account for PayPal service.  Now there's no need to worry because you can buy now and pay later through Bill Me Later a PayPal service.  Bill me later is a payment method offered on many merchant's websites, such as Wal-Mart, Petco, eBay and other merchant's sites.  Bill Me Later allows you to shop online with a merchant that's part of Bill Me Later service without putting in any credit card information. You enter your birthdate, and last four digits of your social security number. Bill Me Later is subject to credit approval.  There's no interest if balanced is paid in full in six months.  Bill Me Later is like a credit card, and just like any credit card the consumer must use it responsibly.  Bill Me Later was acquired by eBay in 2008, and operates as a subsidiary of eBay.

===PayPal Security===

If you use PayPal as many do there is a way to add security to your account.
The Federal and state laws allow you to restrict what information is shared by the site.
Beware you can’t stop all information from being shared but there are specific parts that can be restricted.  If you go into your account and uncheck the box in the Information Sharing section, you can prevent companies like Ebay from using your information for the marketing of their products.  This page can be accessed by going under the Profile subtab under the My Account tab.
You can control how PayPay uses your contact information for marketing as well in the notifications preferences.

===Pay Pal: Digital Wallet===

On March 13, 2012, PayPal will announce it's re-imagined consumer experience.  This marks the first time in PayPal's 
13-year history that they have completely redesigned and re-architected the PayPal wallet to make money work better in today’s rapidly evolving, multi-channel shopping environment.

Because PayPal’s wallet is digital, and not just mobile, it lets consumers do things with their money that have never been possible before.  And there’s no finite set of features, because the digital wallet can evolve with the pace of innovation, allowing PayPal to incorporate new functionality as consumer demands shift.

According to Sam Shrauger, Vice President, Global Product &amp; Experience, PayPal, ' &quot;this is what we will make possible with the new PayPal:&quot; '

' &quot;Separating the purchase from the payment: Buy something in a store, take it home and decide later how you want to pay for it. PayPal is the only wallet that will offer a 5-7 day grace period for consumers to change their minds. Switch from one funding source to another;decide to pay over time in installments;apply different sources of value (gift cards, airline miles, loyalty points, etc.)&quot; '.

' &quot;Personal Lists: Search for items, compare prices and create lists of things you want to buy for a variety of situations&quot; '.

' &quot;Found Money: Your wallet will find deals and coupons for items on your personal lists once you’re in the store. Forgot about that coupon you were saving? The PayPal wallet won’t&quot; '. 

' &quot;Spending Rules. Create specific “set asides” like travel funds, set rules by purchase amount, tie specific payment instruments to specific merchants – all in your wallet, without setting up any new bank accounts or opening any new credit cards&quot; '.

Furthermore, Shrauger goes on to say, ' &quot; . . . examples in everyday life would be:let’s say I want to combine the value of 10,000 airline miles with a $100 gift card to pay for the new TV I just bought.  There’s no way I can do that right now – but the PayPal wallet will. Or what if I want my money to automatically filter into separate “funds” – one for groceries, one for travel, one for entertainment – when I get my paycheck every week.  Then, at the grocery store check out, the payment is automatically pulled from the fund I’ve earmarked as grocery money.  Sometimes I need to make a big purchase that I’d like to pay for in installments – but do not want to put it on credit. If I pay with PayPal, the retailer gets paid upfront by PayPal, but my money will be deducted in equal installments over time. This flexibility with your own money has never been possible before in the digital world. PayPal is not about replacing a card swipe with a phone tap at point of sale. We are reimagining money to free it in its digital form so that it can work better for everyone&quot; '.

One can :
* directly create graphic file 
* open existing graphic file
* add/read/remove text information to graphic file 

Types of graphic files :
* static images 
* video

'''C code''' 

Static array for one color : code in [[C]] for creating pgm text file : 
&lt;source lang=c&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main(){
  int iX,iY;
  const int iXmax = 300; 
  const int iYmax = 300;
  /* color  is coded from 0 to 255 */
  /* it is 8 bit color RGB file */
  const int MaxColorComponentValue=255; 
  FILE * fp;
  char *filename=&quot;m.pgm&quot;;
  char *comment=&quot;# this is my new text pgm file &quot;;  /* comment should start with # */
  static unsigned char color;
        
        
        
  /*create new file,give it a name and open it in text mode  */
  fp= fopen(filename,&quot;w&quot;); /*  text mode */
  /*write ASCII header to the file*/
  fprintf(fp,&quot;P2\n%s\n%d %d\n%d\n&quot;,comment,iXmax,iYmax,MaxColorComponentValue);
  /*write image data bytes to the file*/
  for(iY=0;iY&lt;iYmax;++iY){
    for(iX=0;iX&lt;iXmax;++iX){         
      color=150;   /* compute  pixel color (8 bit = 1 byte) */
      fprintf(fp,&quot; %d &quot;, color);   /*write color to the file*/
    }
    fprintf(fp,&quot; \n &quot;);
  }
  fclose(fp);
  printf(&quot;OK\n&quot;);
  getchar();
  return 0;
}

&lt;/source&gt;

To compile it : 

   gcc m.c

To run it : 
 ./a.out

Remember that :
* fwrite is used for binary files
* fprintf is used for binary and text files
so if you want to use fwrite then you will get binary file ( even if you will open it in text mode ):

'''C code : Static 2D array for whole image'''

  int iX,iY;
  const int iXmax = 100; 
  const int iYmax = 100;

  const int MaxColorComponentValue=255; /* color component is coded from 0 to 255 ;  it is 8 bit color file */

fprintf(fp,&quot;P5\n %s\n %d %d\n %d\n&quot;,comment,iXmax,iYmax,MaxColorComponentValue);  /*write header to the file*/

fclose(fp);
printf(&quot;OK - file %s saved\n&quot;, filename);
return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

'''C code : virtual 2D array and dynamic 1D array''' 

Here image is a virtual 2D array, but in program we use 1D array.

Relations between indexes :
 i = ix + iy*iWidth; // index of 1D array 
 ix = i % iWidth;
 iy = (i- ix) / iWidth;
 
Here is whole program where we only check ranges of array's indexes without using explicit array : 

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

/* --------- global variables ----------------- */

// 2D array 
// Indexes of array starts from 0 not 1 
unsigned int ix, iy;
unsigned int ixMin = 0;
unsigned int ixMax = 3; //
unsigned int iWidth ; // = (ixMax -ixMin + 1) = 4
unsigned int iyMin = 0;
unsigned int iyMax = 3; //
unsigned int iHeight ; //= (iyMax -iyMin + 1) =  4
// The size of array has to be a positive constant integer 
unsigned int i2Dsize ; // = iWidth*iHeight = 16


// 1D array 
unsigned int i; // index of 1D array
unsigned int iMin = 0;
// Indexes of array starts from 0 not 1 so the highest elements of an array is = array_name[size-1].
unsigned int iMax ; // = i2Dsize-1; // = 15
// The size of array has to be a positive constant integer 
unsigned int i1Dsize ; // = i2Dsize  = (iMax -iMin + 1) = 16 ;  1D array with the same size as 2D array



/* ---------- functions ----------------*/

/* gives position of 2D point (iX,iY) in 1D array  ; uses also global variable iWidth */
unsigned int f(unsigned int ix, unsigned int iy)
{ return ix + iy*iWidth; }


/* ---------------------- main ------------------*/
int main()
{

iWidth = (ixMax -ixMin + 1); // 
iHeight = (iyMax -iyMin + 1); //
i2Dsize = iWidth*iHeight; // number of points in array 
iMax = i2Dsize-1; // Indexes of array starts from 0 not 1 so the highest elements of an array is = array_name[size-1].
i1Dsize = i2Dsize; // 1D array with the same size as 2D array


// first method using 1D index i 
for (i=iMin; i&lt;i1Dsize; ++i) printf(&quot; %d \n&quot;, i ); // from 0 to 15

// second method using 1D index i 
for (i=iMin; i&lt;=iMax ;  ++i) printf(&quot; %d \n&quot;, i ); // from 0 to 15

// check second method using 1D index i
for (i=iMin; i&lt;=iMax ;  ++i)  // i from 0 to 15
 { ix = i % iWidth;
   iy = ( i- ix) / iWidth; // inversion of f function
   printf(&quot; ix = %d ; iy = %d ; i = %d \n&quot;,ix , iy , i );} 

// using 2D indexes :  iy and ix
for(iy=iyMin;iy&lt;=iyMax;++iy)
  for(ix=ixMin;ix&lt;=ixMax;++ix) printf(&quot; ix = %d ; iy = %d ; i = %d \n&quot;, ix, iy, f(ix,iy) );     

return 0;
}

 ffmpeg2theora %d.gif --framerate 5 --videoquality 9 -f webm --artist &quot;your name&quot; -o otput.webm 

If you use files '''names''' containing parameter ( here Cx ), then it would be easy to sort files and make video :

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
  char name [10]; /* name of file */
  i = sprintf(name,&quot;%2.7f&quot;,Cx); /* result (is saved in i) but is not used */
  char *filename =strcat(name,&quot;.pgm&quot;); /* new name thru concatenate of  strings  */

Using Image Magic :

Image Magic one can add  comment to png image using mogrify :&lt;ref&gt;[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4497206/how-to-add-extra-meta-data-to-png?lq=1 Stackoverflow : How to add extra meta data to PNG?]&lt;/ref&gt;

 mogrify -comment &quot;My test comment&quot; p.png

or using convert :&lt;ref&gt;[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9036152/insert-a-text-chunk-into-a-png-image?lq=1 Stackoverflow : Insert a text chunk into a png image]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
convert in.png \
        -set 'Copyright' 'CC-BY-SA 4.0' \
        -set 'Title' 'A wonderful day' \
        -set comment 'Photo taken while running' \
        out.png
&lt;/pre&gt;

To read comment from png :

identify -verbose p.png  | grep -i &quot;comment:&quot;

    comment: My test comment

==Chunk==
A chunk is a fragment of information which is used in many multimedia formats, such as PNG, IFF, MP3 and AVI.
Each chunk contains a header which indicates some parameters (e.g. the type of chunk, comments, size etc.) In the middle there is a variable area containing data which are decoded by the program from the parameters in the header.&lt;ref&gt;[[w:Chunk (information)|wikipedia : Chunk (information)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Text chunk is a one of standard ancillary PNG chunks. It's name is a tEXt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/spec/1.2/PNG-Chunks.html  PNG (Portable Network Graphics) Specification, Version 1.2 : chunk]&lt;/ref&gt;


Standard keywords for PNG text chunks:
&lt;pre&gt;
   Title            Short (one line) title or caption for image
   Author           Name of image's creator
   Description      Description of image (possibly long)
   Copyright        Copyright notice
   Creation Time    Time of original image creation
   Software         Software used to create the image
   Disclaimer       Legal disclaimer
   Warning          Warning of nature of content
   Source           Device used to create the image
   Comment          Miscellaneous comment; conversion from GIF comment
&lt;/pre&gt;

The ancillary chunks currently known to ImageMagick are bKGD, cHRM, gAMA, iCCP, oFFs, pHYs, sRGB, tEXt, tRNS, vpAg, and zTXt.

==Parameter files==
===Dot ===
'''Dot files''' are text files describing graphs in dot language. Example file :

 digraph &quot;BinaryAddingMachine&quot; {
 a [shape=circle]
 b [shape=circle]
  a -&gt; a [label=&quot;1/1&quot;,color=red];
  a -&gt; a [label=&quot;2/2&quot;,color=blue];
  b -&gt; a [label=&quot;1/2&quot;,color=red];
  b -&gt; b [label=&quot;2/1&quot;,color=blue];
 }

This file can be coverted to other formats using command line program dot. For example to svg : 
 dot -Tsvg b.dot -o b.svg
===fractint parfiles=== 
&quot;Fractint uses Parameter files&lt;ref&gt;[http://chabin.laurent.free.fr/vff/vff.html#Intro%20to%20par%20files A short Introducion to PAR Files by Laurent Chabin]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.julianhaight.com/filmer_instruct.shtml julian haight : filmer instructions]&lt;/ref&gt; to save/restore all options and settings,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nahee.com/spanky/www/fractint/findex.html Fractint doc index]&lt;/ref&gt; required to recreate particular images.

Most important settigs are :
* [[Fractals/Computer_graphic_techniques/2D#Plane|plane description]] - par files 
* fractal type ( formula) - see also frm files
* [[Colors/Color gradient|color gradient]]  - see map files

Example file :

&lt;pre&gt;

  corners=-0.6014129278/-0.5990935452/0.427747516/0.429487053
  params=0/0 float=y maxiter=1000 inside=0 outside=15
  distest=1/10/320/200 
  }

&lt;/pre&gt;

To use it :
* Save file to fractint main directory. 
* Run fractint. 
* press 2 key
* press F6 key
* select file


Reset causes Fractint to reset all calculation related parameters to their default values. Non-calculation parameters such as &quot;printer=&quot;, &quot;sound=&quot;, and &quot;savename=&quot; are not affected. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nahee.com/spanky/www/fractint/image_calc_params.html fractint Image Calculation Parameters ]&lt;/ref&gt;The reset=1730 in the parameter file shows that it was created with 17.3 version of Fractint. &lt;ref&gt;[http://mailman.xmission.com/lurker/message/20110727.020825.b4307144.pl.html [Fractint&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; FOTD 27-07-11 (Bad Moon on the Rise [No Rating&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;)]&lt;/ref&gt;

3.2 Conventions

In developing the freeglut library, we have taken careful steps to ensure consistency in function operation across the board, 
in such a manner as to maintain compatibility with GLUT's behavior whenever possible. In this section some of the important conventions of FreeGLUT, 
and their compatibility with GLUT, are made explicit.

3.2.1 Window placement and size

There is considerable confusion about the &quot;right thing to do&quot; concerning window size and position. GLUT itself is not consistent between Windows and UNIX/X11; 
since platform independence is a virtue for freeglut, we decided to break with GLUT's behaviour. 
Under UNIX/X11, it is apparently not possible to get the window border sizes in order to subtract them off the window's initial position until some time after the window has been created. 
Therefore we decided on the following behavior, both under Windows and under UNIX/X11:

When you create a window with position (x,y) and size (w,h), the upper left hand corner of the outside of the window (the non-client area) is at (x,y) and the size of the drawable (client) area is (w,h). 
The coordinates taken by glutInitPosition and glutPositionWindow, as well as the coordinates provided by FreeGLUT when it calls the glutPositionFunc callback, specify the top-left of the non-client area of the window.
When you query the size and position of the window using glutGet, FreeGLUT will return the size of the drawable area
--the (w,h) that you specified when you created the window
--and the coordinates of the upper left hand corner of the drawable (client) area
--which is NOT the (x,y) position of the window you specified when you created it.

== App Stores ==

== What Are App Stores? ==
An '''App''' is a term to describe a web-based program.  These web-based or mobile applications perform a specific task for the user.  An '''App Store''' is a website where one can download these small programs for use on mobile devices such as a Smart phone, iPod, or Tablet.  The apps can be free or cost a small nominal fee.  Apps are designed to expand the functionality of a mobile device.&lt;ref&gt;www.wisegeek.com.  ''What is an App Store?'' Retrieved October 13, 2011 from:   http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-an-app-store.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  Apps can be used for personal or business related activities.


== How Does An App Store Work? ==
People usually access an App store from their mobile device (phone, iPod, tablet).  Apps are usually categorized by the App Store so the user can search for an app more easily.  Once the desired App is located in the App Store, the user can download, either for free or by purchasing them, an app onto a mobile device.  The App can then be opened and used on the mobile device.  


== Examples of App Stores ==
Currently there are five major App Stores:

'''Apple''' – The market leader in Apps – http://www.apple.com/mac/app-store/

'''Android Market''' - https://market.android.com/?hl=en

'''Blackberry App World''' - http://us.blackberry.com/apps-software/appworld/

'''Palm/HP App Catalog''' - http://www.hp.com/united-states/webos/us/en/apps.html

'''Windows Marketplace''' - http://www.windowsphone.com/en-US/marketplace

== How App Stores Can Be Used in Education ==

The creation of apps and the App Stores allows educators easy access to complimentary programs that can be used to teach students about specific content areas.  Many different Apps exist that provide the ability to create stories, newspapers, simulations, scavenger hunts, and real-life solutions to only name a few.  Technology has enabled the use of Apps to be used in the classroom by using devices such as an iPod&lt;ref&gt;http://www.apple.com/ipod/&lt;/ref&gt;, iPad&lt;ref&gt;http://www.apple.com/ipad/&lt;/ref&gt;, or a Smart Phone&lt;ref&gt;Wikipedia – The Free Encyclopedia.  Smartphone.  Retrieved October 13, 2011 from:  [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone]]&lt;/ref&gt;.  Using this type of technology increases student engagement, participation, and excitement about the material being taught.  Using apps purchased through App Stores enhances the learning environment for teachers and students.

Apps can be used in all subject areas, grade levels, and by all of the different levels of students.  They can be used for personal organization, collaborative and visual thinking, and to promote creativity.  There is a possibility of saving money by using apps instead of spending money on other costs like educational textbooks and software, going on field trips, expensive supplies and research materials, content expert fees, etc.

Apple&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apple.com www.apple.com]&lt;/ref&gt; is the leading App Store and the industry leader for educational apps [7].

* App Store Wikibook created by Chris L.  Researched all material and uploaded three images to the open content area; only used two in the wikibook though.  Created the reference section and linked all websites to the proper location/website.  I created the entire page myself.  I hope it is informative for all who read it!!

{{wikipedia|Quadrics}}
Quadrics are a way to create simple shapes, such as spheres or cylinders, from their maths equations.

Quadrics are usually drawn using the GLU (OpenGL Utility) library.  In this tutorial though, we target portability, in particular mobile devices, where GLU may just not be available, or only for OpenGL 1.x, so we'll implement it ourselves.  In addition we've get a better understanding than merely call of few functions :)

We can draw quadrics differently:
* solid / wireframe
* front-facing on the outside / on the inside

= Solving the equation =

So you might ask &quot;How on earth am I going to solve a THREE variables equations???&quot;.  Well, the answer is to define x and y, using a grid, and compute z.

There are two main ways to draw a grid for x and y values:
* square grid: make N points along the x axis, and for each of them, make M points along the y axis. This is a classic double-for loop as used with 2-dimensional C arrays.
* disk grid: define a circle radius N times, and compute M points on the circle (using cos/sin).
Both methods will produce different results visually.

When solving the equation, we'll meet two forms:
* &lt;math&gt;z = EQUATION&lt;/math&gt; : z is computed directly
* &lt;math&gt;z^2 = EQUATION&lt;/math&gt; : there are 3 cases:
** EQUATION is 0, and there's one solution (0)
** EQUATION is negative, and there's no solution
** otherwise, z has two solution, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\sqrt{EQUATION}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle-\sqrt{EQUATION}&lt;/math&gt;

= Sphere =

Equation : &lt;math&gt;{x^2 \over a^2} + {y^2 \over a^2} + {z^2 \over a^2} = 1&lt;/math&gt;

So : &lt;math&gt;z^2 = a^2 - {x^2} - {y^2}&lt;/math&gt;

So we have two z solutions for each (x,y) point (except when z = 0).

      <comment>/* Complex Power Function */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;br /&gt;
Cpow is library function in [[C programming]] language, useful to calculate power of a number raised to complex number.&lt;br /&gt;
It is the feature added to C programming language by 1999 standard i.e. C99.
== Complex Power Function ==
===Introduction ===
In [[mathematics]], complex number is denoted by 'z' .
    z = x + iy
In this number 'x' is the real part and 'y' is imaginary part.
'i' is imaginary unit ,where &quot;i&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = -1 &quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
Complex power is defined by the mathematical operation of exponentiation given by &quot;z&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;z&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&quot; .&lt;br /&gt;
In [[C programming language]] , library function for this is given by ''Cpow''.&lt;br /&gt;
==== Header File ====
&lt;br /&gt;Standard Library Header file :
[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/C_Programming/C_Reference/complex.h|&lt;complex.h&gt;](complex arithmetic)

==== Syntax for function ====
&lt;source lang =&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  double complex cpow(double complex x, double complex y);
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This function calculates the power of real number  'x' raised to y-th power ,where y is a complex number .&lt;br /&gt;
In mathematics ,by Euler's formula, e&lt;sup&gt;ia&lt;/sup&gt; = (cos a +i sin a).Here,cos and sin are trigonometric functions.&lt;br /&gt;
For x&lt;sup&gt;ia&lt;/sup&gt;,&lt;br /&gt;
x&lt;sup&gt;i .a&lt;/sup&gt; = e&lt;sup&gt;i .a ln(x)&lt;/sup&gt; = ( cos(a ln(x)) + i sin(a ln(x)) )  ;  ln  : logarithmic function to the base e.
====Return Value====

    This function shall return the complex power function value.
Returns the complex power of base x raised to the y-th power using the principal branch, whose cuts are along the negative real axis.
=== Usage of Cpow function===
&lt;source lang =&quot;c&quot;&gt;
//Program returns the complex number z3
#include&lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include&lt;complex.h&gt;
#include&lt;math.h&gt;
int main()
{       int x, y, p, q;
        double complex z1, z2, z3; //complex variables declaration
        scanf(&quot;%d %d %d %d&quot;, &amp;x, &amp;y, &amp;p, &amp;q);
        z1 = (p + q * I);
        z2 = (x + y * I);
        z3 = cpow (z2, z1);
        printf(&quot;%f + %f * i\n&quot;, creal(z3), cimag(z3));
        return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;</text>

{{displaytitle|title=Hardware Devices: Secondary storage devices}}
&lt;/NOINCLUDE&gt;
This section will be looking at the various forms of secondary storage devices (media).  For each device you should be familiar with the following details:
* [[w:Seek time|Seek time]] - The average time taken from requesting data to starting to read the requested data
* Capacity - The amount of data it is possible to store on a medium
* Write type - Whether it is read only, write only, or readable and writable
* Cost - How much it costs per megabyte
* Access type - Whether it uses Random Access or Serial Access
[[File:Random vs sequential access.svg|thumb|400px|center|sequential access requires all memory locations before the one sought to be read, before reaching it. Random access memory allows you to jump directly to the memory location you are seeking]]

Pay special attention to devices with an {{Font color||#ff9933|orange}} background, you need to be able to describe exactly how they work!

== Magnetic media ==
[[w:Magnetic storage|Magnetic media]] stores data by assigning a magnetic charge to metal.  This metal is then processed by a read head, which converts the charges into ones and zeros.  Historically, magnetic media has been very popular for storing programs, data, and making backups.  It looks set to continue in this role for some time. However, solid state technology is starting to be used more and more, storing programs and data on new devices such as mobile phones and cameras.

=== {{Font color||#ff9933|Hard disk}} ===
[[File:HardDisk2.ogg|thumb|thumb|Video of exposed hard disk drive (HDD)]]
Hard disks are usually found inside computers to store programs and data.  They are increasingly cheap and more and more companies are using them to back things up.  Hard disks can vary in physical size with some disks getting as small as your thumb. The capacity of a commercial disk is currently up to about 4 terabytes allowing users to read and write to them. They are constructed from several key components:
* '''Platter''' - Metallic disks where One or both sides of the platter are magnetized, allowing data to be stored.  The platter spins thousands of times a second around the spindle.  There may be several platters, with data stored across them
* '''Head''' - The head reads magnetic data from the platter.  For a drive with several platters there may two heads per platter allowing data to be read from top and bottom of each
* '''Actuator Arm''' - used to move the read heads in and out of the disk, so that data can be read and written to particular locations and you can access data in a Random fashion, you don't need to read your way through the entire disk to fetch a particular bit of information, you can jump right there.  Seek time is very low.
* '''Power connector''' - provides electricity to spin the platters, move the read head and run the electronics
* '''IDE connector''' - allows for data transfer from and to the platters
* '''Jumper block''' - used to get the disk working in specific ways such as [[w:RAID|RAID]]
[[File:Hard drive-en.svg|center|400px]]
For the exam you must be able to explain how a hard disk works:
# The platters spin around the spindle
# data is requested to be read from a particular area of a platter
# the actuator arm moves the read head to that track
# Once the data sector that is required has spun around and under the read head, data is read
# Read data is sent from the IDE connector to main memory
[[File:Cylinder Head Sector.svg|thumb|center|400px|Description of a hard disk platter]]
Writing data is very similar:
# The platters spin around the spindle
# data is sent to the hard disk using the IDE connector
# the actuator arm moves the write head to the track that will be written to
# Once the data sector that is required has spun around and under the write head, data is written to the platter

'''Pros'''
{{Plus|Fast seek times}}
{{Plus|Random access}}
{{Plus|High capacities possible}}
{{Plus|Low cost per megabyte}}

'''Cons'''
{{Minus|Very susceptible to damage from physical shocks}}

=== Magnetic Tape drive ===
[[Image:Dds tape drive 01.jpg|thumb|right|250px|DDS tape drive. Above, from left  right: [[w:Digital Data Storage|DDS]]-4 tape (20 GB), 112m [[w:Data8|Data8]] tape (2.5 GB), [[w:Quarter Inch Cartridge|QIC]] DC-6250 tape (250 MB), and a 3.5&quot; [[w:floppy disk|floppy disk]] (1.44 MB)]]
Increasingly obsolete, the tape has been a medium to deliver software and back up data since the early days of computing.  Nowadays they are used mostly for corporate backing up and archiving of data. Tapes are sequential data stores, meaning that if you had information stored at the end of the tape you would have to wind your way through the entirety of the tape before you could read it.  There is no random access like with a hard disk!  Tapes can be several terabytes in size and reading and writing can be very fast as long as you read or write continuous sections of the tape at once.

'''Pros'''
{{Plus|Fast}}
{{Plus|High capacity}}
{{Plus|Cheap per megabyte}}

'''Cons'''
{{Minus|Serial read and write capabilities}}

== Optical media ==

Optical media works by creating a disc with a pitted metallic surface.  There are several different types of disk out there ranging from 650 MB to 128 GB, with the pits and lands getting closer together for higher volume disks.  The principle behind how each of them works is the same.

=== {{Font color||#ff9933|CD-ROM}} ===
[[File:CPT Hardware-Secondary-OpticalDrive.svg|thumb|center|400px|close up of the surface of a CD being read]]
A CD-ROM is a metal disc embedded into a plastic protective housing. Each disc has to be 'mastered'; this is the process of creating the CD and placing the data on it. CDs are WORM (Write Once, Read Many) media; this refers to the fact that once they have been mastered, there is no way to change the data on them. 

'''Reading from a CD-ROM'''
# A single track runs in a spiral pattern from the centre of the disc to the outside, this track is made of pits and lands to represent the ones and zeroes of binary data
# A low-powered laser is shone on the metallic surface and the reflection is captured in a photodiode sensor, the lands reflect differently to the pits, meaning it can tell the difference between a 1 and a 0
# The disc spins and the laser follows the track
# The binary data (the 1s and 0s) are put together and the CD-ROM has been read

'''Pros'''
{{Plus|Cheap}}
{{Plus|Data cannot be written over by the consumer}}
'''Cons'''
{{Minus|Slow seek time}}
{{Minus|Data degrades with time, discs from 20 years ago might not work!}}
{{Minus|Can only be written to with a very high powered laser, which is not usually available in home computers}}
{{Minus|Data cannot be written over}}

=== {{Font color||#ff9933|CD-R}} ===
The CD-R is made of a reflective metal disk with a layer of (usually green, opaque) dye on top.

'''Writing to a CD-R'''
# A single track runs in a spiral pattern from the centre of the disc to the outside.
# A high-powered laser is shone onto the CD-R, changing the transparency (permanently) of the dye above. The transparent and opaque parts represent binary 1s and 0s
# The disc spins and the laser follows the track, putting the binary data onto the CD-R in a spiral track
# The data has been written

'''Reading from a CD-R'''

# The disc spins and the laser follows the track
# The binary data (the 1s and 0s) are put together and the CD-R has been read

=== {{Font color||#ff9933|CD-RW}} ===
The CD-RW is made of a reflective metal disk with a layer of a special ('phase change') metal on top.

'''Writing to a CD-RW'''
# A single track runs in a spiral pattern from the centre of the disc to the outside.
# A high-powered laser is shone onto the CD-ROM. Depending on whether this is very high powered or heats at a slightly lower temperature, the top layer of metal cools differently. These will result in different amounts of reflectivity, which represent the 1s and 0s.
# The disc spins and the laser follows the track, putting the binary data onto the CD in a spiral track

USB Flash drives are solid state, that means that there are no moving parts.  This is very useful for seek times as we don't have to wait for mechanical movement, meaning seek time is very low and it allows for fast Random Access Memory.  Flash drives can be set to read only mode, but they will always allow for reading and writing.  The size of flash drives is not as great as a Hard Disk and they are generally much more expensive per megabyte

# put drive into USB socket
# USB driver loads, providing the computer with code on how to read and write from the USB
# The USB is read, giving information on the file and folder structure (File Allocation Table) to the Computer
# [Reading] The user chooses to open a file, the Computer sends the address wanted to the USB port
# [Reading] The USB returns the data at the location requested
# [Writing] The computer sends data to the USB port where it is place into empty space on the drive
# [Writing] The computer then requests a new version of the file and folder structure

'''Pros'''
{{Plus|Very fast seek times}}
{{Plus|Very portable}}

'''Cons'''
{{Minus|Limited capacity}}
{{Minus|expensive per MB when compared to Hard Disks}}

=== Memory cards ===
Work in much the same way as a Flash drive and can often be converted into Flash Drives.  They have different connectors and are generally smaller than USB Flash drives allowing for them to be used in cameras, mobile phones and game consoles.

&lt;/NOINCLUDE&gt;
You should already have met the internal components of the computer and the peripherals, that sit outside.  We are now going to look at two different categories of peripherals.  Those that '''input''' data into a computer, and those that '''output''' data from the computer.
[[File:CPT Hardware-InputOutput.svg|thumb|center|Computers work along the lines shown above, they receive inputs (instructions etc.), they process the input working out what to do with it, then they output some form of result]]
How do we tell what is an input and what is an output device?  Think about it from the computer's perspective.  If a device is putting data into the computer in the form of text, sound, images, button presses etc. then it is an input device, if the device is outputting things from the computer such as sound, movement, printing, images etc., then it is an output device.  It really is that easy to tell the difference, but be warned, some devices can be both input and output!

Let's take a look at two examples:
{{CPTExample|title=Example: Telling the difference between input and output devices}}
[[File:LG L194WT-SF LCD monitor.jpg|thumb|center|An LG LCD monitor]]
When you are using the monitor it displays things that you are doing, such as moving windows and clicking on website links.  At no point do you click on the screen or put anything into the monitor.  The only thing it does is output information, therefore it is an output device.  Easy!
[[File:5 Tastenmaus Microsoft IntelliMouse Optical Black.jpg|thumb|center|An optical mouse]]
A mouse is used to move a little cursor around the screen, clicking and dragging as you go.  if you let go of the mouse, the cursor will stop.  The computer is relying on you to move the mouse, the mouse won't move on its own! Therefore it is an input device.

&lt;small&gt;This fact sheet has been written for those people suffering or affected by osteoarthritis. It provides background information of osteoarthritis and the current treatment and prevention strategies, more specifically resistance training for treatment and prevention. This fact sheet also provides details on where to find further information on osteoarthritis.&lt;/small&gt;

=== What is osteoarthritis (OA)? ===
&lt;small&gt;'''Osteoarthritis''' (OA) is the most common form of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthritis arthritis]. It is a chronic joint disorder that is the most common cause of joint pain and joint disability. It is characterised by the break down of joint [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartilage cartilage] that usually protects the bones joints allowing it to move freely. The joints that are more commonly affected are the spine, hands, hips and knees. In OA, the breakdown of joint cartilage leaves the bones exposed and unprotected resulting in damage that decreases the joints ability to move freely. Accompanying the loss of movement is a decreased ability to carry out daily tasks and normal living, resulting in a decreased quality of life for the individual.&lt;ref&gt;Jamtvedt, G, Dahm, KT, Christie, A, Moe, RH, Haavardsholm, E, Holm, &amp; Hagen KB 2008 ‘Physical Therapy Interventions for Patients With Osteoarthritis of the Knee: An Overview of Systematic Reviews’, Physical Therapy, vol. 88, pp. 123-136. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17986496&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

=== What are the symptoms of OA? ===
&lt;small&gt;The symptoms of OA can vary between sufferers. The symptoms that you experience will sometimes depend on which joints are causing you discomfort. The development of OA is a progressive disease, usually over several months or several years. Joint pain and stiffness are the most common complaints from sufferers of OA. You may experience over symptoms such as a reduction in range of movement (ROM), decrease muscle mass (muscle atrophy), joint swelling and physical disability. These symptoms may become worse when you are inactive for extended periods of time, such as driving for long periods of time. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.arthritisaustralia.com.au/images/stories/documents/info_sheets/english/colour/template_Osteoarthritis.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arthritis.org/media/newsroom/media-kits/Osteoarthritis_fact_sheet.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arthritis.org/media/newsroom/media-kits/Osteoarthritis%20fact%20sheet%20from%20AF-Final%2012_10_09.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

=== What are the risk factors of OA? ===
&lt;small&gt;The cause of OA is not yet clear, but research shows that there are certain factors that increase the risk of developing OA in certain joints, these include:
* knees: previous injuries, occupation e.g. carpet layers, being overweight, repeated overuse, muscle weakness due to minimal physical activity, genetics and aging. 
* hips: previous injuries, occupation e.g. removalist, being overweight and aging. 
* hands: previous injuries, heredity, repeated overuse and aging.
&lt;/small&gt;

=== What are the chances I develop OA? ===
[[File:Osteoarthritis world map - DALY - WHO2004.svg|thumb|right|alt=Example alt text|Age-standardised disability-adjusted life year (DALY) rates from Osteoarthritis by country (per 100,000 inhabitants).]]
&lt;small&gt;The chances of you developing OA increases with age. Research shows 5% of the entire population below 40 are affected by OA, this increases dramatically to 10% of males and 20% of females aged 45–65 years, and then further to affect more than 50% of women aged 85 years and over. 
OA can not only affect you via the cost of medicines and surgery but may affect you indirectly, such as loss of income, lost productivity, pain, disability, emotional impairment, impaired social function and other health-related quality of life issues. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mf/4823.0.55.001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://web.archive.org/web/20080729084239/http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/content/AD383BF1A9E16D5BCA25711A007AF405/$File/evid4.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mja.com.au/public/issues/180_05_010304/mar10381_fm.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

=== What are the treatment and prevention for OA? ===
&lt;small&gt;The overall goal, since there is no cure, is to reduce pain, improve overall function of the joints that are affected and more importantly eliminate the risks of you developing OA. You can meet these goals through the following methods of intervention:
* Pharmacological - drug therapy, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), glucosamine, chondroitin sulfate and paracetamol for pain relief.
* Non-Pharmacological – exercise therapy, such as '''resistance training''' for muscle strengthening, [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/User:J_griffin/Osteoarthritis_and_Aerobic_Exercise aerobic training] for weight loss.
* Surgical - joint replacement surgery, usually the last option if the symptoms can no longer be controlled by pharmacological and non-pharmacological preventions and treatments.&lt;/small&gt;

==== What is resistance training and how does it help? ====
&lt;small&gt;Resistance training is any exercise that causes your muscles to contract against a resistance. The expectation is an increase in strength, tone, mass, and/or endurance for muscle and bone. It has been reported that exercise, predominantly [http://www.dynamicstrength.com/ dynamic strengthening exercises], provides benefits for pain and function of patients suffering from knee and hip OA. 
Activities that are likely to be good for your fitness include walking, swimming, water exercise, low-impact aerobics, and riding a bike or exercise bike. Your physiotherapist can also suggest specific exercises and stretches that are appropriate for your situation.&lt;ref&gt;Maura Daly Iversen, Therapeutic Advances in Musculoskeletal Disease 2010 2: 279&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Taking Control of your Osteoarthritis, Arthritis Australia, http://www.arthritisaustralia.com.au/images/stories/documents/booklets/2011_updates/Taking_control_of_your_Ostoarthritis_booklet.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

==== What resistance exercises can I do to help?====
&lt;small&gt;Below you will find a list of exercises you can complete at home on a regular basis that will help you prevent and manage the onset of OA. These exercises are targeted at strengthening the muscles surrounding the hip and knee joints which are common sites affected by OA. They will help in reducing pain, increasing movement of the joint and increasing your ability in the gait cycle (walking).&lt;/small&gt;

(Note: References still being formatted)

The Train à Grande Vitesse, or TGV, which means High-Speed Train in English, is the French name for their high-speed rail (HSR) service in France. First connecting Paris to Lyon in 1981, the TGV was the first large-scale builder of HSR service in Europe, second in the world only to Japan’s Shinkansen. Today, the TGV network in France comprises nearly 2100 kilometers of track, with many more planned over the next few decades. 

==Introduction==

High-speed rail as we regard it today was first developed by Japan in the construction of their Shinkansen network. The Shinkansen utilized a separate rail infrastructure exclusively built for high-speed passenger service. This was done in part to provide the greatest safety to the trains and passengers and maximize efficiency. The 515-kilometer link from Tokyo to Osaka was designed to be flat and straight, which required many tunnels, bridges, and elevated section. This design approach led to significant cost overruns - double the original estimate - for the first Shinkansen line. &lt;ref name =&quot;hs2&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gourvish |first1=Terry |year=1 March 2010 |title=The High Speed Rail Revolution: History and Prospects |publisher=Department of Transport (UK) |url=http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/rail/pi/highspeedrail/hs2ltd/historyandprospects/pdf/report.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate= 7 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trains developed for the Shinkansen were designed to be lighter and less crash prone than their conventional counterparts. The lightweight nature of the trains reduced energy consumption and wear of the rails, thereby reducing operating and maintenance expenses. Electric overhead power provided the ability for trains to accelerate and decelerate quickly. A similar design approach was utilized in the development of the TGV.

Many advantages exist between the TGV and other modes of travel. The TGV provides arguably the best option for medium distance travel between major European cities, beating out the car in terms of travel time, and competitive with airlines in terms of travel time and ease of accessibility. Its success has shown over time that its speed and connectivity between major urban centers has made it a significant player in business and leisure travel. Additionally, energy consumption on the TGV is considerably lower than using a car or flying, which reduces operating expenses relating to travel. Since many of the high-demand, low-investment routes have already been constructed in France, expansion of the rail network is becoming increasingly difficult to justify. However, as the European Union attempts to elicit greater connection and competition between HSR service in different countries, the growth of the French network may continue for many years ahead.

==Before the TGV==

===Existing modes===

Prior to the development of the TGV network, three main options existed for those wishing to travel across France: conventional rail travel, automobile, and air travel. As the first TGV line opened was the 470-km Paris to Lyon route, this document will frequently on this link to compare different travel modes.

Conventional rail and the automobile both offered similar journey times prior to 1981. The drive between Paris and Lyon takes  approximately 4 hours 30 minutes, compared to 4 hours by conventional passenger rail. The advantages of the train included a modest time savings and freedom to engage in other activities. Highly-taxed petrol in Europe may deter people from driving, in addition to difficulties driving and parking in central area, but auto use provided greater flexibility and versatility in delivering travellers directly from their origin to their destination. Travelers choosing to fly could travel between the cities in only 75 minutes (excluding airport travel time and security). With these mode options, conventional rail competed more closely with the automobile, and high-speed travel was limited to air travel. 

===Limitations of existing modes===

There were growing limitations with each mode in the run-up to the TGV. Auto congestion is a typical problem of most major metropolitan areas. Furthermore, auto travel is usually limited for trips up to 200 km before other modes are considered. The conventional passenger rail service between Paris-Lyon route was at or near maximum capacity, and the service and infrastructure were not well-regarded &lt;ref name =&quot;hs2&quot;/&gt;. The the numerous flights between short-haul markets compounded congestion in airports for long and short-haul flights alike. Furthermore, since the two airports are not centrally located, and are not typically a destination in themselves, traveling by car or train is common among air travelers, particularly for those traveling to smaller cities and towns outside Paris and Lyon. Ultimately, greater capacity was needed to deliver passengers between the two cities, and to destinations beyond. &lt;ref name =&quot;hs2&quot;/&gt;

===New possibilities===

The development of the HSR network has been a part of the French Government’s efforts to modernize the rail network since WWII. This goal was inspired in large part by the success of Japan’s Shinkansen line. In 1976, France’s nationally owned rail company SNCF released their master plans, Objectif 2000, with a Paris-Lyon link being the first line to open.
The development of the train borrowed heavily from the Shinkhansen, with improvements focused on providing a train capable of being fast, safe, and reliable. Making the train lightweight was essential to providing a high power to weight ratio, which is important in delivering high-speed service. Stability was very important as well from a safety and comfort perspective. Rails on exclusive TGV tracks are carefully joined to eliminate the rythmic gallup typical of trains. Trains today are able to travel at speeds of 320 kph without making a glass of wine wobble. &lt;ref name =&quot;economist&quot;&gt; {{cite journal |year=7 July 2007 |title=A high-speed revolution |journal=Economist |volume= 384|issue=8536 |pages=61-62 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By implementing a staggered approach to network development, France learned from Japan’s financial troubles in developing a solely exclusive railway network. The TGV between Paris and Lyon was opened incrementally along existing, but upgraded, rail infrastructure, and eventually on exclusive rail infrastructure. By avoiding the need to build a completely separate rail infrastructure, France avoided some of the initial capital investments that Japan faced in the development of their separate HSR alignment. France’s decision to initially mix their high-speed system with existing rail infrastructure differs from other countries besides Japan. In Spain, new HSR infrastructure is being built to standard gauge track, whereas older conventional track was built at a non-standard gauge. This mixed gauge track issues has been resolved, but only with the development in recent years of gauge-changing technology. In Germany, their high-speed, conventional, and freight trains are all fully mixed in the system, meaning all trains are able to use the same track [hs2] which may create greater potential for delays and congestion.

France would ultimately build rail infrastructure exclusively for the TGV trains. However, while Japan designed a flat, straight track between Tokyo and Osaka, SNCF realized that with fast, lightweight, high powered trains, they could actually build rail at grades in excess of those typically allowed on heavy conventional rail. The construction of separate HSR infrastructure could then be built to more closely follow the topography of the land, significantly reducing earthwork costs. As a result, capital rail improvements for TGV lines are typically among the lowest in the world. [hs2]

The pricing structure that SNCF followed was based on a demand-based model. The TGV followed the yield management system adopted by airlines that varied prices based on the demand of a particular train based on its departure time and destination, and was the first rail company in Europe to do so. Implementing this profit-maximizing policy for the TGV from the beginning was essential to its success, and would have been more difficult to implement later on. [mr]

==TGV Sud-Est - Connecting Paris and Lyon==

The TGV Sud-Est from Paris to Lyon was decided upon as the inaugural route for the TGV. The first phase of the line opened in 1981, and the second phase opened in 1983. Investment was made initially where it was most greatly needed, and would provide the greatest impact. As the rail network and trains were state-owned, this vertically integrated structure made it easier to provide the funds necessary to develop the network. The congested route between Paris and Lyon was the clear choice, as it served 40% of the French population. The initial aim of the TGV was to attract business and leisure travelers looking that might short-haul flight. It also provides time savings and improved connectivity for existing rail travelers. The modest increase in time to take the TGV was considered palatable since many travelers could connect to conventional or metro train service from the train station, instead of switching modes at the airport on the edge of town.

Furthermore, the energy savings provided by HSR were significant. Whereas travel by plane equates to the equivalent of 7.1 liters of diesel fuel for every 100 passenger-kilometers, and 3.3 liters for auto travel, the TGV only utilizes only 0.7 liters of fuel over the same distance. In addition to the energy and associated cost savings, the reduction in energy consumption (in addition to the fact that the TGV operated on electricity via overhead wires), meant that the effects of air pollution from autos and planes might be significantly reduced.

Deployment of HSR infrastructure along this corridor made rail travel more comparable with air travel than with car travel. The travel time between Paris and Lyon on the TGV Sud-Est line was initially reduced from nearly 4 hours (227 minutes) to 2.5 hours (160 minutes). Further upgrades to the system have brought the travel time down to under 2 hours (115 minutes). [hs2]. Before 1981, modal share for trips between Paris and Lyon were 31% by air, 40% by train, and 29% by car or bus. After 1984, only 7% travel by air, 72% travel by train, and 21% travel by car. TGV now has a 90% share in high-speed service between the two cities, and air travel’s mode share has reduced by over 75%, and automobiles by nearly 30%. Deployment of HSR infrastructure has shifted rail travel to be more comparable with air travel than with car travel.  It is clear that the TGV made significant impacts on they way people travel between these two cities, the greatest impact being in mode shift to TGV from the air travel market [hs2]

==The TGV Network Expands==

The Sud-Est line was a major success for SNCF, and the TGV network continued to expand throughout France throughout the 1980s through the 2000s. The network expanded to Calais in the north, Marseilles in the south, Bordeaux in the southwest, and Strasbourg to the east. By 2010, nearly thirty years after the first TGV line, France had built or upgraded rail lines across 1600 km of France, connecting many of the major cities. The relative low cost of construction of the TGV lines has made the networks quick growth possible. 

The expansion of the TGV network to the far reaches of the country provide opportunities for international connections. The connection to Calais provided an eventual connection to London via the Channel Tunnel, and connections to the northeast toward Brussels and Amsterdam. The original Sud-Est line has expanded toward Marseilles, and continues on to the Spanish border, where TGV service will soon continue uninterrupted to Barcelona. The Haut-Bugey connection, completed in 2010, provides a shortcut for TGV service between Paris and Geneva, and the TGV Est line to Strasbourg will provide service to Germany.

For cross-border travel, train operators were created by multiple state-owned train companies to provide service between international destinations. Thalys International is one company that was created to provide high-speed passenger rail services between Paris, Brussels, Amsterdam, and Cologne. Capital ownership of the company is divided amongst SNCF (France), 28% held by the SNCB (Belgium) and 10% held by the DB (Germany). [Thalys]

Eurostar is a similar consortium that provides commercial passenger service between London, Paris, and Brussels. It is operated by a consortium of public and private companies in the UK, France, and Belgium. Eurostar became Eurostar International with its transition from a joint venture between the UK, France, and Belgium to a single corporate entity. [12] [6]

Technological improvements have continued since the TGV first began in 1981. In 1996, TGV unveiled its first double-decker train, which significantly increased capacity (and revenue) along routes that were becoming increasingly congested. Additionally, French trains are continually striving to provide faster service, and have broken rail speed records on numerous occasions. Most recently, a modified TGV train set a new record by reaching a top speed of 574.8 kph in 2007.

Policy changes began taking place in the mid-to-late 1990s with the European Union forcing many state-owned rail companies to split their rail ownership division from their trains operations. In 1997, France broke up SNCF, which controlled both the rail infrastructure and the rolling stock, and created the Réseau Ferré de France (RFF), or the French Railway Network. The RFF was split from SNCF, now simply the train operator, and inherited its debt, in order to make SNCF operationally profitable when train services are opened to privatization. RFF remains a state-owned company, and owns, maintains, and upgrades the rail network throughout France. [13]

==TGV Approaches Maturity==

===Effects of a growing HSR network===

As the TGV and European HSR network expands, it has had significant effects on air service between cities served by HSR. According to SNCF, the point at which more travelers choose air over HSR is at a train trip time of 4.5 hours [mr]. Given the density of the general population and large cities throughout western Europe, this has had significant impact on short haul air travel across Europe. At distances greater than 800 km (or about 3.5 hours travel time by train), air travel begins to take on a majority of the modal share based on current maximum travel speeds by HSR today. But train travel times of 2.5 hours or less show HSR capturing over 80% of the high-speed travel market. [Werner Rothengatter] The advent of HSR in Europe has certainly been detrimental to the airline industry in terms of market share. However, while HSR has been successful in the short-haul, high-speed markets, there are geographical limitations to the extent of a viable HSR network in Europe.

In France, determining the maximum extent of a high-speed rail network length may be helpful for estimating the maximum viable size of the network. As discussed above, the TGV was first deployed between Paris and Lyon. The TGV Sud-Est line provided high-speed access for 40% of the French population between the two largest cities in the country. It was an obvious choice, and perhaps unsurprisingly, quite successful. While the French government has significant leverage to fund the expensive capital investments to infrastructure and rolling stock, as passenger service shifts from SNCF to other carriers with the privatization of the train systems, greater attention will be paid to the return on investment of future service expansion. [hs2] As the network continues to grow, and the network branches out to more distant or less populated areas, or traverses more difficult terrain, subsequent expansion of the system may become difficult to justify. Certainly, there is a limit to the length of economically viable lines that can serve the French countryside.

The TGV network in France in still growing, and has not yet reached maturity, therefore, it is only possible to estimate the maximum value of HSR lines in France. The chart below shows a number of possible scenarios for the maximum extent of cumulative track mileage in France, based on nearly 40 years of completed and planned development of TGV lines. Table 1 shows a timeline of TGV development from 1981 to future lines planned into 2021.  By 2021, there will be approximately 2100 kilometers of high speed rail throughout France. Some estimates suggest that the network may reach 3500 kilometers in total.

===Determining the maximum extent of HSR in France===

What is a reasonable assumption for the maximum extent of rail on the TGV network? Most technologies follow a similar pattern of growth and decline, characterized by an “S-Curve”. This S curve can be represented by the equation

&lt;!-- :&lt;math&gt;S(t) = \frac{K}{1 + e^{-b(t-t&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;}} \! &lt;/math&gt; --&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;S(t) = \frac{K}{1 + e^{-b(t-to)}} &lt;/math&gt;

Where:

S(t) is the estimated cumulative track length at time t (in years);
t&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; is the inflection point at which ½ K is achieved;
K is the saturation level of cumulative track length, in kilometers
b is a coefficient that affects the steepness of the curve across time, t.

The data gathered for track length was analyzed using data analysis software in Microsoft Excel 2011. The results of the data are shown below.

[[File:ScurveTGV.jpg|thumb|600px|none|Saturation Level Of France's TGV Network]]

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!K !! 2500 !! 3000 !! 3500 !! 4000 !! 4500
|-
| b || 0.114 || 0.089 || 0.079 || 0.073 || 0.070
|-
| t&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; || 1998.82 || 2003.98 || 2008.26 || 2011.92 || 2015.12
|-
| t-stat || 37.8 || 30.5 || 25.8 || 23.6 || 22.3
|-
| R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; || 0.973 || 0.960 || 0.945 || 0.935 || 0.927
|}

The results show that values ranging anywhere between 2,500 and 4,500 kilometers (and possibly higher) are possible for maximum K values, based on the strength of the R-squared and t-stat numbers. These numbers are highest for K = 2,500 km. However, plans by the French government plans for up to 4,600 km of total track in the years ahead [BBC news article]. Based on the strength of the results from the regression analysis, the future saturation limit of HSR in France is difficult to predict based in the chronology of past construction.

===The future of HSR in France and Europe===

Analyzing the future effects of privatization and investment in future HSR service in France is difficult, particularly during the current global financial crisis, and the high volatility in oil prices around the globe. Ultimately, the success of TGV over time may provide France a competitive edge as the HSR network expands throughout Europe, and HSR services becomes privatized, meaning TGV services can enter markets outside of France. 

As markets open up to competition, the playing field around HSR is bound to get more interesting. The consortium of state-owned operators like Eurostar and Thalys may soon have to operate alongside other service providers, including new entrants to the market. With the decline of short-haul air travel, airlines like Air France have considered entering the HSR market, with one ticket offering connecting service between air and rail. In this scenario, rail and air travel may become as much complementary modes as they do competitive modes. [Spiegel]

In the interest of improving the operations and management of HSR across borders, the 7 HSR providers in Europe have formed a marketing alliance called Railteam. These companies include SNCF (France), Eurostar UK, DB (Germany), OBB (Austria), SBB (Switzerland), NS Hispeed (Netherlands), and SNCB (Belgium). This alliance is similar to partnerships between airlines in terms of marketing and sales, such as KLM and Delta. High-speed rail operatiors sought to create a booking system that would allow travellers to purchase tickets across multiple providers, and receive a comparable level of service, regardless of which train they traveled on. These efforts were abandoned in late 2009, when it was determined that the policies of each individual service provider were too difficult and expensive to bring together.One of the main goals in this alliance was not necessarily to develop or expand upon the physical technology of HSR, but to develop a single Europe-wide booking system to improve efficiency. This service would make it possible to book travel anywhere across Europe with a single ticket, in place of seperate transactions required for international travel (with exceptions for travel on Thalys or Eurostar lines). Due to increasing costs and complexities of creating this system, the project was scrapped in 2009. [BBC 2009]

Attempting to bridge differences in pricing and service policy between individual countries has made providing joint service difficult. In the near future, Deutsche-Bahn trains will soon travel on the TGV Est line linking Frankfurt and Paris. However, customers and workers in each country are accustomed to how their respective systems operate. Whereas France uses a demand-based pricing system with required reservations, Germany uses a fixed-price system, and reservations are not required. These differences have proven difficult for the two parties to resolve. Additionally, labor rules differ between the two countries further complicate matters between the separate operators. While a complete agreement has yet to take shape, SNCF and DB are working to bridge these gaps incrementally over time. [mr]

As the HSR rail system grows throughout Europe, technological advances will continue to improve the quality of service provided on the rail infrastructure itself. With the HSR market being opened up to competition through privatization, innovation will further grow the network over time.

iTunes Utalk:Welcome.


=='''What is iTunes University? ''' ==

iTunes U is an app for the iPad, iPhone, or iPod touch. The app allows access to free courses that are taught by instructors in schools and universities. Students are able to view their assignments, and check them off on the screen as they complete each assignment. Course materials are accessed through the mobile device and can be downloaded. iTunes U is similar to iBooks in layout and organization.  Users can search the catalog for the courses they want, and subcribe to the classes.  Courses that users subscribe to appear in their library.  Users are able to input notes directly to their class.  Educators can use iTunes U to upload their own courses to the app, and can include any notes, lectures, and assignments they wish to give to their students.  Links can be provided to other apps that will help with the class, such as graphing calculators.  iTunes U was designed to allow anyone with a mobile device easy access to continuing education.  



=='''History'''==
On May 30, 2007 at Cupertino, California iTunes U was officially announced. The purpose of iTunes U was to create, distribute, manage and control access to educational material consisting of video, PDF files and audio files for students. Institutions who wish to contribute to iTunes U are given their own iTunes U site that uses the Apple's iTunes Store infrastructure. This service is free to the user. Users may edit their sites by using an editing tool, the Woolamaloo Automator. This tool was created by Apple to permit users not familiar with XML tools to be able to make changes to their site.

== '''About''' ==
The most important thing about iTunes is that many of the resources are provided for no cost, allowing virtually anyone the opportunity for continued learning on many topics of interest. More than 800 universities have active iTunes U sites. About half of these institutions — including [http://www.standford.edu%20Stanford%20University Stanford], [http://www.yale.edu Yale], [http://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm MIT Open Courseware], [http://www.oxford.edu%20Oxford Oxford]and [http://berkeley.edu/ UC Berkeley] — distribute their content publicly on the iTunes Store. The [http://www.open.ac.uk/ Open University] in the UK set the record for the most downloads as of October 3rd, 2011 having reached 40 million downloads.&lt;ref&gt;Coughlan, S. (2011, October 3). Education and Family. In Open University’s record iTunes U downloads (BBC news). Retrieved from http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-15150319&lt;/ref&gt;

iTunes allows anyone to view lectures and video from the universities and institutions that participate. While there is some content that is blocked, the majority of the resources are for anyone. K-12 schools have found many ways to integrate the resource by providing professional resources on things like Special Education resources.
[[File:An_iTunes_Gift_Card2.jpg]]

== '''Participants''' ==
Participants include individuals and universities worldwide who may customize their iTunes site to fit their particular needs. Participants of iTunes U are able to limit the access to their sites to a specific set of viewers or individuals.&lt;ref&gt;What is iTunes U? (2011). Let the learning begin (apple). Retrieved October 14, 2011, from http://www.apple.com/education/itunes-u/what-is.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=='''Site Navigation'''==
Access to iTunes U may be gained through Apple’s iTunes store, just click the iTunes tab located at the top of the store page. To access specific colleges or universities the Universities &amp; College section must be visited.  The “Beyond Campus” sections allows to user to visit other institutions.

=='''Course materials and more'''==
Lectures are not the only benefit, iTunes U supports the PDF and ePub file format and can be used to distribute materials to students wirelessly to their e-readers, phones or computers.
Other resources may be found in iTunes U.  These include access to museums such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art and libraries such as The Library of Congress.  These resources and others may be found on the Beyond Campus page in iTunes U.

Additional iTunes University topics include art and architecture, business, communications &amp; media, engineering, health &amp; medicine, history, language, law &amp; politics, literature, mathematics, philosophy, psychology &amp; social sciences, religion &amp; spirituality, science, society, and teaching &amp; learning. There are lectures and courses for every age group from early elementary to college. When searching in a k-12 environment the main page has courses from various high schools from across the United States and even other countries such as Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Japan. Students studying a foreign language can find a course from a different country to actually apply the language they are learning to a real life environment. 

The Weekly Education Spotlight [http://www.apple.com/itunesnews/education/us/?cid=ITS-NAUS-ITUNESU-ITUNESNEWS090506 Education Spotlight] can be used by educators and students to find new courses or very popular courses that may be of interest to them. The spotlight can include a variety of features such as the Open University ''Volcanoes'', ''Lyndon B. Johnson: The Space Age'', Foxcroft Academy- ''English 111 Identity and Society'', and ''CSIS Careers in Global Development''. The Education Spotlight also highlights iBooks Textbooks such as ''The Writer's Voice'' by Lynne Dozier and Apps for Learning such as Virtual Human Body.

== '''How to Find the Good Stuff''' == 
the iTunes advanced search allows you to customize your search. If you are looking for lectures on Ancient Rome, you can &lt;br /&gt;

1)click on this [[itms://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZSearch.woa/wa/advancedSearch|link]]:&lt;br /&gt;

2)select iTunes U in the first box &lt;br /&gt;
 
3)type in your search term.&lt;br /&gt;


iTunes updates their main page regularly so if there is new content you will find it here. Then, if you find lectures by someone you like, search for other lectures by the same person.

For current affairs, look at [http://demos3.apple.com/WebObjects/Core.woa/Browse/fora.tv Fora.TV].  For general browsing, check out [http://demos.apple.com/WebObjects/Core.woa/Browse2/uctv.tv UCTV] and [http://demos3.apple.com/WebObjects/Core.woa/Browse/wgbh.org WGBH]&lt;ref&gt;Dara. (2011, August 5). The do it yourself scholar. In Guide to iTunes U. Retrieved October 21, 2011, from http://diyscholar.wordpress.com/guide-to-itunesu/?blogsub=confirming#subscribe-blog&lt;/ref&gt;



=='''Benefits'''==
Universities worldwide have a home for their digital content that may be accessed by students anywhere.  The materials on iTunes U are easily downloaded and viewed on a number of devices including PC, iPhones, Mac and iPods.
Teachers are able to bring the world to their students.  They may enhance their lessons by taking students on virtual field trips, attending concerts or lectures whenever it fits their lesson plans.  Students may access iTunes U as a reference source or study a concept more in depth.

Through iTunes U a lifelong learning process in encouraged. Schools may use the wealth of knowledge in iTunes U as a budget preserving measure.  University lessons may supplement a teacher’s classroom lessons.

==='''Accessible to all students'''===
iTunes provides resources for those with disabilities. For those who are vision impaired, they can use VoiceOver on the Mac and screen readers on PCs. Physically disabled can have the university brought to them allowing them to learn in an environment that is comfortable and with the necessities they require.

==='''K-12 Integration'''===
iTunes is online source of information that can be accessed by both students and teachers.  iTunes U has made many resources available for teachers at any grade level.  For example an extensive library of videos, audio lectures and lesson plans can be used for the classroom.  After an iTunes account is established the user can create a playlist based on grade level or subject.  Resources can be then downloaded into that playlist (Using iTunes in the Classroom, 2012).  A search tool is available within the application to find appropriate content.  Following a search, the user can then browse the results.  The results can be viewed using the preview feature.  Following the preview, the user can download the content to the library or move on to the next topic.  The library is an easy way to organize and access downloaded materials.  Within the library specific tabs can be setup based on the type of material.  In addition, the library owner can setup permissions to allow others to share all or some of the materials (iTunes U at Roosevelt University, 2011).   


K-12 schools are beginning to integrate the services of iTunes into their curricula and many state departments of education are also using the service. For example, the [http://www.doe.k12.ga.us/ Georgia Department of Education] site has categories for best practice writing, best practice social studies, teaching social studies and special education – significant cognitive disabilities. These resources can be helpful to teachers everywhere.

==Introduction==
===The Early Years===

The eastern United States was well developed and had been operating railroads for nearly 30 years before major settlements took shape in California during the 1850's.  After the discover of gold in 1848, numerous people fled to seek wealth in California during the gold rush.  Approximately 200,000 came between 1849 and 1851 with over 100,000 more coming in the next five years.&lt;ref name=&quot;r2&quot;&gt;Lewis, Robert. &quot;Photographing the California Gold Rush.&quot; History Today 52.3 (2002): 11-17. Web. [http://content.ebscohost.com.ezp1.lib.umn.edu/pdf13_15/pdf/2002/HIT/01Mar02/6299278.pdf?T=P&amp;P=AN&amp;K=6299278&amp;S=R&amp;D=aph&amp;EbscoContent=dGJyMNHX8kSep7M4zdnyOLCmr0mep7BSs664SK6WxWXS&amp;ContentCustomer=dGJyMPGrsEyuqbRJuePfgeyx44Dt6fIA].&lt;/ref&gt;  As a direct result of the sudden population growth, California became the 31st state in 1850.

The first railroad in California was the Sacramento Valley Railroad which operated from 1852-1877.&lt;ref name=&quot;r3&quot;&gt;Fickewirth, Alvin A. California Railroads: an Encyclopedia of Cable Car, Common Carrier, Horsecar, Industrial, Interurban, Logging, Monorail, Motor Road, Shortlines, Streetcar, Switching and Terminal Railroads in California. San Marino: Golden West, 1992. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  The 23 mile main line connected the San Fransisco Bay Area and Sacramento.  The track was seven inches wider than standard gauge which limited the compatibility with other railroads that would later be developed.  Since railroad technology had already been developed in the eastern United States, California's railroads could deploy much faster than the early east coast railroads.  As a result, California's railroads had a much shorter birthing phase as they could use the knowledge gained from the earlier railroads.  

Theodore Judah was the chief engineer for the Sacramento Valley RR and later the Central Pacific RR.&lt;ref name=&quot;r3&quot;&gt;Fickewirth, Alvin A. California Railroads: an Encyclopedia of Cable Car, Common Carrier, Horsecar, Industrial, Interurban, Logging, Monorail, Motor Road, Shortlines, Streetcar, Switching and Terminal Railroads in California. San Marino: Golden West, 1992. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  Judah was the main proponent in Sacramento for the development of a transcontinental railroad, but the idea did not gain support for several years.  The idea of an east to west link had gained interest after the settlement of Oregon in 1846, acquiring territories from Mexico in 1848, and the discovery of gold in California.&lt;ref name=&quot;r4&quot;&gt;&quot;Transcontinental Railroad.&quot; Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia. 6th ed. 1 Oct. 2011. Web. [http://web.ebscohost.com.ezp1.lib.umn.edu/ehost/detail?vid=4&amp;hid=17&amp;sid=56a8a377-932b-4d91-88ae-0215fc8cfaf4%40sessionmgr14&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=aph&amp;AN=39036752].&lt;/ref&gt;  Settlers traveled to the west coast by traversing the dangerous trails by horseback and wagon trains.  Adding a railroad would rapidly speed up travel time and make travel safer as well as reducing the cost of shipping goods long distances.  

Asa Whitney, a supporter of the idea form New York, had proposed it to congress in 1845.&lt;ref name=&quot;r5&quot;&gt;&quot;Asa Whitney.&quot; Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia. 6th ed. 1 Oct. 2011.

By 1893, five lines had been completed connecting the west coast to the rest of the United States.  The Northern Pacific and Great Northern Railroads had built lines connecting Oregon and Washington to Minnesota and the Great Lakes.  The Santa Fe Railroad connected Los Angeles to Atchinson, Kansas, and the Southern Pacific Railroad connected Los Angeles to New Orleans, Louisiana.

===Steady Growth===
Once the first transcontinental railway was completed, California's Railroads shifted most of it's construction emphasis to linking the state north to south instead of east to west.  This had substantial benefit, but not as much as linking to the eastern United States, so expansion of the railroad network followed a linear model for the next several decades.  During this time some railroads were already being consolidated.  In 1877, the Sacramento Valley Railroad and the Folsom and Placerville Railroad merged to form the Sacramento and Placerville Railroad.&lt;ref name=&quot;r3&quot;&gt;Fickewirth, Alvin A. California Railroads: an Encyclopedia of Cable Car, Common Carrier, Horsecar, Industrial, Interurban, Logging, Monorail, Motor Road, Shortlines, Streetcar, Switching and Terminal Railroads in California. San Marino: Golden West, 1992. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  From 1870 to 1900, larger railroads like the Southern Pacific and the Northern Railway began to take control over numerous smaller railroads.

===Maturity and Steady Decline===
With some railroad tracks at capacity and others underutilized, it was time for restructuring and more consolidation.  Over a hundred different railroads had operated in California by 1890 and almost a hundred more started operation between 1890 and 1910.  There were too many railroads to efficiently operate all at once.  The major railroads of Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe, Southern Pacific, Central Pacific and Union Pacific were consolidating with other smaller railroads.  California was experiencing many of the problems that all railroads in the U.S. faced.  At the start of World War I, railroads were the largest industry in the country and access to eastern ports was congested.&lt;ref name=&quot;r7&quot;&gt;Garrison, William L., and David M. Levinson. The Transportation Experience. New York: Oxford UP, 2006. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  In order to avoid shortages and provide more efficiency, the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) was granted more powers.  Later in 1917, the government to control of the largest railroads and put them under the control of the United States Railway Administration (USRA).  Nationalization did not help reduce shipping costs so the Transportation Act of 1920 was passed and returned railroads back to private ownership.  By this time, the miles of railroad track in California had already peaked in 1915.  Track miles were maintained for almost a decade before starting a slow annual decline as a result of the Great Depression and World War II, as well as the rise in airplanes as an alternative mode to the railroads.

==Methodology==
The analysis of the life cycle of most modes of transportation follows a traditional logistic curve also known as an S-curve.  In the early years, advancements in the technology result in rapid growth that can be modeled as a period of exponential growth.  A single innovation can spark several improvements and multiple benefits.  As the system expands, the rate of return weakens to a linear relationship.  Adding new rail lines results in some benefit, but not as much as implementing the first lines did.  Eventually the network grow big enough such that the most profitable lines were are built and new line result in little benefit to the entire system.  As the system matures, the extent of the network levels off and begins to decline as a result of consolidation and optimization of the system.  Typically, a new technology comes along to make the old technology obsolete and it declines to extinction or to an optimal lower level of service.

The Logistic Formula:

&lt;math&gt;S(t) = K/\left(1+e^ {-b  ( t - t_0 )}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

Where:
*S(t) is a measure of the transportation system at a given time [miles of railroad in California]
*t is time [years]
*t&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the time when S(t) is at the inflection point of the S-curve [years]
*K is the maximum capacity of the transportation system [miles]
*b is a coefficient that affects how quickly a system reaches maturity


The S(t) formula can be transformed to get a the following linear relationship:


&lt;math&gt;\ln\left(\cfrac{S(t)}{(K - S(t))}\right) = c + b \times t&lt;/math&gt;


Where:
*b from the S-curve
*c = -b * t&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;

There are three unknown parameters (K, n, c) and only two can be fitted, so different K values are chosen and linear regression is done to get the other two using the Least Squares method.  Microsoft Excel is used to perform the analysis and obtain the slope and intercept of the best fit line.  Since the miles of railroad peaked in 1915 at 8451, the real K value is set at 8460.  However, this does not fit the data very well, so Excel's solver is used to obtain the best K, m,&amp; a while minimizing the sum of the square errors.  The optimal parameters for the S-curves can be seen in Table 2.  The S-curves only model the growth phase and only use the data until 1915 to do the linear regression to fit K, n,&amp; c.

The plot of the data in Figure 1 indicates that the birthing and the maturity phases were very short compared to the time span of the entire system.  This indicates that the data may actually follow a two stage linear model, one for the growth phase and one for the decline phase.  The peak number of miles occurs in 1915, so the year 1915 serves as the breaking point for the analysis of the growth and decline phases.  Again Excel is used to do the linear regression and the optimal parameters can be seen in Table 3.     

Data about California's railroads was obtained from numerous annual ''Statistical Abstracts'' from the U.S. Census Bureau.&lt;ref name=&quot;r1&quot;&gt;United States. U.S. Census Bureau. U.S. Department of Commerce. Statistical Abstracts. 1881 1887 1891 1896 1900 1904 1908 1911 1913 1914 1916 1917 1920 1950 1970. Web. [http://www.census.gov/prod/www/abs/statab.html].&lt;/ref&gt;  Each report gave data for every five or ten years and the individual year data for two or three years before the publication of the report.  In order to make a complete data set, data from several reports was merged together and can be seen in Table 1 below.  For some of the annual reports, the numbers contradicted each other; thus, for the purposes of this analysis, the most recent value was consider to be more accurate.

==Analysis==
In Figure 1, the life cycle phases can be seen.  There is no distinct point at which the birthing ends and steady growth begins, but the transition year is found to be 1875.  Similarly, the growth period ends rather abruptly with a little or no transition period.  The year decided to be the beginning of maturity is 1911.  A slow steady decline is deemed to begin in 1920 and continue through WWII.  The timing of maturity occurs at approximately the same time the entire United States railroads mature and is contributed by the start of WWI and failed nationalization of larger railroads at the time.  The continual decline in the 30's and 40's is mainly contributed to the Great Depression and WWII.

In Figure 2, the two best fitting S-curves are illustrated with the data.  Since the transition between phases is rather abrupt, the curves do not fit particularly well.  Even though the S-curves were fitted using only the growth data, the location of t&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and the tight transitions cause the S-curves to predict capacity is not reached until approximately 1930, 15 years later than reality.  Figures 4 and 5 illustrate that the transformed data has an weak linear relationship as the r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; values are 0.84 for K=8460 and 0.91 for K=9152.104.

Since the S-curves were not very accurate at predicting the annual track miles, a two stage linear model was analyzed and can be seen in Figure 3.  The fit for the growth phase had an r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; value of 0.99 and the decline phase had an r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; value of 0.91.  Only the first year of the birthing phase does not get modeled accurately with a linear relationship and the r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; values are significantly better than the S-curves.

==Conclusion==
The deployment of California's railroads was greatly influenced by the historical events of its time.  The gold rush created the demand for more efficient transportation modes.  The divisions between the north and south delayed the start of construction on the first transcontinental railroad.  World War I, shipping congestion, and experimental nationalization of the larger railroads started the maturity phase.  The rise of the airplane as an alternative to railroads, the Great Depression, and World War II caused the miles of railroad track to slowly decline in the 30's and 40's.

Since railroad technology was already being improved in the rest of the country, California's railroads experienced a short birthing phase.  Railroads were able to deploy technology that was already proven to be successful elsewhere.  The relatively unexpected level of track miles in 1915 due to other issue going on in the U.S. could have prematurely ended the growth phase.  A short birthing phase and transition periods can explain why a linear model fits the data better.  If California's railroads had developed independently from the rest of the country, perhaps an S-curve would fit the data better then and linear model.  Like any technology, the success or failure of California's railroad was directly dependent on the alternative modes and the external factor the entire country was facing during the time period.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi

This is Susan Parker. I am pharmacist by profession and I always like to get more information about various health medications through research on the web. I have carried my research for various diseases such as Cancer, Ulcer, Diabetes and few related to men's health such as [http://www.buzzpharmacy.net/ Erectile Dysfunction]. I think these days herbal medicines are getting more demand over the other antibiotics options.

I would love to get more information on relative topics on this portal.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The termios simple example contains:

while (c!='q')
{
   if (read(tty_fd,&amp;c,1)&gt;0)        write(STDOUT_FILENO,&amp;c,1);              // if new data is available on the serial port, print it out
   if (read(STDIN_FILENO,&amp;c,1)&gt;0)  write(tty_fd,&amp;c,1);                     // if new data is available on the console, send it to the serial port
}
 
This liveloop is terrible resource hog, but novices don't know this;
nevertheless this get into many implementations.

* In termios example variable rdset looks unused; looks like &quot;select&quot; part of loop was forgotten
* Are you sure you want to explicitly set c_*flag to 0 after memsetting the whole structure?</text>

==Competition==
There are several ways to travel between countries across oceans, but commercial airliners currently have a monopoly on travel speed.  Before the introduction of motorized ships, a reasonable transatlantic travel time for sailing ships was one to two months.  Motorized ships running on coal brought a spectacular improvement in speed and reliability further reducing one-way transatlantic travel to 16 days in 1840.&lt;ref name=Decker&gt;Decker, Kris D. Life without Airplanes: from London to New York in 3 days and 12 hours. Low-tech Magazine. 4 June 2008. Retrieved 12 October 2011. [http://www.lowtechmagazine.com/2008/06/ocean-liners.html]&lt;/ref&gt;  With the advent of diesel engines and alternative, weight reducing building materials, travel times were decreased even further.  In 1952, the SS United States built primarily out of aluminum set the record for the fastest transatlantic crossing of 3 days and 12 hours at a speed of more than 54 km/h which still stands today.&lt;ref&gt; Liner Transatlantic Crossing Times, 1838 - 1952 (in days). The Geography of Transport Systems. Retrieved 10 October 2011. [http://people.hofstra.edu/geotrans/eng/ch3en/conc3en/linertransatlantic.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another form of transportation that appeared before and remained competitive with the commercial airliner until the 1940s and 50s were airships, specifically Zeppelins. Perhaps the most successful passenger airship of all time was the LZ 127 Graf Zeppelin.  It logged over a million miles during its life -- including the first round-the-world flight in 1929.  On October 11, 1928 it departed Friedrichshafen, Germany inaugurating aerial transatlantic passenger service.  After a flight of 111 hours and 44 minutes, the ship landed at Lakehurst, New Jersey on October 15, 1928.  It carried a crew of 40 members and 20 passengers&lt;ref name=Graf&gt;Graf Zeppelin History. Airships: The Hindenburg and other Zeppelins. 2009. Retrieved 12 October 2011. [http://www.airships.net/lz127-graf-zeppelin/history]&lt;/ref&gt;  The return trip to Germany took 71 hours and 49 minutes, or just under three days.  Ocean liners of the day took twice as long to carry passengers across the Atlantic.&lt;ref name=Graf&gt;Graf Zeppelin History. Airships: The Hindenburg and other Zeppelins. 2009. Retrieved 12 October 2011. [http://www.airships.net/lz127-graf-zeppelin/history]&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite faster travel times, zeppelins were severely disadvantaged in other ways.  Passenger loads were normally if not always under 100 people and because of their enormous size they were very resource intensive requiring huge manufacturing hangers and specialty docking areas.  The grand zeppelin era when out in a blaze as the infamous Hindenburg, buoyant with explosive hydrogen, became a gigantic floating then falling fireball.

==Birth of International Flight==

===Advantages===

====Speed====
As the ear of the zeppelin self-destructed, the public demand for quick travel edged other modes of transit as well.  By the 1940s and 1950s, commercial transatlantic flights had ushered in a new reference system measured in hours rather than days.  A single commercial airplane could travel from NYC to London across the Atlantic Ocean in 5 or 6 hours.  Quickness and directness have been and continue to be the greatest assets of aviation.  Most vacationers and travelers today are limited in travel time due to work obligations consequently increasing the importance of quick, hassle-free travel.  Previously, with ships and zeppelins, travelers would have determine if the duration and quality of potential vacation experiences would outweigh the duration of travel time. Now, vacationers can book a plane ticket, hop a plane and have a meal in a country thousands of kilometers away in the same day.

====Capacity====
Passenger capacities also make airline travel very competitive.  Early passenger loads were similar to those carried by Zeppelins, but with technological advances in building materials, weight saving techniques and increased engine thrust, hundreds of passengers can now be moved at once.

====Safety====
Safety is another advantage of airline travel.  Based solely on deaths or even crashes per kilometer traveled, airplanes are one of the safest means of transit ever. Pilot expertise and safety regulations on planes have reduced the amount of flight accidents. Air travel generally avoids most weather patterns by flying above the clouds, which makes the trip safe and unaffected by storm activity. On the other hand, sea travel is directly affected by any weather changes, which create wind or cause large waves, sometimes extending the voyage making it tedious and more dangerous. Sea travel also requires skilled navigation to avoid dangerous rock formations or ice flows, while air travel has fewer such dangers.&lt;ref&gt;McKenzie, Richard B. Making Sense of the Airline Safety Debate. Cato Review of Business &amp; Government. 1991. Retrieved 12 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  These dangers can be further reduced by using auto pilot technology.

====Pricing====
Lastly, demand for air travel has increased the number of international flights and carriers, making commercial airliners even more desirable.  Initially, flying was a very expensive mode of transportation, which only the wealthy could afford but as markets went global companies began paying for businessmen to fly. Now, competition between carriers has driven down flight costs and increased travel options with regards to varied flight times, directness, amenities and comfort.

===Innovation===
* Jet engine:  Although patents for working gas-powered jet engines have been awarded since the late 1700s the first to actually power an airplane was developed by a German named Hans von Ohain. A successful first flight on August 27, 1939, established the Heinkel He 178 as the world's first jet plane.&lt;ref&gt;Warsitz, Lutz: THE FIRST JET PILOT - The Story of German Test Pilot Erich Warsitz (p. 125), Pen and Sword Books Ltd., England, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  By the 1950s the jet engine was almost universal in combat aircraft and was becoming common on British commercial passenger planes.  By the 1960s, all large civilian planes were jet powered despite piston and prop engines being more efficient fuel burners.  With the advent of high bypass turbofan jet engines which better performed at high speeds and high altitudes, jet engines became as efficient as precursor engines.&lt;ref&gt; Chapter 10: Technology of the Airplane. Quest for Performance: The Evolution of Modern Aircraft. Part II: The Jet Age. Hq.nasa.gov. Retrieved 12 October 2011. [http://www.hq.nasa.gov/pao/History/SP-468/ch10-3.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, gas turbine engines phased out props in commercial applications because they have a great power-to-weight ratio.  Gas turbine engines are also smaller than their reciprocating counterparts of the same power.  Consequently, commercial airliners were encouraged to grow.
* Kerosene fuel: Increases in flight altitudes and lengths meant components and fuel would be subject to a greater number of conditions. Jet fuel known as Jet-A was developed especially for commercial jet planes provided much needed consistency and  reliability.  Jet-A is pure kerosene which has a high flashpoint (temperature at which fumes can be ignited by an open flame) and is high in octane (ensures efficient fuel burning).  It is often mixed with antifreeze to prevent ice build up in the fuel tanks, potentially blocking fuel lines and stalling engines.
* Auto pilot: Navigational accuracy is an essential part of an auto pilot system.  By reducing minute navigational errors commonly made by human pilots, auto pilots can reduce flight times and maximize fuel efficiency.  As a result, auto pilot systems ensure reliable maximum linear distances.
* Composite Materials:  Since the use of aluminum for airplanes in the 1920s, several composite materials combining two or more organic or inorganic components such as fiberglass, carbon fiber, and other exotic fibers have been developed and used.  The greatest value of composite materials is that they can be both lightweight and strong. The heavier an aircraft weighs, the more fuel it burns, so reducing weight is important to aeronautical engineers.&lt;ref name=Composites&gt; Composites and Advanced Materials. US Centennial of Flight Commission. [http://www.centennialofflight.gov/essay/Evolution_of_Technology/composites/Tech40.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, aluminum can be repaired after sustained denting.  Composites cannot.  Although about 10% of the structural weight of the Boeing 777 is composite material, commercial airliners will likely continue to be built using aluminum because it requires less maintenance.&lt;ref name=Composites&gt; Composites and Advanced Materials. US Centennial of Flight Commission. [http://www.centennialofflight.gov/essay/Evolution_of_Technology/composites/Tech40.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Policies===
* Fuel types were regulated to ensure safety.  Jet engines are much more sensitive to the chemical and physical properties of fuel than gasoline and diesel engines.&lt;ref name=a&gt; The History of Jet Fuel. Air BP. [http://www.bp.com/sectiongenericarticle.do?categoryId=4503664&amp;contentId=57733]&lt;/ref&gt;  &quot;Advances in engine and aircraft design greatly expanded varieties of flight envelope which necessitated new standards for turbine engine fuel quality. This led to the introduction of a variety of fuel types for different purposes and to the development of specifications to ensure the fuel met equipment requirements and burned reliably under all flight conditions.&quot;&lt;ref name=a&gt; The History of Jet Fuel. Air BP. [http://www.bp.com/sectiongenericarticle.do?categoryId=4503664&amp;contentId=57733]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Runway length:  Each plane model has minimum takeoff and landing distance requirements.  Runway lengths had to be standardized not only to to make international flight possible but to encourage it.

==Growth Period==

===Policies===
* Runway Protection Zones: &quot;Trapezoidal areas off the end of the runway end that serve to enhance the protection of people and property on the ground in the event an aircraft lands or crashes beyond the runway end.&quot;&lt;ref name=b&gt; Runway Protection Zones. Central Region Airports Division. AIP Sponsor Guide – 500. 1 October 2010. Retrieved 14 October 2011.

First, the airport must own the land.  Second, the airport owner must protect the RPZ from both obstructions and incompatible land uses. Finally, the airport owner must strive to attain compatible zoning around the airport in order to prevent incompatible land uses that could cause or lead to conflicts that endanger the airport, cause the airport to close, to require substantial remedial investment to purchase conflicting developing property.&lt;ref name=b&gt; Runway Protection Zones.

* Landing Fees: A regulation that requires a an airplane pay a fee to the airport at which it lands. If lots of planes want to land at a busy airport, the landing fees will be high due to great demand for a fixed amount of terminals. These high costs disproportionately favor large commercial airplanes because they can carry large numbers of people to offset the costs of the fees.  Therefore, high landing costs encourage larger planes.
* Runway Length: As commercial planes become bigger and bigger they require more and more runway to takeoff and land on.  As a result, airports often have to extend their runways in order to capture the business of these larger airplanes. By actively protecting RPZs early on airports can accommodate runway extensions and reap the benefits the larger airplanes bring.
* Security Procedures: Many of the security policies such as full body scans, liquid restrictions, shoe and belt removal put in place after 9/11/01 have made international travel more bothersome than it used to be. The outcomes of one day ten years ago has and will continue to negatively impact the growth of international air travel.

==Methodology==

The process of calculating passenger kilometers involved several steps. First, an &quot;international flight&quot; was defined as a flight consisting of at least 5568 km (the distance from NYC to London).  This established the minimum flight range and eliminated commercial passenger planes flying prior to 1938.  It also insured consistency throughout the data and subsequent analysis.  Secondly, a list of planes and their first service years was put together with the help of Wikipedia.  Thirdly, aircraft technical data and specifications regarding the maximum passenger configurations of each plane, their maximum flight ranges, and entry date into service were obtained.&lt;ref&gt;Aircraft Technical Data &amp; Specifications. 2011. Retrieved 10 October 2011. [http://www.airliners.net/aircraft-data/]&lt;/ref&gt;  Fourthly, passenger kilometers were calculated as the product of the number of passengers a plane can carry multiplied by that planes flight range.

Using the regression tool in excel, regression results for several K values ranging from 17000000 to 31000000 were produced.  Then  the adjusted R squared, F score and T score from each result of K were placed in a table and visually compared (refer to table 6).

As the values of K increased, the Adjusted R Square plateaued at about 71 percent indicating 71 percent of the movements (generated numbers) are explained in the adjustments of the variable.  Additionally, the F score stabilized at 54 and the T score at 7.4 indicating that the model on the whole is statistically significant.

The Adjusted R Square value of .71 was associated with a K value of 27000000 km.  After 27000000 km, all three measurements (adjusted R, F score, and T score) changed less than .1 between each subsequent K value.  This minimal change indicates that all values of K after 270000000km are equally good models for determining K, even 50000000 km.  Therefore, K = 27000000 was used as the best fit line of regression.

As previously explained, the K value of 27000000 was chosen because it marked the beginning of the plateau.  Table 5 synthesizes the information gathered from the regression calculation for the K value of 27000000.  Using the calculated intercept and b coefficient, t0 (the inflection point in years where passenger km begins increasing at a decreasing rate) can be figured.  t0 for K = 27000000 is the year 2031.  Using these variables, an S-curve was calculated using the equation S(t) = K/[1+exp(-b(t-t0)].  The resulting S-curve on the right depicts advances in passenger kilometers will begin to decrease after year 2031, and begin leveling off at 27000000 passenger kilometers in roughly the year 2170 in the graph.  Because all parameters are maximum numbers, the determined inflection point is a relative extreme value if fuel types remain consistent.  Changes in fuel type and fuel efficiency were not factored into this analysis.

==Maturity==
===Policies===
* Runway and terminal lengths will likely limit the final size of large planes.  Although larger planes will continue to be more profitable than small planes in the presence of landing fees, terminal size will become an issue.  A trade off will have to be made between the number of planes allowed to dock at an airport or the size of the airplanes allowed to dock. 
* Some airports have more room to expand than do others.  This may lead to a size specialization in commercial flight in which super mega planes are able to take off and land at select airports.  However, this specialization is likely disadvantageous since in order to truly reap the benefits of a super mega sized plane it should be operated around the clock all year long.  Not doing so, would be a waste of capital investment.  Then again if super mega planes can only travel between select airports the number of trip options and possibilities go down further decreasing their economic viability.

 
Despite the model, the range of commercial airplanes has likely reached its peak because there is no need for a plane that can fly more than half way around the world.  Therefore, to increase passenger kilometers per flight, planes will have to get bigger and carry more passengers. The Airbus A380 is currently the largest airplane in the world and like the Boeing 747 before it, will likely hold that title for several decades. Reason being, the costs of building larger planes and the costs of adapting infrastructure (terminals and runways) to accommodate larger planes will likely curb the growth in passenger kilometers per flight.  Therefore, although the model predicts growth until year 2170, the growth will likely be sporadic and may result in a maturity plateau before 2170.

==Conclusion==
Demand for quick, safe and cheap international travel has driven airline companies to invest in larger airplanes, light weight composite materials and larger, more efficient engines.  When combined, those factors have increased fuel burning efficiencies, and contributed to an increase in potential passenger kilometers per flight.  Based on the maximum passenger capacity and flight range of 22 planes, passenger kilometers traveled per flight will exponentially increase until year 2031 then exponentially decrease until the technology plateaus around year 2170 according to the produced model.  Although the model predicts this, it may be skewed by the enormous passenger capacity of the recently inaugurated Airbus A380.  Introductions of mega planes such as the A380 are few and far between resulting in a rather sporadic data set which affects the inflection point and year of maturity.  Additionally, other constraints such as the size of the world and length of runways have already begun to limit necessary maximum flight ranges and plane size (directly affects passenger capacity).  Therefore, maturation of passenger kilometers per flight will likely happen earlier than the model predicts.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Welcome message ==
Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to [[Help|help]] you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* Make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window (if javascript is enabled on your browser) that will insert it too (looks like part of a signature). This will let others know who left it, and make it easy to reply back to you.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]] (global to the system) or in a page on your own userspace.
* Remember to use [[Commons:Main Page|Commons]] project for image uploading.
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* Wikibooks are open-source textbooks. ([[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]]).
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer since things work a little different here.
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]].
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Help us by participating in policy and guideline creation.
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to keep a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you have questions, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or [[User_talk:Panic2k4|ask me personally on my talk page]]. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be a good idea to add that page to your &quot;[[Special:Watchlist|watchlist]]&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there. You can do that by clicking the tab labeled &quot;watch&quot; at the top of the page.

&lt;small&gt;&lt;small&gt;(This is not an automated message, I'll be watching during a time for any reply you make to it...)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

Good luck!  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 18:57, 14 October 2011 (UTC)

== strcat_s() ==
I moved the addition you made regarding the function to  the page [[C++ Programming/Lost Bits]] (the move was due to the reason that the function is non-standard and would be out of place on that location). I have added a todo box explaining a possible use of the content in a more encompassing way to the readers.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 18:57, 14 October 2011 (UTC)</text>

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;
&lt;!--redirect regex: [Dd]ead[ _]+link|[Dd]l|[Dd]eadlink|[Cc]leanup-link|[Dd]l-s|404|[Bb]roken[ _]+link|[Bb]rokenlink --&gt;
{{Template shortcut|404|dl|dead|Broken link}}

==Usage==
Use {{Tl|dead link}} when you find a [[w:WP:Linkrot|dead link]] to a website within a paragraph or a [[WB:REFS|reference citation]]. Doing so will place a note by the URL and add the page to the [[:Category:Pages with dead external links]] category.

Append this template '''directly after''' the link or template, leaving the original link intact.  Not doing so will prevent detection from automated tools.  If the citation contains multiple URLs (e.g. chapterurl and url) in a template, and only one is broken, you can use &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;!-- hidden text --&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; to explain which one is broken.

If the article uses [[WB:REFS|clickable footnotes]], then this tag should be placed just before the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; that contains the dead link. The notice will then correctly appear in the reference section (instead of in the body of the text, which is not recommended).

Avoid using this template to identify dead external links that are ''not'' used as references for book content.  Instead, dead external links should normally be removed.

;Common form (with current date)
&lt;tt&gt;{&amp;#123;Dead link|date={{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTYEAR}}}}&lt;/tt&gt;

===Optional parameters===
;url: Provides a history of the linked page via [[w:Wayback Machine|Wayback Machine]].  Set '''only''' if history actually exists, as otherwise it is misleading to users and editors.
;date: Month name followed by year, for use by the categorization system.  Use &lt;code&gt;date={{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTYEAR}}&lt;/code&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;If you don't add a date parameter, a bot will date your entry with the month and year at a later time.
;bot: [[Wikibooks:Bots|Bot accounts]] specify the |bot= parameter as a sign that the tag was added by an automated process.  Set as &lt;code&gt;bot=&lt;bot name&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.

==Examples==
*&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
|url=http://example.org
|title=title
|accessdate=2000-01-01
}} {{Dead link
|date=April 2005
}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br/&gt;→ &lt;span style=&quot;background:white&quot;&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
|url=http://example.org
|title=title
|accessdate=2000-01-01
}} {{Dead link
|date=April 2005
}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
*&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Plunkett, John. [http://media.guardian.co.uk/site/story/0,14173,1601858,00.html &quot;Sorrell accuses Murdoch of panic buying&quot;],{{Dead link}} ''The Guardian'', London, 27 October 2005. Retrieved 5 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br/&gt;→ &lt;span style=&quot;background:white&quot;&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Plunkett, John.

Retrieved 5 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;references /&gt;

===Caveats===
* Avoid using free links (e.g. &lt;code&gt;http://example.org/{{Dead link&lt;nowiki /&gt;}}&lt;/code&gt;) as software unable to handle templates may read an incorrect link. Add brackets if necessary.
* Avoid complicated formatting. Nesting inside a template is generally not supported well.  
* Avoid using &lt;tt&gt;[ ] { | } &lt; &gt;&lt;/tt&gt; character between the end of the external link and &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Dead link}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;, as they are often used to format text

&lt;!--EDIT TEMPLATE DOCUMENTATION BELOW THIS LINE--&gt;

This meta-template can be used to create in-line clean up messages which can be used to tag issues on a line-by-line basis. Many templates are based upon it, like {{Tl|citation needed}}.

It should '''not''' be used directly on articles by itself - instead, use one of the pre-existing derivatives if at all possible. Should there be no suitable derivative already, new ones can be created using the syntax below, but please discuss the need for any new template first. Otherwise, the sub-template in question is likely to end up at [[Wikibooks:Requests for deletion]], as it is better for Wikibooks to have a finite and well-tested set of in-line tags than to allow for endless variation.

=== Usage ===
&lt;pre style=&quot;overflow: auto&quot;&gt;
{{ Fix
| substcheck= &lt;includeonly&gt;{{subst:&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;includeonly&gt;substcheck}}&lt;/includeonly&gt;
| link      = &lt;Page which text should link to, without brackets&gt; (default = Wikibooks:Maintenance)
| text      = &lt;Text to be displayed for the link&gt;
| pre-text  = &lt;Optional text to print before the linked text&gt;
| post-text = &lt;Optional text to print after the linked text&gt;
| class     = &lt;Class to set text to&gt; (default = &quot;noprint Inline-Template&quot;; neither should be removed, but additional classes can be added, e.g. &quot;noprint Inline-Template FooBarBazQuux&quot;)
| title     = &lt;Tool--tip text to display when mouse is hovered over link&gt;
| special   = &lt;Optional replacement for text, link, title, pre-text, and post-text - allowing user to define a non-standard format&gt;
| date      = &lt;Optional date parameter to be displayed at end of 'title' and/or in cat-date&gt;
| cat       = &lt;Category to include page in&gt;
}}&lt;/pre&gt;

Categories are ignored if the template is used on a talk page or on any other non-book page.

The value specified via &lt;code&gt;|cat=&lt;/code&gt; must be in wikicode, including square brackets.

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;

{{tl|{{PAGENAME}}}} is intended to simplify the linking process to files at the Internet Archive &quot;[[w:Wayback Machine|Wayback Machine]]&quot;. 

:''Additionally, {{tl|Cite web}} provides an [[Template:Cite web#Optional parameters|archiveurl]]''

== Parameters ==
&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Wayback|url=}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Wayback|url=|title=|date=}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

;url: The URL of the link that is being referenced in the Internet Archives.
;title &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:normal;&quot;&gt;(optional)&lt;/span&gt;: The text label for the external link. If this is omitted, a generic 'Archive copy' label will be used.
;date &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:normal;&quot;&gt;(optional, but recommended)&lt;/span&gt;: The Internet Archive timestamp (&lt;code&gt;YYYYMMDDhhmmss&lt;/code&gt;) for the date of the archived page that is to be displayed. If provided, the Template will format the date and display it : Month-name, day-number, year.  If omitted, the history of the referenced page will be listed instead.  You must use the full 4 digits for the year, and 2 digits for month, day, hour minute and second.  use leading zeros if necessary, and use a 24 hour clock for the time.

== Examples ==
;Link to page history, using a generic label:&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Wayback |url=http://example.org/ }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br /&gt;→ &lt;span style=&quot;background:white&quot;&gt;{{Wayback |url=http://example.org/ }}&lt;/span&gt;

;Link to page history, using a title rather than the generic label:&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Wayback |url=http://example.org/ |title=Example Title }} &lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br /&gt;→ &lt;span style=&quot;background:white&quot;&gt;{{Wayback |url=http://example.org/ |title=Example Title }}&lt;/span&gt;

;Link to page history using a title, and displaying a particular archived date (2005-01-07, at 12&amp;#58;30 pm and 45 seconds.):&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Wayback |url=http://example.org/ |title=Example Title |date=20050107123045 }} &lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br /&gt;→ &lt;span style=&quot;background:white&quot;&gt;{{Wayback |url=http://example.org/ |title=Example Title |date=20050107123045 }}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;

This is the {{tl|category handler}} meta-template.

It helps other templates to automate both categorization and category suppression. 

Already when used with its default settings this template prevents auto-categorization in some namespaces and on some pages where we usually don't want categorization. Thus even the most basic usage like &quot;&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{category handler|[[Category:Somecat]]}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&quot; sees to that templates don't auto-categorize in the wrong places.

This template makes it easy to choose in what namespaces a template should and should not categorize. And it makes it easy to use different categories in different namespaces. And this template uses a central blacklist where we can add pages and page types where templates should not auto-categorize.

=== When not to use this template ===

If a template only needs to categorize in one of the namespaces main (books), file (images) or category, then using this template is overkill. Then instead use one of {{tl|main other}}, {{tl|file other}}, or {{tl|category other}}. But if your template needs to categorize in any other namespace, then we recommend you use this template, since it provides proper category suppression and makes it easy to select how to categorize in the different namespaces.

=== Namespaces ===

This template detects and groups all the different [[WB:NS|namespaces]] used on Wikibooks into several types. These types are used as parameter names in this template.

:'''main''' = Main space, as in normal Wikibooks books.
:'''wikijunior''' = [[Wikijunior]] books.
:'''cookbook''' = Content in the [[Cookbook:Table of Contents|Cookbook]].
:'''talk''' = Any discussion page, such as page names that start with &quot;Talk:&quot;, &quot;User talk:&quot;, &quot;File talk:&quot; and so on.
:'''user''', '''wikibooks''', '''file''', '''mediawiki''', '''template''', '''help''', '''category''', '''subject''', and '''transwiki''' = The other namespaces except the discussion pages.
:'''other''' = Any namespaces that were not specified as a parameter to the template. See examples below.

=== Basic usage ===

This template takes two or more parameters. Here's an example with the full template code for an article message box:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{ambox
| text = This is a box used in books.
}}{{category handler
| [[Category:Somecat]]
| nocat = {{{nocat|}}}   &lt;!--So &quot;nocat=true/false&quot; works--&gt;
}}&lt;noinclude&gt;

{{documentation}}
&lt;!--Add categories and interwikis to the /doc subpage--&gt;
&lt;/noinclude&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

The above example uses the default settings for {{tl|category handler}}. That means the box will categorize on pages in the following namespaces: 
:'''main''', '''wikijunior''', '''cookbook''', '''file''', '''help''', '''category''', and '''subject'''
But it will ''not'' categorize in the following namespaces:
:'''talk''', '''user''', '''wikibooks''', '''mediawiki''', '''transwiki''', and '''template'''

And it will ''not'' categorize on blacklisted pages. (See section [[#Blacklist|blacklist]] below.)

The reason this template does not categorize in some of the namespaces is that in those namespaces most templates are just demonstrated or listed, not used. Thus most templates should not categorize in those namespaces. 

Any template that is meant for one or more of the namespaces where this template categorizes can use the basic syntax as shown above.

=== Advanced usage ===

This template takes one or more parameters named after the different page types as listed in section [[#Namespaces|namespaces]] above. By using those parameters you can specify exactly in which namespaces your template should categorize. Like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{mbox
| text = This is a box for articles and talk pages.
}}{{category handler
| main = [[Category:Somecat1]]   &lt;!--Categorize in main (book) space--&gt;
| talk = [[Category:Somecat2]]   &lt;!--Categorize in talk space--&gt;
| nocat = {{{nocat|}}}   &lt;!--So &quot;nocat=true&quot; works--&gt;
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

The above box will only categorize in main and talk space. But it will not categorize on /archive pages since they are blacklisted. (See section [[#Blacklist|blacklist]] below.) And if you need to demonstrate (discuss) that box on a talkpage, then you can feed &quot;&lt;code&gt;nocat=true&lt;/code&gt;&quot; to prevent that template from categorizing. (See section [[#Nocat|nocat]] below.) Like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
== My new template ==
Hey guys, have you seen my new template?
{{mytemp|nocat=true}}
Nice, isn't it?
--~~~~
&lt;/pre&gt;

Sometimes we want to use the same category in several namespaces, then do like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{mbox
| text = This is a box used in several namespaces.
}}{{category handler
| main = [[Category:Somecat1]]
| 1 = [[Category:Somecat2]]   &lt;!--For help and user space--&gt;
| help = 1
| user = 1
| talk =     &lt;!--No categories on talk pages--&gt;
| other = [[Category:Somecat3]]   &lt;!--For all other namespaces--&gt;
| nocat = {{{nocat|}}}   &lt;!--So &quot;nocat=true/false&quot; works--&gt;
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

In the above example we use a numbered parameter to feed one of the categories, and then we tell this template to use that numbered parameter for both the help and user space.

This template understands the numbered parameters 1 to 10.

The '''other''' parameter defines what should be used in the remaining namespaces that have not explicitly been fed data.

Note the empty but defined '''talk''' parameter. That stops this template from showing what has been fed to the '''other''' parameter, when in talk space.

This template also has a parameter called '''all'''. It works like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{mbox
| text = This is a box used in all namespaces.
}}{{category handler
| all = [[Category:Somecat1]]   &lt;!--Categorize in all namespaces--&gt;
| nocat = {{{nocat|}}}   &lt;!--So &quot;nocat=true/false&quot; works--&gt;
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

The above example will categorize in all namespaces, but not on blacklisted pages. If you want to demonstrate that box on a page, then use &quot;&lt;code&gt;nocat=true&lt;/code&gt;&quot; to prevent the template from categorizing. 

We suggest avoiding the '''all''' parameter, since templates should preferably only categorize in the namespaces they need to.

The all parameter can also be combined with the rest of the parameters. Like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{mbox
| text = This is a box used in all namespaces.
}}{{category handler
| all = [[Category:Somecat1]]   &lt;!--Categorize in all namespaces--&gt;
| main = [[Category:Somecat2]]   &lt;!--And add this in main space--&gt;
| other = [[Category:Somecat3]]   &lt;!--And add this in all other namespaces--&gt;
| nocat = {{{nocat|}}}   &lt;!--So &quot;nocat=true/false&quot; works--&gt;
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

If the above box is placed on an article, then it will add the categories &quot;Somecat1&quot; and &quot;Somecat2&quot;. But on all other types of pages it will instead add &quot;Somecat1&quot; and &quot;Somecat3&quot;. As the example shows, the all parameter works independently of the rest of the parameters.

=== Subpages ===

This template understands the '''subpage''' parameter. Like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{category handler
| subpage = no    &lt;!--Don't categorize on subpages--&gt;
| wikibooks = [[Category:Somecat]]
| nocat = {{{nocat|}}}   &lt;!--So &quot;nocat=true/false&quot; works--&gt;
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

If &quot;&lt;code&gt;subpage=no&lt;/code&gt;&quot; then this template will ''not'' categorize on subpages. For the rare occasion you ''only'' want to categorize on subpages, then use &quot;&lt;code&gt;subpage=only&lt;/code&gt;&quot;. If '''subpage''' is empty or undefined then this template categorizes both on basepages and on subpages.

=== Blacklist ===

This template has a blacklist of the pages and page types where templates should not auto-categorize. Thus templates that use this meta-template will for instance not categorize on /archive pages and on the subpages of [[Wikipedia:Template messages]].

If you want a template to categorize on a blacklisted page, then feed &quot;&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;nocat = false&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&quot; to the template when you place it on the page, thus skipping the blacklist check. Note that this template only categorizes if it has data for the namespace. For instance, if the basic syntax is used (see [[#Basic usage|basic usage]] above), then even if you set &quot;&lt;code&gt;nocat = false&lt;/code&gt;&quot; the template will not categorize on a discussion page, since it has no data for discussion pages. But it has data for help space, so on a blacklisted help page it will categorize.

The blacklist is in the sub-template {{tl|category handler/blacklist}}. To see or update the blacklist, go there.

=== The &quot;nocat&quot; parameter ===

This template understands the '''nocat''' parameter:

* If &quot;&lt;code&gt;nocat = true&lt;/code&gt;&quot; then this template does ''not'' categorize. 
* If '''nocat''' is empty or undefined then this template categorizes as usual. 
* If &quot;&lt;code&gt;nocat = false&lt;/code&gt;&quot; this template categorizes even when on blacklisted pages. (See section [[#Blacklist|blacklist]] above.)

Templates that use {{tl|category handler}} should forward '''nocat''', so they too understand '''nocat'''. The code &quot;&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;nocat = {{{nocat|}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&quot; shown in the examples on this page does that.

=== The &quot;categories&quot; parameter ===

For backwards compatibility this template also understands the '''categories''' parameter. It works the same as '''nocat'''. Like this:

* If &quot;&lt;code&gt;categories  = no&lt;/code&gt;&quot; then this template does ''not'' categorize. 
* If '''categories''' is empty or undefined then this template categorizes as usual. 
* If &quot;&lt;code&gt;categories = yes&lt;/code&gt;&quot; this template categorizes even when on blacklisted pages.

When adding this template to a template that already uses the &quot;&lt;code&gt;categories = no&lt;/code&gt;&quot; logic, then you can do like this to not break any existing usage:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{category handler
| [[Category:Somecat]]
| nocat = {{{nocat|}}}   &lt;!--So &quot;nocat=true/false&quot; works--&gt;
| categories = {{{categories|}}}   &lt;!--So &quot;categories=no&quot; works--&gt;
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== The &quot;category2&quot; parameter ===

For backwards compatibility this template kind of supports the old &quot;category =&quot; parameter. But the parameter name &quot;category&quot; is already used in this template to feed category data for when in category space. So instead this template uses '''category2''' for the usage similar to '''nocat'''. Like this:

* If &quot;&lt;code&gt;category2 =&lt;/code&gt;&quot; (empty but defined), or &quot;&lt;code&gt;category2 = no&lt;/code&gt;&quot;, or if '''category2''' is fed any other data (except as described in the next two points), then this template does ''not'' categorize.
* If '''category2''' is undefined or if &quot;&lt;code&gt;category2 = ¬&lt;/code&gt;&quot;, then this template categorizes as usual.
* If &quot;&lt;code&gt;category2 = yes&lt;/code&gt;&quot; this template categorizes even when on blacklisted pages.

When adding this template to a template that already uses the &quot;&lt;code&gt;category =&lt;/code&gt;&quot; logic, then you can do like this to not break any existing usage:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{category handler
| [[Category:Somecat]]
| nocat = {{{nocat|}}}   &lt;!--So &quot;nocat=true/false&quot; works--&gt;
| category2 = {{{category|¬}}}   &lt;!--So &quot;category =&quot; works--&gt;
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Note that the &quot;&lt;code&gt;¬&lt;/code&gt;&quot; is necessary, it helps this template to detect if the '''category''' parameter is defined but empty, or undefined.

=== Categories and text ===

Besides from categories, you can feed anything else to this template, for instance some text. Like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{tmbox
| text = This is a talk page message box.
}}{{category handler
| talk = [[Category:Somecat]]
| other = :::::This template should only be used on talk pages.
| nocat = {{{nocat|}}}   &lt;!--So &quot;nocat=true/false&quot; works--&gt;
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

When the template above is shown on anything else than a talk page, it will look like this (note the text below the box):

{{tmbox
| text = This is a talk page message box.
| nocat = true    &lt;!--So this box doesn't add &quot;Category:Talk message boxes&quot;--&gt;
}}{{category handler
| talk = [[Category:Somecat]]
| other = :::::This template should only be used on talk pages.
| nocat = {{{nocat|}}}   &lt;!--So &quot;nocat=true/false&quot; works--&gt;
}}

That text will not show on blacklisted pages, so don't use this method to show any important information. Feeding &quot;&lt;code&gt;nocat = true&lt;/code&gt;&quot; to the template hides the text, just as it suppresses any categories.

=== The &quot;page&quot; parameter ===

For testing and demonstration purposes this template can take a parameter named '''page'''. Like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{category handler
| main = Category:Some cat
| talk = Category:Talk cat
| nocat = {{{nocat|}}}   &lt;!--So &quot;nocat=true/false&quot; works--&gt;
| page = User talk:Example
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

In the above code we on purpose left out the brackets around the category names so we see the output on the page. No matter on what kind of page the code above is used it will return this:

:{{category handler
| main = Category:Some cat
| talk = Category:Talk cat
| nocat = {{{nocat|}}}   &lt;!--So &quot;nocat=true/false&quot; works--&gt;
| page = User talk:Example
}}

The '''page''' parameter makes this template behave exactly as if on that page. Even the blacklist works. The page name doesn't have to be an existing page.

If the '''page''' parameter is empty or undefined, the name of the current page determines the result.

You can make it so your template also understands the '''page''' parameter. That means you can test how your template will categorize on different pages, without having to actually edit those pages. Then do like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{category handler
| main = Category:Some cat
| talk = Category:Talk cat
| nocat = {{{nocat|}}}   &lt;!--So &quot;nocat=true/false&quot; works--&gt;
| page = {{{page|}}}   &lt;!--For testing--&gt;
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Parameters ===

List of all parameters:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{category handler
| [[Category:Somecat]]
| subpage = no / only
| 1 =
...
| 10 =
| all = [[Category:Somecat]] / Text
| main = 1 / ... / 10 / [[Category:Somecat]] / Text
...
| other = 1 / ... / 10 / [[Category:Somecat]] / Text

| nocat = {{{nocat|}}} / true / false
| categories = {{{categories|}}} / no / yes
| category2 = {{{category|¬}}} / 'empty' / no / 'not defined' / ¬ / yes

| page  = {{{page|}}} / User:Example
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Note that empty values to the &quot;main&quot; ... &quot;other&quot; parameters have special meaning (see examples above). The &quot;all&quot; parameter doesn't understand numbered parameters, since there should never be a need for that.

=== Technical details ===
The centralized category suppression blacklist is in the sub-template {{tl|category handler/blacklist}}. To see or update the blacklist, go there.

For its internal parameter processing, this template uses the sub-template {{tl|category handler/numbered}}.

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;

This is the {{tl|category handler/blacklist}} sub-template.

Do not use this template directly, use {{tl|category handler}} instead. This template is called from {{tl|category handler}}, see user documentation there.

But if you came here to see or update the '''category suppression blacklist''', then you are in the right place.

=== Updating the blacklist ===

This template contains a blacklist of the pages and page types where templates should not auto-categorize. This blacklist is used by {{tl|category handler}} to decide when not to categorize. To update the blacklist, edit this template.

This template uses {{tl|if pagename}} to do the pagename-detection, thus see {{tl|if pagename}} for the syntax to use for the blacklist rules.

When this template is placed on a page that should not categorize, then it should return &quot;hide&quot;. And when placed on any other page it should return an empty string.

=== Testing the blacklist ===

There are two ways you can test what this blacklist returns for a page:

You can put this template on the page you want to test, and see what output it produces. You can use edit preview, no need to save. Like this:

:&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;+{{category handler/blacklist}}+&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

Which here on this page returns this:

:+{{category handler/blacklist}}+

The ++ used here is a simple way to make it visible when a template returns an empty string.

Or you can feed the page name you want to test to this template. Like this:
:&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;+{{category handler/blacklist| page = User:Example }}+&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
:&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;+{{category handler/blacklist| page = User:Example/Archive 5}}+&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

Which returns this:

:+{{category handler/blacklist| page = User:Example }}+
:+{{category handler/blacklist| page = User:Example/Archive 5 }}+

=== Technical details ===

Currently this template is only called from {{tl|category handler}}, and indirectly from all templates that use {{tl|category handler}}. But in the future this template might also be directly called from other templates similar to {{tl|category handler}}. This means we can update the category suppression blacklist in one place.

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;

This is the {{tl|category handler/numbered}} sub-template.

Do not use this template directly, use {{tl|category handler}} instead. This template is called from {{tl|category handler}}, see user documentation there.

The rest of the sections here are only for those that want to understand the internal workings of this template.

=== Technical details ===

This sub-template makes it possible for its parent-template to take input in two forms:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{category handler
| 1 = Input
| main = 1
| talk = 1   &lt;!--Reusing &quot;Input&quot; for both the main and talk parameters--&gt;
}}

{{category handler
| main = Input1
| talk = Input2   &lt;!--Instead feeding text directly to the talk parameter--&gt;
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

This sub-template takes a bunch of numbered parameters. There's no limit to the number of parameters it can use, other than what the servers and MediaWiki system can handle.

It also takes a parameter named '''data'''. If '''data''' is a number, then it returns the data of the corresponding numbered parameter. If '''data''' is something else, for instance a category name, then it returns data unchanged.

Here's how you would normally call this sub-template:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{category handler/numbered
| 1 = {{{1|}}}
| 2 = {{{2|}}}
| 3 = {{{3|}}}
| 4 = {{{4|}}}
| data = Input can be a number between 1-4, or something else.
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

In the above example, since the parent-template feeds only 1-4, then only the numbers 1-4 will work properly. Feeding other numbers will return an empty string.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Documentation subpage}}
{{Tl|Citation needed}} (also known by the redirects {{Tl|Cn}} and {{Tl|Fact}}) is a [[Wikipedia:Template messages|template]] used to identify questionable claims that lack a [[Wikipedia:Citing sources|citation]] to a reliable source. The template produces a superscripted notation like the following:

:Humphrey Bogart has won several snooker world championships.{{Citation needed|date={{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTYEAR}}}}

===Usage===
You may append a date to the template in the following format:
:&lt;code&gt;{{Tlx|Citation needed|date{{=}}{{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTYEAR}}}}&lt;/code&gt;

'''Notes''':
* Substitution of this template will automatically fill the date parameter.
* The date parameter consists of the name of the current month and the year only, not full dates. The names of the months are capitalized in English. ''Any deviation from these two rules will result in an &quot;invalid date parameter&quot; error.''

It is also recommended to add the (non-displayed) {{para|reason}} parameter to leave a better record for future editors. For example, the following usage might be appropriate to the claim that &quot;Humphrey Bogart has won several snooker world championships.&quot;:
:&lt;code&gt;{{Tlx|Citation needed|reason{{=}}please give a reliable source for this assertion. I thought he was an actor.}}&lt;/code&gt;

Adding this template to an article places the article into [[:Category:Pages needing sources‎]].

Please remove the template when you add a citation for a statement.

===Examples===
:&lt;code&gt;This sentence shows the template used at the end.{{Tlx|Citation needed|reason{{=}}reliable source needed for the whole sentence}}&lt;/code&gt;

''The above wikitext will render as follows:''

:This sentence shows the template used at the end.{{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date={{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTYEAR}}}}

The template should be inserted ''after'' punctuation, such as a period or comma.
&lt;!--
:&lt;code&gt;While this example{{Tlx|Citation needed|2=1=shows the template}} used to request a citation for a specific part of a sentence.&lt;/code&gt;

''The above wikitext will render as follows:''

While this example {{Citation needed|1=shows the template}} used to request a citation for a specific part of a sentence.
 --&gt;

===When not to use this template===
Unsourced or poorly sourced contentious material about living persons should be '''removed immediately'''. Do not tag it: immediately remove it.

Material that is doubtful and harmful may be removed immediately, rather than tagged.

The &lt;nowiki&gt;{{cn}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; template is intended for use when there is a general question of the verifiability of a statement, or when an editor believes that a reference verifying the statement should be provided. Other templates are available for other or more specific issues, see the [[:Category:Inline cleanup templates|list of inline templates]]. Being specific about the nature of the problem will help other editors correct it.

If you have the time and ability to find an authoritative reference, please do so. Then add the citation yourself, or correct the page text. After all, the ultimate goal is not to merely identify problems, but to fix them.

While an editor may add this template to any uncited passage for any reason, many editors object to what they perceive as overuse of this tag, particularly in what is known as &quot;drive-by&quot; tagging, which is applying the tag without attempting to address the issues at all. Consider whether adding this tag in a page is the best approach before using it, and use it judiciously. Wikibooks' [[WB:OR|original research policy]] does '''not require''' reliable sources for common facts (e.g., &quot;The Moon orbits the Earth&quot;), or that citations be repeated through every sentence in a paragraph. All direct quotations and facts whose accuracy might be challenged (e.g., statistics) require citations.

This template is intended for specific passages that need citation. For entire pages or sections that contain significant material lacking sources (rather than just specific short passages), there are other, more appropriate templates, such as {{Tl|Unreferenced}} or {{Tl|Refimprove}}.

=== How to respond to this tag ===
The addition of this tag is a request for an inline citation to support the tagged statement.  If you are able to provide a citation to support the claim, then please do so.  

Except for certain kinds of claims about living people, which require immediate production of inline citations, there is no specific deadline for providing citations. Please do not delete information that you believe is correct simply because no-one has provided a citation within an arbitrary time limit. Where there is some uncertainty about its accuracy, most editors are willing to wait about a month to see whether a citation can be provided.

== User-Generated Music ==


Music is an art form whose medium is sound and silence.&lt;ref&gt;en.wikipedia.org. Music. Retrieved October 16, 2011 from: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music&lt;/ref&gt;  
User-generated music is a term that is used for music that is created by an individual user or group of users and then distributed over the Internet. This music is often created for the purpose of entertainment. There has recently been a major shift the distribution of music with the advent of Web 2.0 technologies. With the current technology creators of music are able to get their music heard by millions of people simply by placing it on Youtube.

== Types of licenses ==
Music can be protected by several different licenses. The traditional licensing of music falls under the copyrighted music. This traditional form of licensing is in place to ensure that the creator of the music gets paid for their work. When you purchase music, you are buying the right to listen to that music, not to distribute it in any other fashion.&lt;ref&gt;en.wikipedia.org. Music Licensing. Retrieved October 17, 2011 from: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_licensing&lt;/ref&gt;


Music without any type of license is said to be in the public domain. Music is also said to be in the public domain if the intellectual property rights have expired.&lt;ref&gt;en.wikipedia.org. Public Domain. Retrieved October 17, 2011 from: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain&lt;/ref&gt; 
When music is in the public domain then it may be used freely. 

[[File:Creative_commons.jpg|thumb|Creative Commons courtesy of everystockphoto.com]]
[http://creativecommons.org/ Creative Commons] is another type of license that can be sought by a creator of music. By giving a user-created piece of music a Creative Commons license, the creator of the musical piece is defining how a piece of music may be used. This type of protection may allow for commercial use of the work or modifications of the work.
 
No matter what type of license a piece of music has, you should always be sure to give credit to the creator of the piece.

== Where to find user-generated music ==
User-generated music can be found all over the web. 

The most popular website for user-created music is [http://www.youtube.com YouTube]. On YouTube the author of music can post their piece for free. By doing so the author can get their work out to millions of viewers.

== Introduction ==
Images play a major part in helping readers and listeners to comprehend and learn about ideas, concepts, and systems. They help people focus on a particular topic and can be used to generate conversation, deeper thought, and emotional reactions that lead to a greater likelihood that what they have learned will be absorbed and applied. User-generated content can benefit greatly by the inclusion of images that clarify, extend thinking, and offer perspective, as well as images that add to the readability and enjoyment of text.

When using images in user-created content, care should be taken that images are used with appropriate permission, a requirement that is most difficult to meet when publishing content that is to be freely shared on the Internet. There are a number of options for obtaining images to enhance user-generated content. In addition, users may create their own images as part of the process for creating user-generated content; that is, user-generated images created for  user-generated content.

This page will describe the types of image licenses that are available, how they might be used in user-generated content, and information about some particularly useful sites for obtaining images.

== Types of Licenses ==

The world of images can be a confusing one. How can users find what they need and make sure that it is legal to use what they find?

The first step would be to identify sources of images and what kind of licensing is being used. Images in the '''public domain'''&lt;ref&gt;en.wikipedia.org. ''Public Domain.'' Retrieved October 18, 2011 from:   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain&lt;/ref&gt; may be used freely. There is no longer copyright on the image, or the creator of the image has released the image to the public domain. You can change the image and use it for any purpose. However, you should remember that giving credit to the creator of the image for his work may be needed for academic integrity, especially if the image includes content.

Some images are published with a '''Creative Commons'''&lt;ref&gt;en.wikipedia.org. ''Creative Commons.'' Retrieved October 18, 2011 from:   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_commons&lt;/ref&gt; license, which will provide a certain set of privileges to users of those images.

'''Provider-Supplied License.''' Other image collections may reside on their own website and be controlled by a license that is published at that site. These licenses can be wildly different from each other, ranging from those that are similar to &quot;public domain&quot; to those that allow free use of images only in certain, unusual situations.

'''Commercial License.''' There are numerous companies that sell images and establish specific rules for use of what has been sold. It is possible to purchase images that may be used in user-generated content.

'''Copyrighted images.''' If an image has not been released to the public domain or given a Creative Commons or provider-supplied license, the creator or the company that purchased the rights to that image still will maintain the usual copyright privileges. Use of the images requires permission from the owner of the copyright. That permission can be obtained by writing to the owner of the image or purchasing the rights through the company's website.

'''Be careful.''' There is no guarantee that images that were uploaded by users are actually in the public domain, or have a Creative Commons license. If you suspect that an image does not belong to the person or organization that has stored that image, you might want to avoid using it.

'''Fair Use.''' If an image is to be used within a classroom setting for educational reasons, there may be some legal ability to use even commercial images. Standards of fair use must be applied.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Government Copyright Office. ''Fair Use.'' Retrieved October 18, 2011 from:   http://www.copyright.gov/fls/fl102.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Generally, though, using images for which free use has been provided will be a better strategy when creating user-generated content, especially that which is published on the Internet.

== Public Domain Images ==
[[File:CassiopeiaNASAPIA03519.jpg|thumb|NASA photograph in public domain. The supernova remnant Cassiopeia.]]

Images that are public domain can be freely used, without attribution, for your own personal use, for publication, on web pages, or for commercial projects. 

When you look for pubic domain images, remember that &quot;free&quot; does not necessarily equal &quot;public domain.&quot; Some images that can be used for free have an accompanying use requirement that might ''not'' include posting on the web, commercial use, or on Wiki Foundation sites.

A large number of images are available on U.S. government sites because images originally produced by the U.S. government are considered to be in the public domain.

Listings of U.S. government photos and images: http://www.usa.gov/Topics/Graphics.shtml
Sample collection from the National Zoo: http://nationalzoo.si.edu/Animals/PhotoGallery/

Open Clip Library has a collection of images that were placed in the Public Domain: http://www.openclipart.org/about[[File:cheeseburger1310544885.png|thumb|left|Open Clip Art Library public domain image license through Creative Commons]]

You can read the Wikipedia article about Open Clip Library here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Clip_Art_Library and see a list of potential public domain collections here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Public_domain_image_resources

People can also take photos of art that is out of copyright and place the photo in the public domain.&lt;ref&gt;Schultz, J. (2010, September 21). ''When it's Illegal to Photograph Artwork.'' [Blog post]. Retrieved October 18, 2011 from:   http://bucks.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/21/when-its-illegal-to-photograph-artwork/s&lt;/ref&gt;

== Creative Commons Images ==
Creative Commons provides a way for users to designate the kind of licensing they wish to assign to their own work. Take a look at the descriptions of the Creative Commons licenses: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/

The organization also assists those who wish to assign public domain to their work.&lt;ref&gt;Creative Commons. ''Our Public Domain Tools.'' Retrieved October 18, 2011 from:   //http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/&lt;/ref&gt;
 
If you want to search for images with Creative Commons licensing, try http://www.flickr.com/creativecommons/ or http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Image

Another site that lets you locate Creative Commons licensed images, but also displays images that have commercial or some other kind of licensing: http://everystockphoto.com

== Provider-Supplied License Images ==

A number of sites on the Internet provide collections of images that can be used in user-generated content. If selecting from one of these sites, make sure that you read the licensing agreement. Sometimes there are generous conditions, where you can use the image on a web site that you create, in a book you publish, in presentations, even for a client. Other times, the license is more limited, confined to personal use.

Some of the images from this category of image collections should not be uploaded for use in a WikiBook page.
For example, if you locate this  photo on stock.xchng at http://www.sxc.hu/photo/1354752 and read about the license, you'll see that you can use it for yourself, on a web site, or for a client. However, it can't be posted in Wikibooks. Wiki Foundation only allows users to upload and use an image on a wiki page if the image is owned by person who uploaded the image, if it has a specific kind of Creative Commons, Share Alike 3.0 license, if the image was created by the U.S. government, and some other specialized situations. See the section on Images and Wikipedia below for more information. &lt;ref&gt;en.wikipedia.org. ''Images.'' Retrieved October 16, 2011 from:   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Images&lt;/ref&gt;

Some sites provide images that are free for certain types of uses:
* [http://www.stockvault.net stockvault]. 
* [http://www.morguefile.com/archive/ morguefile]

Both sites above provide some high quality images and generous granting of rights for users to publish the images. Generally, you do not have the rights to distribute the image and you do not own the copyright.

There are also sites that allow users with accounts to upload images and to indicate what kind of licensing they will assign. Some could be added to content without cost.

An example:

* [http://www.flickr.com/ Flickr.com] 

If you want to search for images with Creative Commons licensing, try http://www.flickr.com/creativecommons/ or http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Image

== Commercial Images ==
Commercial images are obtained at a cost and include specific rights for usage. Those rights can range from personal use only to posting on web sites. Copyright usually stays with the owner of image, though it might be possible to purchase not only the use of the image but the copyright itself.

Many of these images are of great quality and you can find what you want efficiently. If you don't need an image in high resolution, the cost tends to be less.

As with provider-provided licensing, you need to read the terms of agreement to make sure you can use the image as you plan. 

In some situations, especially for adults, purchasing these images makes sense. If it saves a lot of time and effort, you are very satisfied with the appearance or functionality of the image within what you are publishing, and the licensing allows you to easily share user-generated content, spending some money on the images could be an option.

Examples of commercial image sites:

* http://us.fotolia.com
* http://www.dreamstime.com/
* http://www.istockphoto.com/

== Images and Wikipedia ==
[[File:TroutHall.jpg|thumb|Photo uploaded and donated to Wikimedia and given a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 license]]
Wikipedia and associated Wiki Foundation sites like WikiBooks require that user-created images are uploaded by registered users. If you are using a Wiki Foundation site to contribute images, you'll need to establish an account then upload the images you wish to use. In general, all images must be created by you, in the public domain, or available through a Creative Commons type of license. 

After signing into Wikimedia Commons, for example, you may choose the Upload file option the is available on the left hand side of the screen. Wikimedia Commons requires that you provide copyright information for the image, since you are are actually agreeing to share it with everyone. 

''This is the language that is used on that agreement page:''

:This file is my own work.
:
:I,___________ , the copyright holder of this work, hereby irrevocably grant anyone the right to use this work for any purpose, as long as they credit me and share derivative work under the same terms.

:I,______________ , the copyright holder of this work, hereby publish this work under the following license:

''You then can choose between these three Creative Commons licenses:''

* Creative Commons Attribution ShareAlike 3.0
* Creative Commons Attribution 3.0
* Public domain (all rights waived with Creative Commons Zero license)&lt;ref&gt;commons.wikimedia.org. ''Upload Wizard.'' Retrieved October 18, 2011 from:   http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:UploadWizard&lt;/ref&gt;


If you choose &quot;This file is not my own work,&quot; you may still be able to upload the image. For instance, you can upload an image that has been published under a Creative Commons Attribution ShareAlike 2.0, original work of the US Federal Government, or a photograph of original artwork that is now in the public domain.

Once the upload is complete, you will be given a line of code for your wiki page that will allow you to use the image within a page you are creating. You will also be given a URL, which will be helpful in sharing your image with others.

For more information about uploading and using images from Wikipedia Commons, take a look at [[w:Wikipedia:Uploading_images|this article.]]

If you do start an account and log in, you can also see information about this on [[Commons:Special:UploadWizard|Commons Upload Wizard]].

== Usage ==

Add {{tl|dubious}} after ''a specific statement or alleged fact'' that is subject to dispute (your own or someone else's).

For an entire disputed page, use {{tl|disputed}}.

It is best to simultaneously try to resolve the dispute on the discussion page. To refer to a specific discussion page section, use {{tlx|dubious|discussion page section name}}. If the dispute does not have a discussion page section yet (e.g. because it has been argued in edit summaries), please create one. 

This template is ''not'' for flagging items that an editor simply thinks might be incorrect or unsourced. This is what {{tl|citation needed}} is for. It is for statements ''that are subject to ongoing dispute'' among editors, e.g. due to conflicting sources or doubts about sources' reliability.  The purposes of this template are:
* To warn readers that a statement in the text may not be accurate 
* To alert editors that additional sources need to be found, to ascertain which of the conflicting views in the dispute is more authoritative

Do not add this template to a page more than a reasonable number of times.  Please consider voicing concerns on the discussion page instead.

=== Parameters ===

*'''date''': the month and year when the template was added. Like this: {{tlx|dubious|date{{=}}{{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTYEAR}}}}
* It is also common to use a dummy {{para|reason}} parameter to add a little extra explanation.

== Why have this template? ==
{{edit protected|answered=yes}}
Why is this template necessary? And why is it protected? This template is important on Wikipedia, but I can see no good use for it here. Plus it has only [http://toolserver.org/~dispenser/cgi-bin/embeddedincount.py?db=enwikibooks&amp;title=Template%3ADubious 11 transclusions]. This template should definitely be unprotected, and possibly even deleted.

:If you feel a template should be deleted, an RFD is the answer.  But this differs from &quot;citation needed/fact&quot; if you look at the description on the content page where it notes the intricacies regarding the templates' differences. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|discuss]]&lt;/small&gt; 18:38, 17 June 2012 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">= When to optimize =

{{wikipedia|Program_optimization#When_to_optimize}}
A common pitfall is to be obsessed with optimization, to the point of spending a lot of coding time on tiny optimization, while complexifying the code and making it harder to debug.

Make sure you optimize when you have evidence that the impacted code truly slows down the application.  Make measurements.  Compare in different use cases and possibly different hardware.

Also, we recommend that when implementing a new feature, you write your first version as clear as possible, and optimize it in a second step when the feature works correctly.

= Measuring frame time =

A common way to measure performance in applications is by the use of FPS, or Frames Per Second.  However, because of the definition of FPS itself (frames / 1 second), it does not fully convey performance because of its non-linearity.  There are many pages around the web that fully describe this, but the basic idea is this:  A linear change in FPS does not result in a linear change in actual performance.  A 450 FPS drop from 900 FPS is about 1 millisecond extra time, but a 5 FPS drop from 60 FPS is about.. 1 millisecond extra time. The amount of performance decrease is inversely related to the amount of FPS lost, so as FPS tends towards 0, execution time starts growing out of control fast.  Yet, you only see a linear change in FPS, so you just shrug this off.

Instead, you should use frame time, or the amount of time needed to render 1 frame.  Although it may seem counter-intuitive, it provides a reliable way to measure if code is causing a bottleneck.

Here's a simple code to display the amount of time taken per frame (measured in milliseconds) on the console:
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
/* Global */
static unsigned int fps_start = 0;
static unsigned int fps_frames = 0;
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
/* init_resources() */
  fps_start = glutGet(GLUT_ELAPSED_TIME);
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
/* idle() */
  /* FPS count */
  {
    fps_frames++;
    int delta_t = glutGet(GLUT_ELAPSED_TIME) - fps_start;
    if (delta_t &gt; 1000) {
      cout &lt;&lt; delta_t / fps_frames &lt;&lt; endl;
      fps_frames = 0;
      fps_start = glutGet(GLUT_ELAPSED_TIME);
    }
  }
&lt;/source&gt;

= Vertical sync =

Often, OpenGL is configured to wait for the physical screen's vertical refresh before pushing the new color buffer:
* this prevents tearing, a visual artifact that mixes part of the previous buffer with part of the new one
* there is no visual need to display more frames than what the screen can handle, typically 60-75Hz (depending on the screen)
* this saves resources such as the battery

However, this means that even if we can display 200 FPS, our application will be capped to 60-75 FPS, which makes it difficult to measure the performances.

In such case, it can be useful to disable the vertical sync:
* your graphic card driver may come with utilities to enable and disable it
* with Mesa, you can start your application with &lt;code&gt;vblank_mode=0&lt;/code&gt;, or configure this behavior more permanently in &lt;code&gt;~/.drirc&lt;/code&gt;; some earlier versions have bugs, so you may have to try both.

= Stencil buffer tests =

See performances tips in the [[../Stencil_buffer#Performances|Stencil buffer]] section.

Unfortunately having information about the appearance of the caterpillars seems crucial for identification, and all I have are the moths.  Would there be any way to make the key more useful to those without knowledge of the larvae?

== Linking to Wikipedia articles ==

Hi, I notice that you recently added some links to article in Wikipedia.  There is an easier way to make such links - &lt;nowiki&gt;[[w:article name|your title]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; - this way you don't need to write out the full web address and only the title of the article.--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Italy.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 10:45, 24 October 2011 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">&quot;Most programs for computing Julia sets work well when the underlying dynamics is
hyperbolic but [[Fractals/Mathematics/Numerical|experience an exponential slowdown in the parabolic case]].&quot; ( Mark Braverman )&lt;ref&gt;[http://arxiv.org/abs/math.DS/0505036 Mark Braverman : On efficient computation of parabolic Julia sets]&lt;/ref&gt;

In other words it means that one can need days for making a good picture of parabolic Julia set with standard / naive algorithms.

There are 2 problems here :
* slow or lazy dynamics ( in the neighbourhood of a parabolic fixed point )
* some parts are very thin ( hard to find using [[Fractals/Computer_graphic_techniques/2D#Scanning|standard plane scanning]]) 

=Planes=

*Julia set &lt;math&gt; J_f  \subset \mathbb{C}  &lt;/math&gt; is a common boundary : &lt;math&gt;J_f\, = \partial A_f(p) =\partial  A_{f}(\infty)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
*Fatou set &lt;math&gt; F_f  \subset \mathbb{C}  &lt;/math&gt;
** exterior of Julia set = basin of attraction to infinity : &lt;math&gt;A_{f}(\infty) \  \overset{\underset{\mathrm{def}}{}}{=} \  \{ z \in  \mathbb{C}  : f^{(k)} (z)  \to  \infty\  as\  k \to \infty \}. &lt;/math&gt;
** interior of Julia set = basin of attraction of finite, parabolic fixed point p : &lt;math&gt;A_f(p) \  \overset{\underset{\mathrm{def}}{}}{=} \  \{ z \in  \mathbb{C}  : f^{(k)} (z)  \to  p\  as\  k \to \infty \}. &lt;/math&gt;
*** immediate basin  = sum of componets which have parabolic fixed point p on it's boundary  ; the immediate parabolic basin of p is the union of periodic connected components of the parabolic basin.
**** attracting Lea-Fatou flower = sum of n attracting petals = sum of 2*n attracting sepals
***** petal = part of the flower. Each petal contains 2 sepals, 
****** sepals ( Let 1 be an invariant curve in the first quadrant and L 1 the region enclosed by 1 ∪ {0}, called a sepal. ) &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.math.nagoya-u.ac.jp/~kawahira/works/rims0402.pdf Note on dynamically stable perturbations of parabolics by Tomoki Kawahira]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Petal==
[[File:Julia set for f(z) = z^4 - z with various number of star branches.gif|right|thumb|repelling petals around fixed point and its preimages]]
There is no unified definition of petals.

Petal of a flower can be :
* attracting / repelling
* small/alfa/big/ ( small attracting petals do not ovelap with repelling petals, but big do)  

Each petal is invariant under f^period. In other words it is mapped to itself by f^period.


Attracting petal P is a :
* Each petal is invariant under &lt;math&gt;f^n &lt;/math&gt;. In other words it is mapped to itself by &lt;math&gt;f^n &lt;/math&gt;:  &lt;math&gt;f^n(\overline{P} ) \subset P \cup \left\{ p \right\} &lt;/math&gt;
* [[Fractals/Iterations_in_the_complex_plane/def_cqp#Domain|domain]] (topological disc ) containing :
** parabolic periodic point p in its boundary &lt;math&gt;\overline{P} \ni \left\{ p \right\} &lt;/math&gt; ( precisely in its root  , which is a coomon points of all attracting and repelling petals = center of the Lea-Fatou flower)
** critical point or it's n=period images on the other side ( only small ?? )
* '''[[Fractals/Iterations_in_the_complex_plane/def_cqp#Trap|trap]] which captures any orbit tending to parabolic point''' &lt;ref&gt;[http://num.math.uni-goettingen.de/~summer/cheritat.pdf PARABOLIC IMPLOSION A MINI-COURSE by ARNAUD CHERITAT]&lt;/ref&gt;
* set contained inside component of filled-in Julia set. The attracting petals of parabolic fixed point are contained in it's basin of attraction 



Petals &lt;math&gt;P_j&lt;/math&gt;  are symmetric with respect to the d-1 [[Fractals/Iterations_in_the_complex_plane/r_a_directions|directions]] :

&lt;math&gt; arg(z) = \frac{2 \Pi l}{d - 1}   &lt;/math&gt;

where :
* d is (to do) &lt;!----  a degree of complex quadratic map so d=2  ----&gt;
* l is from  0 to d-2

Petals can have different size. 

If &lt;math&gt;\lambda^n = 1 &lt;/math&gt; then Julia set should approach parabolic periodic point in n directions, between n petals. &lt;ref&gt;BOF, page 39&lt;/ref&gt;

===Number of petals===
 {{under construction}}
[[File:Bifurcation1-2.png|thumbnail|right|In parabolic point child period coincides with parent period]]

For quadratic polynomials :


Multiplicity = ParentPeriod + ChildPeriod

NumberOfPetals = multiplicity - ParentPeriod

It is because in parabolic case fixed point coincidence with periodic cycle. Length of cycle ( child period) is equal to number of petals

&lt;/gallery&gt;




Pleae note that :
* size of image differs because of different z-planes.
* different algorithms are used so colours are hard to compare

===Bifurcation of the Cauliflower===
How Julia set changes along real axis ( going from c=0 thru c=1/4 and futher ) :


'''Perturbation''' of a function &lt;math&gt;f(z)&lt;/math&gt; by complex &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; :

&lt;math&gt;g(z) = f(z) + \epsilon  &lt;/math&gt;

When one add epsilon &gt; 0  ( move along real axis toward + infinity ) there is a '''bifurcation of parabolic fixed point''' : 
* attracting fixed point ( epsilon&lt;0 )
* one parabolic fixed point ( epsilon = 0 ) 
* one parabolic fixed point splits up into two conjugate repelling fixed points ( epsilon &gt; 0 )

&quot;If we slightly perturb with epsilon&lt;0 then the parabolic fixed point splits up into two real fixed points on the real axis (one attracting, one repelling). &quot;

=How to draw parabolic Julia set=

File:Parabolic Julia set for internal angle 1 over 4.png| Checking iteration 
File:Parabolic Julia set for internal angle 1 over 5.png | modified DEM 
File:Parabolic Julia set for internal angle 1 over 5 - new method.png| checking angle 
File:Parabolic Julia set for internal angle 1 over 20.png|checking if zn is in target set  
&lt;/gallery&gt;

All points of interior of filled Julia set tend to one periodic orbit ( or fixed point ). This point is in Julia set and is weakly attracting. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibiblio.org/e-notes/MSet/Local.htm Local dynamics at a fixed point by Evgeny Demidov]&lt;/ref&gt; One can analyse only behevior near parabolic fixed point. It can be done using [[:commons:category:critical orbits|critical orbits]].

There are two cases here : easy and hard.

If the Julia set near parabolic fixed point is like n-th arm star ( not twisted) then one can simply check argument of of zn, relative to the fixed point. See for example z+z^5. This is an easy case.

In the hard case Julia set is twisted around fixed.

===Dynamic rays===
[[File:Parabolic Julia set for internal angle 1 over 15.png|thumbnail|right|Parabolic Julia set for internal angle 1 over 15 - made with use of external rays as a aproximation of Julia set near alfa fixed point]]
One can use periodic dynamic rays landing on parabolic fixed point to find narrow parts of exterior.

Let's check how many backward iterations needs point on periodic ray with external radius = 4 to reach distance 0.003 from parabolic fixed point :

One can use only argument of point z of external rays and its distance to alfa fixed point. ( see code from image) It works for periods up to 15 ( maybe more ... )

 color = iLastIteration % periodOfChild 

where denominator is a denominator of internal angle of parent comonent of Mandelbrot set.
===Angle===

&quot;if the iterate zn of tends to a fixed parabolic point, then the initial seed z0 is classified according to the argument of zn−z0, the classification being provided by the flower theorem &quot; ( Mark McClure &lt;ref&gt;[http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/361205/what-is-the-shape-of-parabolic-critical-orbit stackexchange questions : what-is-the-shape-of-parabolic-critical-orbit]&lt;/ref&gt;)
=== Attraction time ===
[[File:DistanceToFixed.png|right|thumb|Various types of dynamics ]]
Interior of filled Julia set consist of '''components'''. All comonents are preperiodic, some of them are periodic ( immediate basin of attraction).

In other words : 
* one iteration moves z to another component ( and whole component to another component)
* all point of components have the same '''attraction time''' ( number of iteration needed to reach target set around attractor)

It is possible to use it to color components. 
Because in parabolic case attractor is weak ( weakly attracting) it needs a lot of iterations for some points to reach it. 

Here are some example values :
&lt;pre&gt;
 iWidth  = 1001 // width of image in pixels
 PixelWidth  = 0.003996  
 AR  = 0.003996 // Radius around attractor
 denominator  = 1 ; Cx  = 0.250000000000000; Cy  = 0.000000000000000 ax  = 0.500000000000000; ay  = 0.000000000000000   
 denominator  = 2 ; Cx  = -0.750000000000000; Cy  = 0.000000000000000 ax  = -0.500000000000000; ay  = 0.000000000000000   
 denominator  = 3 ; Cx  = -0.125000000000000; Cy  = 0.649519052838329 ax  = -0.250000000000000; ay  = 0.433012701892219  
 denominator  = 4 ; Cx  = 0.250000000000000; Cy  = 0.500000000000000 ax  = 0.000000000000000; ay  = 0.500000000000000   
 denominator  = 5 ; Cx  = 0.356762745781211; Cy  = 0.328581945074458 ax  = 0.154508497187474; ay  = 0.475528258147577   
 denominator  = 6 ; Cx  = 0.375000000000000; Cy  = 0.216506350946110 ax  = 0.250000000000000; ay  = 0.433012701892219    
 
 denominator  = 1 ;   i =               243.000000 
 denominator  = 2 ;   i =            31 171.000000 
 denominator  = 3 ;   i =         3 400 099.000000 
 denominator  = 4 ;   i =       333 293 206.000000 
 denominator  = 5 ;   i =    29 519 565 177.000000 
 denominator  = 6 ;   i = 2 384 557 783 634.000000 
&lt;/pre&gt;

where : 

 C = Cx + Cy*i 
 a = ax + ay*i // fixed point alpha
 i // number of iterations after which critical point z=0.0 reaches disc around fixed point alpha with radius AR
 denominator of internal angle ( in turns )
 internal angle =  1/denominator

Note that attraction time i is proportional to denominator. 
[[File:Distance between point of critical orbit and alfa fixed point in parabolic cases.png|right|thumb|Attraction time for various denominators ]]
Now you see what means '''weakly attracting'''.

One can :
* use brutal force method ( Attracting radius &lt; pixelSize; iteration Max big enough to let all points from interior reach target set; long time or [[Fractals/Computer_graphic_techniques/2D/optimisation#Parallel_computing|fast computer]] )
* find better method (:-)) if time is to long for you

===Interior distance estimation ===


===Trap ===

==Estimation from interior and exterior ==
Julia set is a common boundary of filled-in Julia set and basin of attraction of infinity. 

* find points of interior/components of Kc 
* find escaping points 
* find boundary points using Sobel filter

It works for denominator up to 4.

==Inverse iteration of repelling points ==
[[Fractals/Iterations_in_the_complex_plane/q-iterations#Backward_iteration|Inverse iteration]] of alfa fixed point. It works good only for cuting point ( where external rays land). Other points still are not hitten.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
The federal interstate system in the United States has created a lasting social and economic impact on the American landscape.  From birth, cities have grown to love and loath the interstate system that became the transportation norm in post-WW II America.  However, by the 1990s, the love affair for building new interstate networks had faded and the focus shifted towards maintaining the status quo.  Despite this shift in policy, the debate to build one last interstate, Interstate 69, continues today.  If fully implemented, Interstate 69 will extend nearly 1,700 miles through a seven state region.   There are a number of issues that have arisen with this proposol and we present these issues as a launching point for discussion on future infrastructure investments and their possible consequences.

* November 1967: The first segments of the new I-69/US-27 freeway open for public use in Michigan.  The segment of the I-69/US-27 freeway from the Indiana state line northerly to the Branch/Calhoun Co line is certified, and much of the former route of US-27 is turned back to local control on November 1st. The exception is the 3 miles from Fenn Rd northerly to US-12/Chicago St downtown Coldwater, which becomes part of a new BL I-69. Six weeks later, the segment of the I-69/US-27 freeway from the Branch/Calhoun Co line northerly to I-94 at Marshall is certified. Old US-27 remains an unnumbered state highway for several more months. At Marshall, the I-69 designation terminates at I-94, while the US-27 routing turns easterly via I-94 for about 1-1/2 miles back to the original US-27 alignment, then northerly toward Olivet and Charlotte. A brand new BUS US-27 designation is commissioned, beginning at I-69/US-27 on the west side of Marshall (present day Exit 36), and running easterly via Michigan Ave into downtown, then northerly via the former route of US-27 (Kalamazoo Ave &amp; Brewer St) to the junction of I-94 &amp; US-27 north of town at Exit 110. The BL I-94 routing at Marshall is realigned to run westerly from downtown via Michigan Ave (newly co-designated as BUS US-27) to the new I-69/US-27 freeway, then northerly via the freeway to end at I-94. The former routing of BL I-94 northerly from downtown Marshall is redesignated as a part of the new BUS US-27.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bessert&quot; /&gt;

==Narrative==
===National Interstate and Defense Highways Act of 1956===
There were several Federal-Aid Acts passed by legislation to help the interstate system become a priority and begin its birthing phase. The first of these Acts was in 1952, when $25 million was authorized for the construction of the interstate highway system. Then in 1954, another Act was authorized by legislation for $175 million annually for the fiscal years 1956 and 1957. The largest and most aggressive Act to help the interstate system get off the ground came within a year of Dwight Eisenhower becoming President of the United States. The famous Act of 1956 authorized $13.5 billion for the development of the interstate highway system. This Act increased the proposed length to 41,000 miles of interstate highway to be planned for and built.

====Planning====
The need for an interstate highway system in the United States came about early in the 1900s around the time of World War I. It was 1919, when army captain at the time Dwight Eisenhower, along with 294 other members of the army, drove the first motorized caravan across the country. The caravan departed from Washington D.C. arriving 62 days later at their destination of Union Square in San Fransico, Califonia. The caravan averaged roughly 5 miles per hour on this journey due to the terrain they faced along the way &lt;ref name=&quot;M6&quot;&gt;Rosenberg, Matt. &quot;Interstate Highways - An Overview of Interstate Highways.&quot;Geography Home Page - Geography at About.com. Web. 08 Oct. 2011. &lt;http://geography.about.com/od/urbaneconomicgeography/a/interstates.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; . Eisenhower was also inspired for an interstate highway system by his experience during World War II when he noticed the German’s ability to efficiently move forces in a two-front war by the use of the Autobahn &lt;ref name=&quot;M2&quot;&gt;Garrison, William L., and David M. Levinson. The Transportation Experience: Policy, Planning, and Deployment. New York: Oxford UP, 2006. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Policy played a huge role in the development of the interstate highway system in the United States. Planning the interstate highway system began in the late 1930s. The Federal-Aid Act of 1938 called the Bureau of Public Roads (BPR) to study the feasibility of a toll financed system of three east-west and three north-south superhighways. This study consisted of a total of about 14,000 miles of national toll road system &lt;ref name=&quot;M2&quot;&gt;Garrison, William L., and David M. Levinson. The Transportation Experience: Policy, Planning, and Deployment. New York: Oxford UP, 2006. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;. The study found that the toll network would not be self-supporting and the proposal died. Instead the BPR’s report advocated a 26,700-mile interregional highway network.

It was then in the 1950s when America was threatened with possible nuclear attacks from the Soviet Union, which spurred the need for a national interstate highway system. It was believed that an interstate highway system would allow citizens with evacuation routes if the need ever came &lt;ref name=&quot;M6&quot;&gt;Rosenberg, Matt. &quot;Interstate Highways - An Overview of Interstate Highways.&quot;Geography Home Page - Geography at About.com. Web. 08 Oct. 2011. &lt;http://geography.about.com/od/urbaneconomicgeography/a/interstates.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; . It wasn’t long after that Dwight Eisenhower became president of the United States in 1952 that a push for the interstate system began to grow. It was then in 1956 that the Federal Aid to Highway/Interstate Highway Act (FAHA) was signed and the interstate highways would begin to spread across the country in the years to follow. The first stretch of the interstate highway system opened in Topeka, Kansas and was a total length of about eight-miles. The plan for the interstate highway system was to have all 42,000 miles of interstate highway complete within 16 years. The construction and completion of the originally planned 42,000 miles of interstate highway actually took 27 years to complete, with the last link being Interstate 105 in Los Angeles, which was completed in 1993 &lt;ref name=&quot;M6&quot;&gt;Rosenberg, Matt. &quot;Interstate Highways - An Overview of Interstate Highways.&quot;
Geography Home Page - Geography at About.com. Web. 08 Oct. 2011. &lt;http://geography.about.com/od/urbaneconomicgeography/a/interstates.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; .

====Construction====
The first decade of the interstate highway construction was the most intense period of road building in history. About half of the proposed interstate highway system was opened by the end of 1966, with the system essentially complete by the 1980s &lt;ref name=&quot;M4&quot;&gt;&quot;Interstate System - Design - FHWA.&quot; Home | Federal Highway Administration. U.S. Department of Transportation. Web. 08 Oct. 2011. &lt;http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/programadmin/interstate.cfm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;. The rapid growth phase was due in large part to the government support it received when Dwight Eisenhower became President of the United States of America. During his first term in office, within his first year, the FAHA was signed and allotted $13.5 billion for the planning and construction of the interstate highway system. 

With the money made available for the construction of the interstate highway system, it was set on the fast track to completion. According to the available data, about 23,500 miles (34,115 km) of the interstate highway system had been completed by the end of 1966. And by 1980, what would be considered the end of the growth phase, roughly 40,250 miles (64,430 km) were finished and opened &lt;ref name=&quot;M7&quot;&gt;&quot;USA Interstate Highway System: Miles Opened by Year.&quot; THE PUBLIC PURPOSE 
(Wendell Cox Consultancy). Web. 09 Oct. 2011. &lt;http://www.publicpurpose.com/hwy-intmiles.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Some of the previous technologies that were brought together in the interstate highway system were taken from existing roads and highways. Greater emphasis was placed on standards for the construction of the interstate highway system, as it was important to have uniformity throughout the system. The standards were developed and adopted by the FHWA &lt;ref name=&quot;M4&quot;&gt;&quot;Interstate System - Design - FHWA.&quot; Home | Federal Highway Administration. U.S. Department of Transportation. Web. 08 Oct. 2011. &lt;http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/programadmin/interstate.cfm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;. Similar standards are used in the construction of new interstate highway links.

====Ramifications====
With the growth of the interstate highway system and the increased dominance of the automobile came about urban sprawl. Both private and mass transportation were also dynamically changed due to the interstate highway system. Some of the issues we face even today, many believe, came about as a result of the interstate highway system include issues of economic mobility and growth, problems of sustainability, pollution, congestion and the creation of metropolitan landscapes which lack spatial and cultural harmony &lt;ref name=&quot;M1&quot;&gt;Armbruster, Andrew. &quot;The Interstate Highway System: It's Development and It's Effects on the American Spatial, Economic and Cultural Landscape.&quot; http://www.emich.edu/studentorgs/place/Officers/andrew/Econ%20375%20-%20The%20Construction%20of%20the%20IHS-B.pdf. 5 Apr. 2005. Web. 9 Oct. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;. Major shifts in the relationship between the traditionally dominant core cities and the surrounding suburban areas began to evolve. Economies began to shift out from core cities, and population patterns became more focused on suburban areas. 

The interstate highway system is designed with the highway arteries directed towards the core of the economic energy and in accordance with the existing population density. The highway network concentrated itself as it came into downtown areas and expanded as it moved outward from the city limits. A large reason why the highway system network focuses toward the intercity downtown area is because when it was originally built, it was to be able to be used as an evacuation route for citizens if there was ever a situation where people needed to be evacuated from the city &lt;ref name=&quot;M1&quot;&gt;Armbruster, Andrew. &quot;The Interstate Highway System: It's Development and It's Effects on the American Spatial, Economic and Cultural Landscape.&quot; http://www.emich.edu/studentorgs/place/Officers/andrew/Econ%20375%20-%20The%20Construction%20of%20the%20IHS-B.pdf. 5 Apr. 2005.

On December 18, 1991, President Bush signed the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ITSEA 1991) providing authorizations for highways, highway safety, and mass
transportation for the next 6 years.  Total funding of about $155 billion was appropriated for fiscal years 1992-1997.  The statement of policy outlines several important components:  &quot;to develop a National Intermodal Transportation System that is economically efficient, environmentally sound, provides the foundation for the Nation to compete in the global economy and will move people and goods in an energy efficient manner&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ITSEA&quot;&gt;United States. Department of Transportation. Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 - Summary. By Samuel K. Skinner. National Transportation Library. Web. 21 Oct. 2011. &lt;http://ntl.bts.gov/DOCS/ste.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the goals of ITSEA 1991 are:

* A National Highway System (NHS), consisting primarily of existing Interstate routes and a portion of the Primary System, is established to focus Federal resources on roads that are the most important to interstate travel and national defense, roads that connect with other modes of transportation, and are essential for international commerce.&lt;ref name=&quot;ITSEA&quot; /&gt;
* 
* State and local governments are given more flexibility in determining transportation solutions, whether transit or highways, and the tools of enhanced planning and management systems to guide them in making the best choices.&lt;ref name=&quot;ITSEA&quot; /&gt;
* 
* New technologies, such as intelligent vehicle highway systems and prototype magnetic levitation systems, are funded to push the Nation forward into thinking of new approaches in providing 21st Century transportation.&lt;ref name=&quot;ITSEA&quot; /&gt;
* 
* The private sector is tapped as a source for funding transportation improvements.  Restrictions on the use of Federal funds for toll roads have been relaxed and private entities may even own such facilities.&lt;ref name=&quot;ITSEA&quot; /&gt;
* 
* Highway funds are available for activities that enhance the environment, such as wetland banking, mitigation of damage to wildlife habitat, historic sites, activities that contribute to meeting air quality standards, a wide range of bicycle and pedestrian projects, and highway beautification.&lt;ref name=&quot;ITSEA&quot; /&gt;


====Major Change in Transportation Planning, Policy, and Deployment====

The transit formula and discretionary programs requirements and program structure remained basically unchanged from previous law, but achieved such objectives as transit and highway funding flexibility and identical matching shares, rail modernization funding by formula, increased use of the trust fund, and an expanded research program.  However, a number of programs, including planning and research, began to be funded as percentage takedowns from the total amount of funding provided rather than as separate line items. Reflecting the broader mandates of the transit program, the Urban Mass Transportation Administration, who generally administered these provisions, was renamed the Federal Transit Administration (FTA).&lt;ref name=&quot;ITSEA&quot; /&gt;

====I-69 advocacy begins====
Long before the passing of ITSEA, residents of southwestern Indiana had been exploring the construction of an interstate between Indianapolis and Evansville in hopes of spurring economic development in the region &lt;ref name=&quot;M29&quot;&gt; I-69 Information.  Web.  21 Oct. 2011. &lt;http://www.ccswin.com/policy/I-69.asp&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.  Throughout the mid-1980s, the Southwestern Indiana Highway Coalition (SWIRHC) advocated for a connection to be built and successfully lobbied for a feasibility study to be conducted in hopes of validating that proposition.  Unfortunately for the SWIRHC and its supporters in southwestern Indiana, the feasibility study concluded that a highway between the two cities would not be cost-effective &lt;ref name=&quot;M28&quot;&gt; I-69 Research.  Web.  19 Oct. 2011. &lt;http://www.indiana.edu/~bslib/i69guide.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.  This report, commonly referred to as the &quot;Donohue Study&quot; was forwarded to the Federal Highway Administration and effectively shut out the possibility of an individual interstate being built solely for the purpose of connected the two cities &lt;ref name=&quot;M10&quot;&gt;Dellinger, Matt. Interstate 69. New York: Scribner, 2011. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;.

But the proponents of getting the two cities connected were not stifled by the Donahue study, instead they opted to get their connection built through a grander road building project, Interstate 69.  This pursuit of this project became a reality when an Indiana businessman named David Graham met with a researcher at the Hudson Institute named David Reed &lt;ref name=&quot;M30&quot;&gt;The Men Behind the Interstate. Web. 19 Oct. 2011. &lt;http://washtimesherald.com/local/x1703939795/The-men-behind-an-interstate&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.  Together, these men drew up a broad proposal to extend interstate 69 from Michigan, through Indiana, and through four other states before terminating in Texas along the Mexico border &lt;ref name=&quot;M10&quot;&gt;Dellinger, Matt. Interstate 69. New York: Scribner, 2011. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;.  With this proposal in hand, David Graham set out to promote the vision and would go on to form the Mid-Continent Highway Coalition &lt;ref name=&quot;M10&quot;&gt;Dellinger, Matt. Interstate 69. New York: Scribner, 2011. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;.  

It is from here that one of the most controversial road proposals in the history of the United States began.

==Stakeholders==
===States===
====Michigan====

While many maps of the proposed Eisenhower Interstate System from the late 1950s and 1960s depict I-69 running as far north as I-94 at Marshall, the Michigan State Highway Department  had other plans in mind. The I-69 interchange with I-94 was constructed as a full cloverleaf-style interchange  with collector/distributor ramps that indicated future expansion. In 1968, the northern end of the actual freeway ended almost a mile north of I-94. Expansion would come in 1970 and 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bessert&quot;&gt;Bessert, Christopher J. Michigan Highways: Highways 60 through 69. 31 January 2009. 16 October 2011 &lt;http://www.michiganhighways.org/listings/MichHwys60-69.html#I-069&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:I69--Michigan-Indiana.png|thumb|Map of Interstate 69 from Michigan to Indianapolis, Indiana]]
With the signing of the North American Free Trade Agreement in the early 1990s, many border points between Canada, the United States and Mexico became increasingly important points of international trade, with I-69 and I-94 being two Interstates leading directly from Canadian border crossings to major cities in the Midwest. Proponents of extending I-69 southeasterly into Texas use the &quot;NAFTA Highway&quot; concept in their defense of the extension, while opponents cite the lack of a need for such a highway and the environmental concerns. Today, I-69 begins in Michigan and ends in neighboring Indiana. The first 81 miles of I-69 in Michigan is signed as a north-south highway. At Mile 81, I-69 is signed as an east-west highway.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bessert&quot; /&gt;

====Indiana====

Since the 1940s the Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT) and its predecessor agencies considered an improved highway between Evansville and Indianapolis. Although the idea wasn’t fully developed the idea continued to receive attention until the early 1990s. Congress selected an Evansville to Indianapolis highway as part of a national high priority transportation corridor, designated as Corridor 18 in the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (known as ISTEA). By the late 1990s, Congress further decided that Corridor 18 would be a part of a national Interstate highway project, I-69, which would improve connections between Canada, Mexico and the United States. &lt;ref name=&quot;INDOT&quot;&gt;&quot;Project Overview: i69indyevn.org&quot;. Indiana Department of Transportation. Web. 16 October 2011.&lt;http://www.i69indyevn.org/i-69-tier-2-overview/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Congress has addressed the location of Corridor 18 in several ways; by designating the corridor itself, by approving funding for a &quot;high-priority segment&quot; of the corridor, and by approving the National Highway System (NHS) map for Indiana. To determine the legal status of Corridor 18, it is necessary to consider all of these expressions of the intentions of Congress.&lt;ref name=&quot;DEIS&quot;&gt;&quot;I-69 FAQ.&quot; Official I-69 Evansville to Indianapolis Study Homepage. Indiana Department of Transportation. Web. 16 Oct. 2011. &lt;http://deis.i69indyevn.org/faq.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 1105(f) of ISTEA authorized funding for certain &quot;high-priority segments&quot; of the high-priority corridors. One of the high-priority segments listed in this section was the &quot;Bloomington-to-Newberry&quot; section of Corridor 18. Subsequently, the description of this high-priority segment was extended to &quot;Bloomington to Evansville.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;DEIS&quot; /&gt;

In ISTEA, Congress directed the States to recommend routes that should be included on the NHS, a national network of highways that serve as the primary focus for federal transportation investments. The map developed by INDOT, and approved by FHWA, included an Evansville-to-Bloomington-to-Indianapolis route. Congress approved the Indiana NHS map in 1995, and approved a slightly modified version in 1998. The current approved NHS map for Indiana shows an Evansville-to-Bloomington-to-Indianapolis highway, but does not specifically designate this route as Corridor 18 and does not depict this route as an Interstate. &lt;ref name=&quot;DEIS&quot; /&gt;

The FHWA and INDOT interpret the current legal status of Corridor 18 as follows:

Corridor 18 must connect Evansville and Indianapolis, but does not need to connect to Bloomington;
the funding authorized for the &quot;high-priority segment&quot; between Evansville and Bloomington can be used for construction of Corridor 18 only if an Evansville-to-Bloomington-to-Indianapolis route is chosen (or the legislation is changed); and
the current NHS map for Indiana does not specifically identify a location for Corridor 18.&lt;ref name=&quot;DEIS&quot; /&gt;

====Kentucky====

Gov. Steve Beshear announced federal approval of an agreement by which a 38-mile section of the Wendell H. Ford Western Kentucky Parkway will be designated Interstate 69 by Fall 2011. It is the first segment of what will become an I-69 corridor from Henderson to Fulton, incorporating the Julian Carroll/Purchase Parkway, Edward T. Breathitt Pennyrile Parkway and a portion of I-24 in addition to the Ford/Western Kentucky Parkway. The agreement, which Federal Highway Administrator Victor Mendez approved on Aug. 25, 2011 covers the Ford/Western Kentucky Parkway from its interchange with I-24 near Eddyville to its interchange with the Breathitt/Pennyrile Parkway near Nortonville, in Hopkins County. The agreement outlines improvements the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet will undertake to bring sections of the parkway up to interstate standards. It also identifies design features that are less than interstate standards but which the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) has determined acceptable.&lt;ref name=&quot;KY&quot;&gt;Todd, Keith. &quot;Kentucky I-69 Agreement Approved.&quot; WKMS. WKMS.com, 31 Aug. 2011. Web. 16 Oct. 2011. &lt;http://www.publicbroadcasting.net/wkms/news.newsmain/article/0/5666/1847209/Regional.Headlines/Kentucky.I-69.Agreement.Approved&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the agreed improvements have been advertised to construction contractors, the designated section of the Ford/Western Kentucky Parkway will be eligible for the distinctive red, white and blue shield signs that identify interstate routes. In addition, about 17 miles of I-24, from Eddyville to the Carroll/Purchase Parkway interchange, will also bear I-69 signs, making the total, initial I-69 designation 55 miles long. &lt;ref name=&quot;KY&quot; /&gt;

====Tennessee====

Approximately four miles of I-69 will be built in and around Union City and Troy; this area is represented by federal site maps as &quot;Sections of Independent Utility - 7&quot; or SIU-7. The super-highway will incept north of Union City on U.S. Highway 21 and will run north to Kentucky and southwest, behind Goodyear and Hampton Inn. It will also continue running east of Troy, intersecting U.S. Highway 5. The interstate will then merge into existing U.S Highway 51, which will be upgraded and converted to I-69, between Troy and Dyersburg.&lt;ref name=&quot;TN&quot;&gt;&quot;Dyersburg State Gazette: Local News: Northwest Tennessee Construction of I-69 Continues This Summer (04/09/09).&quot; Dyersburg State Gazette. Dyersburg State Gazette, 09 Apr. 2009. Web. 16 Oct. 2011. &lt;http://www.stategazette.com/story/1529259.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

The project continues from Millington to Dyersburg, Tennessee in Shelby, Tipton, Lauderdale, and Dyer Counties. The proposed project represented on federal site maps as SIU-8 begins at State Route 385 (Paul Barrett Parkway) in Shelby County and extends north to the I-155/US-412/US-51 interchange in Dyer County.  The project has two main alternative corridors.  Corridor R (Red) extends from the State Route 385 (Paul Barrett Parkway) to the west of Millington, Covington, Ripley and Dyersburg  and west of US 51 (SR 3) to I-155 in Dyersburg.  Corridor G (Green) extends to the east of US 51 (SR 3) from State Route 385 (Paul Barrett Parkway) to the I-155/US-412/US-51 interchange in Dyersburg.  Variations of these corridors with crossovers are being studied. 
The proposed project will be built to interstate design standards and will consist of a four-lane divided, access controlled facility with interchanges at major crossroads.  This proposed project is approximately 65 miles in length.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Interstate 69 Project.&quot; PROJECT DATA SUMMARY SHEET: INTERSTATE 69, Section 8. Tennessee Department of Transportation. Web. 16 Oct. 2011. &lt;http://www.tdot.state.tn.us/i69/segment8/description.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

The final section of the proposed I-69 route, SUI-9, runs from Hernando, Mississippi to Millington, Tennessee passing through Desoto and Marshall Counties in Mississippi and Shelby and Fayette Counties in Tennessee.  The Tennessee Department of Transportation is continuing its public involvement process for the Shelby County I-69/I-269 project area.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Interstate 69 Project.&quot; PROJECT DATA SUMMARY SHEET: INTERSTATE 69, Section 9. Tennessee Department of Transportation. Web. 16 Oct. 2011. &lt;http://www.tdot.state.tn.us/i69/segment9/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mississippi====

In Shelby County, I-269, a western, semi-circular subsection of I-69, encompasses former U.S. Highway 385. The future I-269 subsection on the corridor is almost completed between Millington and Collierville. It is expected to be fully constructed by 2013.  The I-69 corridor will run west of U.S. Highway 51 and will be broken into three sections. It will then join Interstate 240, also a Future I-69 Corridor, and will run directly through Memphis, merging into Interstate-55 at Hernando, Miss. The route then runs east to Tunica, Miss. This particular section of I-69, running from Hernando to Tunica, is complete.  Efforts are currently under way to acquire rights of way on I-240. I-69 construction lettings on I-240 are to begin later this year.  A groundbreaking ceremony was held on June 23, 2011 in celebration of beginning construction on one of its five I-269 subsection SIUs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cherry&quot;&gt;Cherry, Bessie. &quot;Local Portion of I-69 Expected to Be Complete in Summer 2012.&quot; nwtntoday.com.

====Louisiana====

The Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development (DOTD), in cooperation with the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), is conducting an environmental and location study to construct a section of the I–69, known nationally as SIU 15. The project would provide a divided, four-lane, limited access highway on new location between US Highway 171 (US 171) near the Town of Stonewall in DeSoto Parish, and Interstate Highway 20 (I–20) near the Town of Haughton in Bossier Parish, a distance of approximately 35 miles. The project Study Area encompasses portions of Bossier, Caddo, and DeSoto Parishes.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;DOTD I-69, SIU 15 Project Site - Why A New Highway?&quot; DOTD I-69, SIU 15 Project Site - Home Page.

====Texas====

The Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) plans routes of the interstate in five segments with the help of committees composed of local officials and stakeholders.  I-69 is planned to occupy the footprint of existing highways, including U.S. highways 59, 77, 84 and 281, and State Highway 44.&lt;ref&gt;Villarreal, Michelle. &quot;Transportation Officials to Meet Wednesday in Kingsville to Discuss I-69 Development » Corpus Christi Caller-Times.&quot; Caller.com.

As currently envisioned, each corridor will include as many as six lanes for passenger vehicles and up to four lanes for large trucks. Corridors also will have up to six rail lines for high-speed passenger rail between cities, high-speed freight, and conventional commuter and freight transit.  Another unique component of each route will be a 61-meter (200-foot)-wide dedicated utility zone for water, oil, and gas pipelines, and transmission lines for electricity, broadband, and other telecommunications services.&lt;ref&gt;Palacios, Antonio. &quot;Trans-Texas Corridor - Vol. 69 No. 1 - Public Roads.&quot; Federal Highway Administration.

===Advocacy Groups===
The proposed building of an interstate that if completed, would span 1,700 miles across seven states, is bound to draw the interest of both supporters and opponents.  The authors of this case study will address the prominent members of both sides in hopes of painting the representative ideals of each movement.

====Groups in Support of I-69====
Although initially started as an Indiana movement to build an interstate from Evansville to Bloomington, I-69's supporters now span an eight state region &lt;ref name=&quot;M25&quot;&gt; History of the I-69 Boondoggle.  Web.  20 Oct. 2011. &lt;http://www.i69tour.org/boondoggle.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.  In each state, the politically and monetarily invested champion the development of I-69 with varying degrees of success.  In battleground states such as Texas and Indiana, the proverbial wars between groups in favor and those in opposition of I-69 routinely make the news.  In states like Kentucky, the opposition movement is less prevalent and support is widely accepted.  Despite these differences, supporters in each state tout economic development and safety as the two principal reasons to build I-69.  

=====Mid-Continent Highway Coalition=====
The Mid-Continent Highway Coalition is comprised of a group of politicians, businessman, and community leaders from seven states, that have lobbied for the completion of the I-69 corridor project &lt;ref name=&quot;M10&quot;&gt;Dellinger, Matt. Interstate 69. New York: Scribner, 2011. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;.  Started in 1993, the Coalition been successful at drumming up support and garnering funding needed to complete I-69.  The Mid-Continent Highway Coalition is the most storied and powerful of all the pro I-69 groups.  Initially the Coalition's efforts towards earning support was modest.  The group's efforts consisted primarily of newsletter distribution and an annual trip by two of its members to Washington D.C..  After nominal success by these means, the Coalition decided it needed to increase its efforts by hiring lobbyists to campaign on behalf of them.  Starting in 1995, the vast majority of the Mid-Continent Highway Coalition's annual budget went to paying for the annual salary of its two lobbyists &lt;ref name=&quot;M25&quot;&gt; History of the I-69 Boondoggle.  Web.  20 Oct. 2011. &lt;http://www.i69tour.org/boondoggle.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.   The use of well paid lobbyists differs greatly from the internet-based efforts of opposition groups.  Although the group has suffered some partnership drawbacks, particular with the state of Texas, the group has been the prominent voice in support of the completion of I-69.

=====Alliance for I-69 Texas=====
The Alliance for I-69 Texas formed in 1994 and is comprised of cities, counties, port authorities and community leaders that support the I-69 corridor project in Texas &lt;ref name=&quot;M24&quot;&gt;Alliance for I-69 Texas.  Web.  20 Oct. 2011. &lt;http://www.i69texasalliance.com/alliance.html&gt;. &lt;/ref&gt;.  The coalition strongly promotes the conversion of existing Highways 59, 77, 84 and 281, and State Highway 44 to interstate quality.  This incremental approach to upgrading to interstate standards is unique for the Texas delegation &lt;ref name=&quot;M10&quot;&gt;Dellinger, Matt. Interstate 69. New York: Scribner, 2011. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;.  The Alliance firmly  believes that this conversion will make travel for Texans safer and that they will reap economic benefits from this heavy investment.  This investment is projected to cost billions of dollars and the means to provide funding for it have caused rifts throughout Texas.  Governor Perry's Trans-Texas Corridor project sought to ease the funding constraints of road building in Texas through the use of public private partnerships.  Some members of the Alliance embraced this concept and voiced their support of the Trans-Texas Corridor project.  However, many felt that the support for another highway project strayed from the Alliance's primary focus and as a result, withdrew from the coalition &lt;ref name=&quot;M25&quot;&gt;County quits Alliance for I-69.  Web.  20 Oct. 2011. &lt;http://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/article/County-quits-Alliance-for-I-69-1641332.php&gt;. &lt;/ref&gt;.  Despite these setbacks, the Alliance for I-69 Texas maintains:  

* The I-69 corridor promotes economic development, new jobs and more efficient freight movements between cities and rural towns.
* Converting the current highways to interstate standards will provide safer travel for Texans throughout the corridor.
* Recognizes the funding constraints of the I-69 proposal and encourages innovative financing tools to step up the pace of developing incremental projects.

====Groups Against the Construction of I-69====
For over two decades, the I-69 corridor proposal has created a substantial opposition force that consists of everyone from farmers to environmentalists.  These groups initially operated independently from one another but with the utilization of the internet, the movement expanded throughout the nation.  In states that were directly affected by the project, opposition varied.  In states like Kentucky and Mississippi, opposition to the proposal was marginal when compared to the states of Indiana and Texas.  

Opposition groups utilized a wide range of techniques to promote their beliefs.  Grassroots organizations like CARR and Count US!, used education, research, and letter writing as a means to influence change.  Other groups, such as Roadblock Earth First! utilized more unconventional means to get their message across.  Although united in opposition, the unconventional tactics of Roadblock Earth First! drew criticism from CARR and Count US!.  

It is important to note that attempting to summarize the wide dispersal of opposition groups throughout the I-69 corridor is a monumental task.  The authors of this case study chose the following opposition groups in hopes of generalizing the common ideologies that characterize the movement.

=====Citizens for Appropriate Rural Roads=====
The Citizens for Appropriate Rural Roads (CARR) was founded by Thomas and Sandra Tokarski of Standford, Indiana&lt;ref name=&quot;M9&quot;&gt;&quot;CARR, Citizens for Appropriate Rural Roads.&quot; . Web. 11 Oct. 2011. &lt;http://www.carri69.org/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;.  CARR was the first organized group that universally opposed the construction of the I-69 corridor.  The Tokarskis founded the group in the fall of 1990 after learning the proposed interstate project would be built directly through their property despite a federally funded study opposing the future development of the interstate corridor.  CARR started small in advocacy, reserving a fire station hall and bringing the I-69 proposal to light for the citizens of Standford.  From there, the opposition to I-69 continued to grow at a localized level.  Although CARR's opposition to the I-69 proposal was notable on a local scale, as it matured, supporters from across the nation began aiding in the group's cause.  In 1995, with the help of an environmental lawyer, CARR successfully proved that the environmental studies conducted by the Indianan Department of Transportation (INDOT) for the I-69 proposal were flawed and violated provisions outlined by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)&lt;ref name=&quot;M10&quot;&gt;Dellinger, Matt. Interstate 69. New York: Scribner, 2011. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; .  This victory in court meant that for I-69 to move forward, INDOT would have to adhere to the provisions outlined by NEPA, which included fully assessing alternatives to the building of the interstate&lt;ref name=&quot;M10&quot;&gt;Dellinger, Matt. Interstate 69. New York: Scribner, 2011. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; .  CARR's success at delaying the building of I-69 caught national attention and the group garnered support from a wide swath of citizens ranging from environmentalists to fiscal conservatives.  The group rejects I-69 for the following reasons&lt;ref name=&quot;M9&quot;&gt;&quot;CARR, Citizens for Appropriate Rural Roads.&quot; . Web. 11 Oct. 2011. &lt;http://www.carri69.org/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;:

*Environmental impacts on the area's water wells, wetlands, wild-life, and limestone karst landscape.
*Believes I-69 is not appropriately funded and that the fiscal benefits that are associated with the project are grossly over-estimated.
*Advocates maintaining the current infrastructure of roads that adequately serve the region.

=====Count US!=====
Count US! is an acronym for Counties Under New Terrain US I-69.  Count US! was founded by John Smith, who formed the group after learning his house would be lost if the corridor proposals for I-69 came to fruition&lt;ref name=&quot;M10&quot;&gt;Dellinger, Matt. Interstate 69. New York: Scribner, 2011. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;.  Count US! worked in unison with CARR to oppose the building of I-69 through southwestern Indiana.  The group maintained that the specific interstate route proposals from INDOT were intentionally vague and posed a  significant threat to homeowners in the proposed corridor area&lt;ref name=&quot;M12&quot;&gt;&quot;CAR Car Rally Tour&quot;.  Web.  12 Oct. 2011.  &lt;http://www.i69tour.org/oldindex.html/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;.  Through its newsletters and website, the group maintained the following&lt;ref name=&quot;M13&quot;&gt;COUNT US! Counties Under New Terrain US I-69&quot;.  Web.  16 Oct. 2011. &lt;http://www.i69tour.org/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;:

*The Environmental Impact Studies conducted for the I-69 route selection were misleading.
*Simply upgrading IN-41 / I-70 would save money, the environment, and free up funds for maintaining the current road infrastructure.
*Governor Daniel's plan to allow the privatization/tolling of I-69 puts taxpayers at the mercy of private for-profit organizations.

=====Corridor Watch=====
Corridor Watch was established in 2004 as a direct response to the Trans Texas Corridor Project.  Corridor Watch's founding members, Linda and David Stall, became active after learning that House Bill 3588 had passed through the Texas State Legislature&lt;ref name=&quot;M10&quot;&gt;Dellinger, Matt. Interstate 69. New York: Scribner, 2011. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; ..  According to the Stalls, advocacy for opposition to HB 3588 was needed because the bill authorized the use of privatized tolling as a means to fund future highway projects, to include I-69.  Using the Toronto's 407 as a reference point, the Stalls stated that greed for increased profit margins would negate any benefits gleaned from this privatized funding structure.  Corridor Watch is against&lt;ref name=&quot;M23&quot;&gt;&quot;CorridorWatch.org-Challenging the Wisdom of the Trans Texas Corridor Project.&quot; Web. 11 Oct. 2011. &lt;http://www.corridorwatch.org/ttc_2007/CW00000035.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;:

*Private control of public infrastructure, whether direct or indirect.
*The use of transportation and transportation related projects as general revenue generators.
*Conversion of existing free highways into toll ways.

=====Roadblock Earth First!=====
Roadblock Earth First! is an offshoot of the anarchist, environmentalist group, &quot;Earth First!&quot;.  Earth First! (EF!) was founded in 1979 as an environmentalist movement that rejects the human-centric, industrialized world through the use of unconventional protest&lt;ref name=&quot;M22&quot;&gt;&quot;Earth First! No Compromise in Defense of Mother Earth&quot;.  Web.  12 Oct. 2011.  &lt;http://www.earthfirstjournal.org/section.php?id=1/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;.  EF! rejects the concept of a professional organization with a structured hierarchy.  The group simply advocates action in defense of Mother Earth.  Unlike other opposition groups, Roadblock EF!'s founder and members are shrouded in secrecy.  The group is notoriously secretive and embraces anonymity as a key strength in the organization.  Since 2005, Roadblock EF! has vandalized and intimidated a number of organizations associated with the construction of I-69.  In fact, the group maintains an online journal, cataloging their exploits&lt;ref name=&quot;M21&quot;&gt;&quot;Stop I-69&quot;.  Web.  12 Oct. 2011.  &lt;http://stopi69.wordpress.com/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Although no specific leadership is identified, Roadblock EF! maintains that I-69 is a highway is being built on the foundation of globalized corporate greed.  The group believes that:

*I-69 is a NAFTA super highway, that will be utilized to move businesses south to exploit cheap labor in Mexico.
*Majority of route will displace families, destroy archeological sites, and destroy the environment through the building of &quot;new terrain&quot;.
*Direct action in the form of civil disobedience, vandalism, and other unconventional tactics are the best means to stop the building of I-69.

==Future Developments==
&lt;br /&gt;
The future of the I-69 corridor is currently uncertain. With local and state governments scrabbling to salvage their budgets and a strong drive in Washington to trim the size of the federal government, funding for the corridor is uncertain at best. The absence of a long-term federal surface transportation bill puts the brakes on construction and has left the local partners in a game of wait-and-see.
A planning commission representative from Tennessee says “recent and expected upcoming budget cuts in funding for I-69 most certainly pose possible construction delays for developing throughout northwest Tennessee.” The Federal Transportation Funding Bill is expected to cut funding by about 35 percent, which will cut the Tennessee Department of Transportation’s funding for the project by about $281 million. U.S. senators for Tennessee, Bob Corker and Lamar Alexander, both say the federal government is doing as much as it can to fund project efforts. In order to secure more stable funding for the project they have proposed the states involved in the corridor should levy a gasoline tax.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cherry&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

	A different strategy has been used by Indiana to fund their portions. Indiana has used, and is continuing to use, proceeds from a commercial highway toll booth in order to fund its portion of I-69 construction. By 2014, Indiana will only have approximately 50 remaining miles left to build from Bloomington to Indianapolis. Despite a better funding situation, local opposition to the corridor is threatening to halt the project. &lt;br /&gt;

	The Bloomington Metropolitan Planning Organization has removed the two mile stretch of I-69 from their long-range comprehensive plans. A federal delegation of congressional representatives from the state have petitioned the planning commission chair stating that the organization holds “legitimate concerns about the project”  but that they should be worked out with INDot and the Federal Highway Administration.&lt;ref&gt;Gabrick, Jason. “Federal Transportation Dollars at Risk with I-69.” Indiana Public Media. 11 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Bloomington removed I-69 from their plans due to significant local opposition from community members. Local opposition could lead to a loss all federal transportation dollars slated for the portion of the corridor.&lt;br /&gt;

	Kentucky has hired a lobbyist in coordination with Indiana to leverage federal funding for a bridge across the Ohio River in order to link the state’s sections of the I-69 corridor. Instead of acquiring new right of way for I-69, Kentucky plans to reconstruct its existing western U.S. Highways at Pennyrile Parkway and Purchase Parkway. Despite this cost saving measure, the retrofitting is still estimated to cost over a billion dollars.&lt;br /&gt;

	Mississippi, Arkansas, Louisiana and Texas have not made significant progress in completing their local portions of the corridor. In Mississippi, environmental impact studies have been completed for four of their five sections of roadway but local funding is not available to start construction. Arkansas has started minor construction only in very small areas. The state has hired a consultant to investigate “innovative financing” options for the state’s portion. Louisiana has yet to identify where it plans to site its section of the corridor. Texas has made no progress on the project except for putting signs along U.S. highway 59 to notify locals that it is part of the future corridor.&lt;ref&gt;Green, Sean. “The Road to I-69.” Bossier Press – Tribune. 30 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">In general, use the acquired wisdom of others in doing any experiment, especially that of a teacher or whoever else is in charge. Make sure that before you do an experiment that you have read about it beforehand and  know what you are doing. You are almost certainly not the first person to do an experiment, and someone already knows what is safe and what isn't. Always follow instructions, and neither do unplanned experiments nor modify the one planned -- even in doing the experiment on a larger scale. Recognize that fire, radioactive substances, hot or very cold objects, and all chemicals are potentially dangerous. Keep all equipment clean, and beware of broken glass that can be contaminated. Dispose of all hazardous substances properly.    

You are the person most responsible for your safety. You can usually do far more to protect yourself from a bad incident than someone else can do to rescue you from a bad event. Report any known hazard that arises to the teacher or other person responsible for the laboratory.

== Introduction ==
The '''Poor Fellow-Soldiers of Christ and of the Temple of Solomon''', commonly known as the '''[[Remembering the Templars/Templars|Knights Templar]]''', the '''Order of the Temple''' or simply as '''Templars''', were among the most famous of the [[Biblical Studies/Christianity/Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic Church]] [[Remembering_the_Templars#Military_orders|military order]]s. Founded during the [[Remembering the Templars/Age|High Middle Ages]] after the [[w:First Crusade|First Crusade]] to help protect Christian pilgrims, the organization lasted for nearly two centuries.

Officially endorsed by Roman Catholic Church around 1129, the Order became a favored charity throughout Christendom, and grew rapidly in membership and power. Templar knights, in their distinctive white [[w:Mantle (vesture)|mantles]] with a red [[w:Christian cross|cross]], were among the most skilled fighting units of the [[w:Crusades|Crusades]]. Non-combatant members of the Order managed a large economic infrastructure throughout [[w:Christendom|Christendom]], innovating financial techniques that were an early form of [[w:banking|banking]], and building [[w:fortification|fortification]]s across Europe and the [[w:Holy Land|Holy Land]].

The Templars' existence was tied closely to the Crusades; when the Holy Land was lost, support for the Order faded. Rumors about the Templars' secret initiation ceremony created mistrust, and King [[w:Philip IV of France|Philip IV of France]] (Philippe le Bel), deeply in debt to the Order, took advantage of the situation. In 1307, many of the Order's members in France were charges of heresy, arrested, tortured into giving [[w:false confession|false confession]]s, and then [[w:death by burning|burned at the stake]]. Under pressure from King Philip, [[w:Pope Clement V|Pope Clement V]] disbanded the Order in 1312. The abrupt disappearance of a major part of the European infrastructure gave rise to speculation and legends, which have kept the &quot;Templar&quot; name alive into the modern day. Only recently did we learn that in [[w:1314|1314]] the Order had secretly been pardoned by [[w:Pope Clement V|Pope Clement V]].

{{:Remembering the Templars/Age}}

== The Crusades and the Reconquista ==
[[w:Crusades|The Crusades]] was one of the most important events of the period, consisting in a series of religious Crusades, in which [[w:Christian|Christian]]s fought to retake Palestine from the [[w:Seljuk Turks|Seljuk Turks]]. The Crusades impacted all levels of society in the High Middle Ages, from the kings and emperors who themselves led the Crusades, to the lowest peasants whose lords were often absent in the east. The height of the Crusades was the 12th century, following the First Crusade and the foundation of the [[w:Crusader state|Crusader state]]s; in the 13th century and beyond, Crusades were also directed against fellow Christians, and in eastern and northern Europe, non-Muslim pagans. Expanded contact with the east, especially among the city-states of Italy, would eventually help spark the Italian [[w:Renaissance|Renaissance]], that then spread throughout the whole of western [[w:Christendom|Christendom]]. The [[History of Western Theatre: 17th_Century to Now/Late German 18th#.22Nathan the Wise.22|late German 18th century theater play &quot;Nathan the Wise&quot; that unfolds in the 12th century Jerusalem]] can be interesting to better contextualize the epoch.

Since at least the 18th century [[w:Freemasonry|Freemasonry]] has incorporated Templar symbols and rituals in a number of [[w:Masonic bodies|Masonic bodies]], most notably, the &quot;[[w:Knights Templar (Freemasonry)#The Degree of Knight of the Temple (Order of the Temple)|Order of the Temple]]&quot; the final order joined in &quot;The United Religious, Military and Masonic Orders of the Temple and of St John of Jerusalem, Palestine, Rhodes and Malta&quot; commonly known as the Knights Templar. One theory of the origins of Freemasonry claims direct descent from the historical Knights Templar through its final fourteenth-century members who took refuge in [[w:Scotland|Scotland]], or other countries where the Templar suppression was not enforced. This theory is usually deprecated on grounds of lack of evidence, by both Masonic authorities (See [http://www.knightstemplar.org/faq1.html#origin Knights Templar FAQ]) and historians (See [http://web.archive.org/web/20101215153015/http://freemasonrytoday.com/19/p07.php Freemasonry Today periodical (Issue January 2002) publisher Grand Lodge Publications Ltd]).

      <text xml:space="preserve">This idiom requires serious rework! Three *distinct* patterns are incorrectly mixed together:
1. non-virtual interface
2. template method pattern
3. before/after invariant checking

1 is a statement about not having virtual functions in the *public* part of an interface and *nothing* more. Reason: distinguish between two major audiences of the inerface, implementers and end-users!
2 is a way to inject specific code into a base class by deriving from it and implement virtual functions and *nothing* more.
3 doesn't have anything to do with 1 and 2.

Just because all three can be used together doesn't mean they are the same.

      <text xml:space="preserve">It's pointless to have a member function
virtual Employee::Employee* create()
What the author probably wanted to do is polymorphic construction, aka factory pattern. In this case a non-member function gets some type flag and returns a newly created object typed as pointer to base.

Consequently the name &quot;virtual constructor&quot; is wrong, which is commonly understood as the factory pattern! Please rename this idiom here to &quot;clone&quot; instead and remove virtual member &quot;create&quot; from the example.</text>

* A personal user page, a [[WB:TALK|talk page]], and a [[Help:Tracking changes#Watching pages|watchlist]] to monitor pages that interest you.
* The ability to [[WB:MOVE|rename]] pages and to [[WB:PREFS|customize]] some aspects of the Wikibooks interface.
* People will recognize you as a member of the Wikibooks community, and you will be eligible to [[WB:REVIEW|review]] pages.
* Your IP address will be hidden from most users, which may give you a greater sense of security and privacy.

We hope that you choose to join our community as a Wikibookian and [[Special:Userlogin|create an account]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">pH is the value which allows people to understand a solution is a base, acid, or neutral. If a solution has pH which is bigger than 7,it is a base. If a solution has pH which is smaller than 7, it is an acid. If a solution has pH which is equal to 7, it is a neutral solution. That solution is water. Understand a solution in a living organism can help to understand the metabolism happens in that living organism.

Hello, thank you for your recent edits to pages on Wikibooks.

Please see the link above for tips about editing Wikibooks.  When you edit article please remember to ''not'' sign your edits.  This isn't necessary except on Talk pages.  Also please try to add information into the correct parts of the page, rather than putting everything at the very start of the page.

== Please do not add your signature to pages that you edit ==

Please do not sign your edits to book pages (&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;).  This is ''only'' necessary when you edit Talk pages, vote for or against the deletion of articles and never within a page of the book.  There is always a record of the edits you have made to a page if you click on the ''View History'' tab near the top of the screen so signatures are not necessary.--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Italy.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 22:04, 19 October 2011 (UTC)

== Please stop ==

We welcome and appreciate [[Special:Contributions/Mttrang1|your contributions]], but some of your recent edits had to be undone. Please see [[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks|What is Wikibooks?]] to learn more about what contributions are beneficial to Wikibooks.

Your [[Special:Contributions/Mttrang1|recent edits]] are considered unconstructive by fellow contributors. Please read [[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks?]] for a description of what we allow. You can ask questions or ask for help in the [[WB:HELP|Assistance Reading Room]]. Please use the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]] for experimenting with the wiki software in the future. Thanks.

Please consider this to be your final warning.

{{tmbox|type=notice|text='''Please do not delete all the content from pages.'''&lt;br /&gt;Page blanking may be mistaken for [[WB:DWV|vandalism]] and does not delete the page. If you wish to have this page deleted please instead add {{tlx|delete|your reason}} to the top of the page and preserve the previous contents, or if it is a duplicate page, add {{tlx|previous edit history|other page name}} to the page instead, so that an administrator can fix it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Very nicely done.  The layout of your wikibook is nice, clear and easy to read.  I like the examples that you provided throughout the page. (C Lloyd)

Thanks, C. It's still not quite done, I have a few finishing touches to do. I just figured out how to do the references last night, so I will add the rest of them soon.

== picture ==

I am not sure how everyone is modifying their picture and putting infromation in the box - I had mucho trouble with this wiki but I'm still learning. I have added several of the sites that you used that I am not familiar with so thank you! SL[[User:Sleclerc|Sleclerc]] ([[User talk:Sleclerc|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Sleclerc|contribs]]) 19:01, 18 October 2011 (UTC)

Check out the Images and Wikipedia section in the Image Content page -- it should help you get started. 

Once you have placed the code for the image in a wiki page, you can add the words for the caption.

== Pretty much done, for now ==

I did add what I had planned to add and made sure the references were there. Hey, it's a wiki page so I might come back and change things later, or maybe someone else will!--[[User:Rcamuse|Rcamuse]] ([[User talk:Rcamuse|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Rcamuse|contribs]]) 15:36, 19 October 2011 (UTC)

Ruth, did you add Everystockphoto.com? That's a pretty strong collection of images that incorporates CC images from Flikr, Morguefile, Xchange, and others. 

In terms of writing style, think of an encyclopedia article. Some of your narrative may be too informal, for example using &quot;you&quot; as though you are talking to the reader. [[User:Sgarrigan|Sgarrigan]] ([[User talk:Sgarrigan|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Sgarrigan|contribs]]) 04:06, 21 October 2011 (UTC)

S.G., I did include everystockphoto.com in the Creative Commons section of the page. Actually that site could be listed under public domain, commercial, and provider supplied licenses too, because it searches through all of them. It's really a great site.

When I chose the style for this page, I was thinking of it more as a lesson than an encyclopedic entry. I'll come back to this later and see what I can do to make it a bit more formal. There's a book that was featured today in Wikibooks that uses informal language, including &quot;you&quot; --  [[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Lucid_Dreaming]]. I can see, though, it might be good to be consistent in the level of formality, matching language used in other pages in the Wikibook, in this case, ''User-Generated Content in Education''. --[[User:Rcamuse|Rcamuse]] ([[User talk:Rcamuse|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Rcamuse|contribs]]) 22:13, 21 October 2011 (UTC)</text>
