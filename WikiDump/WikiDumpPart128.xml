== I'd Like to Offer My Help ==

I am a native Kapangpangan speaker.  I noticed you needed help with audio portions or this book.  I can help with that.  Let me know.
:Thanks, but you haven't left a signature to identify yourself, MetungKP, it makes it easier for us to know who is talking if you sign your message using four tildes like this: &lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;.

I am reverting all the changes that 

1. introduce new words that are not explained (you can't do this, this is a language text book).

2. change the spelling of English words into American English spelling (this book uses British Commonwealth spelling).

3. change the spelling of Kapampangan words into the old Spanish spelling (this book uses Tagalog-based spelling as explained earlier) --[[User:Lgriot|Lgriot]] ([[User talk:Lgriot|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Lgriot|contribs]]) 16:15, 8 December 2011 (UTC)</text>

I don't remember us pronouncing tea as literally &quot;tsssa&quot;...  I remember we pronounce it as the Japanese, Korean, and Chinese do, &quot;cha&quot;, in fact, we pronounce everything with &quot;ts&quot; as &quot;ch&quot;.  The pronunciations need to be checked.--[[Special:Contributions/50.168.47.113|50.168.47.113]] ([[User talk:50.168.47.113|discuss]]) 02:30, 29 September 2013 (UTC)</text>

      <comment>Mixed script Korean Bible as 백팔대참회문 is incorrect.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{WikiProject Languages}}
Intro gives mixed script Korean Bible as 백팔대참회문, but that is a Korean Buddhist text (prayer book, I think) - nothing to do with the Bible.  If I can find out how a mixed script Bible is referred to, I'll correct it.</text>

This page wrongly refers to the son of one's father's brother as a nephew. That is actually a cousin.
A nephew is the son of one's brother (or sister). Perhaps what's meant is &quot;son of one's brother&quot; or &quot;son of one's father's son&quot; (i.e. son of one's brother or of one's paternal half-brother).
Clarification is needed.</text>

== Rohingya Language doesn't exist  ==

Rohingya is so called Fake named used by Bangladeshi illegal immigrants. So they don't have any alphabets at all.

== Tonality in script ==

&quot;Also, the Sumerian writing system, one might imagine, would have developed a way to capture tonality in the script, as has happened in most other tonal scripts.&quot;

I have no idea what this is supposed to mean. By the very fact that, say, du and du3 are distinguished in the script, tones (provided that the difference was tonal) are reflected in it. If, on the other hand, the author means that the script should designate the tones as such directly and predictably, that would have made it a phonetic script and not a logographic one. The only other logographic script for a tonal language that I can think of, the Chinese one, is certainly not phonetic in that way, as it does not have any special signs for the tones as such. Thai is not comparable, since its tones developed after the orthography had been established, and again it is not the tones but the historical tone-conditioning consonants that are expressed in the script. Other &quot;tonal scripts&quot; have mostly been created in modern times and are Latin-based - we can hardly be surprised that the Sumerian one is not like them.--[[Special:Contributions/91.148.159.4|91.148.159.4]] ([[User talk:91.148.159.4|discuss]]) 18:27, 22 February 2011 (UTC)</text>

== more explanation needed... ==

I could use this explained better....

&quot;So instead of saying I am your king = lugal.zu i.men, we could just as easily say lugal.zu.en. Simple as that! The meaning is the same, it's just a little bit of syntactic variety to a common expression&quot;

&quot;I am your king&quot; could be /lugal.zu i.men/ or /lugal.zu.en/

would that be the same for &quot;He/she is your king&quot; ...can we say, /lugal.zu i.me.am/ OR /lugal.zu.en/ .. if not how does the copula work in this instance?</text>

== /z/ phoneme in Telugu ==

The word for true is &quot;nizame.&quot; The romanization I just typed is exactly how it sounds in Telugu. The problem is that the IPA for it is incorrect. /nid͡ʒaːme/ should actually be /nizəːme/ otherwise the romanization would've been &quot;nijaame&quot;. It seems like someone just transliterated the Telugu script into IPA and paid no attention to pronunciation, because the script uses /d͡ʒ/ to represent /z/ like Devnagri. Of course, this could be different from my Gunturi dialect. I am going to go ahead and change it.

== Towards a larger audience ==
I wouldn't mind to include a translation to Portuguese from the English as the book evolves. This could also be interesting for those learning English and Portuguese especially if they understand Tetum.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 12:46, 6 April 2012 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">    My name is Ryan Gaudreau and this is my first semester at Old Dominion University. I have transfered in credits from the University of Connecticut and Quinebaug Valley Community College and am almost a Junior. I just took basic college courses on and off after high school. I enjoy school. I am a fairly laid back person, I work well with others, and look forward to the opportunities here at ODU. 
    I always wanted to teach and I get pretty excited about sciences so that is what I am persuing. I live off campus and am very active in the community. I grew up in New England, but have lived in this area for a year now. I enjoy the area and most importantly, the people I have met here. 
    Because of my interest and passion in science, I can effectively communicate the knowledge I have about it well. I seem to make it interesting, even for people who do not seen too interested in it. As of yet, I am planning on teaching high school and look forward to learning techniques to excel in the education field. 
    Often students have this impression that they &quot;have&quot; to be in school, and essentialy, do not want to be. I look forward to making class fun and even inspirational. You really cannot transmit something you have not got, so I hope I remain inspired and fun loving!

'''Traffic lights''', which may also be  known as '''stoplights''', '''traffic lamps''', '''traffic signals''', '''stop-and-go lights'''{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}, '''robots'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mydriverslicence.co.za/driving_%20road_signs.htm  The meaning of traffic lights/red green and amber robots - South Africa]&lt;/ref&gt; or '''semaphore'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.techtransfer.berkeley.edu/newsletter/07-4/traffic_signals.php A Brief History of Traffic Signals- UCA Berkely]&lt;/ref&gt;, are signaling devices positioned at road intersections, [[pedestrian crossing]]s and other locations to control competing flows of traffic. Traffic lights have been installed in most cities around the world. They assign the [[Right-of-way (traffic)|right of way]] to road users by the use of lights in standard colors ([[Red]] - [[Amber (color)|Yellow]] - [[Green]]),  using a universal [[color code]] (and a precise sequence, for those who are [[w:color blindness|color blind]]). 

Typically traffic lights consist of a set of three colored lights: red, yellow and green. In a typical cycle,
*Illumination of the green light allows traffic to proceed in the direction denoted,
*Illumination of the yellow light denoting if safe to, prepare to stop short of the intersection, and
*Illumination of the red signal prohibits any traffic from proceeding.

Usually, the red light contains some [[orange (color)|orange]] in its [[hue]], and the green light contains some blue, to provide some support for people with red-green color blindness.

==History==
[[Image:Marshalite traffic signal, Melbourne Museum.jpg|thumb|left|[[Marshalite]] traffic signal. Formerly fitted in various intersections in [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]], indicating how much time remained before a signal change.]]

On December 10, 1868, the first traffic lights were installed outside the [[Palace of Westminster|British Houses of Parliament]] in [[London]], by the railway engineer [[J. P. Knight]].  They resembled [[railway signal]]s of the time, with [[semaphore]] arms and red and green gas lamps for night use.
The gas lantern was turned with a lever at its base so that the appropriate light faced traffic. Unfortunately, it exploded on 2 January 1869, injuring&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/nottingham/content/articles/2009/07/16/john_peake_knight_traffic_lights_feature.shtml|title=The man who gave us traffic lights|date=2009-07-16|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2009-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; or killing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Day|first=Lance|coauthors=Ian McNeil|title=Biographical dictionary of the history of technology|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=1996|pages=404–5|isbn=0415060427|url=http://books.google.com/?id=9HQDGHQzVqAC&amp;pg=PA404&amp;lpg=PA404&amp;dq=John+Peake+Knight%2Bobituary&amp;q=John%20Peake%20Knight%2Bobituary}}&lt;/ref&gt; the policeman who was operating it.

The modern [[electric]] traffic light is an American [[invention]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mary Bellis |url=http://inventors.about.com/library/inventors/blasphalt.htm |title=The History of Roads and Asphalt |publisher=Inventors.about.com |date=1952-02-05 |accessdate=2009-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; As early as 1912 in [[Salt Lake City]], [[Utah]], policeman [[Lester Wire]] invented the first red-green electric traffic lights.  On 5 August 1914, the [[American Traffic Signal Company]] installed a traffic signal system on the corner of East 105th Street and Euclid Avenue in [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sessions|first=Gordon M.|title=Traffic devices: historical aspects thereof|year=1971|publisher=Institute of Traffic Engineers|location=Washington|oclc=278619|pages=27–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=New Traffic Signal Installed|journal=The Motorist : official journal of the Ohio State Automobile Association|publisher=Ken Pub. Co|pages=28–29|month=August|year=1914}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It had two colors, red and green, and a [[buzzer]], based on the design of James Hoge, to provide a warning for color changes. The design by James Hoge&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://patimg2.uspto.gov/.piw?Docid=01251666&amp;PageNum=6&amp;idkey=NONE |title=USPTO # 1251666 Sept. 22, 1913 |publisher=Patimg2.uspto.gov |date= |accessdate=2009-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; allowed police and fire stations to control the signals in case of emergency. The first four-way, three-color traffic light was created by [[police officer]] [[William Potts]] in [[Detroit, Michigan]] in 1920.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Sheldon|last=Moyer|title=Mr. 'Trafficlight'|journal=Motor News|publisher=Automobile Club of Michigan|pages=14–15,27|month=March|year=1947| url=http://www33.brinkster.com/iiiii/trfclt/mrtrafficlight/mrtrafficlight.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1922, T.E. Hayes patented his &quot;Combination traffic guide and traffic regulating signal&quot; (Patent # 1447659).  [[Ashville, Ohio]] claims to be the location of the oldest working traffic light in the United States, used at an intersection of public roads until 1982 when it was moved to a local museum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ohiosmalltownmuseum.org/museum1.htm Neato Stuff At the Ashville Museum]. ''Ashville Area Heritage Society''. Retrieved 2008-04-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first interconnected traffic signal system was installed in [[Salt Lake City]] in 1917,{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} with six connected intersections controlled simultaneously from a manual switch. [[Automatic]] control of interconnected traffic lights was introduced March 1922 in [[Houston, Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;Section 1.5: &quot;System Evolution&quot;, ''[http://www.spcregion.org/downloads/ops/FHWA_TrafficControlSystemsHandbook_10-2005-FINAL.pdf Traffic Control Systems Handbook]'', [[Federal Highway Administration]] Report FHWA-HOP-06-006, October 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The first [[automatic]] experimental traffic lights in [[England]] were deployed in [[Wolverhampton]] in 1927.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.localhistory.scit.wlv.ac.uk/plaques/LichfieldStreet.htm Wolverhampton's Blue Plaques]. Wolverhampton History &amp; Heritage Society.&lt;/ref&gt;

The color of the traffic lights representing stop and go might be derived from those used to identify port (red) and starboard (green) in maritime rules governing  [[Port and starboard#Right-of-way for other vessels|right of way]], where the vessel on the left must stop for the one crossing on the right.

Timers on traffic lights originated in Taipei, Taiwan, and brought to the US after an engineer discovered its use.  Though uncommon in most American urban areas, timers are still used in some other Western Hemisphere countries. Timers are useful for drivers/pedestrians to plan if there is enough time to attempt to cross the intersection before the light turns red and conversely, the amount of time before the light turns green.

== Types ==
{{Main|List of variations in traffic light signalling and operation}}
[[Image:Traffic lights.jpg|thumb|right|Traffic lights can have several additional lights for filter turns or bus lanes. This one in [[Warrington]], [[United Kingdom]], also shows the red + amber combination seen in a number of European countries. It also shows the backing board and white border used to increase the target value of the signal head. Improved visibility of the signal head is achieved during the night by using the retro-reflective white border.]]

===Single aspects===
The simplest traffic light comprises either a single or a pair of colored aspects that warns any user of the shared right of way of a possible conflict or danger. 

Flashing Red: Treat as a [[stop sign]]&lt;br&gt;
Flashing Amber: Caution, crossing or road hazard ahead
{{Expand section|date=March 2010}}
Flashing Green: Varies among jurisdiction

===Dual aspects===
{{Expand section|date=March 2010}}
===Three or more aspects===

The universal standard is for the red to be above the green, with amber placed in between. When mounted vertically red is on top, and when mounted horizontally, red is the leftmost light. In addition to the standard red amber and green aspects, other aspects are usually mounted when intersection require more control (i.e. public transport, and permissive turns). Traffic lights in this configuration tend to have a delay between any entry points to allow any residual traffic in the intersection to clear. The delay can be dependent upon the type of intersection, traffic, and road conditions.

===Pedestrian and cyclist crossing lights===

File:AnimatedTrafficLight.ogg|Animated traffic light seen in [[Auckland]], [[New Zealand]].
&lt;/gallery&gt;

When condition require a signalized crossing for non-motorized traffic, crosswalk signals are implemented into the intersection

====European Standard====
The European approach to a signalized crossing is use dual or more rarely, a triple aspect.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freewebs.com/trafficlightsignals2/euroheads.htm Freewebs.com]&lt;/ref&gt; with a blackened out lens of a [[Pictogram]] pedestrian. For cyclist, the same approach is used with the lens blackened out for a bicycle frame. It is not uncommon to see lenses with both symbols on them. &lt;br&gt; 

Light Sequence;&lt;br&gt;
Green: Cross with caution&lt;br&gt;
Amber (if used): Same value as a flashing green &lt;br&gt;
Flashing Green: Continue to cross if already in the intersection. Do not start to cross&lt;br&gt;
Red: Do not cross

====North American Standard====
In North America, the most common aspects found are text only lenses (WALK/ DON'T WALK), and the pictogram stop hand (in Red) and a walking person (in white). Increasing for retrofits of dual aspects and newer installations, the lower aspect formally used for the walk signal (walking person) is being replaced with a timer countdown.

Light Sequence;&lt;br&gt;
Green (Walking Person or WALK); Cross with caution&lt;br&gt;
Flashing Red (Stop hand or DON'T WALK); Continue to cross if already in the intersection. Do not start to cross&lt;br&gt;
Red; Do not cross

====Asia====
Japan
Light Sequence; &lt;br&gt;
Green: Cross&lt;br&gt;
Yellow: Cross if already in intersection, otherwise do not (however by law, you are allowed to cross) &lt;br&gt;
Red: Do not cross&lt;br&gt;
Green (sometimes blue)Arrow: Turn only the direction the arrow points
Pedestrians:
Green man: Walk &lt;br&gt;
Flashing Green Man: Cross if already in intersection, otherwise do not &lt;br&gt;
Red Man: Do not cross &lt;br&gt;
Japan generally does not have timers that accompany the signal, however some new signals will have this function.

Some traffic-light controlled junctions have a light sequence that stops all vehicular [[traffic]] at the junction at the same time, and gives pedestrians exclusive access to the intersection so that they can cross in any direction (including diagonally).  This is known as a [[pedestrian scramble]] in some places.  [[Ampelmännchen]] pedestrian traffic signals have come to be seen as a nostalgic sign for the former [[German Democratic Republic]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

'''Australia:'''
In Australia, a red man means do not cross, a green man means cross and a red flashing man means finish crossing.

==Lights for public transport==

[[Image:Т-образный светофор.JPG|thumb|4-lamp public transport traffic light in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]], showing &quot;stop&quot; signal.]]
[[Image:Ampel muenchen.jpg|thumb|Traffic light in [[Munich]], [[Germany]], showing a special [[bus]] signal.]]

Traffic lights for public transport often use signals that are distinct from those for private traffic. They can be letters, arrows or bars of white or colored light. 

In [[Portland, Oregon]], the tram signals feature a horizontal white bar and an orange vertical bar.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} Some systems use the letter B for buses, and T for trams.

In [[Russia]], dedicated traffic signals for public transport (tram, trolleybus or bus) have four white lights that form the letter T.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} If the three top lamps are lit, this means &quot;stop&quot;. If the bottom lamp and some lamps on the top row are lit, this means permission to go in a direction shown. In case of a tram signal, if there are no tram junctions on an intersection, a simpler system of one amber signal in the form of letter T is used instead; the tram must proceed only when the signal is lit.

In North European countries the tram signals feature white lights of different forms: &quot;S&quot; for &quot;stop&quot;, &quot;—&quot; for &quot;caution&quot; and arrows to permit passage in a given direction.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

[[Image:Public transportation traffic lights in NL and BE.svg|border|none|300px]]

The [[Netherlands]] use a distinctive &quot;negenoog&quot; (nine-eyed) design shown on the top row of the diagram;&lt;ref&gt;{{nl}} [http://wetten.overheid.nl/cgi-bin/deeplink/law1/title=RVV RVV 1990 artikel 70] Official regulation of traffic rules and traffic signs]&lt;/ref&gt; bottom row signals are used in [[Belgium]] and [[France]]. The signals mean (from left to right): &quot;go straight ahead&quot;, &quot;go left&quot;, &quot;go right&quot;, &quot;go in any direction&quot; (like the &quot;green&quot; of a normal traffic light), &quot;stop, unless the emergency brake is needed&quot; (equal to &quot;yellow&quot;), and &quot;stop&quot; (equal to &quot;red&quot;).

The [[Hiawatha Line]] in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]] uses a simplified variant of the Belgian/French system in the city's central business district where only the &quot;go&quot; and &quot;stop&quot; configurations are used.  A third signal equal to yellow is accomplished by flashing the &quot;go&quot; signal.

In [[Japan]], tram signals are under the regular vehicle signal; however the color of the signal for the tram is coloured orange.

===Preemption===
{{Main|Traffic signal preemption}}

Some regions have signals that are interruptible, giving priority to special traffic.  Such ''traffic light preemption'' is usually reserved for [[emergency vehicle]]s such as [[fire apparatus]], [[ambulance]]s, and [[police]] [[squad car]]s, though sometimes [[mass transit]] vehicles including [[buses]] and [[light rail]] trains can interrupt lights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Emergency vehicle traffic signal preemption system  | work=United States Patent and Trademark Office | url=http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?patentnumber=6326903| accessdate=October 7, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/HTM/2003r1/part4/part4f.htm Chapter 4F] of the [[Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices]]&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the systems operate with small transmitters that send radio waves, [[infrared]] signals, or [[strobe light]] signals that are received by a sensor on or near the traffic lights.  Some systems use audio detection, where a certain type of siren must be used and detected by a receiver on the traffic light structure. 

Upon activation the normal traffic light cycle is suspended and replaced by the &quot;preemption sequence&quot;: the traffic lights to all approaches to the intersection are switched to &quot;red&quot; with the exception of the light for the vehicle that has triggered the preemption sequence. Sometimes, an additional signal light is placed nearby to indicate to the preempting vehicle that the preempting sequence has been activated and to warn other motorists of the approach of an emergency vehicle. The normal traffic light cycle resumes after the sensor has been passed by the vehicle that triggered the preemption.

In lieu of pre-emptive mechanisms, in most jurisdictions,{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} emergency vehicles are not required to respect traffic lights, but must activate their own emergency lights when crossing an intersection against the light, in order to alert oncoming drivers to the preemption.

[[Image:Colourblind traffic signal.JPG|thumb|right|A traffic signal in [[City of Halifax|Halifax]], [[Nova Scotia]], [[Canada]] with specially-shaped lights to assist people with color blindness.]]
In some instances, traffic may turn left (in left-driving jurisdictions) or right (in right-driving jurisdictions) after stopping at a red light, providing they give way to the pedestrians and other vehicles.  In some places that generally disallow this, a sign next to the traffic light indicates that it is allowed at a particular intersection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rta.nsw.gov.au/trafficinformation/trafficfacilities/trafficsigns/r2/r2-20.html NSW.gov.au]&lt;/ref&gt;  Conversely, jurisdictions that generally allow this might forbid it at a particular intersection with a &quot;no turn on red&quot; sign, or put a green arrow to indicate specifically when a turn is allowed without having to [[yield sign|yield]] to pedestrians (this is usually when traffic from the perpendicular street is making a turn onto one's street and thus no pedestrians are allowed in the intersection anyway).  Some jurisdictions allow turning on red in the opposite direction (left in right-driving countries; right in left-driving countries) from a one-way road onto another one-way road; some of these even allow these turns from a two-way road onto a one-way road.&lt;ref&gt;[http://law.justia.com/washington/codes/title46/46.61.055.html Justia.com] para 3a.&lt;/ref&gt;  Also differing is whether a red arrow prohibits turns; some jurisdictions require a &quot;no turn on red&quot; sign in these cases.  A study in the [[Illinois|State of Illinois]] (a right-driving jurisdiction) concluded that allowing drivers to proceed straight on red after stopping, at specially posted T-intersections where the intersecting road went left only, was dangerous.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}  Proceeding straight on red at T-intersections where the intersecting road went left only used to be legal in [[Mainland China]], with right-hand traffic provided that such movement would not interfere with other traffic, but when the [[Road Traffic Safety Law of the People's Republic of China]] took effect on 1 May 2004, such movement was outlawed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/jusjih/trafficlightsignals.html#turnred |title=Traffic Light Signals and Red Light Cameras |publisher=Geocities.com |date= |accessdate=2009-05-19|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/20040724025749/www.geocities.com/jusjih/trafficlightsignals.html#turnred|archivedate=2004-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In some other countries, the permission is indicated by a flashing amber arrow (cars do not have to stop but must give way to other cars and pedestrians).

Another distinction is between intersections that have dedicated signals for turning across the flow of opposing traffic and those that do not.  Such signals are called dedicated left-turn lights in the United States and Canada (since opposing traffic is on the left).  With dedicated left turn signals, a left-pointing arrow turns green when traffic may turn left without opposing traffic and pedestrian conflict, and turns red or disappears otherwise.  Such a signal is referred to as a &quot;protected&quot; signal if it has its own red phase; a &quot;permissive&quot; signal does not have such a feature.  Three standard versions of the permissive signal exist:{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}  One version is a horizontal bar with five lights - the green and yellow arrows are located between the standard green and yellow lights.  A vertical 5-light bar holds the arrows underneath the standard green light (in this arrangement, the yellow arrow is sometimes omitted, leaving only the green arrow below the solid green light, or possibly an [[LED]] based device capable of showing both green and yellow arrows within a single lamp housing).  Some newer LED turn arrows seen in parts of [[Canada]] are capable of multicolored animation.  Such lights will often display a flashing and animated green or yellow arrow when the dedicated turn is allowed, but then transform into a red arrow on a white background with a red line through it, emphasising that the turn is no longer allowed.  These lights will also often have the words &quot;NO TURN&quot; displayed, or an explanatory reason why the turn is not allowed, such as &quot;TRAIN&quot; in the case of a rail or light rail crossing.  A third type is known as a &quot;doghouse&quot; or &quot;cluster head&quot; - a vertical column with the two normal lights is on the right side of the signal, a vertical column with the two arrows is located on the left, and the normal red signal is in the middle above the two columns.  Cluster signals in [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] use six signals, the sixth being a red arrow that can operate separately from the standard red light. In a fourth type, sometimes seen at intersections in [[Ontario]] and [[Quebec|Quebec, Canada]], there is no dedicated left-turn lamp per se.  Instead, the normal green lamp flashes rapidly, indicating permission to go straight as well as make a left turn in front of opposing traffic, which is being held by a steady red lamp. (This &quot;advance green,&quot; or flashing green can be somewhat startling and confusing to drivers not familiar with this system. This also can cause confusion amongst visitors to British Columbia, where a flashing green signal denotes a pedestrian controlled intersection.&lt;ref&gt;{{PDFlink|[http://www.icbc.com/Licensing/RoadSense%20for%20Drivers%20PDFs/RoadSense_for_Drivers_Signs_Signals_and_Road_Markings_MV2075.pdf  RoadSense for Drivers - Signs, Signals and Road Markings]}} Accessed: 05 Aug 2008&lt;/ref&gt;)  Another interesting practice seen at least in Ontario is that cars wishing to turn left that arrived after the left turn signal ended can do so during the amber phase, as long as there is enough time to make a safe turn.

A flashing amber arrow, which allows drivers to make left turns after giving way to oncoming traffic, is becoming more widespread in the United States, particularly in Oregon.  In the normal sequence, a protected green left-turn arrow will first change to a solid amber arrow to indicate the end of the protected phase, then to a flashing amber arrow, which remains flashing until the standard green light changes to amber and red.  These generally take the form of four signal sections (green, amber, amber, red). On some newer signals, notably in the city of Bend, the green and flashing amber arrows emanate from the same light section through the use of a dual-color LED array, while the solid amber arrow is mounted above it.

Generally, a dedicated left-turn signal is illuminated at the beginning of the green phase of the green-yellow-red-green cycle. This is called a leading turn. This allows left-turn traffic, which often consists of just a few cars, to vacate the intersection quickly before giving priority to vehicles traveling straight.  This increases the throughput of left-turn traffic while reducing the number of drivers, perhaps frustrated by long waits in heavy traffic for opposing traffic to clear, attempting to make an illegal left turn on red. A dedicated left-turn signal that appears at the end of the green phase is called a lagging turn. If there is no left-turn signal, the law requires one to yield to oncoming traffic and turn when the intersection is clear and it is safe to do so.  Nevertheless, it is increasingly and disturbingly common in at least the U.S. to see drivers who do not yield in the absence of a dedicated signal, cutting off traffic that has right-of-way and is starting to head across the intersection.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}  In the U.S., many older inner-city and rural areas do not have dedicated left-turn lights, while most newer suburban areas have them.  Such lights tend to decrease the overall efficiency of the intersection as it becomes congested, although it makes intersections safer by reducing the risk of head-on collisions and may even speed up through traffic, but if a significant amount of traffic is turning, a dedicated turn signal helps eliminate congestion.

Some intersections with protected-turn signals occasionally have what is known as &quot;[[yellow trap]]&quot;, &quot;lag-trap&quot;, or &quot;left turn trap&quot; (in right-driving countries).{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} It occurs at intersections where vehicles are permitted to make left turns on normal green lights. &quot;Yellow trap&quot; refers to situations when left-turning drivers are trapped in the intersection with a red light, while opposing traffic still has a green.  In British Columbia, the law addresses this problem by giving a left-turning driver already in an intersection the right-of-way to make the turn once the intersection is otherwise clear, regardless of the traffic light state.

For example, an intersection has dedicated left-turn signals for traffic traveling north.  The southbound traffic gets a red light so northbound traffic can make a left turn, but the straight-through northbound traffic continues to get a green light. A southbound driver who had entered the intersection earlier will now be in a predicament, since they have no idea whether traffic continuing straight for both directions is becoming red, or just their direction.  The driver will now have to check the traffic light behind them, which is often impossible from the viewing angle of a driver's seat.  This can also happen when emergency vehicles or railroads preempt normal signal operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/midimagic@sbcglobal.net/lagtrpqz.htm |title=Lag-Trap Quiz |publisher=Geocities.com |date= |accessdate=2009-05-19|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/20090915215755/www.geocities.com/midimagic@sbcglobal.net/lagtrpqz.htm|archivedate=2009-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the United States, signs reading &quot;Oncoming traffic has extended green&quot; or &quot;Oncoming traffic may have extended green&quot; must be posted at intersections where the &quot;yellow trap&quot; condition exists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/htm/2003r1r2/part4/part4d.htm#section4D05 |title=FHWA - MUTCD - 2003 Edition Revision 1 Chapter 4D |publisher=Mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov |date= |accessdate=2009-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/htm/2003r1r2/part2/part2c.htm#section2C39 |title=FHWA - MUTCD - 2003 Edition Revision 1 Chapter 2C |publisher=Mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov |date= |accessdate=2009-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although [[motorcycle]]s and [[Scooter (motorcycle)|scooters]] in most jurisdictions follow the same traffic signal rules for left turns as do cars and trucks, some places, such as [[Taiwan]], have different rules.  In these areas, it is not permitted for such small and often hard-to-see vehicles to turn left in front of oncoming traffic on certain high-volume roads when there is no dedicated left-turn signal.  Instead, in order to make a left turn, the rider moves to the right side of the road, travels through the first half of the intersection on green, then slows down and stops directly in front of the line of cars on the driver's right waiting to travel across the intersection, which are of course being held by a red light.  There is often a white box painted on the road in this location to indicate where the riders should group.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}  The rider turns the bike 90 degrees to the left from the original direction of travel and proceeds along with the line of cars when the red light turns green, completing the left turn.  This procedure improves safety because the rider never has to cross oncoming traffic, which is particularly important given the much greater likelihood of injury when a cycle is hit by a car or truck. This system (called a &quot;[[hook turn]]&quot;) is also used at many intersections in the CBD of Melbourne, Australia, where either or both streets carry tramways. This is done so right-turning vehicles (Australia drives on the left) do not block the passage of trams. The system is being extended to the suburbs.

==Lane control==
{{Main|Lane control lights}}

Lane control lights are a specific type of [[Traffic lights|traffic light]] used to manage traffic on a multi-way road or highway. Typically they allow or forbid traffic to use or more of the available lanes by the use of green lights or arrows (to permit) or by red lights or crosses (to prohibit).

==Special provisions==

Traffic light failure in most jurisdictions must be handled by drivers as a priority-to-the-right intersection in both drive-on-the-left Australia and some states of the mainly drive-on-the-right Europe, or an all-way stop elsewhere, pending the arrival of a [[Police|police officer]] to direct traffic. 

Some jurisdictions, however, have additional [[Traffic#Right of way|right-of-way]] signs mounted above, below or next to the traffic lights; these take effect when the lights are no longer active. (In [[Italy]] as well as some jurisdictions in the US, traffic lights inactive at nighttime emit an amber-colored flashing signal in directions owing priority while the intersecting street emit a flashing red light, requiring drivers to stop before proceeding. In [[Germany]] the priority directions will not be illuminated while the intersecting streets will be shown a flashing yellow signal.) In the [[UK]] and parts of [[North America]], drivers simply treat the junction as being uncontrolled when traffic lights fail, giving way as appropriate, unless a police officer is present.  In much of the United States failed traffic signals must be treated as [[all-way stop]] intersections.

==Dummy lights==
[[Image:Dummy Light.jpg|thumb|Historic dummy light in [[Canajoharie (village), New York|Canajoharie, New York]], [[United States]]]]
A dummy light is a traffic light that stands on a pedestal in the middle of an intersection.  There are at least three that still operate in the United States today, all located in [[New York|New York State]]: [[Beacon, New York|Beacon]], [[Canajoharie (village), New York|Canajoharie]] and [[Croton-on-Hudson, New York|Croton-on-Hudson]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}  There have been a number of requests in recent years for these traffic lights to be removed due to safety concerns, but the historic value has kept these landmarks at their original locations.

==Technology==
===Optics and lighting===
[[Image:LED traffic light.jpg|thumb|upright|left|An example of an LED traffic light [[Australia]]]]
Traditionally, incandescent and halogen bulbs were used. Because of the low efficiency of light output and a single point of failure (filament burnout) municipalities are increasingly retrofitting traffic signals with [[Light Emitting Diodes|LED]] arrays
that consume less power, have increased light output, last significantly longer, and in the event of an individual LED failure, still operates albeit with a reduced light output. With the use of optics, the light pattern of an LED array can be comparable 
with the pattern of an incandescent or halogen bulb.

===Programmable visibility signals===

[[Image:First and Mill 3Ms img14.jpg|right|250px|thumb|3M traffic signals installed in [[Shelton, Washington]], [[United States]]. Standing off-axis from the intended viewing area, these signals appear to be &quot;off&quot; or invisible to adjacent lanes of traffic during the daytime. (A faint glow is present in the lit indication when viewed at night)]]
[[Image:First and Mill 3Ms img07.jpg|right|250px|thumb|The same two signals above, taken in the signal's intended viewing area (a single lane of northbound traffic). Special light-diffusing optics and a colored fresnel lens create the indication.]]Signals such as the [[3M High Visibility Signals|3M High Visibility Signal]] and McCain Programmable Visibility signal, utilize light diffusing optics and a powerful fresnel lens to create the signal indication. Lit via a powerful 150W PAR46 sealed-beam lamp, the light from the lamp in these &quot;programmable visibility&quot; signals passes through a set of two glass lenses at the back of the signal. The first lens, a frosted glass diffusing lens, diffuses the light into a uniform ball of light around five inches in diameter. The light then passes through a nearly identical lens known as an optical limiter (3M's definition of the lens itself), also known as a &quot;programming lens&quot;, also five inches in diameter.  

Using a special aluminium foil-based adhesive tape, these signals are &quot;masked&quot; or programmed via the programming lens so that only certain lanes of traffic will view the indication. At the front of these programmable visibility signals is a 12&quot; fresnel lens, each lens tinted to meet United States [[Institute of Transportation Engineers]] (ITE) chromaticity and luminance standards. The fresnel lens (3M utilized a square lens masked to create a ball indication, McCain used a circular lens itself) focuses or concentrates the light output created by the lamp, and creates a uniform display of light for the lane in which it is intended. These signals were first developed by the [[3M]] Company in the late 1960s,{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} and were wildly popular in the late 1970s as traffic density increased.

In addition to being positioned and mounted for desired visibility for their respective traffic, some traffic lights are also aimed, louvered, or shaded to minimize mis-interpretation from other lanes.  For example, a [[Fresnel lens]] on an adjacent through-lane signal may be aimed to prevent left-turning traffic from anticipating its own green arrow.  One example of the Fresnel lens application common in the USA is the [[3M High Visibility Signals|3M Model 131 traffic signal]] (dubbed the &quot;Programmed Visibility&quot; signal). Although 3M has recently discontinued the M-131, it became a popular traffic signal for skewed or complex intersections. Today, McCain Traffic Systems (a traffic signal manufacturing company based in [[Vista, California]]) is the only U.S.-based manufacturer producing true &quot;programmable visibility&quot; traffic signals. In addition to aiming, Fresnel lenses, and louvers, visors and back panels are also useful in areas where sunlight would diminish the contrast and visibility of a signal face.

Typical applications for these signals were skewed intersections, specific multi-lane control, left-turn pocket signals or other areas where complex traffic situations existed.

===Conventional lighting systems===

Conventional traffic signal lighting, still common in some areas, utilizes a standard light bulb.  Typically, a 67 watt, 69 watt, or 115 watt medium-base (household lamp in the U.S) light bulb provides the illumination.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} Light then bounces off a mirrored glass or polished aluminium reflector bowl, and out through a polycarbonate plastic or glass signal lens. In some signals, these lenses were cut to include a specific refracting pattern. Crouse-Hinds is one notable company for this practice. In the 1930s throughout the 1950s, they utilized a beaded prismatic lens with a &quot;smiley&quot; pattern embossed into the bottom of each lens.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

===Light design===
In the United States, traffic lights are currently designed with lights approximately {{convert|12|in|-1|-1}} in diameter. Previously the standard had been {{convert|8|in|-1|-1}}, however those are slowly being phased out in favor of the larger and more visible 12&amp;nbsp;inch lights. Variations used have also included a hybrid design, which had one or more 12&amp;nbsp;inch lights along with one or more lights of {{convert|8|in|-1|-1}} on the same light.  For example, these &quot;12-8-8&quot; (along with 8-8-8) lights are standard in most jurisdictions in Ontario, Manitoba, and British Columbia (that, is, the red light is 12 and others 8, making the red more prominent). {{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

In the United Kingdom, 12&amp;nbsp;inch lights were implemented only with Mellor Design Signal heads designed by [[David Mellor (designer)|David Mellor]]. These were designed for symbolic optics to compensate for the light loss caused by the symbol. With the invention of anti-phantom, highly visible SIRA lenses, lights of {{convert|8|in|mm|-1|-1}} could be designed to give the same output as plain lenses, so a larger surface area was unnecessary. Consequently lights of {{convert|12|in|-1|-1}} are no longer approved for use in the UK and all lights installed on new installations have to be {{convert|200|mm|0|0}} in accordance with TSRGD (Traffic Signs Regulations and General Directions). Exemptions are made for temporary or replacement signals. {{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

In the state of Victoria, Australia, lights used to have long visors with a slanted cut on the side nearest the road (for approach side) and none for the opposite side.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} These lights also had a sort of horizontal filter covering the upper half of the visor, except on arrows. This design eliminated or minimised washout of the light by a low-lying sun. This type of design has yet to surface outside of Victoria. LED-based lights, however, do not follow this standard, adopting the national standard of having a short visor and cut on both sides, although the cut is also applied to the lights on the opposite side of the junction. Some installations do not have cuts on the opposite side. There exists at least 1 LED-based light using the visor and filter set of its predecessor.

===Control and coordination ===
{{Main|Traffic light control and coordination}}

The normal function of traffic lights requires sophisticated control and coordination to ensure that traffic moves as smoothly and safely as possible and that pedestrians are protected when they cross the roads.

===Mounting===

There are significant differences from place to place in how traffic lights are mounted or positioned so that they are visible to drivers.  Depending upon the location, traffic lights may be mounted on poles situated on street corners, hung from horizontal poles or wires strung over the roadway, or installed within large horizontal gantries that extend out from the corner and over the right-of-way.  In the last case, such poles or gantries often have a lit sign with the name of the cross-street.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

[[Japan]], [[South Korea]], [[Singapore]], [[Taiwan]], [[Thailand]] and [[Croatia]], along with some jurisdictions in the [[United States|U.S.]] (including [[New Mexico]], [[Wisconsin]], most of [[Texas]], [[Florida]], [[Nebraska]], and some localities in [[Kansas]], [[New Jersey]] and [[Louisiana]].),some places in [[Canada]] and [[Mexico]] mount lights with their multiple faces arranged horizontally, often with supplemental vertical signals on the side, while others use vertical signals almost exclusively.  Horizontal signals have consistent orientation, like their vertical counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/HTM/2003r1/part4/fig4d-03_longdesc.htm |title=FHWA - MUTCD - 2003 Edition Revision 1 Fig. 4D-3 Long Description |publisher=Mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov |date= |accessdate=2009-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Often, supplemental curb pedestal mounts, intended to support a signal for a different approach road, are used when primary signals are partially obscured due to structures such as overpasses, approaches around a building that obscures the primary signal mountings, and unusual approach geometry. In Florida, horizontal signals mounted on poles, known as &quot;mast arms&quot;, are in wide use due to their lower wind profile, important for minimising [[hurricane]] damage. The horizontally mounted traffic light position is very common in [[Texas]], [[New Mexico]], and [[South Florida]] on most intersections.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} In areas where wind-load is not as major a concern as ice-load such as [[Illinois]] or [[Minnesota]] the lights are mounted vertically to reduce the accumulation of ice or snow over the surface of the signal heads.

[[California]] is particularly rigorous{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} in ensuring that drivers can see the current state of a traffic light.  One entrance to a typical large intersection, with three through lanes, two dedicated left-turn lanes, and a crosswalk, may have as many as three traffic lights for the left-turn lanes, three for the through lanes, and a pedestrian signal for the crosswalk.  Those numbers must be multiplied by four to cover all four ways to enter a typical intersection.

[[Image:20060627 Trump Taj Mahal from Pacific Avenue.jpg|thumb|right|Example of horizontal mounted traffic light in [[Atlantic City]], [[New Jersey]], [[United States]]]]
Traffic signals in most areas of Europe are located at the stop line on same side of the intersection as the approaching traffic (there being both [[right- and left-hand traffic]]) and are often mounted overhead as well as on side of the road. At particularly busy junctions for freight, higher lights may be mounted specifically for [[lorry|trucks]]. The stop line alignment is done to prevent vehicles blocking any crosswalk blocking and allow for better pedestrian traffic flow. There may also be a special area a few metres in advance of the stop line where cyclists may legally wait but not motor vehicles; this [[advanced stop line]] is often painted with a different road surface with greater friction and a high color, both for the benefit of cyclists and for other vehicles. The traffic lights are mounted so that cyclists can still see them.

In North America, there is often a pole-mounted signal on the same side of the intersection, but additional pole-mounted and overhead signals are usually mounted on the far side of the intersection for better visibility.  In some areas, signals facing all four directions are hung directly over the intersection on a wire strung diagonally over the intersection.

==Implementation==
According to transportation engineers, traffic lights can have both positive and negative effects on traffic safety and traffic flow.  The separation of conflicting streams of traffic in time can reduce the chances of right-angle collisions.  But also the frequency of rear-end crashes can be increased by the installation of traffic lights, and they can adversely affect the safety of bicycle and pedestrian traffic.  They can increase the traffic capacity at intersections, but can also result in excessive traffic delay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Traffic Signals |publisher=Institute of Transportation Engineers |date=September 2007 |url=http://www.ite.org/safety/issuebriefs/Traffic%20Signals%20Issue%20Brief.pdf |accessdate=2009-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Hans Monderman]], the innovative Dutch traffic engineer, and pioneer of [[shared space]] schemes, was sceptical of their role, and is quoted as having said of them: &quot;We only want traffic lights where they are useful and I haven't found anywhere where they are useful yet&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

===Small vehicle safety===
In some instances the stoplight traffic detector will not change the light for small vehicles such as motorcycles and scooters. This is the result of the inability of the sensors to detect the presence of the small vehicle. A vehicle with sufficient mass consisting of a metal such as steel interacts with the sensors magnetic field causing the light to change at the appropriate time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://auto.howstuffworks.com/car-driving-safety/safety-regulatory-devices/question234.htm Howstuffworks.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Motorcycles and scooters have much less mass than cars, resulting in a failure to trigger the sensor. This situation most often occurs at the times of day when other traffic is sparse as well as when the small vehicle is coming from a direction that does not have a high volume of traffic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://motorcycleassistant.com/motorcycles-and-stoplights/ Motorcycleassistant.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all sensor traffic lights have this problem. There are some that can pick up these vehicles without problems and most are capable of doing so, however through road construction and other processes they are not properly adjusted or calibrated for the small vehicles - but they should be, including bicycles. Faulty ones should be reported. Magnetic field sensors detect vehicles passing over them and not necessarily stationary vehicles.

===Traffic signal warrants===
{{globalize/USA}}
Traffic signals have strengths and weaknesses that must be considered when deciding whether to install them. Signaled intersections can reduce delay for side road traffic and reduce the occurrence of collisions by turning traffic and cross traffic. But they may also cause delay for traffic on the main road, and often increase [[rear-end collision]]s by up to 50%&lt;ref name=CRF&gt;National Cooperative Highway Research Program, Crash Reduction Factors for Traffic Engineering and Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) Improvements: State-of-Knowledge Report, November 2005, Table 3&lt;/ref&gt;. Since right-angled and turn-against-traffic collisions are more likely to result in injuries, this is often an acceptable trade-off.

==US Department of Transportation Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices==

Criteria have been developed to help ensure that new signals are installed only where they will do more good than harm. In the United States these criteria are called ''warrants'', and are found in the [[Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices]] (MUTCD), the Federal regulation covering the use of signs, pavement markings, traffic signals, and similar devices.

In the US MUTCD, there are nine warrants for traffic signals:&lt;ref&gt;[http://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/htm/2009/part4/part4c.htm Section 4C. Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (2009 Edition).]&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Eight-Hour Vehicular Volume'''. Traffic volume must exceed prescribed minima for eight hours of an average day (usually a weekday).
&lt;!-- {{Clarify|reason=Does weekday include Saturday?|date=March 2009}}
The MUTCD text specifies &quot;average day&quot;, except in Warrant 8, where it mentions the term &quot;weekday&quot;. But the MUTCD usage of &quot;weekday&quot; does not include Saturday or Sunday, because Warrant 8 specifies different conditions for Saturday and Sunday. Refer to Section 4C.09 for this usage, there's a citation link now. --&gt;
*'''Four-Hour Vehicular Volume'''. Traffic volume must exceed prescribed minima for four hours of an average day. 
*'''Peak Hour Volume or Delay'''. This is applied only in unusual cases, such as [[office park]]s, industrial complexes, or [[park and ride]] lots that attract or discharge large numbers of vehicles in a short time, and, for a minimum of one hour of an average day. The side road traffic suffers undue delay when entering or crossing the major street.
*'''Pedestrian Volume''', if the traffic volume on a major street is so heavy that pedestrians experience excessive delay in attempting to cross it
*'''School Crossing''', if there not enough safe gaps in traffic for school children to safely cross the street
*'''Coordinated Signal System''', for places where adjacent traffic control signals do not keep traffic grouped together efficiently. 
*'''Crash Experience'''. The volumes in the eight- and four-hour warrants may be reduced if five or more right-angle and cross traffic turn collisions have happened at the intersection in a twelve month period.
*'''Roadway Network'''. Installing a traffic control signal at some intersections might be justified to encourage concentration and organization of traffic flow on a roadway network.
*'''Intersection Near a Grade Crossing'''. A traffic control signal is often justified at an intersection near a [[railroad crossing]], in order to provide a preemption sequence to allow traffic queued up on the tracks an opportunity to clear the tracks before the train arrives. 

An intersection should meet one or more of these warrants before a signal is installed. However, meeting one or more warrants does not ''require'' the installation of a traffic signal, only ''suggests'' that they may be suitable. It could be that a [[roundabout]] would work better there. There may be other unconsidered conditions that lead to traffic engineers to conclude a signal is undesirable. For example, they may decide not to install a signal at an intersection if traffic stopped by it will back up and block another, more heavily trafficked intersection. Also, if a signal meets only the peak hour warrant, the advantages during that time may not outweigh the disadvantages during the rest of the day.

Between 1979 and 1988, the city of [[Philadelphia]] removed 199 signals that did not meet any of the warrants. On average, the intersections had 24% fewer crashes after the unwarranted signals were removed.&lt;ref name=CRF/&gt;

==Legal implications==
[[Image:Redlightfinesign.jpg|left|thumb|Attempt to discourage red light running by posting the minimum fine, which has increased by $1.09 since this photo was taken.]]

In virtually all jurisdictions{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} in which they are used, it is an offence for motorists (and other road users) to disregard the instructions of traffic lights (or other traffic control devices). Exceptionally, it is not an offence for pedestrians to cross against a red light in the United Kingdom, where pedestrian lights officially give advice, rather than an instruction, although UK pedestrians do commit an offence if they cross a road against the signals of a police officer controlling traffic.

The most common{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} infraction associated with traffic lights is failing to stop for a red light (in some jurisdictions, running an ''amber'' light can also incur a penalty).  Enforcement of traffic lights varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction; some places are extremely strict.  Other locales are infamous for traffic lights being routinely ignored by motorists, with no serious attempts by law enforcement to alter the situation.

Jurisdictions differ somewhat on how to deal with &quot;red light running&quot; — attempts by motorists to race to an intersection while facing a yellow light, in an attempt to beat the red.  In some locales, as long as the light is yellow when the motorist enters the intersection, no offense has been committed; in others, if the light turns red at any time before the motorist clears the intersection, then an offense occurs.  In  [[Oregon]] and other places, a stricter standard applies-—running an ''amber'' light is an offense, unless the motorist is unable to stop safely.  This standard has been criticized{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} as ambiguous and difficult to enforce (red light cameras in Oregon are activated only if a motorist enters the intersection on a red). Red light cameras in [[New South Wales|NSW, Australia]] are activated only if a motorist enters an intersection 0.3 seconds ''after'' the light has turned red.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rta.nsw.gov.au/licensing/downloads/road_users_handbook.pdf NSW RTA Road users' handbook]&lt;/ref&gt;

In some jurisdictions (such as [[Toronto, Ontario|Toronto]], [[Washington D.C.]], [[New York City]], and the state of [[California]]){{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}, there are ordinances against &quot;[[gridlock]]ing.&quot;  A motorist entering an intersection (even if on a green light) but is unable to proceed and gets stranded in the intersection (when traffic ahead fails to proceed), and remains after the light turns red (thus blocking traffic from other directions) may be cited.  The definition of the intersection area is that square where the two streets overlap marked by the inner lines of each crosswalk.  (Occupying the space inside the crosswalk lines is itself a traffic infraction, but different from gridlocking.)  This gives the meaning to the anti-gridlock slogan &quot;Don't Block the Box.&quot;  This is sometimes used as a justification for making a turn across the opposing travel lanes on a red light at a busy intersection, by pulling partway into the intersection at a green light waiting to perform the turn, and, if oncoming traffic is not abated before the light changes to red, proceeding to turn once the light has turned red and opposing traffic has stopped. This means that at busy junctions without a protected green arrow for turning traffic, one turns after the light turns red.  This maneuver is commonly referred to as &quot;occupying the intersection&quot; or &quot;being legally allowed to complete one's turn&quot;.  In some jurisdictions, including most American states, a vehicle already in the intersection when the light turns red legally has the right of way, and vehicles who have green must yield to the vehicle in the intersection.

In [[Sackville, New Brunswick|Sackville]], [[New Brunswick]] it is customary for through traffic to voluntarily yield to the first oncoming left-turning vehicle to allow it to perform a [[Pittsburgh left]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} This is similar to a [[hook turn]] performed in Melbourne, Australia, which is legal at signed intersections.
[[Image:Farolvermelho.jpg|right|thumb|A driver skidding to a stop on the crosswalk as a result of attempting to avoid a red light violation.]]

Enforcement of traffic lights is done in one of several ways:

* By police officers observing traffic, and issuing citations to motorists who violate the signal.
* As a result of an accident investigation, if it is determined that one or more motorists ran the red light — even if the incident was not observed by a police officer.
* With red light cameras.

===Red light cameras===
{{details|Traffic enforcement camera}}
In some areas, [[red light camera]]s are used.  An automated camera is connected to the triggering mechanism for the corresponding traffic light, which is targeted to photograph any vehicle, which crosses against the light. The driver or owner (depending on local laws) of a vehicle is photographed so that they can be fined for the violation. In some jurisdictions in the United States, private companies have been contracted to operate traffic-related cameras and in turn receive a portion of the resulting revenues. This has resulted in abuses, where vehicle operators that are innocent of infractions have been fined as a result of traffic systems that have been improperly modified to benefit the private companies.

===Light timing length===
{{See also|Traffic light control and coordination}}
The length of amber lights can differ, for example in many places the length of an amber light is usually 5 seconds, but elsewhere it may be as little as 3 seconds considerably reducing the time for reaction.  It is typical for these times to vary according to the set speed limit, with longer times for higher limits. In the state of Georgia, United States, an amber light must be lit one second for every 10&amp;nbsp;mph of posted speed limit. In this situation, a 45&amp;nbsp;mph posted speed limit would have a 4.5 second amber light.  For intersections with red light cameras, 1 extra second must be added. In Colorado Springs, Colorado, green lights at numerous intersections have been noted with durations of approximately two seconds. 

The time from when a red light is displayed and when a cross street is given a green light is usually based on the physical size of the intersection. This intervening period is called the all-red time. A typical all-red time is 3 seconds to allow cars to clear the intersection.  In a wider intersection, such as 4 lane road or highway intersection, the all-red time may be as much as 5 seconds, allowing drivers who could not stop at the amber light enough time to clear the intersection without causing a collision.

==In other contexts==
The symbolism of a traffic light (and the meanings of the three primary colors used in traffic lights) are frequently found in many other contexts. Since they are often used as single spots of color without the context of vertical position, they are typically not comprehensible to up to one in ten males who are [[color blindness|color blind]].

Traffic lights have also been used in pieces of artwork, particularly the [[Traffic Light tree]] in London, UK.

===Racing===
Automobile racing circuits can also use standard traffic signals to indicate to racing car drivers the status of racing. On an oval track, four sets may be used, two facing a straight-away and two facing the middle of the 180 degree turn between straight-aways. Green would indicate racing is under way, while yellow would indicate to slow or while following a pace car; red would indicate to stop, probably for emergency reasons.

[[Scuderia Ferrari]], a [[Formula One]] racing team, formerly used a traffic light system during their pit stops to signal to their drivers to when to leave the pits.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} The red light was on when the tires were being changed and fuel was being added, yellow was on when the tires were changed, and green was on when all work was completed. The system is (usually) completely automatic. However, the system was withdrawn after the [[Singapore Grand Prix|2008 Singapore Grand Prix]], due to the fact that it heavily delayed [[Felipe Massa]] during the race, when he was in the lead. Usually, the system was automatic, but heavy traffic in the pit lane forced the team to operate it manually. A mechanic accidentally pressed the green light button when the fuel hose was still attached to the car, causing Massa to drive off, towing the fuel hose along. Additionally, Massa drove into the path of [[Adrian Sutil]], earning him a penalty. He finally stopped at the end of the pit lane, forcing Ferrari's mechanics to sprint down the whole of the pit lane to remove the hose. As a result of this, and the penalty he also incurred, Massa finished 13th. [[Ferrari]] decided to use a traditional &quot;lollipop&quot; for the remainder of the [[2008 Formula One season|2008 season.]]

===As a rating mechanism===
{{See also|Traffic light rating system|European Union energy label}}

The colors red, amber and green are often used as a simple-to-understand rating system for products and processes. It may be extended by analogy to provide a greater range of intermediate colors, with red and green at the extremes.

      <text xml:space="preserve">====Chapter VI:  Seasonal work and the village school====  

Just after WWII it was still possible to see steam engines propelling wagons, road rollers and farm implements. The threshing machine  working in Tatworth was hired from the local supplier. It usually came with its own team of men who were familiar with its workings. The decision to start threshing was a judgement made by the farmer. His starting point would be the price of flour, the position of his bank balance and the gamble he was prepared to make on the state of the local economy. Usually the corn was threshed in late autumn and early winter. If done outside, the state of the weather or what was forecast, was the adjudicator. The flail was still known to be used – mainly in the winter, to give work when bad weather kept the workers from the field - to produce corn for the chickens.

Threshing was always done in a hurry - using the maximum number of workers. A full water cart was always to hand. It was no good finding you were out of water halfway through the job - having to close down the boiler. It was the farmer’s responsibility to see that water was always available and sufficient coal to hand. If local water unavailable it was pumped from a stream or pond into the water tub. Welsh steam coal was shovelled into the boiler as gradually steam pressure was reached… The tall chimney belched black smoke and the whistle blew – at last pressure 'was up!' The great flywheel turned and the piston rod jerked backwards and forwards… the belt started to flap and the speed regulator spun… The thresher started pulsating – humming its never-ending tune, as every piece of loose metal, associated bit of tackle, and worn bearing, started to rattle and shake. One man started to go round the road wheels on the engine, to hammer in wedges to prevent the engine from moving closer to the thresher, and another man wedged the thresher – the idea was to stop the belt from slipping by maintaining the correct tension on the belt.

Two men usually unricked the sheaves of corn onto a cart… which duly, pulled up to the elevator, to be off-loaded onto the conveyor. The sheaves passed along the conveyor to the bond cutter who cut the string or untied the band to release the stalks, which were then entered into the drum feeder. At the other end of the feeder the now husk-less straw was taken off the drum to be taken to the straw-stack… the grain was bagged up from the side-chute using a sack-trolley in two hundred-weight sacks, and loaded onto the grain wagon.

Ten men often carried out this whole operation. The spent straw not always taken immediately to make a stack – some farms would tie the straw into trusses using a straw-bond, sold-on or ricked-up. The husks left to fall onto the ground, although: the very action of the belts driving the action, the spinning drum, and conveyor, tended to blow the husks out, making a cloud of irritating, itching-making husks, mask the whole operation – covering everything. From removal of the corn from the ear, to grinding at the mill, as much husk was removed as possible -  winnowing, by using draughts of air - by blower or fan… The threshed straw went to build the rick. This straw would be animal feed for the winter and cut out of the rick by the ‘fogger’ using very long and broad hay-knives to cut away a truss, which was then bound and carried to the field. Un-used ricks, which were surplus, broken down and spread on fields - to be ploughed-in or cut-up to make manure heaps. Ricks could be either round or square-sided, with or without end hips. They were built mostly in the rick-yard reasonably close to where the animals were to be fed – near to the chickens - to nest, feed and lay. If likely to be infested with vermin the rick would be built on staddle stones [mushroom shaped stone or iron to prevent vermin from getting into the ricks] - if not, a base of bundles of brushwood laid to allow air to circulate - kept the straw or hay off the ground to prevent rotting. Once the rick built up, the top was thatched.

At the turn of the century, this would cost the farmer 2s for five hours work. At the same time the ricks were being built, the swedes and mangles were being made into heaps [clamps] and covered with straw and earth to keep off the frosts. Potato clamps were specifically for humans although if sufficient, at the end of the season, they would also be fed to the pigs. Both these root crops were used as winter-feed for the cattle. In the winter, cattle food was not just thrown on the ground but placed in large wooden troughs and hayracks. The carter’s stockmen and shepherds were expected to administer to their animals when they were ill. Old remedies were used perfected over the ages to cure swine fever, foot and mouth disease, and foot rot. Antiphlegestin, Stockholm tar and castor oil, were all popular medicants. The only animals to be kept in close confinement were pigs. In some farms, they were allowed to feed off the apples in the orchards or in small fields to graze the acorns. Very often, particularly for hops and soft fruit, town’s folk would descend on the farms to do casual work – staying in purpose built wooden huts. They considered this not only a method to earn a little extra but as a holiday too. It was usually an expected and organized event at harvest time and the same families met up every year taking in turn to look after the children. The huts were provided with cooking facilities and a communal sink and latrines.

After the harvest had been gathered in and the festival blessed in the church, the village held its thanksgiving. In times past this was known as ‘The Revels’, but Puritanism soon put a stop to all that. Now the village fete and garden show took its place. They still draw the inhabitant together: for the children to run wild and the merry-go-round to spin - by the efforts of the showman and his cranking handle. There were country dancing, races and hoopla, ducking apples… and the maypole to be laced – danced round. However trivial it may seem, it was planned for, looked forward to, and continually remembered. A demand was now made on Bradford’s warehouse for coulters, ploughshares and dung forks, as the crops were cleared from the fields. Dung was tipped in piles across the fields and old ricks broken up and interspersed too, ready for ploughing. It was the time for the stable hands to start repairing the harnesses and to put right all those faults with the carts and wagons.

The morning started bright and clear. It was the most perfect September day, the sky was cloudless, the only sounds disturbing the peace was the cooing of the wood pigeons, and the squabbling of the rooks high in the trees overhead. Not far away a stag rears on its hind legs to knock some more acorns off the lower branches of the oak… a shaft of sunlight through the branches lights-up a peacock butterfly - which settled for a moment before continuing its erratic journey. On one of the top branches, a kestrel swivels his head - to left and to right, surveying his kingdom…

The wet grass from an overnight shower sparkles and thousands of small cobwebs glisten from tiny water droplets that shimmer in the sun. Gradually the morning mist lifts from the ground as the sun warms the air… piles of newly dug soil advertise the underground run of a mole. Autumn has begun, we put aside all thoughts of how well Somerset is doing in the cricket league… the football season is upon us. The countryside now changes. The sun is still hot but comes to us lower in the sky. September kicks in with a sudden chill makes one reach for the jumper. The ground begins to show the first scatterings of fallen leaves. They are in a variety of browns, reds and oranges blowing about the ruts, rustling and chattering as they pile up. The dewy grass, covered with early morning webs, soak my shoes that are not waterproof - giving me wet socks again… The acorns and fallen twiglets crunch underfoot. The humming and squawking wildlife quietens as day by day their food becomes more difficult to find… finally the blackbird and song thrush leave for warmer climes…

Tomatoes are starting to ripen outside as well as the blackberry and autumn delight raspberries, the potatoes, onions, beans and marrows become staple diet. The weeds keep coming… it is a full-time job to keep on top of their growth. The pears and apples on the trees behind the privy are picked as they become ready. Those not eaten are wrapped in newspaper and stored on trays in the outhouse.

The local thatcher lays out his unthrashed wheat straw… gathers and ties them, in handy bundles. On wet days, he whittles his pegs, sharpens his scissors and prepares for the next fine day. His first job on Monday morning is the cottage in Perry Street, by Crossways Corner. It is there that he places his very long ladders – in readiness, carting and stacking his prepared bundles for an early morning start. He not only works for the farmer repairing barns, haylofts and making ricks but also re-thatched and replaced roof ridges in the village.
 
The fields, in the first half of the twentieth century, the banks, and ditches, all presented an enormous variety of plant life compared to today's selection. There were trees of fruit, nut and thorn, varieties of bush rose, vetch, yarrow, knapweed and birdsfoot. The ditches were deeper and damper, with grass more lush and succulent. Insect life not only of greater variety but larger: dragonflies, stag beetles, butterflies, moths, glow-worms, snakes, lizards, toads, frogs and crickets. Birds too would be more numerous. In fact, the whole flora and fauna would be almost unrecognisable by the profusion of differing types and species, especially the winged insect variety.

As September led into October… the cabbages displayed frayed edges as the white butterfly’s caterpillar nibble away - gradually reducing the leaves to skeletons, a number lay across the leaves producing a crosshatched colouration of yellow and black. Some of the cabbages have their hearts completely destroyed – going mouldy and black. There is no time to be sentimental the caterpillars have to be removed – pinched out. By now the beans are stringy and the marrows hard. Digging in earnest… preparing the ground to sow the spring cabbage must be concluded… All the old decaying crops removed to the compost heap. The time for sowing the broad beans, that are going to stand the winter, will have to be sown - to give the New Year a good start.

The compost heap was broken into and manure from the yard made up the load to spread upon the stubble. Now is the time to start pulling and cutting the tops off the cattle-beet… followed by the autumn ploughing and the planting of beans… Immediately drilling the winter wheat, the horse teams are prepared in advance, putting at least a two-horse drill on the light soils. The mangels could now be collected up and carted off to the clamp - which lay beside the potatoes. 
Autumn is well under way. October starts cold and damp. The early morning mist lies late into the morning giving the fields a ghostly presence. The river is clear and low and the banks encroach – the luxuriant grass weighed down by water droplets sags dipping their heads into the water… the water reflects the growth making the width of the stream appear even smaller. Lower down a pair of swans go through their bonding ritual ducking their heads then reaching up until finally they touch one another. 
    
The thick hedges provided not only a field boundary but also give new material for future hedge and fence, shelter for the farm animals and birds, and provide a byway for wild creatures – to pass from field to field. The hedgerows at the side of the lanes would not be cut, becoming, in some cases, interlinked over the middle of the road forming a tunnel - which shut out the daylight. In the evening or winter nights these lanes were frightening places for us children; the trunks began to form faces and the long tendrils of the branches looked like arms ready grab any unfortunate passer-by. The glow-worms light twinkled in the dark, dank ditches and lane sides, whilst the bats flitted above on their set course to the nearest food. The hooting owls and barking foxes gave a sinister background to the shadowy undergrowth…  The hedge banks and ditches were ancient boundaries of tracks running from hamlet to village, from village to town… a source of wonderment at the diversity of wildlife, a fascination at the beauty of the leaf and branch - forming a varied, colourful picture.

The ditches became flooded every year. Tall rushes, herbs and reed, shoot up, at the expense of smaller, less vigorous plants, when the ditches are lush and green – it is impossible to see the bottom of the ditch and quite difficult to extract oneself - if clumsy enough to fall in! In early November, the wind penetrated the stoutest coat. The skies washed out and threatening. The rooks were buffeted, being blown off course, having to make an extra effort to regain their perch. They complained creating a tremendous racket. When they took off to find food, they swept over the fields in gigantic swoops soaring upwards to gain height and then down again almost plunging into the ground. They seemed to keep this up for hours, almost as if they were at play…

Halfway through the month, the better weather arrived and a walk by the brook revealed a wider streambed - now that the dead and dying vegetation had rotted and fallen away. The trees were beginning to look bare - half their leaves had fallen. The reeds with their yellow stems and black rotting heads were flattened by the wind - lay in the water, the fallen leaves clogging their matted remains.The warm weather never lasts long for the rain settles in again, turning the roads into glistening rivers of black ink, gurgling down the drain which leads to the river. Now the mornings were frosty, quickly thawing out to leave just the shady areas icy on dead leaves and limp grass. The river changed again now reflecting browns and ochre’s. It is going to stay that way for some time to come… Back at the cottage, work continued... the war had not changed the routines of life one jot. The butter factory, near Chilson Common, took over the mantle of chief employer after the net making industry had suffered yet another poor year. 

The early mornings were crisp, the frost glistening on the roads. The forecast is two days of rain and sleet followed by strong winds. The river is high and unusually brown from mud washed down stream. Last weeks rain has made the current strong as the water rushes over the stones swept down from higher ground. Once again, the moles have been active on the grassy bank every so often the brown earth thrown up into soft crumbly piles. Out of all the greenery, left by the winter’s blast, the ivy remains bright and vibrant. The flowers of pale-yellow populate the tops and by the end of December the berries will be very dark green. Also looking strong, but not as colourful, is the holly with its many bunches of bright red berries - declaring a hard winter… Should look a picture when pinned to the beams in the sitting room, along with the mistletoe, from the oak in yonder field. There is just time for grandad to plant the shallots… before he sits down to the main meal of the day. Then off with his sons to the Poppe Inn… known before 1927, as the Country Hotel,the local meeting place for most of the local village men folk… this is where they played darts, shove-halfpenny and dominoes, until about ten, when they returned home to sit by the fire, play cards or relate the local gossip to grandma.

After Christmas, when all the festivities were over, the farm-workers tried to keep indoors, or at least stayed close to the barns where the seed-barley could be thrashed. On dry days, the broken fences and gates could be repaired or the stack-yard swept. There was always something to do even in the foulest weather to keep the men busy. At Rosalie Cottage, life got back to normality after the Christmas jollities. Other than during the winter the cottage door was left open – guarded by a large, cast iron dog. Step over the threshold onto the thick stone step, which spans the width of the door; take the cambered sandstone brick path through the gate onto the road beyond… Turning right, start up the hill; a few paces more and there, on the left… some steps, with a neat set of iron railings supporting a handrail which lead to a gothic door. The school entrance stands impressively tall. Its an official building… surmounted by the bell tower… the autumn term was ending - another year almost over… The children are practicing their carols; ‘The Holly and the Ivy’ filters out - in time with the piano… Another cold day - the third week in December – the last week of term. The sun shines weakly as it tries to penetrate the moisture-laden air. Nobody dallies, head down, they move quickly to get inside out of the cold. There, the fire blazes up, casting a warm, flickering  light, against the brass warming pan… the paraffin lamp is already lit, the smell of the oil another part of my memory bank… gives light, as well as comfort.

On the beams in the living room the pinned holly and mistletoe remained. The painted and crayoned cards still lurked behind the clock and candleholders. The table is set again as grandma bustles about cutting the bread ready for the evening meal… Life in the village changed little. This was the quietest time, it was as if everything waiting for warmth to strike flesh or ground. Inside the cottage the fire crackled in the hearth and the clock strikes midday. The wind and rain of January has passed to clear cold days of February. The farmer over the hedge has started drilling the spring beans and peas. In a few weeks time the oats and barley would have to go through the same procedure. In the village school the children stayed in during their break times, the cold penetrated up from the floor making their toes as cold as ice. The coke fire did little to keep the cold at bay…

Tatworth was not a normal rural village. The lace mill, butter factory and railway junction made it more isolated from the affects of low farm prices - than an economy solely reliant upon what could be produced from the land. The offshoots to all three plus the corn mill at Forton gave it strength to resist unemployment. Even when there were hard times for lace, production one or other of the employers would came to the rescue, plus the largest landowners like Parrocks Lodge and Forde Abbey. This relative isolationism was reflected in the population’s view of the outside world’s troubles, as being a hindrance to the perpetuation of all that was good and normal. Life, like the language, was slow and ordered, in pace with the seasons. Within all his rural activity, the creative industries fed off the large manufacturers circulating wealth and jobs. This circular life in Tatworth, where all benefited from this mechanism - each part fed off the other, maintained the coherence of the complete social group.

Village schools in the eighteen hundreds had their teaching practice based upon learning by rote… in classrooms holding a number of other age groups. In most schools, there was only one large room, which was cold, damp and dusty. Religious bodies… mainly the Anglican National Society established in 1811, controlled the institutions. Church schools greatly outnumbered voluntary organization. All schooling required fees supplemented by donations and government grants. ‘The Education of the Poor’, such as it was, was ministered by the church – by the Church of England’s National Society. At this time, there was no Government provision or legal requirement. The provision of a school was dependant upon patronage and beneficence of the Rector of Chard Church… plus, bequests and subscriptions. Only five years before A Parliamentary Act banned the use of child labour although it did carry on for a few more years.In 1837, Victoria came to the throne one year after the Union workhouse was built on the Crewkerne Road. A further two years saw 243 people sheltered there from the town and borough. Out-relief was a fund raised to help the unemployed… that year a sum of seventeen hundred pounds was allocated for that cause.

The start of the century had seen harvests ruined by bad weather and the lead up to the coronation was to see little improvement. William IV had been on the throne for seven years… now it was the chance to turn round the economy. Victoria was eighteen and she was made of sterner stuff. One the continent, 1830 was a year of revolution. England was up in arms serious rioting broke out. Farm machinery was smashed, ricks set on fire and fists were raised. The rain in 1828 had been the worst in living memory and agricultural prices dropped. During the next ten years farmers’ begged for a reduction in their rent's – a few had to sell up and move away to the town. The lord of the manor, in a number of estates, gave land over to the community for allotments. It was a bad time for all, particularly for the already poor. There was much unemployment, for neither farmers nor workshops were taking on labour. The poorhouse in the town had to turn people away. The Mayor of Chard called a meeting where he put it to the assembled parishioners that the severe weather was creating hardship. It was decided to make donations and a collection was immediately taken – which raised £60. The plan was to purchase coal, bacon and peas and share those out to six hundred poor persons.

The social gap was widening as the inefficient and uneconomic farmer sold up and the wealthy tenant and lord increased their holding. Landowners had benefited from the purchase of low price land. The industrialisation of manufacturing brought to a head the scandal of child labour. By 1844, the employment of any child below the age of eight, in the textile industry, was banned. Between eight and thirteen, the child had to attend school for three hours a day. Many parents evaded the restrictions where they could. Textile workers opposed the raising of the minimum working age of half-timers. Lace schools were set up to teach children to read. The commissioners later tested the children to find out what had been learnt. The results proved that although the children could read the majority could not write.

The Union workhouse was still a necessary. Inmates were issued with a hammock although it would appear that these were not in a very good condition. An issue of string gave some comfort to repair the netting and to ensure the hammock hung properly. Two rugs made by previous inmates were all that were allowed for each person. There were complaints about not being able to wash and the violent disturbances resulted in two months hard labour, in the House of Correction.

It was the large acreage now of the thrusting landowners that allowed them to survive the hard times, after the act of enclosure. Once again, the Pouletts gained most. By 1865 horse-powered threshing machines had been installed, improved land drainage continued, whilst fields redesigned both assisted hay farming to reach its peak by the end of the century.In 1866 J B Gifford, who owned and foundered a lace manufacturing business at Forton - then moved to Holyrood Mill, forming Gifford Fox &amp; Company, who were approached to finance and provide premises for a Co-op. This they did with the additional loan of £15. This proved to be a very successful enterprise although it did not stay at the mill but moved to Fore Street under the title of Chard Industrial &amp; Provident Society. The shop’s staff was in the main local people. To them came Thomas Dolling as a twelve-year-old errand boy in the year 1879. He was a Chard Board pupil who was not only accomplished at schoolwork but also diligent in the shop. Within twenty years, he had risen to become the head of the Co-op. For the next forty years he stayed and directed the operation taking it to great heights.

Tatworth boasted the building and consecration, of a daughter-church to St Mary’s of Chard. This became the Mission Chapel of Tatworth, in September, 1851, [at that time, still considered a hamlet].  When built it was consecrated by the Bishop of Jamaica – the foundation stone being laid three months before, in June, with much approbation.. The chapel, built on a quarter of an acre of land, had been donated by the lord of the manor, Earl Poulett, together with the necessary stone, and fifty pounds towards the total cost of one thousand and forty pounds. All previous churchgoers from Tatworth had to walk three miles to attended St Mary’s Church, Chard. When the poor arrived the church was short of seating – even as far back as 1827. Years later a gallery had been erected, but still the church lacked sufficient accommodation. Many worshippers attended St Margaret’s Chapel of Ease in South Chard rather than face the walk and the possibility of not having a seat.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello world -- wow, I've only recently discovered Wikibooks, and found that it's quite a resource! (Aug 2010). I appreciate all the work its authors/editors/admins have put into it.

I am now working through the book, ''Blender 3D: Noob to Pro''. It's quite well put-together. I find the online pages easier to read than the downloadable PDF version. However, in the online version, I have yet to find a ''specific'' page with a &quot;sequential&quot; TOC, that we can expand into subsections. Since it's a tutorial whose topics are presented in a meaningfully sequential manner, a master TOC page would be a godsend. (otoh, maybe I'll find this page in the next 5 minutes -- apologies in advance......)--[[User:Mike410books|Mike410books]] ([[User talk:Mike410books|talk]]) 22:11, 2 September 2010 (UTC)

      <comment>/* Extruding the Cone */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Adding the Curve modifier ==
Noob note: Whole tutorial worked fine and easy to follow, right up to the last step. I can't get it to deform to curve at all. :(

Noob2 note: Just the same with me. After adding the Curve modifier nothing happens.

Noob3 note: After I added a Curve modifier and pressed the &quot;Y&quot;,the cone MOVED ALONG the Curve, not bent to it.

Noob4 note: This happened for me too, it just means you're aligning the cone on the wrong axis. Try using one of the other five (it was the x button for me, not y). also make sure that the curve is aligned to an axis, don't goof off too much in 3d view when making the curve, stay in top/side/front view.

&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:Bezier_mod_Y.JPG|thumb|120px|left|Notice of the &quot;Y&quot; button pressed]] --&gt;

('''Wi_Tr Note:''' In order to obtain a deformation like the one shown above, be sure you've pressed the '''Y''' button located at the bottom row of ''Modifiers'' tab. This seems to inhibit deformations through the selected axis).

Noob5 (6 months training anyway) I found the X axis button on the modifier must be pushed to display the cone like shown. 

Noob6: Make sure the surface of the cone has many faces as well - if you just extruded the cone tip like I did the cone will not twist at all but only follow the path. I ended up extruding the tip out some ways and then subdividing the cone a few times in addition to setting x as the axis of deformation. It worked then.

Noob7: If you can not get it to work select your curve and look in the lower left under links and materials. You must find the ''real'' name of your curve, mine said &quot;Curve.001&quot; the .001 is important it will not work without the entire name.

Thanks for the fix... somehow that got left out! *smacks forehead into desk* Apologies... chalk it up to a newbie tutorial writer. I think it's fixed now... [[User:Embri|Embri]] ([[User talk:Embri|talk]])

== Extruding the Cone ==

another reader: I found that it works to make a cylinder, '''Ctrl+R''' it into 10-ish segments, then select the circle of vertices on the top (use the '''B''' key, preferably). Press '''S''', use the wheel to increase the selection radius to include almost the entire cylinder, and scale them to 0 (make sure the pivot is set to ''&quot;Individual Centers&quot;'' - that's close to the middle of the 3D View window header). This should squeeze the top of the cylinder into a cone and compress the segments below it by smaller degrees. The segments won't be of the same height, but the idea's the same. At least it's easier than extruding and scaling ten times.

reader note: I can't loop cut a cone (in Blender 2.48 - don't actually know why), as an alternative you can select all the edges that start from the tip of the cone (be sure to be in edge select mode) and subdivide/subdivide multi

reader 2: I found a much easier way to get the cone ready for the curve was to create the cone initially with a depth of 20, then do a knife multi-cut (k, multicut, 10).  No extruding or scaling necessary.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">====Chapter VII: The early life of Elsie May====
Tatworth school was built in 1872, in the same Early English style as the church, built some twenty years before. These two institutions gave the village a new status: recognised as a separate community from Chard - to became a parish in its own right. Thirty-percent of the population was aged fourteen or less, and it was deemed highly desirable to have a local school. The new school was built of local flint stone with brick quoins around the windows and doors. Two gable ends faced the road, separated by two lean-to aisles and a front porch. Two sets of steps mount the pavement to meet at the arched wooden doors, which led into cloakrooms. Topping the whole was a bell tower, whose ringing bell called the children to school. 

The pupils were mainly from homes who’s parents worked at the mill or creamery - they all knew each other or knew of each other.  It was that sort of village school. Very few lived at a distance and most walked or rode a bike. Living opposite, gave the Collins children an even greater sense of belonging, not just to the school but to the community and to its inhabitants.

When the school day was over all the children came out in succession - the youngest first, making the otherwise deserted road alive with their shouts and calls. It was a happy place remembered fondly. They were all oddly dressed especially the younger ones. Their chatter was joyful if rather quaint not in the least embarrassed by their local patois. The boys in their caps and the girl’s hair tied up in ribbons skipping along in their pinafores. The majority would come from poor homes but that does not explain how they were brought up. The village was in the main a god-fearing place, its inhabitants Low Church, ridged in behaviour, and set in their ways.

The boys and girls who lived at the other side of the village - near the railway station, or Chardstock, used lane, path and short cut, to reach school. Along the way they could usually find some stick or special find to show-off with… betting each other that theirs the greater find, and couldn’t be bettered. It was the boys who liked to find a stick to make a bow or make-pretend sword, catapult or pipe. The girls, who kept well away from the nettles and briars, were the authority on what could be eaten safely or which leaf would make the better print. They chatted and giggled, keeping to their own little group, as they weaved their way past the cowpats refusing to take notice of the boys… by now, carving their name on the beech tree.

Their past-times, games, hobbies, and interests, are little different from those played generations before, or now. The boys kick a ball or tin and the girls skip, play catch or hopscotch – the same the world over. Their clothes less tattered today although fashions have changed slightly - but childish behaviour remains much the same… The bullies demand subservience and the meek consideration, the confident were heard, and the shy tried to hide. That, after all, is the way of the world!

The village was lucky having the mill and creamery, with all their ancillary trades, giving training and employment to its inhabitants. The Chard Road station and sidings, gave employers the means to import labour and transport goods. Both the warehousing sheds and ironmongers provided all those ancillary pieces of equipment necessary to support both these firms engineering shops.

Ten years before the school was built, education standards were linked to ‘student results’ – under the Revised Code. There was an annual examination, an attendance record level, religious instruction and needlework for the girls. Specific subject grants for grammar, history and geography, were brought into being in 1867, which  raised the number of subjects - giving a broader curriculum; these subject became ‘class’ subjects, eight years later. Shortly before, a number of other subjects were included: Latin, mathematics, science, modern languages and domestic economy – cookery and gardening. By the turn of the century, the curriculum as we know it, was in general use, and not long afterwards ‘payment by results’ ended. 

Child labour under eight was forbidden, six years later the employment of children on farms was not allowed [in a group less than ten] even though eight-year-old children could be employed, if they had attended school for 250 days during the preceding year. However, all the laws passed to regulate labour were widely evaded. The Elementary Education Act of 1870-73, compelled Chard authorities to ensure that there was adequate provision… to establish a Chard Board School. The cost of the board was met by local taxation. Church Aided Schools had to rely upon voluntary donations topped up by donations from the local gentry. The Board Schools provide national elementary education for over two million children. There was now a universal curriculum, which had to be followed. Secondary education did not have the same encompassing system until the School Boards tried to instil order. Eventually the Education Act of 1902, ensured the basis of all public education, and lasted until the Education Act was brought into being by Rab Butler in 1944.
        
My mother, started school at the age of four, in 1912. Academic standards in the Board Schools still did not rise sufficiently, even after the 1902 Act set out targets levels for Standards I and II. Standard I required an ability to read from a textbook, including words of more than one syllable: dictation, writing down a few common words, in a neat hand, the ability to add up, and subtract - not more than four figures, and the recitation of the multiplication table up to six. Many children did not reach even this low minimum standard and it is unfortunate that teachers resorted to harsh methods to improve their standards.

Village schools, at the turn of the twentieth century, laid great emphasis on the principles of Christian religion, morals, reading, writing, and the casting of accounts with beads. Some pupils went on to grammar schools. Girls were accepted into the village school but not allowed into the grammar. The grammar school’s curriculum consisted of Latin grammar and literature, history and geography - to some degree, and a little Greek... The scriptures were obligatory, so too arithmetics - mental and addition. Diction and manners were given special regard, along with National heroes. Marching, some games, and physical exercises, considered fitting in short measure. Boys attended six-days of the week and church on Sundays. Those parishioners who valued education – the ability to read and write and reckon, were usually those who could afford to do so without their child being ‘put to labour’, for as long as was necessary. Those folk were tradesmen, yeoman farmers, and lesser gentry. When the School Boards were put in place it was to those citizens – those unable to afford individual lessons by tutors and public schools, they were planning for. 

The School’s Inspectors - noticed in both town and country, the bad treatment of schoolchildren. The nation’s children were, from this time forward, going to be better educated. The ‘payment, of teachers, by results’ had disappeared by the time Elsie went to school. Although the children in Tatworth had the benefit of an education in a new school, operating a regulated curriculum, they still lacked the cultural benefits available to town children. Eight years before, the Board of Education defined elementary education as ‘forming and strengthening the character of children, and developing their intelligence’, assisting boys and girls to, ‘fit themselves for the work of life’. Girls were expected to be self-sacrificing, domesticated, and moral… boys, hard working, loyal, and brave, both boys and girls extolled as, ‘Children of the Empire. The Nation was proud of itself believing that there were, ‘further noble deeds to be done’, the Empire was supported throughout the country. Heads of rural schools not only maintained discipline within the school but were sometimes expected to control the behaviour of their charges outside as well. In many outlying hamlets, sending older children to school was looked on as 'wasted labour' by the poor.

When Elsie went to school in 1912, children were being given cocoa or some other warm drink for a 1d during the midday break. The local nurse still discovered ‘dirty heads’ during a school inspection, teachers were always taking care that when children scratched they were inspected for lice or flea bites. Inferior meals at home caused some of the children to be undernourished. Giving free school meals afforded the school the opportunity to instil good manners and proper eating habits – to eat properly with a knife and fork. A full-time dentist travelled from school to school checking the children’s teeth. He carried out inspections whilst the children were sent out to play. Cheap spectacles were obtainable free of charge and instruction given about the correct way to clean one’s teeth. The health of the nation’s children had become a national issue and initiatives started to improve the general state of health, and other child welfare matters. The Rowntree Foundation highlighted the ‘serious physical deterioration amongst the poorer section of the community, in their 1901 publication. The First World War evened out the vast difference between children health, in good and bad areas, by government inspection. 
 
Every day began the same for all children. At the turn of the twentieth century, most working-class families expected their children to contribute to the running of the household. Tasks were learnt by following their parents round the home helping as they went. The boys took on the heavier work whilst the girls helped with the sewing and food preparation… water had to be bought from the stream... each day had its routine of household chores. All this work had to be done before going to school… It was expected that Elsie and her sisters helped their mother look after the chickens, fetch the eggs, and clean them out. The washing had to be mangled, hung out, turned, and then ironed, when dry. The vegetables gathered from the garden, washed and put away for the next meal. There was a half-time system at the mill; children over the age of ten could work limited hours, whilst receiving their education. This continued until after the First World War.

After the war, the troops were dismissed and returned home. They might have been informed by letter that the village had changed or they might have seen for themselves a few of these changes when they were sent home on leave. However, it was a different thing altogether when they had to face the changes day after day. Younger people were not content to put up with things that had gone on for centuries. They wanted to sample the so-called good living to be found in the towns and cities. Women too had seen for themselves their sex working on the land and others had gone to work in factories. The industrial age had started the decline. The First World War had carried the momentum further, shattering the old ways. Things were never to be the same again. It was not just the working class that had to adapt. The upper classes, particularly the large landowners lost their sons who were going to take over. Working arrangements at the mill continued, but not for long…!

Children still worked at the mill crawling under the looms, with bare feet to stop slipping, to retrieve the ends of broken threads. These ends had to be instantly repaired in very hot and damp conditions to quickly get the gliding jennies back into action again. They felt proud they were contributing to the family’s income as they felt the sixpence in their pockets. The children of farm workers also turned their hands to the work in the fields. Picking up stones, weeding the crops, and collecting potatoes. No child of the poor was allowed to get away from, ‘working for their keep’.
   
The bell on the roof tolled at 9am. It seemed very loud and the pigeons scattered at its sound… the noisiness of the children greeting friends subsided and the running around stilled… lines were formed outside the door and all waited for the teacher to admit them. No talking was allowed and each child allotted a seat - after the girls put on their pinnies. Any late comer received a black mark and this was entered in the term report. The roll was called when attendants were ticked off in red. All the Collins children went to this school – there was no escaping either the building or its influence – it stood before Rosalie Cottage and dominated the skyline!

Prayers and Hymns started the day - always the well-known favourites learnt by heart… just as the scholastic subjects were reinforced, by repeating them in rhyme - intoned in a singsong fashion. It was an unchanging ritual going back generations. Classes started at nine o-clock, and lasted until three thirty every day; these went on until she was fourteen. The school hall divided by a large curtain, which did not reach the top of the pitched roof, one side for the younger children and the other side for the older ones. The sun’s rays, finding a gap in the curtain, penetrating the dusty haze, created a spectrum on the opposite wall as they passed through the glass … normally drawn back for morning assembly and special occasions.

A trained certificated male assistant teacher received £100 per year; his female colleague received £10 less. Teacher training colleges insisted upon a strict religious calling for their student intake – they must be free from all faults. It was about moral ascendancy over literary knowledge. It was not always the case that properly trained teachers filled the vacancies. Acting teachers, who were usually the brightest girls in their final year, were preferred – heads considered that they understood their jobs better and had an empathy with their charges. Elementary teachers were, ‘uncultivated and imperfectly educated’, commented one Chief Inspector. It was not unusual for the local squire or magistrate to require schoolteachers to attend Sunday school, play the piano, and organize out of school educational trips, without payment...

The first and second year children followed the seasons with calendar records noting when the first snowdrop showed itself, when the first cuckoo called, and the first swallow flew. The class would be given the task of drawing these and the best ones displayed on the wall. 

All the younger children and newcomers used slates and squeaky slate pencils and approved lessons like English and arithmetic checked by the local authority. Scripture was compulsory for all and once a week the vicar would come to talk about moral behaviour - told in the form of a story. Country children were taught to observe and appreciate the countryside and local history sometimes by a village elder. When the class was considered capable, they were given lead pencils and told to copy letters of the alphabet and words from cardboard specimens. The next stage, after obtaining the correct standard - exercise books with faint green lines were passed out, was to copy off the blackboard simple sentences, this carried them to the next stage, linking sentences together to make a paragraph.

After the two years, the class graduated to the use of pen and ink. Every day the ink monitor would pass out the filled china inkwells placing them in the drilled holes at the top of each desk. It was found difficult to control the ink at first or even to make the pen work at all. The nibs had to be clean and the points not splayed out or crossed - by too much pressure – if so a new one was issued from the store cupboard. Blots and smudges appeared as if by magic. Sleeves and hair sometimes got in the way. But these hurdles were soon overcome and the class settled down to perfect their copper plate hand writing – less pressure on the pen for up strokes and a firmer pressure on the way down. There was always a controversy whether strokes down should follow directly on top of those going up instead of making a loop.

It was consider important by school authorities that ‘drill’ superseded random gymnastics.  The class was told to march swinging their arms forward with the opposite leg – in military fashion. All the arm and leg movements were to be done in correct order - following an accepted pattern – so that each exercises known in advance. Every muscle had an approved exercise and running strictly regulated. If the day were particularly cold then: marching, swinging the arms, hopping and coordinated exercises proceded in turn - the class all following round and round folding and unfolding like a snake. There was never enough space for games, and no equipment if there were. Once a year there was sports day, when all the classes did their exercises before their parents. There were three-legged races, egg and spoon and sack races, throwing the beanbag and catching the ball. All the children had to bring an enamel mug to school so that lemonade could be served out. There were iced and currant buns, provided by the school authorities. Prizes won and achievements recognised, usually in the form of a book with an inscribed insert.

Music lessons consisted of practising singing the National Anthem, the national songs of each country making up Britain, popular patriotic songs and folk songs. This involved much practice, which was taught using the tonic sol-fah system, using a tuning fork to start on the right note.

The whole school marched into the playground to salute the flag and sing all the songs practised…. on Trafalgar Day - with an emphasis on why it was so important to have a navy to protect the country, its Empire, and its trade. After the First World War, Armistice Day was observed when once again the whole school assembled to salute the flag and observe the two minutes silence with the flag at half-mast. National and Saint Days celebrated - Flying the Union Jack and the flag of St George a prerequisite for all organizations and groups. Empire Day considered the most important national event next to the Kings birthday. Patriotic songs sang and tales of daring do – exploration, discovery and invention, read aloud and cheered. All these national events were celebrated during the Sunday church service, which following on from where the school left off.   

My mother and her class were taken for country walks where the names of plants and trees were written down and the local wild-life pointed out. Collections of grasses, leaves, butterflies and other insects mounted and named. Records of when certain things happened throughout the year were copied down and older children made their own sketchbooks, which were initialled and coloured up. Prizes were presented in the hall at the end of each year, these, once again were mainly books.

There were three teachers taking different groups called standards. Infants were taught to knit dishcloths and to patch holes and darn. Elementary dressmaking, buttonhole stitching and pleating was also taught. Reading was considered especially important and frequently checked by the School Inspector.  The quality of writing - using correct English grammar, neatly set out on the page a necessity:  Geography, History, and Nature Studies, Needlework, Cooking and Gardening, all given attention.

Most girl pupils had long hair, plaits or ponytails [on leaving school hair was ‘put up’ either in a bun or braids round the head or draped either side below the ears]. Where possible in large families most of the clothes would be hand-me-downs. If these were not available, they were purchased at ‘bring and buy sales’ or made by mothers, except shoes and hats. Generally, the dresses were of checked gingham, knitted socks, and cotton knickers. Winter wear usually navy skirt attached to a bodice, with hand-knitted jumper, knee high socks, brown lace-up shoes, knitted woollen vest, a liberty bodice buttoned down the front, and an assortment of other buttons to hold up suspenders and knickers. In extremely cold weather, fleecy knickers were worn with a pocket for a handkerchief.

Nothing was ever wasted in the clothing line. Discarded clothes were: cut down, shortened, taken up, patched, darned, or cut into squares - for rag rugs. Worn sheets turned side to middle or made into pillowcases. Worn pillowcases became handkerchiefs, liners or tea towels. There was no end to the amount of make do and mend necessary to look after a large family. All families had a rag bag the contents useful for repairs or making up patchwork quilts and mats.
  
The only outside building was the coal shed and a row of lavatories in the playground. They contained a wooden seat over a bucket that was emptied each week by the school caretaker, who also provided the torn-up newspapers on a string!

There were lessons on Health &amp; Hygiene – the importance of washing hair emphasised, as were: brushing teeth, cutting nails, and what was good to eat. The importance of bathing; the girls were taught how to look after babies. However, there were no lessons on sex. Girls were instructed on how to look after and run a home and this was linked to sewing - the make-up of curtains and covers. Boys were instructed how to dig, why to dig and how to plant out vegetables, and run a greenhouse. There were talks on how to avoid common ailments by a local nurse who cautioned about practising old country remedies, dispelling superstitions, and tales of false beliefs - especially about the menstruation period. Some children smelled strongly and no one wanted to share a desk with them… much of the nurse’s talk was trying to make children aware without spelling out the truth. Children sometimes wore underwear all the year through, never taking them off.   

There was neither school milk nor lunches – sandwiches were eaten at the lunch break… there was always water from the tap in the playground. The eldest children did not finish until three-forty-five to give the infants and their mother’s time to clear the front entrance. Those children who had an elder brother or sister, to take then home, had to wait inside. 

The rooms were well lit because there were such large windows set into the gable ends. In winter, it was always cold due to the high ceilings. Two large round stoves heated both ends of the room. However much the stoves were stoked it was never sufficient to heat the corners. The floor was bare boards, which gave off clouds of dust whenever there was any movement, particularly during  the morning assembly, and for the dancing class. 

Infants were taught to knit with two needles and then four. Darning, using a wooden mushroom, how to turn, hem and take-up and gather in, how to sew on buttons, make floor cloths and cover buttons and taught fraying out – removing each separate thread from a patch of material and un-picking – unravelling an old woollen garment, were methods used to provide material to make-up new. Sewing bags made and each girl’s initials graced the sides – these were end of first term tests and used by the teachers to keep one class quiet whilst the other in the room carried on with their reading and writing. Material was supplied by the council – always-white cotton. From this articles of clothing were made, pillowcases and nighties. Patterns had to be traced, suitable for the child’s size. There was a communal box of thimbles, needles and thread. Embroidery with coloured wool made simple samplers. 

A school inspector of the day noted that a number of children had died through diphtheria. The winter always brought the usual bout of illnesses: whooping cough, mumps, chicken pox, scarlatina, diphtheria, scarlet fever, colds and influenza. The Schools Medical Officer had to be notified especially in an outbreak. These problems affected the standard of education. Special lessons were arranged for children to catch up with lost lessons. Regular attendances by the Doctor and Nurse, to inspect for infections and general cleanliness.If there were, the parents were visited to check that action had been taken... Heads were examined by the Nurse, for nits, and general health. Proper clothing and shoes for winter wear identified, reported and logged. There were no aspirins or cold remedies. Antibiotics had not long beern discovered. Infections were easily spread by contact. In the early twenties, there was a national epidemic of mumps and influensa.

The senior classes had to fill in nature notebooks mostly by personal observation, making sketches and writing explanatory notes. It was encouraged that everyone should be observant and knows what to look for when each season arrived. Poetry was used to promote a good memory. Popular writers of the day discussed and passages read out. On Speech Days, prizes would be distributed for every subject. As with national songs, poems and noted authors - these works committed to heart - to the extent that they could be remembered all through one’s life. In rural areas, in the early twentieth century, most children left school at twelve, to start work. The Education Act of 1918 raised the age to fourteen. The School’s Inspector noted, ‘that arithmetic was not a strong subject but that the discipline was good and the children attentive to their lessons’.

In the early afternoons, before the youngest children pored out of the main school doors, shouting and screaming, their mothers had done the shopping and made courtesy calls... pushing their coach-built, second-hand, much used prams, containing the latest addition. It was a time relished by the mothers knowing their peaceful existence about to be extinguished when their little ones came out of school. They remembered their time in the same school, sometimes even the same teachers. The layout of the schoolrooms recalled - the smells and sounds the same. There were brothers, sisters, cousins, and even more distant relations, mingling with friends, made many years before, all doing the same lessons, in the same manner.

After school my mother roamed the woods and fields with her sisters and brothers in search of birds’ nests and ‘fruits of the hedge’ to take home and present to their mother which might stop her complaining about their torn clothes. She was strict which was necessary considering that at thirty-seven she had eleven children to look after. Her life was a constant endeavour to make ends meet. Gentle, devoted and strong willed, worshipping respectability and constancy. The children played hide-and-seek and Red Indians leaping the streams, climbing the trees, collecting bluebells in the wood and constructing bows and arrows. Mum would be wearing her pinny and hair in ribbons, her brothers, corduroy knee breeches and a jersey. They would search the hedges for suitable sticks to make into pipes, whistles, catapults and peashooters, spud and pop guns, bows and arrows, lances, swords and daggers. The vibrating blade of grass - held between thumbs, made a whistling noise when air blown through… Owl hoots, produced in the same way, but without the grass… betting each other, they could whistle louder or longer... Children still trundled their hoops, bowled marbles – tip-cat'd and skipped; drew hop-scotch chalk lines, spun tops and constructed ‘cats cradles’… Girls played their singing games - joined hands and skipped… here we go gathering ‘Nuts in May’; Jenny Jones visited, Orange and Lemons chopped off heads, and What’s the time Mr Wolf - tempted giant paces… The Big Ship Sails, and The Farmer wants a Wife, gave everyone a chance. Throwing a ball against the school wall, clapping hands, whilst spinning round, sevens, or swapping marbles, or cigarette cards, were all games played at school. Conkers were strung in the autumn and daisies threaded in spring.

All the children in the village went to Sunday school, whose numbers had been built up since the chapel had been erected, thus enabling a choir of boys and young men to be formed - the Morning Service, followed on after the school. The choir was used, as a means of teaching basic music to the children - would make them keener to continue attending. Occasionally there would be special services for a christening, saint’s day or Mothering Sunday. The annual Empire Day was celebrated using paper hats previously painted in the Union Jack colours. Patriotic songs were sung - stories of daring-do – Cecil Rhodes and Captain Cook, atlases perused for its pink areas and places of British influence. It was a day for rejoicing and celebration, greatly looked forward-to. The organist who doubled as the choirmaster religiously stuck to the few Hymns, Ancient and Modern, which were well known and practiced. It was a way of ensuring that there would not be any embarrassing silences of mumbled verses. The church brought together all the various elements of the population cementing the community together. Whether the day wet or fine… the music of the choir, gave the stark interior a softer touch.

In the winter, the cold seemed to be far more intense. Clothing was not so efficient at keeping the cold out and often children had chapped hands and legs. Some cried, when their hands started to thaw out, whilst standing round the coke brazier. Many of the children reached school having to stumble over rutted ground and frozen field still wearing ordinary shoes worn by much use – usually from being passed on from older brothers and sisters. Sometimes the soles would be so thin that studs and blakies would not hold in to the leather. Fortunately, the Collins children lived opposite the school did not suffer these setbacks. This was one of the positive aspects to having the school so near!

My mother told us that her reading was done mostly in bed by the light of a candle. During the evening, before going to bed, time would be filled by knitting in front of the fire, resting her feet on the logs, set before the fire. Her sisters would embroider, make spills – rolling up strips of newspaper, make dolls’ clothes and Christmas presents: kettle or iron holders, gloves, pin-cushions, handkerchief sachets, lavender bags, padded coat hangers, peg bags and tray cloths – many of these would be crocheted or contain crocheted borders. French knitting, using a cotton reel with looped wool over pins, made a long cord that could be tacked in the round to make mats. A useful present could be made from sewing mothballs in red silk… providing leaves, cut out of thick felt, to represent holly, a hanging loop of platted wool would ward off moths in the wardrobe. Dishcloths were knitted from heavy cotton yarn, face flannels from old cut down towels, old dresses made aprons, rag rugs, patchwork quilts and sacking doormats. Cardboard cutouts were decorated with coloured paper stuck on with flour paste to make theatre sets were some of the pastimes, which contributed towards passing long winter evenings. Her brothers designed poker work using red hot skewers spliced onto a wooden handle, cut jig saws out of pictures pasted on boards, and interlaced wooden spills to make mats.

Along with the harvest revels, Christmas Day and Boxing Day were the other two great occasions for the whole family. Both these were holidays celebrated by everyone, although the animals still had to be looked after. Holly and mistletoe – the only decorations, were draped across the tops of pictures and laid across the ceiling beams. Carols were sung, everyone singing one verse on their own, party games enjoyed and simple presents unwrapped. The children went to church three times on Christmas Day and on each occasion they enjoyed a special meal, the highlight of the day's events, the afternoon meal served with parsnip wine for the elders. The church choir did the rounds and the children knocked on doors after singing a carol. Neither, New Year's Eve, or the following day, were marked by celebration.

      <text xml:space="preserve">====Chapter VIII: Elsie and the world of work====

Amongst the children who left school, in the twenties, there were few who went on to higher education. Some of the girls took up nursing or teaching - the only two positions which required training for girls. Those who were to become pupil-teachers could stay on at school to teach the youngest children and pick up some of the skills necessary for teaching. Trainee nurses might be taken on in hospitals if they were near enough. Both positions were underpaid receiving less than the lowest paid worker. Women teachers, and nurses in training, could not get married, having to leave if they did so.

If a bright thirteen year old, from a lower-middle class family, residing in the country – father perhaps a self employed artisan with a flourishing business employing others; the track to become a teacher would be as a class monitor, to an uncertificated teacher, teaching the first induction class of about fifty children. If he/she proved capable, offered a formal indenture - as a pupil-teacher. The first hour of every day was put aside for instruction… you would be also expected to take an annual examination for each of the five year apprenticeship course when you then proceeded to a teacher training college - to take a two-year course. After 1903, the starting age for apprenticeships was sixteen and paid £2 per annum. Their title was pupil-teacher in a four-year course. It is clear that a national scheme was still a long way off. The observance of one scheme rather than another depended on the local authority - whether it was at a board school or attached to a religious body.

There were no unions or tribunals working arrangements were strictly adhered to. Pupil Teachers had to attend county classes twice a week This continued until the Second World War had been underway for a couple of years. Then the emergency of all out war made such rules irrelevant. The training for both skills took until the pupil was eighteen - then earning about £1.16p per month One pound usually went back home to mother and the rest on lodging and keep, leaving very little left; then a college course undertaken for full training.

The County Council paid any travelling expenses – this was the only grant. Books had to be bought and college fees had to be paid – by the parents. An oath had to be taken by Pupil Teachers that they would not work out of the county for two years after qualifying. It also meant that the now trained teacher could not get married until after that period had been completed.

Some children were bright enough to sit for a scholarship examination when eleven – and then go to a grammar school. However, there were so few places that extra cramming had to be contemplated. School uniform, books, sports equipment and satchel all had to be bought, and the fares paid for train or bus. It was quite impossible for workers children to think of such treatment.

If the boy was to go into ‘trade’, he too had to think of an apprenticeship. There were no such schemes for girls until the late seventies. An employer had to be found to take on a lad and there were many who wanted the chance. Most trades took five years - to become full trained, others took seven. The parents had to pay the employer a fee for the privilege - which might be several hundred pounds. The often meant that the boy had to leave the village and find lodgings. At the end of his apprenticeship, he would have his ‘papers’ stating that he was full qualified. He was then likely to be taken on as an ‘improver’ at the lowest paid rate, for at least the first three months; by which time the employer would be in a better place to judge whether to take on the worker. If taken on, it would take several years to be accepted as a fully trained worker, then, and only then, would he receive the ‘going’ rate for the job - at the bottom rung of any ladder -  any layoffs, then he suffered the 'last in, first out' rule.

An alternative was to work on a farm – as a ‘lad’, to pick up the skills of a land worker - this maybe, looking after animals, helping repair walls, ditches and fences. Alternatively, as a carrier’s boy, delivering. Other employment could be found working for the local estate – park, garden or ‘in house’. Girls usually stayed at home under the watchful eye of mother – perhaps making lace, straw dollies or making garments. What is interesting is that women were more adventurous than men and that of those women it was the younger who opted for urban life – more often than not, to life in-service. It is clear from census figures that economic and social developments since the latter part of the nineteenth century have confirmed that women were attracted to town life… It only needed the stimulus of a shortage of men in the work place to attract women from the home. Each of the wars in the twentieth century has contributed to this trend. By the time the First World War was over women had seen a complete change in social cohesion. This was the start to the breaking up of class structures. The numbers of men killed and maimed, particularly the officer classes, was felt by the gentry who were looking forward to getting back to pre-war standards. Inheritance taxes completed the breakdown…

Girls from agricultural labourer’s families in their first job often only worked for their keep - so that they might receive training and eventually that much sought after reference. The turnover of servants was high the average time in a first job was three years. Positions for more skilled trades were found through the grapevine – the church, tradesmen, family or friends.

My mother started work, four years after the Great War finished, in 1922 - immediately on leaving school at the age of fourteen. Her father, aged fifty-two, was employed as an independent lace engineer at Small &amp; Tidmas net factory doing maintenance work. Elsie’s mother Rosa was looking after ten of her children at home. It is uncertain if they were all living together, but certainly seven were – which made Rosalie Cottage very cramped living indeed. The number of children conceived close together was normal for the working class and the lack of living space common for the poor. The obvious lack of family planning being the result of the absence of sex education, lack of discipline, and personal ambition... there was also a degree of, ‘conforming to general behaviour patterns’. Even though there was a national exodus to the cities and towns, there were still insufficient jobs and housing. In the 1920s, neither the Tatworth Parish Housing Scheme, at Wellings Close provided sufficient housing, nor did the Perry Street Factory cottages - mainly taken up by retired workers. This shortage mainly affected the growing population of young people with children. Money was short, jobs hard to come by, and even when they did, the choice was limited; everything had to be within cycle range.

It is not generally realized that between the end of the First World War and 1922, one quarter of the land in Britain changed hands. It was not appreciated at the time and has scarcely been written about after. It was not just one factor that brought this about... the great landowners were short of cash, and they were tired... tired of the responsibility, after so many of the owners, and their male progeny, had been killed - in the slaughter of WWI. It could have been put down to taxation, poor grain harvests, imported grain prices forcing down its profitability and the decline in the old tenant landlord system. It all came a head... the old ways could not continue. The aristocracy had let the country down, now it was the turn of the Trades Unions and the Labour Party. Surely, the workers could rely upon each other?  

In the twenties, most working-class families expected their children to contribute to the running of the household. Tasks were learnt by following their parents round the home helping as they went. The boys took on the heavier work whilst the girls helped with the sewing and food preparation… water had to be bought from the stream... each day had its routine of household chores. Even though Tatworth had two main employers that made the village more self sufficient for jobs at least forty per-cent of labour was connected to the land. Agricultural prices had been falling for six months and continued to fall. The price of wheat had halved in six months and the farmers, to combat this: shed workers, reduced prices, and reduced the acreage of cereal cultivation. It took ten years of struggle for the farming industry to recover and by 1932, the Wheat Act guaranteed prices and control mounted through Marketing Boards. 

Knowing that her daughter needed work her mother arranged for her son Cecil, to introduce Elsie to Mr Phelps - the manager of the lace mill. Her good references and connection with the factory - through the family, ensured that she would stand a good chance of being employed - to become a trained lace hand. This was no light matter. Only one child in six was offered training of some kind, and to be an apprentice was even more difficult... My mother’s references and good school report stood her in good stead. She started work at the Small &amp; Tidmus net factory in 1922, the fourth member of the Collins family to work there. This was three years before the ‘mule’ spinners, became the first group of workers to be enrolled as legalized trade unionists. The man in charge of the lace factory was Fred Phelps who lived at the top of St Margaret’s Lane, opposite the thatched chapel of ease.

The Perry Street Lace Mill was Tatworth's main employer giving work to over fifty people in lean times, and a hundred, when in full production. The mill had been developed by Cuff &amp; Co., in 1830. Ten years later J B Payne had bought it but had very little capital to develop the mill. The power was supplied by a feeder pond discharging into leats. During the next ten years, the industry was in the doldrums and the workers on half time. This unsettled production period was caused by the usual social problems – industrialization, labour problems, cost of living, export restrictions, fashion changes, and war. In effect, lace for fashion was a luxury; however, for mosquito netting it had a permanent place in the nations shopping list - during wars and troop settlements abroad – later for parachute silk. 

Mr Phelps, the works manager, saw to it that Elsie was properly taught, and then she was placed under the watchful eye of one of the senior lace hands... It was not long before she was crawling about under the looms joining the broken thread in company with the other girls. Eventually she was allowed to wind the bobbins. The Manchester spinners, their wagons rolled into the mill yard at frequent intervals, supplied the yarn by the hank, which were slipped over the free-running spoked frame and drawn off by Elsie and her fellow trainee girls to wooden bobbins.When sufficiently filled the wooden bobbins were placed into a basket, taken to the machine bobbin rack, and placed in rows… their threads taken through feeder guides to brass bobbins, an inch and a half diameter within a slim case. Once winding completed they were packed tightly into a bobbin carriage ready to be inserted into the lace machine. The yarn from each bobbin threaded through an eyelet.

Another rack was filled with a long line of wooden bobbins their threads drawn off and taken through guides, to converge with others – warping onto a drum. From the drum groups of threads taken off onto a long roller called the beam… this beam was then taken to the lace machine and placed in position. A bundle of threads were then untied and lead through guides to the net roller and when given tension - the warp was ready. The brass bobbin carriages then set into slots in the machine. The machine was set into motion. The weft thread was given a twist as it engaged with the warp thread making a series of interlocking loops.

There, Elsie worked with her assistant for ten years, with the great mill wheel, within the building on the floor below, revolving with enough weight and power to shake the building, throbbing and thrusting away, as it gathered speed. A clackerty, pulsating action, that seemed to be beating time with your pulse. The mill’s power transferred by an iron shaft beneath; above, on every floor, the pulleys, spindles, cogs running in and out, and drive belts slap and clap as they start the bobbins spinning… then nothing but the mighty crescendo could be heard. The lace hands signalled to each other by hand, mouthing the words – much like the deaf and dumb. The world trembles as the tiny cotton particles dance to the tune. It was the job of her father to repair and make his own machines in the workshop alongside the mill.
  
The ‘lace hand’ or ‘twist hand’ worked with a boy or girl to look after a pair of machines… setting the machine up – un-tying a bundle of warp threads… leading them through the guides to the net roller, to be tensioned. When the brass bobbins were slotted into carriages the machine was ready to start… knitting - twisting as it engaged with the warp thread. The labourers made up the largest numbers in the mill followed by lace menders and lace hands.

After learning the trade, she was paid five shillings a week; a labourers wage was forty-six shillings. Nearly all lace manufacturers kept a general store and made the workers take goods for money. Two loaves of bread and half a pound of butter formed part of the weekly allowance. Mother could well remember the noise made by the machinery, the dust and the fluff that flew about – being breathed in… and the danger of fire and explosions. She worked among the rows of whirling spindles where the threads often broke when the tension was too great… twisted and spun. Her first job was to repair these broken ends as quickly as possible moving as fast as she could taking care not to slip on the oil-soaked wooden floors. It was so hot in the spinning and weaving sheds maintaining a moist atmosphere to prevent the threads breaking… that the girls wore just their slips throughout each day. Elsie stayed there for ten years until she was twenty-four, working her way up the ladder… becoming one of the senior lace hands.

Both men and women operated a number of looms packed closely together. Although this made a short distance to cover, it was tightly packed. The operator had to maintain his or her own looms making sure the area was swept clear and the machine oiled. The breaks in the cotton and lack of weft made good if the young trainee girls were not there. The weaving shed were kept cool and damp in summer and steam heated in winter… the object being to stop the cotton from breaking and assist in a better weave. However, the dripping condensation and damp atmosphere did nothing for colds and chills. In summer, the floors kept damp to hold down the flying dust and fluff, which could become a hazard being flammable and causing lung damage. From accounts of factory life at the turn of the century it is obvious that the working conditions for both men and women would not remain in such a depressing state… relying on time to heal the sore expected… however, forces more urgent pushed evolution.

The comparison is easy to make between the periods prior to each of the World Wars… both lengthy agricultural depressions. It is also not difficult to see why these depressions were immediately reversed by rearmament and conscription. The second agricultural revolution saw the state intervene to reconstruct rural Britain. There was an urgency to expand production at any cost we were to become self-sufficient.

Grandfather gave up being a self-employed lace mill engineer when he was sixty-five, in 1935. The Salter &amp; Stokes creamery had open up in South Chard near to Chard Junction some years previously and he and his sons went to work there. In the 1938, The Wiltshire United Dairies stated a milk processing plant on the site, the most modern in the world at the time. Shortly afterwards it became part of the United Dairies Group… then in turn Cow &amp; Gate… all part of the Unigate Group. Now there was no family connection with the lace mill.

Only a cycle ride away from Tatworth is Forde Abbey. The original abbey had been built to accommodate twelve brothers in 1142 – after taking six years to build. By 1200, it was considered one of the major scholastic, religious foundations in Britain, continuing its role until the dissolution of the monasteries in 1539. The last abbot, Thomas Chard considerably enlarged the building adding the cloisters. After the dissolution, it fell into decay until bought a hundred years later by Sir Edmund Prideaux – who later became Oliver Cromwell’s Attorney General - further enlarged it to today proportions. In 1702, the estate came by marriage to Sir Francis Gwym, whose inheritors continued the ownership until a relation of the present family, Mrs Bertram Evans, bought the building and nearly two thousand acres of land, including five farms, in 1864. In 1905, there were eight resident servants for the family. The in-house servants included a housekeeper, governess, a nurse and nursery-maid, a cook. A parlour maid, and a ‘tweeny’, who combined the duties of housemaid with those of the kitchen. For outside duties, a coachman/chauffeur and stable-man who occupied the stable mews, whose duties involved driving the new car – the brougham was still kept, as were a pair of horses for carriage work, and a hunter for him. Head gardener with a staff of four who maintained a kitchen garden and park, and pig man whose duties included the pig-sty, chicken houses and milking the cow. The laundry was done outside the house in the village, as was the shoeing of the horses. Increasingly the number of servants was reduced the work taken over by part-time staff. As the main services were introduced so there was a further reduction in staff. Before mains water was piped to the abbey, there was a great deal of water to be supplied to the rooms daily. There was three breakfasts to prepare - for the nursery and schoolroom at eight and for the dining room at nine.It was the housekeeper’s job to control and direct the staff inside the house. Many of the servant’s duties carried over into other tasks to help. The gardener and stable-hand trimmed the lamps, filled the lamp’s bowls and pumped water into the cistern.

Life at the abbey was highly structured. To maintain the house and grounds required an enormous amount of work… it needed to be painted on a regular basis both inside and out and the grounds kept mown. The annual spring clean was a major event when a number of village girls were employed to dust, polish, and attend to the crystal chandeliers.
 
The Lady of the house announced locally that there was a vacancy for a live-in woman’s maid/house-cleaner. It was common knowledge that the the owner was a good employer – considerate towards their staff. Her sister told Elsie that there was a vacancy for a maid and it was for this post she applied after telling the foreman at the lace factory her intentions to apply. The management graciously supplied her with good references to go with the application. She soon heard back that her application was satisfactory that she was expected to attend an interview in a few days. This she did and the interview was a success to the extent that she was offered the position of ladies maid instead. Elsie considered she was very fortunate, excited by the thought of leaving the mill -having a far gentler, cleaner, superior job.

She was lucky to be employed by someone considered a good employer who was fortunate too, in that my mother was very keen to leave the mill - to do more gentle and refined work, in comfortable surroundings. In 1932 at the age of 24, Elsie left the lace factory for good. The job description was changed to that of ‘Lady’s Maid’, after my mother had been interviewed. The owner was delighted to find someone who understood quilting and cap making even though they were outdated skills. A Lady’s Maid was often expected to originate new dress designs whilst up dating others. Her other main task was to dress and fashion her mistresses hair. Having worked at the Lace Mill, she was familiar with the skill of maintaining-materials, cleaning, stitching and re-adapting old work.

This was towards the end of the Depression - things were just beginning to ‘look-up’. It was a new start for my mother, at a time when there was more optimism about. It was also the time when many estates were breaking up. The wealthy had tried to hold on skimping here and there trying to make ends meet. Many failed and their homes sold up. There were many house sales. Land was sold to absentee landlords as an investment. The old ways stated to disappear. Into this new world, my mother trod without knowing where it would lead. She had been offered the position of Lady’s Maid and she was excited, as she had just cause to be…!

The four year period between the end of the First World War and Elsie ‘going into service’, one-quarter of the land in Britain changed hands – the largest change of ownership since the dissolution of the monasteries – it was the break-up of the landed estates. Once again, much of the land ended up being cultivated by farmers. There was a shortage of domestic labour, rationing was imposed and the state intervened in the running of the countryside. All these things were to affect the owners. Forde Abbey survived and continued to play a part in society. 

A Lady’s Maid was a considerable step up in the world, no more backbreaking work replacing shuttles. There was always the possibility of visiting London, which she had to agree to do before accepting the job. Quite often Elsie wore clothes handed down to her although she was obliged to alter the dress so that it was not recognisable as her Mistresses. Her ordinary dress was black stockings and close fitting floral dress. There was a strict code of behaviour even though her employer was easy going. My mother would never speak badly about her mistress and nothing would ever induce the mistress to disparage her maid’s character.

Elsie’s position in the household was just below that of the housekeeper – above the nurse, and about the same as the governess. Most came from middle-class parents in reduced circumstances, which is why my mother was so delighted to be offered the position. Her income was £20 per week. Although the work was not arduous, she was very much kept on the go – adjusting her lady’s hair, changing her clothes and preparing for the next outing. The biggest drawback to the job was that generally the Mistress preferred their personal maid to be young, good looking and well turned out. As the older ladies maids lost their calm so fear of unemployment followed. 

Mum was woken at seven every morning by the housemaid to quickly wash and comb her hair; her day lasted until ten o’clock at night having half an hour for breakfast, tea and supper, and an hour for dinner. She had to be ready at half-past seven to take tea and toast, the morning paper and any letters. The bath had filled and the toiletries prepared, before taking breakfast with the other servants in the Servants Hall. Immediately afterwards she had to be upstairs to help her Mistress to dress.

She had a comfortable bedroom next door to her mistress. The bed was made for her by the upstairs maid, with clean sheets every week. There was hot water for her bath and jug, and on cold night a hot water bottle. Once a week she had her own tablet of soap and a lighted candle placed by her bed at seven. Her main tasks were to correct, alter, make-up her mistresses clothes in the sewing room and attend to her mistresses every want.

Dinner was at one o’clock, the first course in the Hall, and the second in Nan’s [the governess’] room. Work started an hour later, completing her morning work. A walk in the grounds could take up the rest of the day until teatime at four, when it was time for a buffet meal of sandwiches and cake. This lasted a further hour when the mistress’s clothes were to be prepared for the evening - or, for ‘calling’. The timing for the evening's entertainment discussed well before. It was now four years after the First World War. The services reduced to pre-war levels… the influx of so many men onto the job market created massive unemployed. There were groups of men on every street corner around the job centres.

The social changes brought into being by women taking over men’s jobs changed forever the role of women. They liked the responsibility and the freedom from household drudgery… women were not going to give up their newfound status. Women’s fashions displayed this change - skirts and dresses were designed to be worn level with the knee. It was the age of the flappers – short straight dresses, dropped waistlines, cloche hats and short hair – cut in a shingle, or bob if slightly longer. The Marcel effect, corrugated waves, was achieved by using curling tongs.It was the time for women to display boyish figures to go with the shingles and long cigarette holders. Waist was small, and hips and busts kept in proportion. Undergarments changed, now waists compressed in roll-on girdles with suspenders attached – stocking always worn. A shapeless bra known as a bandeau flattened the bust. Over these were worn cami-knickers or a camisole and French knickers.Length of outer garments kept well above the knee consisting of sleeveless dresses with dropped waistlines. Strait skirts with perhaps box pleating that mother had to continually iron. Shoes had medium heels, pointed toes and a bar across the instep, considered very stylish. Hats were cloches, tightly fitting over the ears with a close turned-back brim. It was mother’s job to sew trimmings of ribbon on the hats to match the suit worn for the next day.    
  
Each morning’s task was to prepare her Mistresses clothes, for the day as well as seeing that the previous were put away - clean and tidy. Any repairs set aside for future work by the seamstress. There was generally an hour for needlework and specialist ironing. Once ready for her day, and had left her bedroom, the room was tidied, bed aired and remade and the next set of clothes laid out for the afternoon or for travelling out – walking or riding in the dog-cart. Carpets cleaned, surfaces dusted and dressing glass polished. At monthly intervals the furniture was polished.

If a shopping trip arranged then mum would accompany Mrs Roper to help her with the bags and be a companion. If visiting, presents or gifts set aside ready for the occasion. If she stayed in there would be tea, served in the Servants Hall at eleven… In the winter, it was mum's job to make-up - keep lit, the bedroom fire - to ensure the room aired. A clotheshorse draped with recently ironed clothes to air them properly. The lake in the garden, enclosed by the flower borders and tall trees, held the evening air, which made the house damp if the windows left open and fires not kept in. The Servants dinner served at midday and taken with the rest of the staff. The pudding, and after dinner tea served in the Housekeeper’s Room where mum’s friend Nan, who was the governess, entertained her.

Between the hours of two and four – when tea served in the Servants Hall, mum was able to catch up on her sewing and any leisure-time practices before helping Mrs Roper to dress for Afternoon Tea - served at five. She may have visited the garden to arrange with the Gardener to cut some flowers for the bedroom. Thereafter, the bedroom was set ready for preparation - dressing her Lady for dinner and the evening’s entertainment. This started at half-past six and ended with tidying up the room and toiletries, preparing the bed, inserting the hot water bottles, which were changed at half past eight. An hour later supper served in the Servants Hall after which the rest of the evening given over to leisure activities until the Mistress retired to bed when the final undressing supervised. 

Her life revolved around her mistress who always referred to her as Miss Collins. A lady's maid had to be with her mistress all the time whether at home or away. Every piece of clothing had to be in perfect condition - properly washed, ironed or steam-cleaned. All sewing completed, the dressing table equipped with all the necessary items and the bathroom laid out ready for use. For the lady of the house her maid was not only a helper but a confidant and friend.

Elsie was expected to travel with her employer wherever she went - to supervise her comforts and to carry anything extraneous. For the annual move to London - for the ‘season’ the ladies maid went along as did the chauffeur. This state of affairs for the wealthy was going through a transition period. Increasingly young staff did not want to enter service - the duties were considered boring and beneath them. Socialists and Trade Unionists, pointed out that servants were being exploited and should seek better wages and the ‘Girls’ Friendly Society considered the moral welfare of the young. Inheritance Tax finished off what industrialization started. The Second World War completed the transition not just the death of many young men who would have received an estate as an inheritance but the rise of Socialism and the victory of the Labour party. By the time Elsie started her new job the General Strike was in the past and the Government bent on rearming the nation. A period of full employment, massive house building and euphoria took the place of stagnation and decay.

The lady’s maid was responsible for dressing her employer's hair and laying out all the clothes to be worn that day - for every occasion. Dignity at all times and in all places was essential. Her mistress used Pond’s Cold Cream at night and Pond’s Vanishing Cream during the day, with a hint of rouge under a thin dusting of powder. Cremola hand cream used to soften the hands and scented lavender soap was at the side of the basin. Gloves of soft leather, white for summer and brown for winter, washed by my mother and dried very slowly to retain their softness. My mother stayed for only a year… as a companion rather than as a Lady’s Maid. That same year, 1933, she met her future husband at a Masonic dinner… they married … at St John the Evangelist, Tatworth and the wedding breakfast held at Rosalie Cottage.

It was a long way for my mother to have travelled… from the  garden gate, that lead out onto the street; the stream and its bridge - that never ceased to play a part in every day life. The dominant school building opposite - refusing to play a minor role, and of course, ‘The Mill’… and the childhood, teenage friends - all enduring, the cold, the damp and the clammer together. The secure family routine… closeness of relations and friends… wandering the country lanes - looking over the hedges at trees on far off purple hills, that touched the sky…; all things of the past but retained inside… Now, when married,it was to be a life of suburban pavement and shop… children, a pram and brick built house…, cinema, and all that makes for town-life. I am sure it was all, what my mother wanted - imagined in her dreams… whilst working away at the looms, and later… attending as a Lady’s Maid.

Elsie’s upbringing, despite the obvious lack of amenity and convenience did include security and love – the sort of love common to the time not sentimental and clinging. What stood her in good stead was her love and understanding of nature, which permeated her soul. She had witnessed the change in how the land was managed. The reliance on the horse now given over to the tractor, the decline in the number of village craftsmen and the move away from country ways to industrial muscle and the vans delivery service. The deferential attitude accorded to higher social classes by generations of tenants and workers were now questioned – changed for good after World War 1. Peoples ambitions, like my mother’s, did not included working three looms for the rest of her life. She wanted a bit of luxury not servitude… Mum could easily have returned to Tatworth, but, as with all dreams, reality dictated otherwise… what price then a glow-worm in the ditch instead of a street lamp… It is just like forgetting the pain of fingers thawing out, especially when the sun is burning the back of one’s neck!

By the time mum took us on holiday she had been living away from home for nine years. In those nine years she had been in service, married, moved to two London suburbs, had as many children… whilst suffering the blitz. Not only had her life changed, but work back at the mill had altered too… Her father had been retired for six years, missing the bombs, randomly dropped on the mill. The mill by 1941 was turning out mosquito nets for the Far East… the village meanwhile became inward looking when the blackout descended. Rationing had to be coped with and the extra hour of double-summertime allowed more work to be done in daylight hours. The Make-do-and-Mend slogan, initiated by the government, indicated the sort of attitude that should be adopted - for a country under siege.

The already hard rural existence was made harder still by shortages and absentee men folk. It was the woman’s job to ‘make ends meet’, which they did, turning to age-old methods of living off the country. They had not only the means to do so but also past experience to draw on. In fact, there was little change in the life of the Collins’ family or in the day-to-day life in the village. Some of the innocence and obedience, dignity and pride had rubbed off, replaced by: better education, fewer acceptances of past rules and regimes, more casual attitude to dress formalities, manners and etiquettes.

Elsie never forgot her early life, which shaped everything she did. Recounting those times brought her eyes alive and a smile to her lips. Giving time to her past kept the memories dust-free - easily plucked from her memory-bank in times of stress. She could recall and name the trees down the lane, the shrubs in the hedges lining the winding path, and the wild flowers in the meadow. The ford and the bridge, not far from the garden gate, served the brook, which bubbled and chuckled as generations of laughing children played in its crystal-clear water. Flocks of sheep passed over the bridge, hurried on by the shouts from the shepherd, later, the farmer’s cows pushed and shoved to get to their stalls - to be milked. The banks that lined the waters edge burgeoned with rush and thyme, waterlillies and cowsfoot. The willow in the hedge, beneath which the waters flowed, alive with chattering sparrows pecking at the berries then wiping their beaks on the lichen covered boughs. All these she left behind… for a town life, she had hankered for… To step away from the fluffy, damp atmosphere of the lace mill and in-service attendance. All these pictures were the rock upon which she clung, recalling their colours and shapes to pass on… more to satisfy her longings than to educate us children.

* &lt;font size=3&gt;The first meter was installed in 1928. All stamps are inscribed “[[w:CCCP|CCCP]]” either in the frank or the town mark. The Union collapsed into its constituent states in 1991. For issues since the break-up, see BELARUS, ESTONIA, [[w:KAZAKHSTAN|KAZAKHSTAN]], LATVIA, LITHUANIA, MOLDOVA, [[w:RUSSIA|RUSSIA]], and UKRAINE. Some Soviet meter designs continued to be used unaltered for months and even years after the break-up.

* The stamps are grouped according to appearance of the frank and usage:

:: A - Rectangle with simulated perforation border
:: B - Rectangle with straight-line border
:: C - Horizontal octagon
:: D - Upright octagon
:: E - Without frank frame, value figures only
:: F - Frank with dentate (toothed) sides
:: PP - Special stamps for Parcel Post
:: PV - Public, self-service vending machine stamps&lt;/font&gt;

'''Description of the cover at right''':
:::::::::: The large circular marks are no postal cancellations or censor marks. The text says &quot;УСМО * Московская расчетная контора * За счет с оглашения № 4852&quot; and translates as &quot;USMO * [[w:Moscow|Moscow]] accounting office * On account of agreement number 4852&quot;. УСМО = Управления Cвязи Московской Области = Moscow [[w:Oblast|Oblast]]' Directorate of Communications. An 'Oblast' is the equivalent of a province. УСМО had a factory in Moscow which was evacuated to [[w:Shadrinsk|Shadrinsk]] in the Cheliabinsk Oblast' in November 1941 because of the war. It is still there. A smaller factory was re-established in Moscow in 1942.
 
:::::::::: The word &quot;расчетная&quot; in the circular mark relates to &quot;postage-on-account&quot; mail originating from a number of Soviet institutions and enterprises in the 1920's and 1930's. The procedure followed is described in an article in the Post Rider, the journal of the Canadian Society of Russian Philately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Post-Rider|publisher=Canadian Society of Russian Philately, Issue: 38, June 1996 - 'Postage on Account Mail'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:::::::::: The cover shows an unusual use of this service, combining both a meter frank (15k being the international ordinary letter rate) and the use of the &quot;on account&quot; mark. It is conceivable that the meter frank was applied by an automated machine located on the enterprise's grounds and then the circular cancel applied by a supervisor to validate its use. The meter-franking machine would be periodically checked by the post-office to assess the total sum owed by the enterprise.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Albanian language belongs to the Indo-European family of languages but has its own specifics, similar to Greek or Armenian, which means it does not have any direct similarities with other languages in the same family.

The Albanian language is spoken by Albanians who descend from the ancient Illyrian tribes that occupied the western part of the Balkan peninsula. It is recognized to be the continuation of the Illyrian language. Unfortunately, there are no written documents to prove this theory so the connection between the two languages is only indirectly supported through the names of people, places and historical studies.

The first document in written Albanian dates from the 16th century when the book, Meshari by Gjon Buzuku, was published in 1555.

During the middle-ages, there was a large exodus of Albanians into Greece, where today, an archaic dialect of Albanian is still spoken. The Albanian language was also spoken in the Chameria region of northern Greece, but due to the ethnic cleansing of Albanians by Greeks there, many Albanians took refuge in Turkey or returned to Albania. The remaining population has been forbidden to speak Albanian.

After the death of the great Albanian national hero, Skenderbeg, and the occupation of Albania by the Ottoman Empire, thousands of Albanians migrated to southern Italy and Sicily. Today, some 200,000 Albanians called Arbëresh remain there and speak a very old Albanian dialect.

The national literary Albanian language was formed during the middle of the last century. At that time, there were two main dialects used: the northern dialect, Gege, and the southern dialect, Tosk.

Both dialects were incorporated into one in 1972 during a language congress held in Tirane where most of the Gege dialect was incorporated into the Tosk dialect and was declared the official, unified Albanian language and was subsequently accepted by all Albanians of the former Yugoslavia.

Where is the Albanian language spoken today?

Today, the Albanian language is spoken in Albania and within the ethnic Albanian areas of the former Yugoslavia, such as Kosova, Macedonia, Montenegro and South Serbia. But in these regions, where daily political repression has become a way of life, the Albanian language is also suffering setbacks as a result of the widespread discrimination against Albanians.

Since the dawn of tribal society and the emergence of a social structure, the concept of governance has been evolving and changing. When a king is crowned and rules his lands with an even temperament or an iron fist the norms and behavior that is expected of his subjects is a form of governance. When ancient council members meet to discuss and decide on the rule of their lands is a form of governance. Governance is a tool for establishing ordered rule and mobilizing a collective into action (Stoker, 1998).  Stoker wrote &quot;The essence of governance is its focus on governing mechanisms which do not rest on recourse to the Authority and sanctions of government.&quot; (Stoker, 1998)  As societies become more advanced the mechanisms of governance become more advanced.  In the modern era governance is a complex network of checks and balances that requires adherence to many different concepts that work in unison to help keep the process of governance moving in a forward direction. The concepts that we are going to look at in this study are participation, transparency, responsiveness, consensus and accountability.

=== Governance ===
Since the dawn of tribal society and the emergence of a social structure, the concept of governance has been evolving and changing. When a king is crowned and rules his lands with an even temperament or an iron fist the norms and behavior that is expected of his subjects is a form of governance. When ancient council members meet to discuss and decide on the rule of their lands is a form of governance. Governance is a tool for establishing ordered rule and mobilizing a collective into action (Stoker, 1998).  Stoker wrote &quot;The essence of governance is its focus on governing mechanisms which do not rest on recourse to the Authority and sanctions of government.&quot; (Stoker, 1998)  As societies become more advanced the mechanisms of governance become more advanced.  In the modern era governance is a complex network of checks and balances that requires adherence to many different concepts that work in unison to help keep the process of governance moving in a forward direction. The concepts that we are going to look at in this study are participation, transparency, responsiveness, consensus and accountability.

=== Good Governance ===
&quot;One of the most important aspects of governance is participation. Participation is achieved through legitimate intermediate institutions or representatives working towards a common goal.&quot; (UNESCAP, 2009) For example, the representative republic found in the United States Government requires a certain level of participation from elected representatives, their constituents, and the government itself to function properly. Without participation from various parties governance would fail to progress past its initial stages.
Equally critical to the success of governance is achieving consensus. (UNESCAP, 2009) A consensus oriented approach needs to take into consideration that there are several actors and as many view points in a given society. &quot;Good governance requires mediation of the different interests to reach a broad consensus on what is in the best interest of the whole community and how this can be achieved.&quot; (UNESCAP, 2009) This can only result from an understanding of the historical, cultural and social contexts of a given society or community. If decision makers aren’t sensitive to the needs and wants of the governed the proposal will ultimately fail.
Accountability is needed at all levels and stages of the governance process not only governmental institutions but also the private sector and civil society organizations must be accountable to the public and to their institutional stakeholders. (UNESCAP, 2009)  In general an organization or an institution is accountable to those who will be affected by its decisions or actions.
Transparency is also required to foster good governance. This means that decisions taken and their enforcement are done in a manner that follows rules and regulations. It also means that information should be freely available and directly accessible to those who will be affected by such decisions and their enforcement. Transparency also means that enough information is provided and that it is provided in easily understandable forms and media. This can ensure the right information is afforded to the decision makers to ensure the guidance or control of an activity, in order to meet a specific objective.  A good governance process must also be responsive to the needs of the all stakeholders within a reasonable time frame. (UNESCAP, 2009) For example the way Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 which was created in response to the Enron scandal of 2001 was quickly enacted to protect the general investing public. If this legislation took ten years to become law the purpose for its creation would have been lost in the time between its inception and implementation. In addition to being timely any rule enacted needs to reach a broad consensus in society on the best interests of the community. For governance to succeed, consensus or an understanding of the consensus must be a priority.

=== The Internet ===
The Internet is a relatively new and dynamic technology. The origins of the internet can be traced back to the beginning of the 1960's with Leonard Kleinrocks' research on packet switching technologies and J.C.R. Lickliders' work on the concept of the &quot;Galactic Network&quot; (Leiner et al., 2009). Additional research and development of the Network Control Protocol (NPC) by Vinton Cerf and TCP/IP by Robert Kahn in the 1970s directly contributed to the development and success of the Internet (Leiner et al., 1997). However, the creation of the internet as we know it today is not simply the result of engineers and scholars working on new technologies. The individuals that were instrumental in creating the internet feel that developing new technologies and extending existing technologies was only one aspect (Leiner et al., 2009). In the beginning, the contributors of the technology needed to help build what we know as the internet were on opposite ends of the world while other scientists where in the United Kingdom (Leiner et al., 1997). They needed a way to come together and pool their collective knowledge and resources to achieve their goals.
The Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) was created in 1958. The previous year on October 4, 1957 the Soviet Union launched the Sputnik satellite into orbit. This singular action sparked a feeling of global hysteria and was the driving force behind the creation of ARPA (Van Atta, n.d.). As a result ARPAs mission in 1958 was to &quot;prevent technological surprise like the launch of Sputnik, which signaled that the Soviets had beaten the U.S. into space.&quot; (Wikipedia, n.d.). Today that mission has changed to &quot;maintain the technological superiority of the U.S. military and prevent technological surprise from harming our national security by sponsoring revolutionary, high-payoff research bridging the gap between fundamental discoveries and their military use.&quot; (DARPA Mission, n.d.). Though supported by the military Dr. Van Atta clarifies that DARPA was focused on high risk and high reward projects that have tangible results over theoretical progress (Van Atta, n.d.). The combination of curious minds in the form of Licklider, Kleinrock, Cerf and Kahn among others and the need for development of useful advancements in technology for military and defense purposes lead to the development of the Internet.

Since the 1970s the essence of the Internet has been against control and governance. Its very creators were working under the assumption that they were creating something that would exist outside of conventional control. Robert Kahn an Internet pioneer states that while he was working to develop his protocols for internet communication he was focusing on creating a system where individual networks could stand on their own, a system that was fault tolerant to the point that if a transmission or part of a transmission failed it would simply be resent from the source. He was trying to create a system that would have no global control (Leiner et al., 2009). ARPANET was officially terminated in 1989 but by that time the Internet as we understand it today was just getting started (Waldrop, n.d.). By the time the ARPANET died companies were incorporating TCP/IP into their products (Leiner et al., 1997). As time passed computers, networks and the Internet have become more entangled in our everyday lives. Online shopping, gaming and communicating have become common place.

Internet Governance consists of the collective rules, procedures, processes, and related programs that shape social actors’, shared expectations, practices, and interactions and result in practices and operations that are consistent with the sovereign rights of states and the social and market interests of end-users and operators. It includes agreements about standards, policies, rules, and enforcement and dispute resolution procedures. Internet governance and many of its issues and questions upon sovereignty, security, stability, privacy, international coordination, intellectual property rights (IPR), who does what, have, over the past few years been hot topics. In my opinion, the debates reflected the reality that Internet governance is not limited to technical issues or to policy issues only. It has increasingly included important social, economic, and national security issues. In addition, people are troubled by the facts that there are no consensus on areas of responsibility, standards and accountability. We have to figure out who should be doing what? Is it the role of the government to govern the internet; should the government even have a role or should it be left up to the private sector that seems to enjoy the invisible hand approach that just seems to govern responses to issues, problems and trends as they happen?

=== Governing Bodies ===
Historically standards and governance act as a tool to aid in the development and advancement of systems and technology. A well defined set of standards and a clear governance structure will help pave the way for new systems and technologies to be presented to the masses and be adopted which in turn will allow for more advancement and still more required governance. This system growth and governance is not limited to tangible goods and service. Telecommunications, networked computing and the Internet are not exceptions to this trend. Since the inception of networked computing governance and standardization have played a heavy role in the direction and development of what we now understand as the Internet. Since the early 1970’s efforts have been made to provide governance to networked computing. In 1972 RFC 433 was published by Jon Postel pertaining to a unified process for the transmission of Registry Information (Socket Number Lists, 1972). Efforts of individuals like Jon helped spur the creation of numerous national, international, non-profit, for-profit, independent and government funded governing organizations specific to telecommunications and the Internet.

==== International Telecommunications Union ====

Telecommunications governance actually began in the late 1800’s. Prior to 1932 ITU stood for International Telegraph Union and was established IN May 28 1865 to facilitate amendments created during the International Telegraph Convention, which was signed in Paris on May 17, 1865 (ITU's History, 2009). In 1947 the ITU became a specialized agency of the United Nations. According to their website the mission of the ITU is to &quot;enable the growth and sustained development of telecommunications and information networks, and to facilitate universal access so that people everywhere can participate in, and benefit from, the emerging information society and global economy.&quot; (The ITU mission:, 2009) The ability to communicate freely is a pre-requisite for a more equitable, prosperous and peaceful world. And ITU assists in mobilizing the technical, financial and human resources needed to make this vision a reality. Over the last 145 years, the ITU has participated in improving the level of connectivity on a global scale. They have participated at the physical level by improving the global telecommunications infrastructure; they have made efforts from a governance and policy perspective by establishing global standards for communications systems; they continue to look ahead and address new issues to telecommunications and networking by helping to strengthen cyber security (About ITU, 2009). To better focus efforts to the varying areas of standards and policy in 1992 the ITU broke into three categories leaving the ITU-T as the contact point for standards-making efforts. In 1999 the ITU became a founding member of the Protocol Supporting Organization of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN PSO) (ITU Landmark Dates, 2009). Eight years later the ITU-T helped to establish governance and standards for IPTV that encompass television / video / audio / text / graphics / data delivered over IP based networks (IPTV-GSI, 2009). This effort to remain a leader in the development of standards and governance is what pushed the ITU to continue the development of telecommunications policy on a regional and global scale.

==== International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) ====
Another global leader in the area of standards development is the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). The IEC was founded in 1906 with British scientist Lord Kelvin as its first president (IEC History, n.d.). This was a response to “steps should be taken to secure the co-operation of the technical societies of the world, by the appointment of a representative Commission to consider the question of the standardization of the nomenclature and ratings of electrical apparatus and machinery” commented at the International Electrical Congress in 1904 (IEC History, n.d.). The International Electrotechnical Commissions mission is to be “the leading global organization that prepares and publishes international standards for all electrical, electronic and related technologies” (Mission and Objectives, n.d.). The IEC feels that their national and international standards contributions have aided in fostering a climate of international cooperation in the area of electrotechnical standardization (Mission and Objectives, n.d.). Since its creation the IEC has worked to compile and standardize terminology and measurements for telecommunications. By 1914 they created an international standard for resistance of Copper on a wire. By 1930 they had developed uniform measurement for Hertz and Gauss (IEC History, n.d.). Directly related to modern technologies the IEC helped to standardize terms like ‘Network’, ‘Local Area network’ and ‘wireless LAN’ (IEC Electropedia, n.d.). Currently the IEC has made a commitment to focus is on the development of standards and uniform terminology for current and emerging technologies. This focus is not likely to change in the future as the IEC is trying to foster the idea of global participation through various affiliation programs and incentives (Raeburn, n.d.).

==== International Standards Organization (ISO) ====
A third legacy organization that has roots long before the development of modern computing is the International Standards Organization was established in 1946, when delegates from 25 countries met in London and decided to create a new international organization, of which the object would be &quot;to facilitate the international coordination and unification of industrial standards&quot;(ISO Story, n.p.). In the realm of Information Technology the ISO has developed standards that apply to the governance of management processes (and decisions) relating to the information and communication services used by an organization. “These processes could be controlled by IT specialists within the organization or external service providers, or by business units within the organization.” (ISO/IEC 38500:2008). The ISOs long term plans outlined in their strategic plan for the next five years are to increase the relevancy of their existing Policy documentation by improving the language support and promote the use of their standards and policy globally. They intend to boost stakeholder involvement by utilizing the feedback of stakeholders in both the public and private sectors. The ISO is also working towards improving the efficiency of development with closer interaction with the IEC and ITU (ISO Strategic Plan, n.d.).

====Institute for Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)====
Moving away from large international organizations that have broad scopes that are designed to encompass AS many industries as possible there is another level of organization that is more focused on the areas of information technology and the internet.  One such organization is the Institute for Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE).  According to their official website, the history of the IEEE dates back to 1884, during a time when the popularity of electricity was beginning to broaden its reach. The American Institute for Electrical Engineers (AIEE) was formed to encourage and promote innovation in this field. Twenty-eight years later, the Institute of Radio Engineers (IRE) was separately formed to deal with wireless and radio transmissions as well as general electronics. Over time, the interests of the two groups started to overlap, and in 1963 they both joined to create the IEEE. (IEEE, 2009) The IEEE has played a large and important role in the ongoing realm of internet governance. The group is responsible for such standards as the 802.3 Ethernet and the 802.11 wireless networking standards. Both of these standards are heavily used access standards for the Internet and can be considered among the IEEE’s most important standards today. The IEE continues to push development and innovation standards in the power and energy, information technology, and telecommunications fields with over 1300 standards in development. (IEEE) One of IEEE’s most recent developments is the ratification of the 802.11n wireless networking standard which brings increased range and data rates for wireless data transmission. (IEEE, 2009)

====Internet Architecture Board (IAB)====
One of the first governance organizations that were born after the creation of modern computing is the Internet Architecture Board (IAB).  The IAB’s website explains that the Internet Architecture Board originated as the Internet Advisory Board and was formed in 1984 to replace the Internet Configuration Control Board (ICCB). The ICCB was created in 1979 by Vint Cerf, the programming manager at DARPA at the time, and its purpose was to offer technical advice on issues dealing with the Internet. In 1986 the IAB went under an official name change to become what is known today as the Internet Architecture Board. Current IAB documents deal with general principles relating to the Internet and network management. Some of examples of recent IAB dealings include the future of Internet addressing, partial checksums for UDP traffic, network management, and service identifiers and filtering (IAB, 2009). The IAG is also the confirming body for the IESG and IEFT. The IAB will continue to be more of an oversight and guidance organization rather than a technical standards one. In IAB’s Nov. 4 Meeting Minutes, the AIB discussed potential candidates to “act as the IETF liaison to the Smart Grid Interoperability Panel (SGIP). (IAB, 2009)
Two years after the creation of the IAM the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) was established.  According to the IETF website, the IETF was formed in January of 1986 to help promote and develop technical Internet standards. The organization works closely with the W3C and ISO/IEC and its focus is in “Making the Internet work better by producing high quality, relevant technical documents that influence the way people design, use, and manage the Internet.” (IETF, 2009)
There are no formal membership requirements for the IETF, and membership is open to all willing participants. Current examples of IETF research include areas in internationalized domain names, application-layer traffic optimization, and email filtering. In the future the IETF aims to continue producing relevant and technical standards and proposals to help govern the Internet. (IETF, 2009)

====The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)====
The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) is one of the Internet's oldest governing institutions, with its activities dating back to the 1970s. The IANA is responsible for coordinating many of the key elements that keep the Internet running. Even though the Internet is a worldwide network, renowned for being free from central coordination, there is a technical need for some key parts of the Internet to be globally coordinated and this coordination role is undertaken by IANA. Specifically, IANA allocates and maintains the unique codes and numbering systems that are used to drive the Internet. IANA aims to implement agreed policies and principles in a more universal manner. (IANA, 2009)
The IANA operates and maintains the root zone, and the .int and .arpa domains. The root deals with the upper-most part of the DNS hierarchy, and involves delegating administrative responsibility of “top-level domains”, which are the last segment of a domain name, such as .com, .uk and .nz. Part of this task includes evaluating requests to change the operators of country code domains, as well as day-to-day maintenance of the details of the existing operators. (IANA, 2009)
IANA also operates the .int top-level domain, designed for the sole use of cross-national organizations, such as treaty organizations, that do not naturally fit into a specific country’s top-level domain. In brief, the .int domain is used for registering organizations established by international treaties between or among national governments. The .arpa domain is used internally by Internet protocols, such as for reverse mapping of IP addresses, and delivery of ENUM phone number mapping. IANA administers this domain in close liaison with the Internet Architecture Board, which has policy responsibility for .arpa. The .arpa domain is the “Address and Routing Parameter Area” domain and is designated to be used exclusively for Internet-infrastructure purposes. It is administered by the IANA in cooperation with the Internet technical community under the guidance of the Internet Architecture Board. To help foster the deployment of Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs), IANA provides a repository of “IDN tables” which document the permissible characters for different languages and scripts provided for registration by different top-level domain registries. The repository is informative, and designed for information sharing. IANA provides a repository of “trust anchors” from top-level domain operators who sign their zones. This allows software to cryptographically verify that DNS data has not been modified in transit over the Internet. IANA provides an Interim Trust Anchor Repository to share the key material required to perform DNS Security Extension (DNSSEC) verification of signed top-level domains, in lieu of a signed DNS root zone. This is a temporary service until the DNS root zone is signed, at which time the keying material will be placed in the root zone itself, and this service will be discontinued. (IANA, 2009)
IANA is implementing internal systems and processes in order to allow users to sign the .ARPA zone with DNS Security Extensions. It is expected that this will be an important project to help prepare for implementation of DNSSEC in the DNS Root once policy has been developed on that area. IANA is also performing initial investigations and consultations on Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) work, which involves signing IP address assignments using security certificates. One of IANA's key projects is to move processing of IANA root zone management requests from a predominantly manual system into a new online system that will shepherd a request through its various processing stages. Key benefits of this will be greater transparency on the status of requests to their requestors, plus optimization of some tasks that are currently labor intensive. (IANA, 2009)

====The Internet Society (ISOC) ====
The Internet Society (ISOC) is a nonprofit organization founded in 1992 to provide leadership in Internet related standards, education, and policy. With more than 80 organizations and more than 28,000 individual members in over 80 chapters around the world, the ISOC is dedicated to ensuring the open development, evolution and use of the Internet for the benefit of people throughout the world. (ISOC, 2009)
Internet governance is a broad term used in many different contexts, applying to activities as diverse as coordination of technical standards, operation of critical infrastructure, development, regulation, and legislation, among others. Internet governance is not restricted to the activities of governments. Many different types of stakeholders have a role in defining and carrying out Internet governance activities and ISOC has always been an active leader in such discussions. 'The Internet Society provides leadership in addressing issues that confront the future of the Internet, and is the organizational home for the groups responsible for Internet infrastructure standards. The Internet Society acts not only as a global clearinghouse for Internet information and education but also as a facilitator and coordinator of Internet-related initiatives around the world. For over 15 years ISOC has run international network training programs for developing countries and these have played a vital role in setting up the Internet connections and networks in virtually every country connecting to the Internet during this time.” (ISOC, 2009)
Through its sponsored events, developing-country training workshops, tutorials, public policy, and regional and local chapters, the Internet Society serves the needs of the growing global Internet community. From commerce to education to social issues, the ISOC’s goal is to enhance the availability and utility of the Internet on the widest possible scale. The Society's individual and organization members are bound by a common stake in maintaining the viability and global scaling of the Internet. They comprise the companies, government agencies, and foundations that have created the Internet and its technologies as well as innovative new entrepreneurial organizations contributing to maintain that dynamic. The Internet is built on technical standards, which allow devices, services, and applications to be interoperable across a wide and dispersed network of networks. Internet standards are developed by group of organizations which operate under the sponsorship of the ISOC. (ISOC, 2009)
The ISOC has an initiative called the Enabling Access Initiative, focused on enabling access to the Internet by addressing the fundamental impediments to Internet growth and usability. The challenges of improving Internet growth are multifaceted and interrelated, particularly in developing countries. They include, for example, access to technical skills and knowledge, the regulatory and policy environment for information and telecommunications services, and broader economic and market factors, language diversity, and the diffusion and reliability of basic infrastructures and services. The &quot;Global Addressing&quot; program specifically identifies challenges to global addressing. The goal is to deliver a smooth transition beyond the end of the IANA IPv4 address pool, while working out the longer-term architecture of the Internet. The ISOC also has a “Secure &amp; Stable Infrastructure” program aimed at supporting the development and deployment of key technologies for ensuring a stable and secure. The Internet Society's Trust and Identity initiative recognizes that in order to be trusted, the Internet must provide channels for secure, reliable, private, communication between entities, which can be clearly authenticated in a mutually understood manner. The mechanisms that provide this level of assurance must support both the end-to-end nature of Internet architecture and reasonable means for entities to manage and protect their own identity details. (ISOC, 2009)
A trusted Internet takes into account security, transaction protection, and identity assertion and management. Given the network dependence on unique numbers and the escalating amount of geo-location data being gathered, the privacy implications of the current Internet represent a significant and growing concern. Trust must be a primary design element at every layer of the architecture, and in some cases, existing elements may need to be redesigned or improved to meet emerging requirements. (ISOC, 2009)

==== RIPE NCC ====
RIPE (Réseaux IP Européens) started in November of 1989.  RIPE is a collaborative forum that is open to anyone who is interested in wide area IP networks.  This is a mostly volunteer group.  A majority of the work done by this group is done on individuals on their own or their organization’s time.  Some activities do require constant availability and coordination between people working on projects.  This is why a RIPE NCC’ (Network Coordination Centre) was formed.
RIPE NCC began in April 1992 with there central office in Amsterdam.  The main administrative task of RIPE NNC is acting as a Regional Internet Registry.  A Regional Internet Registry allocates and assigns IP address space and other internet numbers.  RIPE NCC also had a helping hand creating MBONE and WWW services.  RIPE NNC also played a major part in helping to develop Internet Routing Registry (IRP).
In 1994 the Registration Services expanded more than anyone expected.  Funding became really tight and there was a shortage of service resources. In 1995 it was agreed that all registries need to contribute to funding RIPE NCC in order to receive service.
Today RIPE NCC is a not-for-profit organization.  Its membership mainly consists of Internet Service Providers (ISPs), telecommunication organizations and large corporations.  RIPE NCC mission now is to perform activities that benefit the RIPE NCC as a group.  Service and Activities are all discussed in detail in the open.  RIPE NCC does not compete with its’ members activities.

==== World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) ====
In October of 1994, Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) at MIT.   W3C works mostly on the standardization of Web Technologies.  To help come up with the highest quality of standards, W3C uses a community consensus.  All the stakeholders involved do have an opportunity to have a voice in the development of W3C standards. After the technical report development process is complete W3C publishes Recommendations, which are considered web standards. It is up to manufacturers to follow the recommendations of W3C.  If a product would like to be labeled W3C-compliant, it must meet the defined level of conformance set by the W3C.
Before W3C was created there were different versions of HTML put out on the market by various vendors.  Many of these different versions were not compatible with each other.  The consortium allowed the vendors to get together and agree on core principles which everyone would use.  Some web standards that W3c is responsible for are: CSS, XHTML, HTML, XML, P3P, and OWL.  W3C also is working on device independence.  Device independence would allow the web to be accessible by any device under any circumstance.  

==== Internet Corporation for Name &amp; Numbers (ICANN) ====
Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) was established in 1998.  ICANN is a not-for-profit organization that spans world-wide.  Its’ mission is to help keep the internet secure, stable and interoperable.  ICANN has no control over the content and doesn’t deal with access to the internet. 
ICANN helps co-coordinate the supply and assignment of IP addresses to help stop duplicate IP address problems.  ICANN also distributes ranges of IP addresses to regional registries who in turn distribute them to network providers.  ICANN’s role in internet governance is to provide “universal resolvability.”  Universal resolvability allows you to receive the same results when you are accessing the internet no matter your location in the world. 
ICANN was responsible for creating the registrar market (together with an accreditation system).  This helped create greater competition on the internet and the price of domains has fallen 80 percent.  The rapidly changing domain name market has caused ICANN to reform its accreditation process.  ICANN has also help implement a low-cost way to resolve ownership disputes of domain names.  The Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy (UDRP) helps disputes turn into costly court battles.
Approval of “generic top level domains” is also introduced by the ICANN.  This helps provide enough space online as more and more people take advantage of the internet.  ICANN has introduced 13 new top level domains.  ICANN is working on an improved process that will help introduce new TLDs.

=== Debate Over Governance Control ===
With the abundance of content on the Internet traveling around the world and back again in fractions of a second and countless organizations working to provide guidance in the form of uniform terminology, set standards and practices it can become difficult to manager and control the Internet at a whole.  Currently, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) has been branded as the Internets ruling Body (Ward, 2002).  ICANN which is chiefly responsible for oversight of Top level Domain names and deciding who gets web addresses with the common suffixes we have become accustomed to as well as the IP addressing schemes that allow networked computers to communicate (Porteus, 2005).  In the US, some feel that the current governance in place is sufficient.  They feel that the current system though not perfect still provides an invaluable service.  In America, there is a sense that the current governance standards that are in place for Top Level Domains, web address suffixes for industry, government, military and even countries (i.e. com, net, gov, mil, uk, us, etc.) is perfectly acceptable.  American politician Representative Fred Upton from Minnesota feels that ICANN may be flawed but the benefits of an established process for creating domain names is critical to sustaining the global economy (Porteus, 2005).  Others feel that allowing a single nation that operates under a free and democratic market is the best option and the addition of multiple nations and ideologies would ultimately make the organization as a whole less effective.  Associate professor of public policy at the Georgia Institute of Technology agrees: “Things are more efficient if one government controls it but that's make everybody uncomfortable. You get everybody involved, you get stuck with a bunch of different committees and it becomes less effective.” (Porteus, 2005).  Not only are the functions of ICANN necessary to maintain the logical control of assignment of Domains and creation of organizational suffixes there are substantial physical concerns that must be taken into consideration.  The North America has the lowest response time and among the lowest incidence of lost packets of all major regions on the planet according to internet traffic reporting on a global scale (Internet Traffic Report, 2009).  North America on average has a response of less than 120 milliseconds and 5% packet loss (Internet Traffic Report, 2009).  The Europe has a response of almost 160 milliseconds while dealing with less overall traffic.  If control and management of the Internet were shifted there would be a global reduction in the quality of service and capability of the Internet until infrastructure demands were met by the new controlling nation or organization.
Outside of logical and physical considerations for maintaining control of Internet Governance within the United States is the abundance of court cases that are creating prescience at the state and federal levels that is establishing the guidelines for the future of internet governance from a legal perspective. 
 Here is an example at the state level:

==== Cohen vs. Google 2009 ====
In this case the Plaintiff Cohen is attempting to sue the Defendant Google for defamation of character this defamation occurred on a site hosted by blogger.com.  The blog site was posted anonymously and had contact information listed with Goggle.  As part of the pre-action discovery Cohen’s attorney requested electronic archive information to ascertain the identity of the anonymous blogger.  Google denied the request stating that the information requested was too vague and Google “has refused to provide Petitioner with any information or documents with respect to the Blog unless it is required to do so pursuant to applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request” (Madden, J., 2009).  In response the Plaintiff attempted to hold Google partly liable for the defamation in an attempt to get the necessary information.  Google stated that they are cannot be held liable for any damages as a result of their anonymous users because when entering into any agreement of service with Google, one must agree to specific indemnity terms that release Google from liability of wrongdoing.
The acceptance of the indemnity statements as a binding agreement is significant in this case because the acknowledgement used to indemnify Google from any nefarious actions committed by the anonymous blogger which was upheld by the courts was a check box clicked by the user when setting up their account.  This “signature” was acquired via a means that is virtually indistinguishable from any other users' similar action. In an interview with an employee of the Syracuse City Legal department she stated that in reference to legally binding documents that require a signature or similar form of acknowledgment, “a non-electronic binding signature must be uniquely identifiable” (Rauch, 2009).
The outcome of the pre-action discovery in Cohen v. Google illustrates the fact that at some levels the basis of internet governance has been set by de facto standards that have become so ingrained in society that they will stand in state Supreme Court.  This illustrates the need for a formal and sound governance structure to help shape future policy.  Similar findings have been made at the national level as well.

==== Gonzalez vs. Google 2006 ====
In 2005 the Bush administration demanding that Google and other search engines turn over aggregate search information to help revive a child protection law. Google refused to comply with the subpoena and a motion was filed in January of 2006 by US Department Of Justice to force Google to hand over the data. The government claimed that the information would help &quot;estimate how often Web users encounter harmful-to-minors material in the course of their searches, and to measure the effectiveness of filtering software in screening that material.&quot; Google’s lawyers have objected to the subpoena on the grounds that it lacks &quot;relevancy,&quot; it's redundant since Yahoo! and Microsoft already caved and that the company's trade secrets would be in danger.
On March 17th of 2006 Federal Judge, James Ware ruled that Google did not have to release any information to the government as its subpoena shows limited use for the information being gathered. “In particular, this Order doesn’t address the Plaintiffs’ concern articulated at the hearing about the appropriateness of the government’s use of the Court’s subpoenas power to gather and collect information about what individuals search for over the internet.” (US District Court Ruling, 2006)
When we're at home, the illusion of privacy and anonymity allows us to feel comfortable searching for anything. Let's not pretend that we haven't used the Internet to explore ideas we'd just as soon not share with friends, colleagues, family, or government prosecutors. Put another way, if you knew someone was looking over your shoulder when you used a search engine, would it change what you searched for? If the ISP’s and search engine developers were required to maintain a list of a user’s search records and could these records ever get out and embarrass you? Or worse, land you in jail? How is information private when anything?
Even though the Justice Department insists Google can strip away any information that could be linked to individual users, the Google still refuses to cooperate. Companies will always be subject to subpoenas served but the government, but the judge sent a clear message about privacy that is simply reassuring for internet users. What the ruling means is that neither the government nor anyone else has carte blanche when demanding data from Internet companies. When a party resists an absurd subpoena, the legal process of the United States’ justice system can be an effective check on such demands and a protector of its citizens.

==== FCC Guidelines ====
In October 2009 the FCC issued a press release proposing a set of rules governing net neutrality. Though the rules are not yet solidified and are still at a proposal stage, they aim to limit an ISP’s network management techniques on their networks in the name of net neutrality. The proposal includes a set of six rules, three of which govern the restriction of ISPs from tampering with a user’s content, applications or devices being used on the Internet.  The other three rules deal with fair competition, lawful content being passed through the Internet, and transparency as it relates to ISPs’ network practices. Each rule, however, contains a clause that is “Subject to reasonable network management”, which effectively leaves a gray area and still allows ISPs to perform reasonable network management practices such as traffic throttling during peak times (FCC, 2009).
The move by the FCC is a huge step towards net neutrality and Internet governance as a whole. In fact, this is probably the biggest step taken by the United States government in terms of regulation of the Internet. The FCC’s proposal has certainly set a precedent in United States Internet policy. This is significant because it paves the way for the possibility of further regulation in the future, such as with Congress and federal network neutrality laws.
Traditionally, the Internet in the United States was largely left at the mercy of the ISPs. The market has generally done well at keeping ISPs and other participants of the Internet honest and fair. The latest and most profound example of this is Comcast’s decision to throttle BitTorrent traffic in its network. After massive public outcry and public protest (as well as a nudge from the FCC in the form of an official investigation), Comcast decided to reverse its stance on BitTorrent traffic and become “protocol agnostic”. (FCC, 2009) Though the FCC did play a slight contribution in Comcast’s decision, the governing agency traditionally has not been strict on network management practices used by ISPs. The FCC’s new guidelines aim to demonstrate a stricter stance towards ISPs and their network management practices in the name of net neutrality.
In the face of all the support for maintaining the status quo of US/ICANN control of internet governance there are others that feel that a multinational organization is a better solution for Internet Governance.  Former Secretary General of the United Nations Kofi Annan is focused on the inclusion of developing nations in the process and procedures for navigating the current Internet Governance Structure and feels that the United Nations or similar body could help bridge that gap (Porteus, 2005).

==== International Governance debate ====
International governance of the internet has a lot of questions that still need to be looked into before it can be determined whether or not governance on an international level is achievable or needed (Einar Himma, 2008).  There is debate over whether the internet should be subject to any restrictions.  If there should be restrictions, who and what determines what restrictions are justified?  How are international restrictions enforced?
It is pointless for one country to try and regulate the internet (Zizic, 2000). A country trying to regulate this internet can do more harm than good to itself.  E-Commerce sites could potentially move out of the country due to regulations imposed by the country the E-Commerce site resides in (Bick, 2006).  Different countries have drastically different positions on content regulations.  China and Saudia Arabia have very tight controls on what can and cannot be viewed on the internet. Content is filtered by country level proxy servers.  The country level proxy servers have large databases of blocked sites.  The government controls what websites are added to these databases (Einar Himma, 2008). The problem with this content system is sites that should not be block are.  An example would be a site with the word “breast” being used in a medical term.  The filtering system would block this site from being viewed. In contrast the United States and Europe have a very open policy (Reporters without Borders, 2006).
Legislation with a country has been a relatively effective way to govern the internet.  The United States banning internet gambling is an example of this.  While any gambling sites within the United States would have to comply with the legislation, sites who were outside of the United States boarders would not.  How the United States government worked a way to close this loop hole was to enact the Unlawful Internet Gambling Act of 2006.  This act made it illegal for US based banks and credit card companies to process payments to gambling sites.
“No person engaged in the business of betting or wagering may knowingly accept, in connection with the participation of another person in unlawful Internet gambling (1) credit, or the proceeds of credit, extended to or on behalf of such other person (including credit extended through the use of a credit card); (2) an electronic fund transfer, or funds transmitted by or through a money transmitting business, or the proceeds of an electronic fund transfer or money transmitting service, from or on behalf of such other person” (The Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006).
Another case that proves the effectiveness of nations using their own legislation to govern the internet in their country is the LIRCA v. Yahoo! Inc.

==== LICRA v. Yahoo! Inc ====
Ligue contre le racisme et l'antisémitisme et Union des étudiants juifs de France c. Yahoo! Inc. et Societe Yahoo! France (LICRA v. Yahoo!) is a court case that was brought in front of France’s High Court in 2000.  The complaint involved the sale of Nazi memorabilia on Yahoo!’s auction sites.   Nazi memorabilia falls under Article R645-1 of the French Criminal Code. This code prohibits the public display of any insignia, emblem, or uniform which was worn by organizations that have been convicted of crimes against humanity.  Yahoo!’s defense was that their company is based in the United States and primary target audience are US residents. 
The French court found Yahoo! was providing illegal services under French law.  Yahoo! Inc was given orders to take all appropriate measures to block access to Nazi memorabilia to French residents.  Yahoo! Inc argued that is was almost impossible to comply with the courts order.
Instead of appealing the French Courts decision, Yahoo! Inc decided to bring the case to the United States Court system.  The United States District Court of the Northern District of California in San Jose agreed with Yahoo! Inc. The Court found that the decision returned by the tribunal de grande instance of Paris infringed upon Yahoo! Inc’s First Amendment right given by the United States Constitution.
LICRA appealed the decision by the District Court.  The appeal fell on the bench of the United States Court of Appeals for 9th Circuit.  The Appeals Court over turned the ruling of the District Court.  The Court ruled that &quot;France is within its rights as a sovereign nation to enact hate speech laws against the distribution of Nazi propaganda in response to its terrible experience with Nazi forces during World War II. Similarly, LICRA and UEJF are within their rights to bring suit in France against Yahoo! for violation of French speech law. The only adverse consequence experienced by Yahoo! as a result of the acts with which we are concerned is that Yahoo! must wait for LICRA and UEJF to come to the United States to enforce the French judgment before it is able to raise its First Amendment claim. However, it was not wrongful for the French organizations to place Yahoo! in this position.

|-
| Plaintiff || Liskula Cohen || Alberto R. Gonzalez || LICRA
|-
| Defendant || Google, Inc. and/or its subsidiary Blogger.com || Google, Inc. || Yahoo! Inc
|-
| Reason for Suing  || Cohen claimed that an anonymous blogger on a subsidiary site of Google made defamatory remarks.  As a result of the plaintiff wanted the defendant to produce information to aid in identification of the blogger or be held liable for any damages as a result of the case. || Bush administration demanding that Google and other search engines turn over aggregate search information to help revive a child protection law. Google refused to comply with the subpoena and a motion was filed in January of 2006 by US Department Of Justice to force Google to hand over the data || French Law prohibits the public display of any insignia, emblem, or uniform which was worn by organizations that have been convicted of crimes against humanity. Yahoo! Inc's auctions allowed French residents to view such memorabilia. French Court ordered Yahoo! Inc to block access to all auctions involving such memorabilia
|-
| Outcome || Google was not required to produce any information nor were they deemed liable for any damages to the plaintiff in this case.  Google was determined not to be liable as a result of an electronic signature of privacy information that releases Google from liability. || On March 17th of 2006 Federal Judge, James Ware ruled that Google did not have to release any information to the government as its subpoena shows limited use for the information being gathered. || Yahoo! Inc filed suit in the US Court system.  Yahoo!'s claim was that the French ruling infringed upon the US Constitution's First Amendment.  US Appeals Court ruled France has a right to enforce it's laws.

|-
| Impact on Internet Governance || The court’s decision to accept electronic signature and a binding agreement and to protect the anonymity of its users in this case helps to set precedence going forward on similar cases in the future. || The governance of the internet is still in the hands of the users. There may not be any rules and regulations but specific incidents like this case set precedence for how the government needs to approach requesting information from ISP’s and content providers. Consumer privacy is still a major contributor to how much the government can use ISP’s and content providers as watch dogs. || This case creates a precedent that one Country's law can affect how internet companies can conduct business.

=== &quot;Debate over Governance Control&quot; ===
The debate over Internet governance control is one that is becoming increasingly important as the popularity of the Internet continues to rise. There is a tendency to think of governance control as a debate between all of the different countries that are connected to the Internet. After all, legal systems that are formed in various countries have jurisdiction only to the extent of that particular country’s geographical borders. It would be logical to assume that the Internet would fall under the same constraints. In some ways, this notion is not incorrect. Laws and general Internet governance within a particular country can only extend to that country’s population. The United States’ Can-Spam Act, for example, cannot enforce its email and spam rules in other countries. This creates an inherent problem within the realm of Internet governance because of conflicting laws between different countries.
The Internet itself developed from the American ARAPNET, and agencies such as ICANN are headquartered in the United States. Thus the United States plays a very large part in the governance of the Internet despite it being just a single country among a multitude of others participating in the Internet. For this reason, there is increasing pressure by the International community for more of a multinational approach to Internet governance. The following discussion will examine three main approaches as possible solutions to the ongoing governance of the Internet.

==== Utopian Suggestion ====
The implementation of a global consortium similar to the United Nations will allow any and all decisions pertaining to the governance of the Internet to be made by the best minds available all working towards the common goal of providing the best possible services.
Using a global organization will help to eliminate the ill-conceived perception that the internet can be governed by anyone company, or government and that the rules of the internet are subject to change by its source or destination.

==== Dystopian but Practical Suggestion ====
Dividing the governance of the internet to be unique to the region of its source or destination would allow for maximum control of content and accountability of resources and usage.
The dystopian view of Internet governance would shift the majority of control away from the United States and towards all of the individual countries involved with the Internet. Separation of ownership of the internet will make its governance not dissimilar from current laws that change from country to country.  This will put the responsibility of maintaining compliance with the web surfer and content providers.  This will be akin to international travel and being subject to the laws of the country or in this case the network that they happen to have traveled to.
The advantage to this governance structure is that each country will be able to establish its own unique regulations to govern their portion of the Internet. As mentioned, this would not be unlike the current system set in place and thus there should not be any large interruption with the way each country handles Internet regulation. A multinational approach would also create a system whereby each country involved with the Internet has an equal amount of control, which might help to ease tensions between various countries struggling to increase their prominence over the Internet. Furthermore, it is possible that decentralized control of the Internet may result in increased redundancy of the Internet’s various services, as well as preventing a single country--the United States--from maintaining too much control over the Internet from other countries’ perspectives.
Separation of power does not come without its disadvantages. Because a central point of control over the Internet (the United States) would no longer exist, the reliability of worldwide Internet access may suffer, and there may be a significant interruption of service during the period of reallocation. This system would also require more cooperation between a much larger number of participating countries, which may prove to be very difficult to maintain, especially considering the participation of historically problematic countries such as North Korea and China. With decentralization and increased control between individual countries, political disputes could escalate into denial of service attacks or worse: fragmentation of the Internet itself. To a certain degree, centralized control can prevent this from happening, but decentralization would most likely be problematic in this regard.

==== Real Suggestion ====
Maintenance of the status quo will ensure the consistency of the Internet.  This will ensure that services are not interrupted and that the flow of information and money is not interrupted. Within this perspective, governance and regulation reflect the representation of the material stakes of different interest groups such as industry and commerce, profession, scientists, religious groups and so forth who are active within a social setting. In its simplest form, the model attributes core interests to specific groups over specific issues (Macmillan 2003).
 
Keeping ICANN and North America as a hub for Internet communications will help to ensure that the quality of service is not interrupted.
Recommendation:
In the wake of the various development that have been happing globally pertaining to Internet governance and the overall control and future of the Internet a global consortium is our recommendation for a robust solution for maintaining control of the Internet.  Globalization is dissolving borders in finance and politics, language barriers are slowly crumbling and the implementation of this worldwide organization will further compliment the steps to a unified world both on and off line.

=== Summary ===
 I.            What is Internet Governance
a.      Governance: Relates to decisions that define expectations, grant power, or verify performance. It consists either of a separate process or of a specific part of management or leadership processes. Sometimes people set up a government to administer these processes and systems.
                                                              i.      Good Governance
1.      Participation
2.      Transparency
3.      Responsiveness
4.      Consensus Orientation or Understanding
5.      Accountability
b.      The Internet: A global system of interconnected computer networks that use the standard Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP) to serve billions of users worldwide. It is a network of networks that consists of millions of private and public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope that are linked by a broad array of electronic and optical networking technologies.
c.       Internet Governance: The definition of Internet governance has been contested by differing groups across political and ideological lines. One of the main debates concerns the authority and participation of certain actors, such as national governments and corporate entities, to play a role in the Internet's governance.
     II.            Governing Bodies of the Internet
a.       International Telecommunication Union (ITU)
b.      International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC)
c.       International Standards Organization (ISO)
d.      Institute for Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)
e.       Internet Architecture Board (IAB)
f.       The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)
g.       The Internet Society (ISOC)
h.      World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)
i.        Internet Corporation for Name &amp; Numbers (ICANN)
j.        National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)    
   III.            Debate over Governance Control
a.       Multinational Control: A Global consortium working together to manage, develop and organize the internet for the greater good of the many. 
b.      Regional Control: Each regional stakeholder will organize their own methods and mechanism for governance. 

=== Discussion and Recommendations ===
In the wake of the various development that have been happing globally pertaining to Internet governance and the overall control and future of the Internet a global consortium is our recommendation for a robust solution for maintaining control of the Internet.  Globalization is dissolving borders in finance and politics, language barriers are slowly crumbling and the implementation of this worldwide organization will further compliment the steps to a unified world both on and off line.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''CHAPTERS: Active Chapters and Candidate Chapters'''

Authors should write about the sociotechnical aspects of the subjects, not about all aspects of them.

=== Introduction ===

==== Brief History  ====
Net neutrality is not a new concept relative to the age of the Internet; its roots are embedded within the founders.  Net Neutrality refers to a guiding principle that preserves the free and open Internet with no discrimination.  It makes it such that an Internet Service Provider (ISP) cannot discriminate the speed of the connection - or lack there of - to one content provider versus another (Eudes 2008). When the Internet was first invented, founders wanted to be sure that it was to provide a safe haven for the transportation of information without any biases.  They wanted to ensure that all people had a consistent way to access to the Internet would be able use the Internet; regardless of their connection and social status (Margulius, 2003).
Net Neutrality has two polarizing factions; those who are in favor, and those who are not.  On this topic there is not a middle ground.  Those who are in favor of Net Neutrality consist of organizations like Microsoft, Google, and other content providers.  Those who are against Net Neutrality are generally made of telecommunication network organizations and/or ISPs (Owen 2007). 
The roots of Network Neutrality have been pointed towards the 1887 Act to Regulate Commerce.  Within this law exists the following verbiage:
&quot;It shall be unlawful for any common carrier subject to the provisions of this act to make or give any undue or unreasonable preference or advantage to any particular person, company, firm, corporation, or locality, or any particular description of traffic, in any respect whatsoever, or to subject any particular person, company, firm, corporation…”
Initially this law was to regulate the railroad system.  At that time, certain rail lines were being accused of charging different fees based on the content of the object transported.  They also were being accused of taking a longer time to route the content to delivery based on who was asking for the item to be shipped.  This made the rail business extremely inconsistent and unfair.  As the legal system looks towards precedent when reviewing a legal case, proponents of network neutrality look towards this law as the foundation for network neutrality; whereas people against network neutrality see this as a completely different case in a completely different line of business.  However, some ISPs wish that they can apply the precedent which was set by Benjamin Franklin in which he would not carry or deliver newspapers which came from competing publishers (Johnson, 2006).

==== Reasons for being in favor of network neutrality ====
The reasons that people are in favor of net neutrality is because they want to make it such that they are preventing a monopoly from happening within the last mile of connection.  The last mile is the final leg of delivering connectivity from a communications provider to a customer (http://goingwimax.com).  At this point within the transportation of a packet, it has to reach through many service providers’ equipment.  What people are worried about is that a provider, who owns the physical cable lines in a given space, would charge a higher amount for a certain content provider to deliver its services versus another.  This would make the content providers’ cost of doing business to go up.  Going into the idea of preventing the last mile monopoly, content providers want to keep ambiguity down as ambiguity is inherent within risk.  If a content provider relies on a last mile provider to distribute their services, they would have to be paying for the service.  However, the last mile provider could unexpectedly increase their rates which were not accounted for within the content providers’ budget.  This could throw off the content providers’ business which can lead to incorrect projections of profitability. 

==== Reasons for not being in favor of network neutrality ====
As stated above, Internet Service Providers (ISPs) are not in favor of net neutrality.  A specific reason that they would like to be sure that net neutrality does not exist is so that they can gain the ability to offer tiered services.  They want to offer tiered services because they believe that a user should be able to pay for the quality of service provided to them (in terms of throughput).  Instead of offering a flat level of service (in terms of throughput) for all customers (both content providers and end users, the ISPs would like to offer different tiers of service.  They want to provide a content provider with a guaranteed level of service based on the tier that which they are willing to pay.  For a top tier service, this would allow that content provider for be able to provide their content at a fast rate to its users.  It would also let content providers, who do not want to pay for an extremely high level of throughput, to be able to save money by not paying for a high level.  People for net neutrality argue that this would provide a disadvantage to content providers who cannot afford top-tier services.  However ISPs already say that this form of increased level of service already exists when there is a content provider who has thousands of services strategically placed throughout the world. They have the ability to provide a consistently high level of service to its users due to physical access in relation to the users’ location.  ISPs think that because this already exists that it should not a problem; offering tiered services. 
Another reason that ISPs are against net neutrality is because they believe that by offering the tiered services, they will have the ability to offer a higher level of service to their subscribers through tiered filtration.  By offering different tiers that users can opt in and out off, users will be signing up for the service that they are happy with.  The ISP can better throttle its bandwidth as people will be in different tiers.  If a user subscribes to a low level of throughput then they will be paying for a low level of throughput and they will suffice with receiving a low level of throughput because they paid for it.  Likewise, if a user subscribes for a high level of throughput then they will be paying a higher fee and will be content with the high level of throughput.    Throughout this chapter we will be exploring the different aspects and impacts of net neutrality.  The various aspects that we will be covering will include the economics of net neutrality, the technicalities of net neutrality, past and current regulation of net neutrality, a suggestion on how to end the debate on net neutrality, and finally the conclusion about net neutrality. 
 
=== Economics of Network Neutrality ===

==== Existing Benefits from Net Neutrality and Open Access ====

Before a decision can be reached whether to impose regulation on the Internet or not, or whether to advocate for Net Neutrality, one must understand the current state of the Internet and its benefits to those that have a final saying, these being the end-users. The Internet has come a long way and has emerged as perhaps the best innovation in modern age. The Internet seems to have endless possibilities and it seems as if everything is possible. However, the debate over Net Neutrality could possibly alter further possibilities and pose a risk to innovation on the Internet. 

It is important to understand that the Internet came to be because the telecommunications markets were not allowed to provide “electronic data processing and data communications services (now know as “information services”) on an integrated basis” (Roycroft, 2006). Moreover, due to this fact of separation of the telecommunications markets and the information services markets the creation of the Internet was made possible. The initial start of the Internet was the dial-up access and this produced a “mass-market means of accessing the Internet,” which along with it fostered competition in the market. Because of the competition among providers, the customer was able to choose among a preferred Internet provider to access the Internet. From there on, the Internet grew step by step. Among many factors that contributed to the growth of the Internet was the factor of “flat rate” rates that were first imposed on the Internet, thus attracting more consumers and creating the mass-market and fostering competition (Roycroft, 2006).

With open access to the Internet, the end-user certainly has the final say about how much of the Internet he or she will use. It is important to keep this important fact in mind when deciding whether or not to impose regulation on the Internet. Open access has tremendous benefits because it does no allow one service provider, such as AT&amp;T and Verizon, to dominate the market and decide what is available on the Internet and how much content is available. Through the open access to the Internet companies/organizations are able to increase their consumer market, and it is possible to connect to users worldwide. Open and standard protocols such as web browsing, e-mail, search engines, and e-commerce are great examples of benefits from open access to the Internet because no one company/organization has the ability to “determine which applications, content, or services should be allowed to use the Internet” (Roycroft, 2006)

==== Competition Between Internet Service Providers and Internet Content, Services, and Applications ====
As the common carriage principle implies, one must offer its services if the user is willing and able to pay for those services. According to an example from Professor Lee McKnight, if a ferry carries people across a river and it charges a certain price, then it cannot refuse anyone who is able to pay for the ferry to take them across the river. Similar is the case in the Network Neutrality discussion. An access provider such as AT&amp;T should not be allowed to discriminate against and refuse access to content providers like YouTube and Google. 

However, that is why the Network Neutrality debate has received a great amount of attention and continues to be a hot topic to date. The Internet, for many across the globe, is seen as a gateway to acquire information and be able to educate oneself about current events as well as stay in touch with friends and family across the world. Nonetheless, it is in the Internet access provider’s power-that is, if Network Neutrality is abandoned and regulation is imposed on the Internet-to dictate whether end-users across the globe will be able to freely download and view information on the Internet as it has been done to this day, or whether they will only be able to acquire certain information at certain speeds. Moreover, should Internet regulation be imposed, discriminatory pricing and choice of content providers will surface, thus imposing exclusion. Exclusion occurs when an Internet access provider chooses one content provider over another, YouTube over iFilm for example, thus resulting in the exclusion of iFilm (Hemphill, 2008).

In addition to exclusion, Internet regulation could also prove harmful for innovation and innovators because it could influence potential Internet access providers to use extraction as a way to cash in more money. Due to threats of exclusion, one Internet access provider benefits from applications from competitors and charges both content providers for access to premium Internet connections (Hemphill, 2008). On the other hand, an Internet provider will most likely try to extract rather than to exclude because the benefits from applications are greater and it is more likely that competitors will compete for the number of applications as well as quality, thus fostering competition through extraction. However, the party that benefits most is the Internet access provider. 

==== Risk to Innovation if Net Neutrality Factors Are Abandoned ====
Innovation is a key principle associated with network neutrality and through open and neutral internet access innovation is able to prosper and provide so much more to users around the globe. Innovation with the help of the Internet’s open and unregulated access has been responsible, and continues to be responsible for how we live our lives today. For instance, before the internet was born, many of the tasks were done physically and required a larger number of employees. A retail bookseller, such as Borders would have a physical location which buyers would be able to visit and purchase books. 
	
However, now that the Internet is here, the same buyers are able to purchase the books online and get it faster than ever, especially with the use of a Sony’s Kindle eReader, for example. Also, let us take into consideration Amazon.com, which is the leader when it comes to purchasing products online. Amazon has a great deal of products available, from books to clothing, and buyers are able to sign on the website, without leaving their homes, and purchase any necessities they might require. Such examples are worth mentioning because these innovations would perhaps not be possible on a regulated network. It may have not been possible because in addition to start-up costs for organizations such as Amazon, additional costs from service providers-AT&amp;T, Verizon, and Comcast-could have discouraged the opening of such an online retail giant. 

Abandoning network neutrality factors will certainly alter innovation due to threats of exclusion and extraction. It is perhaps safe to say that the best innovations are produced with open and uncontrollable surroundings, or when the mind is allowed to operate freely without any constraints. Another online giant is worth mentioning here, and that is Google. Google allows its employees to freely work on whatever they please twenty percent of the employees’ time in the day, and in turn the innovations belong to the company. GMail is one example that resulted from such an incentive. However, now that Google is a dominant force in in various aspects, imposing regulation on the Internet would perhaps not slow this Internet giant down. If there is regulation imposed on the content providers, larger organizations like Google will be able to continue to dominate the Internet, and organizations like Yahoo! could be facing the threat of exclusion. 

On the other hand, should there be no regulation imposed on the Internet both companies could continue to innovate and provide users with ways for a more efficient use of the Internet. So, as a result it is evident that when no constraints or regulations are put into place at times, the results can be rewarding to every Internet user in the world. An open and free Internet has been the foundation of innovation and it can certainly continue to benefit users and contribute to innovation. 

==== Economies of Scale, Sunk Costs, and Barriers to Entry ====
It is clear as to why Internet service providers, AT&amp;T, Verizon, and Comcast want to see regulation imposed on content providers, Google, YouTube, Wikipedia, etc. because these content providers are able to stream content, services, and applications to users and earn a great deal of money, while using the Internet access providers’ lines. Let’s look at how these Internet access providers already earn their revenues. According to a recent analysis by the Government Accountability Office (GAO), it has found a duopoly in the highly concentrated market for broadband access. A closer look at the market reveals that residents of the United States of America get their broadband access from either of the two service companies in the duopoly, one being the telephone company DSL, and the other being the cable company Cable Modem service (Roycroft, 2006).  Due the fact of a duopoly in the broadband market last-mile competition-delivering the final connectivity from an Internet access provider to the customer-is non-existent. Economists believe this is caused by certain entry barriers, which are discussed in more detail below. 

Entry barriers are not necessarily high or low, but there are factors that come into play that certainly play a role in discouraging others from providing last-mile competition. Let’s take some of these factors into consideration. Economies of scale tend to play a vital role that discourages entry into the broadband market. When talking about economies of scale in the broadband market we talk about the proximity of the users, and the best possible solutions to efficiently connect users. Whether the users reside in rural or suburban areas is important because in order to lower the costs of building a network it is better if the users are closer to one another as well as having a larger number of users present in one given area. Such economies of scale will offer certain benefits, it will be cheaper to build one network that will connect more users in one given area, and it will also provide a better incentive to build a network since there are a large number of users in that area.

On the other hand, if there is fewer users and they reside in a rural area, it quickly becomes difficult and expensive to provide connection to these users. To provide connections to users in rural areas it is important to take int consideration certain geographic characteristics, such as the terrain, soil conditions, and weather extremes, and the fact that it will take a significantly large amount of cable that will need to be extended from the network facility to the users, adding to the costs. Geographic characteristics are vital as they represent sunk costs as well. Running cable from the network to the users involves digging into the ground, connecting wires from pole to pole, digging into streets, and so on, which are not recoverable should the business fail. However, if a company is able to succeed in its process to compete in last-mile connectivity, the telephone and cable companies are able to exclude the newcomer by lowering their prices to the users until the new competitor exits the market (Roycroft, 2006). 

It is important to note that not only is it discouraging to enter the broadband market, but also that the current companies have a clear advantage and are reluctant to new competitors. Due to the duopoly in the broadband market, why is it not fair for content providers to fight for open and unregulated Internet access? Do Internet providers have the right to seek regulation? Network neutrality will continue to be a heated debate for years to come and those arguing in the favor of net neutrality will succeed because the Internet has come a long way since its introduction in the mid-90s, and it accounts for a great deal of innovation and success throughout the world.

==== Market Power and the Supply and Demand for Technology and Internet Traffic ====
It is evident that there is an increase in the demand for newer and more efficient technological devices and the complementary Internet use. With the introduction of certain products such as the PDAs and more recently the Blackberry and the iPhone certain tasks have become much simpler, and people are able to be more productive as well. Perhaps it is not always appropriate to use Google as an example, but it is a dominant online giant in many aspects and the name Google certainly cannot be left out when talking about search engines. Although Google is not the first search engine that was introduced to the market, it is definitely the most popular one today. 

Advances in technology have enabled innovations such as the Google search engine, the online auction giant eBay, one of the biggest online retail book sellers Amazon, and so on. In addition to these innovations comes the increase in demand for even newer and more advanced ways in which tasks can be made simpler for everyday Internet users. The introduction of web conferencing, for example, has allowed organizations to lower travel costs and connect its users via the use of the Internet, and similar innovations are needed for organizations to lower costs and increase productivity. The Internet has also made it possible for employees to work from home, which in turn has been responsible for increased employee productivity. There is an increase in the demand for products such as those mentioned above because they are not labeled as luxury products, but rather necessities. Products such as a smartphone certainly is a necessity because it allows users to do various tasks, such as access to e-mail, the Internet, etc. while they are on the go.

Moreover, we are experiencing an increase in the demand for Internet usage. Users from all corners of the world seek equal access to the Internet for educational purposes as well as gaining knowledge of the world’s events. Facebook, a social networking cite that has the ability to connect users from one end of the globe to the other, consistently experiences high volumes of traffic due to the fact that people like to stay connected and be able to communicate to others on different levels. The previous examples are results of competition and innovation with a free Internet and why it is important not to let Internet access providers gain too much market power. 

Should these access providers gain too much market power, users will experience rather slow Internet speeds and connections as well as experience higher rates for accessing the Internet. In addition, with too much market power the ability of doing business with other companies in the market will not exist, and Internet access may be available only to those high-tier users in the market, according to the article “Four nightmares for net neutrality” by Shane Greenstein. Network neutrality is important and it needs to preserved, otherwise changing the Internet as it is now can have various implications, such as excluding a great deal of the population and significantly decreasing the use of the Internet. However, this debate will continue to demand large amount of attention from officials and anyone involved in the process. Satisfying everyone in this market is impossible, and this debate will not be resolved in the near future. It will be interesting to see as to how the Obama administration will try to resolve this debate and provide solutions to the issue. Hopefully the process will not involve Internet access providers spending money on lobbying officials in the government to regulate Internet access.

=== Technicalities of Network neutrality ===
==== Discrimination on Internet ====
The extent to which network operators should be allowed to discriminate among Internet packet to block selectively, adjust price or quality of service is one of the most fundamental issue in the network neutrality debate (Peha,2007).The networks favor some traffic orpacket streams over others by using variety of data differentiation techniques or algorithms.
There are various methods by which the ISP’s are able to discriminate, by determining which types of packets are in the network. The first type is flow classification, ISP’s are able to determine the nature of packet by examining the amount of time since the packet stream began, theamount of time between consecutive packets, and the sizes of packets in astream (Peha,2007). The information about every packetstream going through the network can be maintained by using the second methodcalled as deep packet inspection. It can categorize traffic based, not just on what it can learn from the packet it is currently handling but also on the combination of the content of many consecutive packets (Peha, 2007). Instead of looking only at the information needed to get the packet to its destination, using deep packet inspection a device is aware of the information at the application layer as illustrated in Table 1.1

Table is adapted from a table mentioned in 'The Benefits and Risks of Mandating Network Neutrality' by Peha.

==== Types of Discrimination ====
===== Minimal vs. Non-minimal Discrimination =====
This is a type of network discrimination, which discards packets by assigning priorities to the packets, and always discards the packet with lowest priority (Felten, 2006). When it is absolutely necessary a network discards packets it is called minimal discrimination, because only when it can’t serve everybody the network discriminates (Felten, 2006). In minimaldiscrimination if the network is not crowded, lots of low-priority packets canget through; the low-priority packet inconvenienced only when there is anunavoidable conflict with high-priority packets  (Crowcroft, 2007).
In contrast, non-minimal discrimination is more drastic form of discrimination in which even when it is possible to deliver or forward every packet routers discards some low-priority packets (Felten, 2006). For example even if 80% part of network capacity is idle, a router might limit low-priority packets to 20% of thenetwork’s capacity (Felten, 2006).
It is decided which packets to be discarded or not with the help of different traffic control algorithms. The first type is scheduling algorithm in which it determines how often packets from agiven stream are transmitted, and when each waiting packet is actually transmitted (Peha, 2007). Using a dropping algorithm, it will select some packets to be discarded when the number of waiting packets becomes too large (Peha, 2007). In traffic shaping algorithm so that packets are spread out sothat they do not arrive in a single large burst (Peha,2007). And finally an admission control algorithm on the grounds that it would not be possible to meet QoS requirements for the new packet stream if this new stream were admitted and the current streams it may block entire packet streams temporarily (Peha,2007). 
===== Delay Discrimination =====
Discrimination can also work by reordering or delaying packet streams it always doesn’t haveto operate by dropping packets (Felten, 2006). Where a packet should be forwarded next is decided by using routing algorithm thus achieving delay discrimination (Peha, 2007). Some packets with low priority might besent the slow way, while others with high priority may be sent over the mostreliable path and quickest  (Crowcroft, 2007).
“A network operator might discriminate by providing unequal access to various services (Peha,2007).” Delay discrimination is useful for those who broadcast media streams such as music or video to multiple users simultaneously over the Internet (Goldsborough, 2008). Delay discrimination also works giving better access of information caches to some users, so that internet content need not have to be retrieved from remote part of the network but can be done locally (Lehr, Gillet,Sirbu, &amp; Peha, 2007).Other users may be charged more or not even allowed for using that network associated caches (Lehr, Gillet, Sirbu, &amp; Peha, 2007).

==== The Benefits of Discrimination ====
There are several benefits for discrimination and it ranges from securityto quality of service control.
One of the most important benefits of discrimination on network level is security. A network operator can determine whether a packet stream is carrying a virus or a dangerous piece of spyware by using deep packet inspection (Peha, 2007). It would be a huge damage to network security if a network neutrality policy that prohibits networks from dropping dangerous traffic/packet stream of this kind.
The network can prevent customers from using equipment which would hinder their neighbors’ traffic by ensuring that only authorized devices are attached to thenetwork  (Peha, 2007). The devices may access adult-only material contrary, or that consumes more of the shared resources than is allowed contrast to the customer’s stated wishes (Peha,2007). Different applications have different QoS needs so discrimination with respect to QoS is also important (Peha,2007) (Felten, 2006). So it is not required to give equal access to all services.
Pricing also plays an important role in congestion control by using price discrimination. There are quantifiable advantages of price discrimination over more traditional technical approaches; it is done by convincing some users to delay their transmissions by adjusting prices dynamically basedon congestion levels (Peha,2007).
The internet traffic is increasing at tremendous rate. This flow of data/traffic can suffer from congestion at a number of points on the internet. The increasing use of multimedia technology is worsening the congestion of the flow of data/traffic.“An internet user attempting to retrieve a file from a file repository in another country will generally be unable to tell whether the dominant cause ofcongestion is the hardware at the file repository, or the various network links between the repository and the user (Gibson, 1998).” Thus, the effect on internet users isgenerally the same, although the distinction between hardware and data/traffic congestion is important to internet providers  (Gibson, 1998). Thus by discriminating the ISP’s canprovide better service to maximum of the customers.

==== The Risks of Discrimination ====
In the previous section we talked about the benefits but there can be huge consequences to discrimination if it is not properly monitored.
One of the serious risks with discrimination is that it may lead to protecting legacy services from competition. In the current ISP market cable and telephone companies are dominant broadband providers. In this case without any network neutrality the ISP’scan block the traffic or degrade the QoS for rival services (Peha, 2007) (Grossman, 2009). For e.g., a telephone company can degrade the VoIP services forcing customers to use traditional telephone services, as well this can be the case with cable companies for degrading streaming videos (Goldsborough, 2008) (Crowcroft, 2007) (Felten, 2006).
Discrimination may also lead to charging oligopoly rents in the broadband. In this scenario the ISP’s may be able to maximize their profit depending on the will of the customers to pay for particular services (Peha, 2007). This would lead to degrading services for customers who pay less. By using the above statement it can be said that the scenario of internet access without net neutrality regulation would look like as figure shown below:

Figure 1.1: Internet Plan charging different value for different sites
&lt;gallery&gt;
File:Example.jpg|Creative commons material, Retrieved from: http://www.flickr.com/photos/barrettb/4080341641/sizes/m/
&lt;/gallery&gt;




As well discrimination may even lead to charging oligopoly rents competitive upstream market. Firstly an upstream market in this situation is ane-commerce market (Peha, 2007). For e.g., an ISP if not restricted can lead to charging extra for every book sold online, just because it is allowing its customers to visit that particular site (Crowcroft,2007).
Too much of discrimination on Internet may lead to stifling of free speech. This would play an important role in political environment for reasons varying from raising campaign donations to extreme cases like avoiding access to sites having contradictory views on certain political candidate (Peha, 2007). 

==== Misleading Characterizations of the Network Neutrality Issue ====
Banning all discrimination should not be a network neutrality policy (Peha, 2007). As we have seen previously discriminating is also used in benefiting customers for improving security, QoS etc.
Protecting the rights or “freedoms” of consumers should not be a network neutrality policy (Peha, 2007). FCC has endorsed freedom for internet user; under which consumers should have the ability to receive meaningful information about their service plans, attach the devices of their choice, run the applications and they can also access any legal content they want  (Powell, 2004). However if regulation for network neutrality is to be approved it has to be based on behavior of network operators and not the freedom of consumers (Peha, 2007).
Not just “who pays” for Internet service or infrastructure should be a clause for network neutrality policy (Peha, 2007). Today, the cost for the last-mile service providedby network operator is paid directly by both consumers and content providers. However,some network operators argue that content providers pay only for their own last-mile connection thus getting a “free ride”  (Peha, 2007). This is the same where both sender and receiver pay for “air time,” using cellular telephone calls in the U.S., which is accepted without any problem.
“Network neutrality should not be about whether network operators can differentiate their services (Peha, 2007).” In regions with only one broadband provider differentiation is not a big issue, but in today’s market situation with rigorous competition a network neutrality policy would turn broadband access into a commodity if it prevents a network operator from offering a unique set of services  (Sidak, 2006).

=== Net Neutrality Regulation ===
==== Telecommunications Regulation ====
The Telecommunications Act of 1996 was not the first piece of legislation enacted which directly affected service providers. It was the original act, which in 1934 established the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). In that act, specific functions and powers were granted to the FCC, which would determine what extent the FCC would be able to promulgate its powers. 
As previously mentioned, in 1996, the United States government affixed the first set of amendments to the Telecommunications Act of 1934. The purpose of the legislation as stated in the bill was to “promote competition and reduce regulation in order to secure lower prices and higher quality services for American telecommunications consumers and encourage the rapid deployment of new telecommunications technologies” (Telecommunications Act 1996, 1996, §1).  In order to rapidly develop and deploy new technologies, the 1996 bill would set forth rules and guidelines that would facilitate local loop unbundling via facilities-based entry rather than service-based entry. This meant that incumbent service providers who owned landlines would be forced to give access to competing new service providers in order to foster competition and growth. Or least that was the intention of the bill.
However, enforcing such a practice would not go without sharp criticism as Bauer &amp; Bohlin (2008) noted, “ the Act sent mixed signals to regulators and industry, as some of the instruments envisioned to support the transition to local competition invited excessive forms of regulation”(Bauer &amp; Bohlin, 2008, p. 5).

==== First Incidents ====
Granted the issue of “net neutrality” had not risen into the public sphere until the early 21st century. Specific regulation containing language that was either for or against net neutrality, had yet to be constructed in the House or the Senate until mid 2000’s.  The following are some of the major events that would set the stage for how net neutrality legislation would be formulated and FCC policies promulgated.

===== Brand X =====
On June 27, 2005, the United States Supreme Court upheld a decision by the Federal Communications Commission on whether to classify cable companies as telecommunications service providers or information service providers. In that decision, an appellate court’s decision would be overturned, which had initially overturned the FCC’s decision. The Supreme Court in agreement with the findings of the Commission found that based on the functionality of the Internet, that “because Internet access provides a capability for manipulating and storing information, cable companies are classified as information service providers ”(National Cable v. Brand X, p.6, 2005). Quite simply what this means is since cable companies provide access to the Internet (via broadband), that is significantly faster than traditional dial-up services, and that those services allow for the manipulation, retrieval and storage of information, they should be classified as information service providers. Being a telecommunications provider, e.g. Telephone Company, would imply providing a service to customers where the transmission of the data is not manipulated, retrieved, or stored e.g., phone calls. This is important because if the Supreme Court had concluded that cable companies be classified as telecommunications providers, they would then be subject to the regulations of the FCC granted by the Telecommunications Act of 1934 as well as be subject to common carrier legislation that would force local loop unbundling as set forth in the Telecommunications Act of 1996. 

===== Madison River =====
In 2005, Madison River Communications, a telephone company operating in North Carolina, blocked port availability to customers using Vonage; an operator of Voice Over Internet Protocol (VOIP) phone services. At the behest of complaint filed by Vonage and investigation by the press, the FCC’s enforcement bureau set in motion an investigation on the complaint. The only noticeable action taken upon Madison was a $15,000 fine imposed by t the Federal Communications Commission and the signing of a consent decree by Madison River Communications.
Though resulting in a fine and signing of a consent decree, the settlement by no means indicated that the Madison River was willfully acknowledging any “factual or legal finding regarding any compliance or noncompliance with the requirements of the Act” (Consent Decree, p.3, 2005). This is important because though it would inhibit such future actions from, the decree was not formed as a legaly binding action.
Vonage, a broadband service provider, does not own physical landlines for transmitting phone calls. They operate their service by selling routers and a compatible handset that connects to their customers’ existing DSL modem(s). Vonage does not provide customers with a way to store, retrieve, or manipulate information rather they only provide a service where information is transferred in it original form (phone calls). According to the Supreme Court’s opinion in the Brand X case they might be classified as a telecommunications provider, however since they are operating over a broadband connection they are classified as information service providers.
Though discriminated against, Vonage was not subject to any of the discrete forms of discrimination mentioned in the previous section such as flow classification or deep packet inspection. Rather, it was a more blatant form of discrimination that prevented Vonage’s customers from actually using the service by preventing the Vonage routers from connecting to required servers on Madison Rivers’ network.

===== FCC Policy Statement of 2005 =====
With a model case, the dense and rapid growth of broadband escalated the importance and value of interconnectivity. In August 2005, shortly after the Madison River incident. The Federal Communications Commission released a policy statement in which it referred to The Telecommunications Act of 1934 which it stated that, “In section 706(a) of the Act, Congress charges the Commission with encouraging the deployment on a reasonable and timely basis of advanced telecommunications capability – broadband – to all Americans” (Policy Statement, 2005, p.2). In its interpretation, the FCC used the Act to reiterate its ancillary authority to regulate domestic telecommunications commerce. In that policy statement, the commission would enforce principles allowing its enforcement of broadband development and deployment. The statement was aimed at fostering competition, such that consumers are able to access the content and services and connect devices; granted they are lawful devices approved by the FCC. For the FCC, fostering competition meant consumers should have the rightful choice of multiple network, application, service and content providers that would appropriately foster a competitive and consumer driven market place. (Policy Statement, 2005, p.3)

===== Comcast =====
In 2007, Comcast replicated a similar action to that of Madison River Communications in which it willfully practiced discrimination. This time it was not against a service provider like Vonage, this time foul was voiced by consumers and operators of Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networks.  Initially Comcast strongly denied conducting such actions, however at the behest of an investigation by the associated press, Comcast admitted that it had it was in fact practicing reasonable network management. The actions against Comcast did not come swiftly as it did with Madison River. A hearing was held on February 25, 2008 in which Comcast's Executive Vice President defended the network management practices of his company but would deny blocking access to any content, service, or application provider. 
The hearing resulted in the FCC forcing Comcast to change its network management policies and discontinue the discriminatory packet management against P2P networks.
Unlike the Madison River incident, the type discrimination in this incident was deep packet inspection. It was not the reasonable traffic management practices that caught the attention of the FCC; rather it was the throttling of content from the torrent P2P networks. Much of content flowing through those networks was thought to be content that was competing directly with content that Comcast provided e.g. movies, music, and television shows.
Most recently, Comcast has settled a class action lawsuit with the operators of the bit-torrent network and has settled the matter for a sum 16 million dollars. Which results in a sum of roughly 16 dollars per plaintiff involved in the case.

===== Internet Non-Discrimination Act of 2006 (S. 2360) =====
Brought to the Senate by Democratic Senator of Oregon, Ron Wyden, the Non- Discrimination Act was the first piece of legislation introduced in Congress that directly tackled the arising issue of network neutrality. It laid out rules for actions following complaints of violations made to the FCC and it laid out penalties for those violations. Those violations would be punishable and promulgated by the FCC as stated in the Telecommunications Act of 1934.
The bill was ambitious in that it would specifically prevent network providers from offering superior service to companies whom they conduct business with, while providing inferior service to customers. It also set out quality of service provisions preventing network providers from prioritizing packets for customers regardless of geography or service agreements, putting service on a level field.  More importantly, the legislation would force network providers to clearly disclose its network management practices for consumers in its terms and agreements. (Internet Non- Discrimination, 2006, §4)
The proposed legislation, though ambitious, was only referred twice to the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation. The bill failed to gain any ground and did not pick up any co-sponsors. There has been no action on this bill on since, thus it never became law.
===== Network Neutrality Act of 2006 (H.R. 5273) =====
This bill was introduced by Democratic Representative Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts on May 2, 2006. Not introduced as an amendment to prior laws, this bill attempted to pick up where the Internet Non-Discrimination Act left off and contained much of the same non- discriminatory language that bill S. 2360 had contained.
One of the main provisions in this bill not included in the Non-Discrimination Act stated that operators shall have the right to “manage the functioning of its network, on a system wide basis, provided that any such management function does not result in discrimination between content, applications, or services offered by the provider and unaffiliated providers” (Network Neutrality, 2006, §4). It would also allow operators to reserve data prioritization rights in the event of an emergency. Overall, the tone of the bill was to reinforce the principles for regulating telecommunication commerce as stated in the Telecommunications Act of 1934. 
Providing for a little more flexibility than its predecessor, though containing much of the same language, the bill received support from 23 house representatives, including current Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi. However, like its predecessor it failed to pick up any ground and was only referred twice, once to the Committee on Energy and Commerce and once to the Subcommittee on Telecommunications and the Internet. 
===== Internet Freedom and Nondiscrimination Act of 2006 (H.R 5417) =====
Unlike the first two bills, this bill was introduced not as an amendment to the Telecommunications Act but to the Clayton Act, which covers anti-trust regulation. It would make all actions listed under the law illegal as a matter of competition among broadband providers.
The purpose of the act was the facilitation of trade and competition within the communication marketplace, with the aim of protecting consumers, and content providers from discriminatory network management practices. This bill, like the previous ones, contained much of the same non-discriminatory language prohibiting certain actions by broadband network providers. But more specifically, this bill laid out a provision which would allow any person to provide content, applications, or service over a said network, at the same time providing nondiscriminatory protections for those offering the content, applications, or service. (Internet Freedom, 2006, §3) It was an area of network neutrality prior proposed legislation had not covered. Rather than focusing on the establishment of a neutral network from business to customer prospective, it focused on ensuring that the business-to-business connection along with the innovation and growth to could be bred from that competition, would not be hampered by anti-competitive behavior.
===== Communications Opportunity, Preservation, Enhancement Act of 2006 (H.R. 5252) =====
The Communications, Opportunity, Promotion, Enhancement Act was a fairly narrow piece of legislation that covered national franchises, local loop unbundling, restrictions on states municipalities ability to provide cable operations and internet services to the general public, requirements for VOIP operators such as Vonage, but most importantly network neutrality. This was the first piece of legislation to be wholly introduced by a Republican member of the House, Representative Joe Barton of Texas. In Title II of the bill, Congress via this bill,  would reassert the right of the FCC to regulate communications commerce violations and impose reasonable punishments, through the powers granted by the Telecommunications Act of 1934 which stated that “the Commission shall have exclusive authority to adjudicate any complaint alleging a violation of the broadband policy statement or the principles incorporated there- in” (Communications Opportunity, 2006, §201). Though it did not contain any specific non-discriminatory language, the bill would support net neutrality via FCC regulation.
The first version of the bill introduced in the House of Representatives received support from both Democrat and Republican House members, as a result passing with a vote of 321-101. After making it through the House, it moved on to the Senate where it was referred to the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation for markup. There were several proposed amendments to the bill, but of those, only four were adopted, none of which contained any specific net neutrality language. Granted that the bill did make it to the Senate, it was reviewed by the Congressional Budget Office, where it was estimated that the bill would cost over 5.2 billion dollars to implement over a ten-year period. That spending would in turn generate revenues of 5 billion over the same period. On September 29, 2006, the bill was put on the Senate calendar for debate, but never was acted on again and fell short of becoming law.
Though the bill did pass in the House of Representatives with a defining majority, it did not come without its criticisms. As mentioned above, the bill did not pass with any specific net neutrality amendments, thus it would be Senators Bryan Dorgan and Olympia Snowe (authors of Internet Freedom Preservation Acts 2006 &amp; 2007 respectively) who would dissent. Subsequently, they would propose an amendment that &quot;prevented cable and telephone companies from assigning priority to Internet traffic based on financial arrangements with Web Sites” (Roberts, 2008, p. 76). It was an amendment, which they felt would strongly uphold and maintain the goals of a competitive telecommunications market place as set out in the Telecommunications Act of 1934.
===== The Internet Freedom Preservation Acts (IFPA) =====
Of all of the regulation that has been proposed, but yet to make it to becoming law, the Internet Freedom Preservation Act, has had the most re-incarnations since the original version of the bill was first introduced in 2006. 
Making the transition back to much of the strong non-discriminatory language of the Internet Freedom Non- Discrimination Acts. It was aimed at amending the Telecommunications Act of 1934, by specifically requiring that broadband operators provide consistent and non-discriminatory service to customers in the same manner that previous legislation would have required. It borrowed language from the C.O.P.E Act, preventing network operators from forcing customers to purchase other network services e.g. telephone and television (known as bundling or the ‘triple play”) as a requirement for receiving Internet Service. 
Similar to the Non-Discrimination and Net Neutrality Acts, this bill would not prevent network providers from conducting ‘reasonable network management’ practices to maintain the quality of its network.  It also would allow service providers to offer different levels of service to customers, but would not allow them to charge for those varying levels of service. Overall, the bill provided consumers protections against discriminatory network practices, but would also give broadband operators provide operators with the ability to ensure in conducting ‘reasonable network management’, much of which includes ensuring proper and secure transmission of data over a providers broadband network. 
To date there have been four versions of the bill under the same name which have either failed or have yet to be enacted into law.

Unlike the prior proposed legislation this bill, would receive support form currentPresident Barack Obama, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, as well as currentSpeaker of the House Nancy Pelosi. However even with the backing whom were at the time presidential candidates, the Freedom Preservation Acts have yet togain any serious ground in the House or the Senate and continues to fight an uphill battle. It remains that network neutrality regulation is seen asgovernment intrusion into an area it has no business being in. And on the otherside, as some say, protecting the very Internet that has flourished because ithas been neutral.

=== Suggestion ===
Suggestions are few and far in between when it comes to net neutrality.  As the two sides are so divided, it makes it very difficult to come to a compromise.  However, there is one suggestion which comes from the Canadian organization, Canarie, which is funded by the Canadian organization.  The suggestion comes from a study which was led by researcher Bill St. Arnaud where he suggests that homeowners pay for the last mile connection.  It is a known within the telecommunications industry that companies do not make any money off of the last mile connection(s).  The initial investment within the last mile connection is so expensive, and the fees at which that they can charge their customers are so competitive.  Because of that, technology lags so much in the last mile connection as they cannot make any money off of it.  This is what makes a non-net neutrality environment to ISPs because it now presents a way in that they can make money off of the last mile connection.  The idea from the study is that it would have the people that actually use the connection and bandwidth to actually pay for the bandwidth.  Once they purchased it, they would be in charge of doing upgrades if they so choose, as well as dealing with maintenance costs.  Once an installation is added on a house, the homeowner may then sell the connection with the house in a future sale.  Though each installation is costly at roughly $2700, a homeowner could bundle it into their mortgage which would allow them to spread the cost out over the length of their mortgage; mitigating the impact of the initial price shock.  Having a high speed connection which is owned by the occupants of the home is also a major selling point. Arnaud also cites that home owners are starting to factor in broadband access when choosing a new home.  Having purchased broadband would be a positive thing within a potential home sale because the investment has already been made for the potential buyer (Johnson, 2008). 
This suggestion also poses several positive side effects for the telecommunications companies.  One being that it allows them to get a depreciating asset off of their books.  Currently the last mile connections are owned by the telecommunication companies.  As they are expensive the install and maintain, the telecommunication company must foot the bill when it comes to installation and maintenance.  It is an investment that they have to make in order to attain a significant customer base, however it is an investment which will depreciate.  Each year as the technology gets older and older it will depreciate which causes their current assets to go down.  By allowing the telecommunications companies to sell these assets to individual owners, it allows them to get rid of these depreciating assets and turn them into a liquid asset (I.e. cash) which helps to enhance their cash flow situation and make a real investment (which can provide a return) into their core competencies like programming and installing and maintaining the major backbone infrastructure.  As the telecommunications companies cannot make money off of the last mile connection(s), they have to subsidize it with their other service offerings.  With them not having to subsidize it anymore, they would have the ability to lower the fees that they charge each month.  It also opens up potential future business because the connections will need to be maintained.  By situating themselves correctly, the telecommunications companies have the potential to do the maintenance work for the homeowners as further maintenance is required.
 
==== Balanced Network Neutrality Policy ====
The debate over network neutrality has two very different points of view. Network neutrality advocates worry about ISP’s discriminating internet traffic andopponents argue that enforcing network neutrality would be difficult and errorprone (Felten, 2006). The solution for this is a balanced policy which would limit the harmful uses of discrimination and allow it’s beneficial uses, because making wrong decision with respect to network neutrality regulation can hamper Internet’s development (Peha, 2007).
For the protection of beneficial discrimination a policy can be designed which might allow the following:
Network operators could provide different QoS to different classes of traffic by using explicit prioritization or other techniques. A stricter QoS requirements for trafficsent using a higher-priced service can be favored using these techniques (Alleven, 2009).
Network operators could charge a different price for both the senders and recipients of data depending on different classes of traffic  (Peha, 2007). The higher price could be charged for traffic which consumes more of a limited resource or which requires superior quality of service and has adverse effect on neighbors traffic (Felten, 2006).
Traffic that can pose a threat to network security or which can be harmful to the network could be blocked by the network operator; it can be either by not following certain protocols or defined algorithms (Crowcroft, 2007). Network operators could also benefit by offering unique services or proprietary content to their customers (Peha, 2007). 
If and only if, the broadband market is not highly competitive, a policy designed to limit harmful uses of discrimination would not allow the following:  (Peha, 2007).
A network operator cannot charge more for a 50kbps VoIP stream than 50kbps gaming application where the QOS requirements are the same (Felten, 2006). One user could not be charged more than another by a network operator whether the user is a service provider, content provider or a consumer for a comparable information transfer or monthly service or even whether the user is the sender or receiver  (Peha, 2007).
Until and unless a network operator has a reasonable belief that certain traffic poses asecurity threat to the network it could not block traffic based on content or application alone (Crowcroft, 2007). Degradation of QoS only on the basis of content alone couldn’t be done by the network operators (Crowcroft,2007)(Alleven, 2009).

A network operator could not offer different QoS and price for traffic that competes witha legacy circuit-switched service  (Peha, 2007).

=== Conclusion ===

Net neutrality is one of the most contested issues today within the Internet forum.  Its impact is over-reaching and is tremendously impactful. Firstly we gave a brief overview of net neutrality.  This discussed where its roots had come from and introduced the polarized sides within the debate of net neutrality.  Next we discussed the economics of net neutrality.  Not only are the ethical issues important within net neutrality, but the economics must make sense and be feasible.  All parties involved within the net neutrality debate want to be sure that outcome should benefit them financially.  Thirdly we discussed the technicalities of net neutrality.  In the previous section we talked about the financial implications (through economics), and now we wanted you, the reader, to have an understanding of how, technically, the routes and switches are able to support or not support net neutrality.  Next we discussed regulations within net neutrality.  This was important because it is imperative to understand the current legal landscape of net neutrality.  It was discussed where this topic is supported and not supported within the legal environment.  After that, we discussed a suggestion of how to solve the debate by having home owners purchasing their broadband connection from the ISP; the last mile.  By the homeowners purchasing the connection it would neutralize the last mile connection and therefore taking a lot of the contention of net neutrality out of the running. 
Net neutrality is a broad topic.  However, though it is broad, there are a lot of nuances and passion that needs to be understood about it.  By having an understanding of this topic it allows one to begin to develop an opinion on where net neutrality should go in the future.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Having Leaf exchange data with other programs can be challenging. This author, Thomas Messerschmidt, working with his robot Robot Betty9 (see http://www.myspace.com/robotbetty9), has created a very simple but quite effective way of allowing Leaf to chat with just about any external (external to LISP) program. 

The methodology consists of passing text message between Leaf/LISP and the outside world by creating and destroying small text (.txt) files. It was originally written so that Leaf could expand his AI using a standard ALICE-BASED (ProgramD) chatbot. 

The first part consists of the function &quot;sendchatout2chatbot&quot;. It writes data out to the &quot;in&quot; file &quot;in.txt&quot;.

The second part consists of the function &quot;readchatbotfile &quot;. It reads text returned from an application, in this case from a chatbot using a file called &quot;out.txt&quot;. 

;;; Start of Chatbot Interface Code -----------------------------------------
;;; Start of Chatbot Interface Code -----------------------------------------
;;; Start of Chatbot Interface Code -----------------------------------------
;;; Code by Thomas Messerschmidt (Please credit me. A link back to Betty9 would be nice.)

(defun sendchatout2chatbot ()
  (print *text-phrase*)
        (setf mytext *text-phrase* )
        (setf mytext (subseq mytext 6))
        (with-open-file 
            (textin &quot;C:/in.txt&quot; :direction :output
                                         :if-exists :supersede)
            (print mytext textin)
        )
        (setf *text-phrase* nil)  )

(defun readchatbotfile ()
 (with-open-file (stream &quot;C:/out.txt&quot;)
   (do ((line (read-line stream nil)
               (read-line stream nil)))
    ((null line))
    (setf x1 line))) 
    (sapi-tts x1)
    (delete-file &quot;C:/out.txt&quot;)   ); and then delete the file

(defun getchatin () ; tts what came back from chatbot and then delete the file
  (if (probe-file &quot;C:/out.txt&quot;) (readchatbotfile))  ) ; Read the file if there is a file to be read.


;;; End of Chatbot Interface Code -------------------------------------------
;;; End of Chatbot Interface Code -------------------------------------------
;;; End of Chatbot Interface Code -------------------------------------------


So to sum it up:
1. A user asks a question of Leaf
2. Leaf sends the question to the chatbot via the sendchatout2chatbot function which writes to &quot;C:/in.txt&quot;
3. The chatbot reads in the question asked in &quot;C:/in.txt&quot; and then deletes the file.
4. The chatbot writes out its response to the question in a file &quot;C:/out.txt&quot;
5. When leaf sees that there exists a C:/out.txt file, he reads it in with the readchatbotfile function which also reads it aloud using Microsoft's standard TTS (Text to Speech) SAPI 5.x.
6. The file &quot;C:/out.txt&quot; is then deleted by Leaf.

== What version ==

Hello, and please correct me if I'm wrong:

In the first page of this book it makes no reference to the version of Python being used within the book.  This strikes me as important information to include in the very beginning of the book.  In my case, I'd like you to imagine my frustration when I go to run my first program as: print 'Hello, World!' and immediately receive a Syntax Error in my version of Python 3.1.3.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">This page describes &quot;add-ons&quot; to GLPK &amp;mdash; including
unofficial extensions to the GLPK codebase to provide
some special functionality.  As such, these extensions
require a suitable compilation environment.

__FORCETOC__

== BAK: branch-and-bound analysis kit ==

[[Image:Bak_branch_and_bound_tree.png|thumb|Branch and bound tree generated with BAK and rendered with gnuplot]]

BAK is a tool for analyzing the branch-and-bound behavior of GLPK and other solvers.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hunsaker|first1=Brady|title=BAK: Branch-and-bound Analysis Kit|year=2009|url=http://www.rosemaryroad.org/projects/BAK/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ozaltin | first1 = Osman Y. | last2 = Hunsaker | first2 = Brady | last3 = Ralphs | first3 = Ted K. | year = 2007 | title = Visualizing branch-and-bound algorithms | url = http://www.optimization-online.org/DB_FILE/2007/09/1785.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
BAK is distributed with a [http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html GPL 2.0] license and a [[w:BSD licenses|BSD]] style license &amp;mdash; the choice of which to employ is left to the user.

=== Adding BAK to GLPK ===

The latest BAK tarball can be downloaded as from [http://www.rosemaryroad.org/bak/download/ www.rosemaryroad.org/bak/download/].

BAK comes with some patched source files for GLPK in the directory &lt;tt&gt;bak/interfaces/GLPK&lt;/tt&gt;.  First copy these files to the normal GLPK source directory and then rebuild GLPK afresh (see chapter [[GLPK/Compiling_GLPK|Compiling GLPK]]).

=== Usage ===

The modified standalone solver GLPSOL writes a file with branching information. The name of this file is specified using command-line option &lt;tt&gt;--bakfile&lt;/tt&gt;, for example:

&lt;pre&gt;
glpsol --bakfile tsp.bak -m tsp.mod
&lt;/pre&gt;

The file contains information about the nodes created, the branching process, the integer infeasabilities encountered, and the run-time progress. The file format is documented at [http://www.rosemaryroad.org/projects/BAK/browser/trunk/grammar_details www.rosemaryroad.org/projects/BAK/browser/trunk/grammar_details]. As an example, this file might start with the following lines.

&lt;pre&gt;
#SOLVER: GLPK
#PROBLEM: (null)
0.002000 branched 1 0 M 6030.000000 6.466667 32
0.002000 candidate 2 1 L
0.002000 candidate 3 1 R
0.004000 branched 2 1 L 6030.000000 6.466667 30
0.004000 candidate 4 2 L
0.004000 candidate 5 2 R
0.006000 branched 4 2 L 6069.000000 7.533333 32
0.006000 candidate 6 4 L
0.006000 candidate 7 4 R
0.008000 branched 7 4 R 6069.000000 7.266667 30
0.008000 candidate 8 7 L
0.008000 candidate 9 7 R
0.009000 infeasible 9 7 R
...
&lt;/pre&gt;

A python script can be used to create intermediate files for visualizing this information with [[w:gnuplot|gnuplot]]:

&lt;pre&gt;
python bak/BAK_visual.py --all tsp.bak
&lt;/pre&gt;

The resultant files can be viewed with a [[w:PNG|PNG]] file viewer, for instance evince:
&lt;pre&gt;
evince tree_alt.004.png
&lt;/pre&gt;

structured LP problem into subproblems &amp;mdash; and then
solving these separately and usually in parallel.  The
underlying constraint matrix needs a certain form of
block structure.  The technique, first proposed in
1960, is attracting renewed interest, given the advent
of inexpensive multi-core personal computers.

The
[http://sourceforge.net/projects/dwsolver Dantzig-Wolfe Solver project],
now hosted at
[[w:Source_forge|SourceForge]], provides a general,
parallel implementation of Dantzig-Wolfe using GLPK.
The code was authored by Joey Rios.  The first public
release, version&amp;nbsp;1.0, was uploaded on
15&amp;nbsp;October 2010.

This implementation uses the [[w:Pthreads|Pthreads]]
thread management library.  Small modifications to GLPK
were necessary to allow it to run concurrently.  As a
result, GLPK in its entirety is included in the
Dantzig-Wolfe Solver project codebase.  Aside from
Pthreads, no other specialist libraries are required.

The code has been successfully built on Mac OS&amp;nbsp;X
10.5 and 10.6, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, and Windows XP
via cygwin.

The author hopes this tool will provide a starting
point for further research into Dantzig-Wolfe
decomposition.  Indeed, while many papers across
several domains have taken advantage of DW, this is
possibly the only project that offers DW source code
for open testing and development.

The software has some limitations.  As at October 2010,
only LP formulations can be used and the subproblems
must be bounded.  There may also be bugs.

The modeler provides CPLEX LP input files for the
master problem and each of the subproblems.  A simple guide
file, that tells a command-line tool where everything
is, also required.  The codebase contains several DW
examples taken from textbooks and websites or developed
by the author.

For an assessment of Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition in general
and under parallel computation, see Tebboth (2001).&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==H.1 Introduction to relativity==

===H.1.1 Describe what is meant by a frame of reference===
A frame of reference refers to a point of view. Physics refers to observational frames of reference, i.e. what is heard, seen, touched, smelt or tasted from a certain point of view.

e.g. you have a frame of reference (in a computer chair) that views the world as stationary. A frame of reference with the sun as stationary would view you as moving around the earth.

===H.1.2 Describe what is meant by a Galilean Transformation===
Galilean is what seems intuitive. The equations do not involve relativity. 

===H.1.3 Solve problems involving relative velocities using the Galilean transformation equations===
This should be easy.
position equation:
x'=x-vt

Velocity equation:
u'=u-v

e.g. You are sitting on a park bench. You see a bike and car moving away from each other. The bike is moving at 5m/s, the car is moving at 20 m/s. How fast is the bike moving in the cars reference frame?
(Ans: 25m/s)

==H.2 Concepts and postulates of special relativity==

===H.2.1 Describe what is meant by an inertial frame of reference===
A reference frame that is moving with a constant velocity.          This really isn't that essential but you might see a fundamental flaw in this definition (just ignore it if you do).

===H.2.2 State the two postulates of the special theory of relativity===
* the speed of light in a vacuum is constant for all inertial observers.
* The laws of physics are the same for all inertial observers.

===H.2.3 Discuss the concept of simultaneity===
Consult a textbook (or youtube &quot;simultaneity&quot;), best explained with diagrams.

In summary though, simultaneous events that take place at the same point in space will be simultaneous to all observers. However, events that take place at different points in space can be simultaneous for one observer but not for another.

==H.3 Relativistic Kinematics==

===H.3.1 Describe the concept of a light clock===
'''Best described by diagram.''' 
                                                                            
Imagine a clock where light is bounced off two mirrors.           mirror|                   light beam --&gt;                   mirror |

Each time it hits a mirror a &quot;tick&quot; is registered. Since light is the same for all reference frames, this is the most accurate type of clock.

This seams simple for a stationary clock, HOWEVER in a reference frame where the clock moves, it must travel a diagonal distance which is greater than that for a stationary time frame. In this case a &quot;tick&quot; would take longer for one reference frame than the other. Therefore, time is shorter for one reference frame than another.

===H.3.2 Define proper time interval===
Proper time interval is the elapsed time measured between two events when the observer is in an inertial frame of reference.

===H.3.3 Derive the time dilation formula===
The time dilation formula can be derived using pythagoras's theorem. The length of the light clock is l. According to the observer's clocks, the clock in the light clock travels longer (l' = ct'). Horizontal distance traveled by the light clock: vt'.
t = l/c

l&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+(vt')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = (l')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

t'&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = (l')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/c&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;


t'&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = (l&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+(vt')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)/(c&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)

After rearranging,
t' = 1/(&amp;nbsp;1-v&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/(c&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&amp;nbsp;) x t

===H.3.4 Sketch and annotate a graph showing the variation with relative velocity of the Lorentz factor===


===H.3.5 Solve problems involving time dilation===


===H.3.6 Define proper length===


===H.3.7 Describe the phenomenon of length contraction===


===H.3.8 Solve problems involving length contraction===


==H.4 Some consequences of special relativity==

===H.4.1. Describe how the concept of time dilation leads to the &quot;twin paradox&quot;===


===H.4.2 Discuss the Hafele-Keating experiment===

Testing the theory of special relativity, scientists flew two clocks around the world in opposite directions and compared them to a clock that was stationary relative to the earth's surface.  One plane flew eastward and another went westward.  When the planes returned, it was  found that that for the plane flying East, it's clock was slower than the clock on the earth's surface (it was behind by 59 ns).  Since the earth spins to the east and the plane was travelling east relative to the earth's atmosphere, this clock had a greater velocity relative to the stationary frame of reference: the centre of the Earth and so it's clock ticked a little slower. The westward clock ran faster than the clock that remained on the earth's surface as it was moving more slowly relative to the centre of the earth.  This experiment provided evidence of time dilation that was in excellent agreement with relativistic predictions.

===H.4.3 Solve one-dimensional problems involving the relativistic addition of velocities===


===H.4.4 State the formula representing the equivalence of mass and energy===


===H.4.5 Define rest mass===
'''Rest mass''' of an object is defined to be the energy required to produce the object at rest.

===H.4.6 Distinguish between the energy of a body at rest and its total energy when moving===


===H.4.7 Explain why no object can ever attain the speed of light in a vacuum===
According to the classical mechanics, F = ma therefore if the force is applied to an object constantly over a very long time period, the speed of the object must increase without limit. However, this is not true; as the speed of the object increases, ''the relativistic mass of the object increases'', therefore acceleration will gradually decrease. Only the particles with no rest mass (such as photon) can travel with the speed of light.

===H.4.8 Determine the total energy of an accelerated particle===
The total energy E, momentum p, and the rest energy E&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; (=m&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;c&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) have a relationship E&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = p&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;c&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + E&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

==H.5 Evidence to support special relativity==

===H.5.1 Discuss muon decay as experimental evidence to support special relativity===


===H.5.2 Solve problems involving the muon decay experiment===


===H.5.3 Outline the Michelson-Morley experiment===


===H.5.4 Discuss the result of the Michelson-Morley experiment and its implication===


===H.5.5 Outline an experiment that indicates that the speed of light in vacuum is independent of its source===


==H.6 Relativistic momentum and energy==

===H.6.1 Apply the relation for the relativistic momentum p = γm&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;u of particles===


===H.6.2 Apply the formula E&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; = (γ-1)m&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;c&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; for the kinetic energy of a particle===


===H.6.3 Solve problems involving relativistic momentum and energy===


==H.7 General relativity==

===H.7.1 Explain the difference between the terms gravitational mass and inertial mass===
Gravitational mass is the mass obtained from when a gravitational force acts upon an object. The inertial mass is the mass obtained from when an external force acts upon a body (the mass is resisting the acceleration). Evidently, the gravitational and inertial mass are exactly the same because uniform acceleration is indistinguishable from a gravitational field.

===H.7.2 Describe and discuss Einstein's principle of equivalence===
The principle of equivalence states that there is no difference between an accelerating observer and an observer in a  gravitational field. This principle coincides with General Relativity and the IB exams focus on light being bent by a gravitational field; Einstein stated this idea in respect to his closed elevator thought experiment. Light bent the same way regardless of whether the elevator was at rest or accelerating downward. The second part of the principle of equivalence is that time slows down when an object approaches a massive body such as black holes.

===H.7.3 Deduce that the principle of equivalence predicts bending of light rays in a gravitational field===


===H.7.4 Deduce that the principle of equivalence predicts that time slows down near a massive body===


===H.7.5 Describe the concept of spacetime===
'''Spacetime'''is the 4-dimensional world with three space and one time coordinates.

===H.7.6 State that moving objects follow the shortest path between two points in spacetime===
In the absence of any forces, a moving object will move in spacetime along path with the shortest length. This path is called '''geodesics'''.

===H.7.7 Explain gravitational attraction in terms of the warping of spacetime by matter===

Large masses will warp space-time in such a way that the shortest distance to be travelled between point A and B for a particle is now a curve around the large mass.  As such, this curved path that the particle follows can be thought of as the gravitational attraction.

===H.7.8 Describe black holes===
'''Black hole''' is a singularity of space time, and is a point of infinite density. It causes extreme curvature of spacetime around it.

===H.7.9 Define the term Schwarzschild radius===
'''Schwarzschild radius''' (R&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;) is sometimes called '''gravitational radius''', or '''event horizon'''. Within R&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;, no object can escape from the gravitational field (because the escape velocity exceeds c within R&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;).

===H.7.10 Calculate the Schwarzschild radius===
R&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; = 2GMc&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;, where G is the gravitational constant and M is mass of the black hole (or the star).

===H.7.11 Solve problems involving time dilation close to a black hole===


===H.7.12Describe the concept of gravitational red-shift===


===H.7.13 Solve problems involving frequency shifts between different points in a uniform gravitational field===


===H.7.14 Solve problems using the gravitational time dilation formula===


==H.8 Evidence to support general relativity==

===H.8.1 Outline an experiment for the bending of EM waves by a massive object===

===H.8.2 Describe gravitational lensing===
Assuming a massive galaxy has a large gravitational pull, light from a distant quasar is bent, thereby creating two quasars when viewed through a telescope. The galaxy acts a lens as it bends the incoming light from the quasar.

===H.8.3 Outline an experiment that provides evidence for gravitational red-shift===

Pound-Rebka Experiment where they shot a photon from the ground floor of a building up to the attic.  They found that the frequency of the photon was longer up at the attic then at the ground floor and thus, provides evidence for gravitational red-shift.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Questions with which to focus the responses==

The main focus is to ask the CEO, TM of EDC, and OER Foundation to reflect on the recommendations for what an institution can take from this book. What things stand out to them for their considerations for managing their organisation. What concerns or reservations might they have? 

# Why do you think more than 80% of tertiary educators ''never'' use social media in their work?
# Referring to the section [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Open_Education_Practices:_A_User_Guide_for_Organisations/Measuring_Open_Education Measuring Open Education] where it is shown to cost $4 000 to train a teacher how to use social media for open education and research, and that it returns over $9 000 in savings and benefits to the organisation, does this motivate you to invest in staff professional development? Why? Do you think it would make a difference to the statistic mentioned in question one?  
# Based on the recommendations made in [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Open_Education_Practices:_A_User_Guide_for_Organisations/Incentives_and_Rewards Incentives and Rewards] - what do you think an institution could feasibly do to encourage the use of social media for open education and research?
# What do you think of the idea to use marketing budgets being more laterally spent, such as helping teachers producing open educational media and publishing it through social media channels? Would this help progress open education? Would it help promote the Institution? Would it deliver better educational services to teachers and their students?
# What new models of education strike you as having the least or most potential in the context of your institution? Why?</text>

This template gives you a way to later prove that you are the person who was in control of your account on the day this template was placed. This is done by putting a code (called a &quot;hash&quot;) on your user page so that, in the event that your account is compromised, you can convince someone else that you are really the person behind your username.

==Why?==
The intended use of this template is to help in the hopefully unlikely event that your account is compromised. If you published your real-life identity, then that identity could be used to reestablish contact with you if your account were compromised; keep in mind, in this scenario contact could not be established with you through your account, since it may be under the control of someone else. However, many Wikipedia users do not disclose their real-life identities, or disclose little enough of them that it may be difficult to establish their identity.

This is not a replacement for having a [[w:Password strength|strong password]], nor for registering an email address for your account. You should still do everything you can to prevent your account being compromised, including using a strong password and remembering to log yourself out when using a computer others may have access to. If you have one, it may also be helpful to post your [[w:Pretty Good Privacy|PGP]] public key. But even with the best of precautions, your account could become compromised, for instance, via a [[w:trojan horse (computing)|trojan horse]] or a brute-force attack on your password. This is intended to be a last resort.

==How==
The idea is to use cryptographic hashes; you choose a secret string known only to yourself, put it through a one-way [[w:Cryptographic hash function|hash function]], and publish the result somewhere. It is infeasible to determine the secret string corresponding to the hash; hence, an attacker compromising an account presumably would not be able to supply the secret string.

=== Syntax ===
:&lt;code&gt;{&lt;nowiki/&gt;{user committed identity|&lt;var&gt;hash&lt;/var&gt;|&lt;var&gt;hash function used&lt;/var&gt;|background=&lt;var&gt;[[w:Web_colors#CSS_colors|CSS color]]&lt;/var&gt;|border=&lt;var&gt;[[w:Web_colors#CSS_colors|CSS color]]&lt;/var&gt;|article=&lt;var&gt;[[w:Article (grammar)|grammatical article]] for the hash function&lt;/var&gt;}}&lt;/code&gt;

Italicized text should be replaced with appropriate input, or its parameter should be removed. Parameters are represented by 'parameter=&lt;var&gt;value&lt;/var&gt;&quot;, and separated by vertical bars |.
*Replace &quot;hash&quot; with the hash produced from your secret string. The implicit name of this parameter is &quot;1&quot; (see [[Help:Template#Example: numeric parameter substitution|numeric parameters]]).
*The &quot;hash function used&quot; parameter, if not included, defaults to [[w:SHA-512|SHA-512]]. (This hash function is strongly recommended.)
*The &quot;background&quot; parameter, if not included, defaults to #E0E8FF (&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: #E0E8FF;&quot;&gt;light blue&lt;/span&gt;, see [[w:Web colors#Hex triplet|Web colors#Hex triplet]])
*The &quot;border&quot; parameter, if not included, also defaults to #E0E8FF.
*The &quot;article&quot; parameter, if not included, defaults to &quot;a&quot;. The other likely value is &quot;an&quot;.
For example, if your hash is &quot;ef7c4c55a176bd20ed558aaefde21c4803080195&quot; using [[w:SHA-1|SHA-1]], and you want a light orange box with a black border, use the following code
:{&lt;nowiki/&gt;{user committed identity|ef7c4c55a176bd20ed558aaefde21c4803080195|SHA-1|background=#FC9|border=#000}}
to produce
{{user committed identity|ef7c4c55a176bd20ed558aaefde21c4803080195|SHA-1|background=#FC9|border=#000}}

=== Choosing a good secret string ===
# Your secret string should not be easy to guess. ''If your string is easy to guess,'' then the fact that you know the string is not likely to be very persuasive. For example, a string of 'joe' will be less convincing than 'My name is Joe Schmoe, and I can be contacted at: joe@example.com'
# Your secret string should specify enough of your identity that, if the string were revealed, you could unambiguously prove you match that identity. For instance, your secret string could include a telephone number or email address at which you can be reached.
# Try not to choose a secret string that represents your identity that could go completely out of date. So, for instance, it may be bad to choose a string that specifies ''only'' your telephone number as that number might change.
# If you want to change your secret string, do so, but keep track of all your old secret strings. It is best to reveal all of them if you ever want to confirm your identity, as this will establish that you are the same person who used your account from the first moment the committed identity was published.
# Your secret string should not be short. A dedicated attacker could, by brute force, try short strings until they find your secret string, but if your string is longer that attack would be impractical. If your string is 15 characters long, there are around 10&lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt; strings of that length, or an [[w:octillion|octillion]] (and that's just counting alphanumeric strings with spaces).
# Your secret string should not only contain an email address, name, or phone number, but should contain hard to guess components. &quot;jsmith@hotmail.com&quot; for example may be vulnerable to both [[w:dictionary attack|dictionary attack]]s and a search of email addresses, enabling attackers to check 'only' those hundred million names against all published hashed identities, which is computationally much easier than trying to identify a randomly chosen string.

=== Getting the hash ===
Be sure to note the ''exact string'' you enter into the form, in case you need to use it later. It is important that this string be both easily remembered exactly by you and hard to guess or find by any intruder - if an intruder knows the secret string, then this scheme is useless and provides no security. One's username is public and trivially guessable; one's password is not a good choice either, as in the event of a compromised account, the password is likely to have been guessed.

On [[w:Unix-like|Unix-like]] operating systems the &lt;code&gt;[[w:md5sum|md5sum]]&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;[[w:sha1sum|sha1sum]]&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;sha224sum&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;sha256sum&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;sha384sum&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;sha512sum&lt;/code&gt; programs are provided in the [[w:GNU Core Utilities|GNU Core Utilities]]. Windows users may use one of the methods mentioned below; those who have [[w:PowerShell|PowerShell]] installed can generate a hash using the following command. Provide your secret phrase in the location indicated:

&lt;code&gt;[bitconverter]::tostring((new-object security.cryptography.sha512managed).computehash([text.encoding]::utf8.getbytes(&quot;Secret phrase here&quot;))).replace(&quot;-&quot;, &quot;&quot;)&lt;/code&gt;

It is recommended that SHA-512 be used, as recent cryptographic research has cast doubt on the long-term security of SHA-1. The template defaults to [[w:SHA-512|SHA-512]] if the hash function parameter is omitted. For security, you should only use locally executed programs, or client-side javascript, to create your hash. Examples of such hash calculators include [http://jssha.sourceforge.net/ jsSHA] and [http://www.slavasoft.com/hashcalc/ HashCalc 2.01].

To verify that you are correctly hashing your secret string, you can try hashing 'My name is Joe Schmoe, and I can be contacted at: joe@example.com' (without the enclosing single-quotes). Your SHA-512 hash should be: b7a84efbbd843545666957384e874c894fdc17f48ced53abd231c2e4d08e45ad10287b1225432e3ed9794c12994ff1e82aecf66a2ded61ad4baf6d8b9c81dab8

== Compromised identities ==

In case your account is compromised, to make use of your committed identity to someone and prove you are the same person who originally controlled the account, give a trusted user the ''exact secret string'' you originally entered into the box. They can then compute the appropriate hash of that same string and verify that it is the same result and that you are who you say you are.

Once you've established your identity, and set up a new account or regained control of the original account, you'll probably want to create a new hash as now someone (possibly multiple someones depending on who and how you told the secret string to) else knows the secret string.

== Weakness ==
This technique of establishing identity by revealing the secret string behind the hash is not inherently attack proof; it increases attacker effort substantially (if the secret string is chosen and handled properly) which is worthwhile, and does so at little effort to the legitimate user. But it is attackable in that anyone can invent their own secret string, hash it, and claim an identity.  

An attacker with access to the account could overwrite the hash with their own one.  They could then say that the previous owner of the account was an attacker who claimed their identity and generated his own hash.

An attacker without access to the account could claim that the current account's owner stole their identity. The attacker could state that they did not publish a hash when they used to own the account, or that they did not register an account and that someone else is using their name.

This weakness does not indicate the [[w:commitment scheme|commitment scheme]] is worthless, because the ''commit phase'' did not apply to all interested parties (the real person and all potential attackers).

::I don't like the idea of a welcome bot.  It's far better for actual ''people'' to place welcome messages, and ''sign'' them.  --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 22:12, 23 August 2010 (UTC)
:::What Jomegat said. If this came up for consensus, I'd vote against. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 00:23, 24 August 2010 (UTC)
::::I was unaware of the extension that Yair rand mentioned when I asked Hoyojo to come over. I should inform zh.wikibooks too. However, I don't agree with Jomegat. The only difference between automatic and manual welcoming is that the human being welcomer may have the page on his or her watchlist. However, if a new user asks for help on his or her own talk page it would appear on RC anyways. Also, I don' think anyone would believe that the welcomers type out the code for {{tl|bigwelcome}} every time, so in a way it is already 'automated'.

::::: Semi-automation is still more personal than full-automation.  I always sign bigwelcome when I leave it.  What would the bot do?  When I use bigwelcome, it leaves a link to my talk page which I think adds a personal touch and encourages them to make contact with a real person.  I view it as analogous to reaching a real person on the phone instead of a recording that says &quot;press 1 for customer service.&quot; --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 13:10, 24 August 2010 (UTC)
:::::: For what it is worth, I often personalize welcome messages when I see a common interest between me and the person I am welcoming.  Besides, not that many of us regularly watch RC.  I would miss it if a user I didn't know edited there own talk page (even though I often check the RC list).

      <text xml:space="preserve">When the Spanish Civil War ended, the '''Spanish State''' ({{lang|es|'''''Estado Español'''''}}) was created. It was the formal name of Spain from 1939 to 1947 under the authoritarian dictatorship of Francisco Franco and the ''Falange Española Tradicionalista y de las JONS''. In 1947, Spain was reconstituted as a kingdom, which changed the Spanish State into the '''Kingdom of Spain''' ({{lang|es|'''''Reino de España'''''}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Shneidman |first=Jerome Lee |title=Spain &amp; Franco, 1949-59 |publisher= Facts on File, Inc |year=1973 |page=32 |isbn=0871961806}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Franco was still ''de facto'' in power as an Regent of Spain.

After World War II, Spain was very poor.

14 years after World War II, Spain enjoyed a miracle due to oil, only to be broke more than 10 years after.

With the death of Franco on 20 November 1975, Juan Carlos became the King of Spain.

The '''Mapuche''' are the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] inhabitants of Central and Southern [[Chile]] and Southern [[Argentina]]. They were known as '''Araucanians''' (''araucanos'') by the Spaniards. This is now considered pejorative{{Fact|date=September 2008}} by the people and the term Mapuche is the one most often used by people in conversation. Mapuche make up about 4% of the Chilean population,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ine.cl/cd2002/sintesiscensal.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; who are particularly concentrated in the [[Araucania Region]], while over 60% of Chile's population is believed to possess some Mapuche ancestry.

Contrary to popular belief, the [[Quechua]] word ''awqa'' &quot;rebel, enemy&quot;, is probably not the root of ''araucano'': the latter is more likely derived from the placename ''rag ko'' (Spanish [[Arauco]]) &quot;clayey water&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.serindigena.cl/territorios/recursos/biblioteca/monografias/lenguas/monografia_lenguas_mapuche2.htm ''Mapuche o Araucano''] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://escuela.med.puc.cl/publ/ArsMedica/ArsMedica4/08Zuniga.html ''Antecedentes históricos del pueblo araucano''] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mapuche had an economy based on agriculture; their social organisation consisted of extended families, under the direction of a &quot;[[lonco|lonko]]&quot; or chief, although in times of war they would unite in larger groupings and elect a [[toqui]] (from Mapudungun ''toki'' &quot;axe, axe-bearer&quot;) to lead them.

The Mapuche are a wide-ranging ethnicity composed of various groups which shared a common social, religious and economic structure, as well as a common linguistic heritage.  Their influence extended between the [[Aconcagua River]] and [[Chiloé Island]] and later eastward to the Argentine pampa.  The Mapuche (note that Mapuche can refer to the whole group of [[Picunche]]s (people of the north), Huilliches and [[Moluche|Moluche or Nguluche]] from [[Araucanía]] or exclusively to the Moluche or Nguluche from Araucanía) inhabited the valleys between the [[Itata River|Itata]] and [[Toltén]] Rivers, as well as the [[Huilliche]] (people of the South), the [[Cunco]]s.  In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries the Mapuches expanded eastward into the Andes and pampas forming with the existing people the [[Poya (tribe)|Poya]]s and [[Pehuenche]].  At about the same time ethnic groups of the pampa regions, the [[Puelche]], [[Ranquel]]es and northern [[Aonikenk]], called [[Patagons]] by [[Ferdinand Magellan]], known now as [[Tehuelche]], made contact with Mapuche groups, adopting their language and some culture (in what came to be called the [[Araucanization]]). 

== History ==
===Origin===
[[Image:MapvsInc.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Huamán Poma de Ayala's picture about the confrontation between the Mapuches (left) and the [[Incas]] (right)]]
[[File:Mauricio rugendas - el malon.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Picture of Mapuches during a [[malón]] raid]]
The origin of the Mapuche is not clear. The Mapuche language [[Mapudungun]], has been classified by some authorities as being related to the [[Penutian languages]] of North America. Others group it among the Andean languages &lt;ref&gt;Greenberg 1987, Key 1978&lt;/ref&gt;, and yet others postulate an Araucanian-[[Mayan]] relationship &lt;ref&gt;Stark 1970, Hamp 1971&lt;/ref&gt;; Croese (1989, 1991) has advanced the hypothesis that it is related to [[Arawak]]. Recent [[DNA]] analysis has found that Mapuche pre-Columbian [[Araucana]] chicken came from [[Polynesia]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uv.cl/noti_videos/textos_detalle.php?codigo=716&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dibam.cl/noticias.asp?id=6478][http://pvs.kcc.hawaii.edu/rapanui/mapuche.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/06/070604-chickens_2.html Polynesians - And Their Chickens - Arrived in Americas Before Columbus&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  suggesting contact between the Mapuche and Polynesia. One of the earliest sites of human occupation in the Americas, [[Monte Verde]], lies within what was later to become [[Huilliche]] territory, although there is currently no demonstrated link between the Monte Verde people and the Mapuche.

===War of Arauco===
{{main|Arauco War}}
The Mapuche successfully resisted many attempts by the [[Inca Empire]] to subjugate them, despite their lack of state organisation. They fought against the [[Sapa Inca]] [[Tupac Yupanqui]] and his army. The result of the bloody three day  confrontation known as the [[Battle of the Maule]] was that the Inca conquest of the territories of Chile ended at the [[Maule river]].  They fell back to the north behind the [[Rapel River|Rapel]] and [[Cachapoal River]]s where they established a fortified border guarded by fortresses like [[Pucará de La Compañía]] and the [[Pucará del Cerro La Muralla]]. 

After the successful subjugation of the Picunche in the [[Conquest of Chile]] the [[Moluche]] of the area the Spanish called [[Araucania]] fought against the Spaniards for over 300 years. Initial conquests of land by Spain in the late 16th century were repelled by the Mapuche, so effectively that there were areas to which Europeans did not return until late in the 19th century. One of the main geographical boundaries was the [[Bío-Bío River]], which the Mapuche used as a natural barrier to Spanish and Chilean incursion. The 300 years were not uniformly a period of hostility, but often allowed substantial [[trade]] and interchange between Mapuche and Spaniards or Chileans. Nevertheless, the long Mapuche resistance has become primarily known as the [[Arauco War|War of Arauco]], and its early phase was immortalized in [[Alonso de Ercilla]]'s epic poem ''[[La Araucana]]''. 

From the mid 17th century the Mapuches and the governors of Chile made a series of treaties in order to end the hostilities.  By the late eighteenth century many Mapuche [[lonco]]s had accepted the ''[[de jure]]'' soverignity of the Spanish king of their lands while having a ''[[de facto]]'' independence.

When Chile revolted from the Spanish crown, some Mapuche chiefs sided with the royalists of [[Vicente Benavides]]. The aid of the Mapuches were vital to the Spanish since the had lost the control of all cities and ports north of [[Valdivia, Chile|Valdivia]]. Mapuches valued the treaties done with Spanish authorities, however most regarded the matter with indifference and took adventage of both sides. After Chile's independence from Spain, the Mapuche coexisted and traded with their neighbours, who prudently remained north of the Bío-Bío River, although clashes occurred frequently.

===Occupation of the Araucanía===
[[Image:OcupArau.JPG|thumb|right|300px| [[Cornelio Saavedra Rodríguez]] in meeting with the main [[lonco]]s of Araucania in [[1869]]]]
{{main|Occupation of the Araucanía}}
Chilean population pressures increased on the Mapuche borders, and by the 1880s Chile extended both to the north and to the south of the Mapuche heartlands. Further, Chile in the 1880s, as a result of its preparation for and its victory in the [[War of the Pacific]] against [[Bolivia]] and [[Peru]], found itself with a large standing army and a relatively modern arsenal for the period. Finally, in the mid- to late-1880s, partially on the pretext of crushing a French adventurer, [[Orelie-Antoine de Tounens]], who had declared himself '''King of Araucania''', Chile overwhelmed the Mapuche in the course of the so-called &quot;[[pacification of the Araucanía]]&quot;. 

[[Image:Mapuche engraving.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Vintage engraving of Mapuche]]

Using a combination of force and diplomacy, Chile's government obliged some Mapuche leaders to sign a treaty absorbing the Araucanian territories into Chile. The immediate impact of the war was widespread [[starvation]] and [[disease]]. It has been claimed that the Mapuche population dropped from a total of half a million to 25,000 within a generation&lt;ref&gt;Ward Churchill, ''A Little Matter of Genocide'', 109.&lt;/ref&gt;, though the latter figure has been called an exaggeration by several authorities. In the post-conquest period, however, there 
was internment of a significant percentage of the Mapuche, the wholesale destruction of the Mapuche herding, agricultural and trading economies, the wholesale looting of Mapuche property (real and personal - including a large amount of silver [[jewelry]] to replenish the Chilean national coffers), and the creation and institutionalization of a system of reserves called [[Indian Reductions|''reducciones'']] along lines similar to North American reservation systems. Subsequent generations of Mapuche live in extreme poverty as a direct result of being conquered and expropriated. 

[[Image:Mapuche map.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Map of Mapuche region]]

===Recent history===
Mapuche descendants now live across southern [[Chile]] and [[Argentina]]; some maintain their traditions and continue living from agriculture, but a growing majority have migrated to cities in search of better economic opportunities. Chile's [[Araucanía|region IX]] continues to have a rural population made up of approximately 80%; there are also substantial Mapuche populations in regions [[Los Lagos Region|X]], [[Bío-Bío Region|VIII]], and [[Maule Region|VII]].  

In recent years, there has been an attempt by the Chilean government to redress some of the inequities of the past, by, for example, validating the Mapudungun language and culture by including them in the curriculum of elementary schools around [[Temuco]]. Nevertheless, land disputes and violent interactions do continue in some Mapuche areas, particularly in the northern sections of the IX region between and around Traiguén and Lumaco - where a history of conflict continues into the present.

Representatives from Mapuche organisations joined the [[Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organisation]] (UNPO) seeking recognition and protection for their cultural and land rights.

Though Japanese and Swiss interests are active in the region that Chileans call &quot;Araucanía&quot; and the Mapuche call &quot;Ngulu Mapu&quot;, both of the main forestry companies are Chilean-owned. On land the Mapuche claim is theirs, the firms have planted hundreds of thousands of acres with Monterey pine and eucalyptus trees, species that are not native to the region and that consume large amounts of water and fertilizer.

Chilean exports of wood to the United States, almost all of which come from this southern region, are about $600 million a year and rising. Though an international campaign led by the conservation group Forest Ethics resulted in the Home Depot chain and other leading wood importers agreeing to revise their purchasing policies, to &quot;provide for the protection of native forests in Chile,&quot; some Mapuche leaders were not satisfied.

In an effort to defuse tensions, a special government body, the Commission for Historical Truth and New Treatment, issued a report in 2003 calling for drastic changes in Chile's treatment of its indigenous people, more than 80 percent of whom are Mapuche. The recommendations included the formal recognition of political and &quot;territorial&quot; rights for aboriginal peoples, as well as efforts to promote their cultural identity. 

In recent years, Mapuche activists have been prosecuted under counter-terrorism legislation originally introduced by the military dictatorship, under [[Augusto Pinochet|Pinochet]]. The law allows prosecutors to withhold evidence from the defense for up to six months, and to conceal the identity of witnesses, who may give evidence in court behind screens. There are several violent activist groups, which utilize various tactics, including the destruction of private property, including, but not limited to, the burning of structures and pastures. Protesters from Mapuche communities have engaged in these tactics against multinational forestry corporations [http://www.cooperativa.cl/p4_noticias/antialone.html?page=http://www.cooperativa.cl/p4_noticias/site/artic/20051111/pags/20051111124708.html] and private individuals, all of which possess and occupy territories originally owned by Mapuche communities.

== Culture ==
[[Image:Flag of the Mapuches.svg|thumb|right|250px|Flag of the Mapuche]]
According to genetic studies, most Chilean Mapuche possess some non-aboriginal ancestry, and over 60% of Chile's non-aboriginal population possess [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] ancestry, in varying degrees, although until recently very few Chileans would admit their Native American admixture. There were 604,349 Mapuche according to the census of 2002, making up approximately 4% of the Chilean population, while an estimated 300,000 living in Argentina. Due to the loss of their lands, many Mapuche now live in impoverished conditions in large cities such as [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]]. ''See also: [[Demographics of Chile]]''. Mapuche resistance continues, especially against the large [[forestry]] companies exploiting traditional lands. [[Pinochet]]-era anti-[[terrorism]] laws have frequently been used in recent years against certain community leaders and Mapuche political activists. 

At the time of the arrival of Europeans, the Mapuche were capable of sufficiently organizing themselves to create a network of forts and complex defensive buildings but also ceremonial constructions such as some [[mound]]s recently discovered near Purén.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dillehay, Tom]], ''[http://www.cambridge.org/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780521872621&amp;ss=fro Monuments, Empires, and Resistance: The Araucanian Polity and Ritual Narratives]'' (Cambridge University Press, Washington, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; They quickly adopted [[iron]] [[metal-working]] (they already worked [[copper]]&lt;ref&gt;Pedro Mariño de Lobera, in '''Crónica del Reino de Chile''', Cap. XXXI and XXXIII mentions copper points on the Mapuche pikes in the [[Battle of Andalien]] and [[Battle of Penco]]. Copper metallurgy was flourishing in South America, particularly in Peru from around the beginning of the first millennium AD. Possibly Mapuche copper metal working was learned from the prior interaction with the [[Inca Empire]] or prior Peruvian cultures or was a native craft (copper being common in Chile).&lt;/ref&gt;) and [[horseback-riding]] and the use of [[cavalry]] in war from the [[Spaniards]], along with the cultivation of [[wheat]] and [[sheep]]. In the long 300 year coexistence between the Spanish colonies and the relatively well-delineated autonomous Mapuche regions, the Mapuche also developed a strong tradition of trading with the Spanish/Chileans. It is this which lies at the heart of the Mapuche silver-working tradition, for it was from the large and widely-dispersed quantity of Spanish and Chilean silver coins that the Mapuche wrought their elaborate jewelry, head bands, etc. 

===Mapuche languages===
{{Main|Mapudungun}}

Mapuche languages are spoken in Chile and to a smaller extent in Argentina. They have two branches: [[Huillice language|Huilliche]] and [[Mapudungun]]. Although not related, there is some discernible lexical influence from [[Quechua]]. It is estimated that only about 200,000 full-fluency speakers remain in Chile, and the language still receives only token support in the educational system. In recent years it has started to be taught in rural schools of [[Bío-Bío Region|Bio-Bio]], [[Araucanía Region|Araucanía]] and [[Los Lagos Region|Los Lagos]] Regions.

===Mythology and beliefs===
{{Main|Mapuche mythology}}

Central to Mapuche [[belief]]  is the role of the ''[[Machi (Shaman)|machi]]'' &quot;shaman&quot;. It is usually filled by a woman, following an apprenticeship with an older Machi, and has many of the characteristics typical of [[shaman]]s. The machi performs ceremonies for curing diseases, warding off evil, influencing weather, harvests, social interactions and dreamwork. Machis often have extensive knowledge of Chilean [[medicinal herbs]], though as biodiversity in the Chilean countryside has declined due to commercial agriculture and forestry, the dissemination of such knowledge has also declined but is in revival. Machis also have an extensive knowledge of sacred stones and the sacred animals.

A book by [[investigative journalist]] [[Patrick Tierney]], ''The Highest Altar: Unveiling the Mystery of Human Sacrifice'' (1989) ISBN 9780140139747 , documents a possible modern ritual human sacrifice during the devastating [[1960 Valdivia earthquake| earthquake and tsunami of 1960]] by a machi of the Mapuche in the [[Budi Lake| Lago Budi]] community. The victim, 5 year old José Luis Painecur, had his arms and legs removed by Juan Pañán and Juan José Paincur(the victims grandfather), and was stuck into the sand of the beach like a stake. The waters of the [[Pacific Ocean]] then carried the body out to sea. The sacrifice was rumored to be at the behest of local machi, Juana Namuncurá Añen. The 2 men were charged with the crime and confessed, but later recanted. They were released after 2 years. A judge ruled that those involved in these events had &quot;acted without free will, driven by an irresistible natural force of ancestral tradition.&quot; The story is also mentioned in a Time Magazine article from that year, although with much less detail.[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,869529,00.html] 

The most important beliefs of the Mapuche are expressed in the tale [[Trentren Vilu y Caicai Vilu]], and manifest in the [[Ngen]] and [[Pillan]] spirits, the [[Kalku]] and [[Wekufe]] (evil/illness) spirits, the [[Chonchon]], the [[Piguchen|Piuchen]], the [[Nguruvilu]], and the Calchona.

An equally important part of Mapuche belief and society is the remembered history of independence and resistance from 1540 (Spanish and then Chileans) and of the treaty with the Chilean government in the 1870s. In that perception, it is important to include not exclude Mapuches in the Chilean culture. Having said that, memories, stories, and beliefs, often very local and particularized, are a significant part of the Mapuche traditional culture. To varying degrees, this history of resistance continues to this day amongst the Mapuche, though at the same time a large majority in Chile would also strongly include themselves as Chilean similarly to a large majority in Argentina including themselves as Argentines.

The territory of [[Chile]] has been populated since at least 12,000 BCE. In the 16th century the Spanish [[conquistador]]s began to subdue and colonize the region of present-day Chile, and the territory became a colony from 1540 to 1818, when it gained independence from Spain. Chile's economic development was successively marked by the export of first agricultural produce, then [[sodium nitrate|saltpeter]] and later [[copper]] until the 1980s. The wealth of raw materials led to an economic upturn, but also led to dependency, and even wars with neighboring states. The country was governed during most of its first 150 years of independent life by different forms of restricted democracy, where the electorate was carefully vetted and controlled by an elite.

The [[Chile under Pinochet|17-year military-led government]] was marked by severe human-rights violations and deep market-oriented economic reforms. In 1988, Chile made a peaceful [[Chilean transition to democracy|transition to democracy]]. 

==Early history==
About 12,000 years ago, migrating [[Indigenous Peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] settled in the fertile valleys and coastal areas of what is present day Chile. Pre-Hispanic Chile was home to over a dozen different Amerindian societies. The current prevalent theories are that the initial arrival of humans to the continent took place either along the Pacific coast southwards in a rather rapid expansion long preceding the [[Clovis culture]], or even trans-Pacific migration. These theories are backed by findings in the [[Monte Verde]] archaeological site, which predates the Clovis site by thousands of years. Specific early human settlement sites from the very early human habitation in Chile include the [[Cueva del Milodon]] and the [[Pali Aike Crater]]'s [[lava tube]]&lt;ref name=Hogan&gt;{{cite book |title=Pali Aike |last=Hogan |first=C.

[[Image:Tulor Settlement Chile.jpg|thumb|200px|left|&quot;Tulor&quot; settlement near [[San Pedro de Atacama]], a Pre-Columbian [[Atacameño]] culture (800 BE - 1100 BC).]]
Despite such diversity, it is possible to classify the indigenous people into three major cultural groups: the northern people, who developed rich handicrafts and were influenced by [[Cultural periods of Peru|pre-Incan cultures]]; the Araucanian culture, who inhabited the area between the river [[Choapa River|Choapa]] and the island of [[Chiloé Island|Chiloé]], and lived primarily off agriculture; and the Patagonian culture, composed of various nomadic tribes, who supported themselves through fishing and hunting (and who in Pacific/Pacific Coast immigration scenario would be descended partly from the most ancient settlers). 

No elaborate, centralized, sedentary civilization reigned supreme.&lt;ref name=Mapuches&gt;{{cite book |title= Historia del pueblo mapuche: (siglo XIX y XX)
 |last=Bengoa |first=Jose |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2000 |publisher= |location= |language= Spanish |isbn= 9789562822329|chapter= |page= |pages= |quote= |url= http://books.google.com/?id=k_E3aAiunm8C&amp;pg=PA190&amp;lpg=PA190&amp;dq=Mapuche+y+su+forma+de+gobierno}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Araucanians, a fragmented society of hunters, gatherers, and farmers, constituted the largest native American group in Chile. A mobile people who engaged in trade and warfare with other indigenous groups, they lived in scattered family clusters and small villages. Although the Araucanians had no written language, they did use a common tongue. Those in what became central Chile were more settled and more likely to use irrigation. Those in the south combined slash-and-burn agriculture with hunting. Of the three Araucanian groups, the one that mounted the fiercest resistance to the attempts at seizure of their territory were the [[Mapuche]], meaning &quot;people of the land.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mapuches&quot; /&gt;

[[Image:Urville-Araucanians.jpg|thumb|150px|right|The [[Mapuche]] were the original inhabitants of central and southern Chile.]]
The [[Inca Empire]] briefly extended their empire into what is now northern Chile, where they collected tribute from small groups of fishermen and oasis farmers but were not able to establish a strong cultural presence in the area&lt;ref name=Chile&gt;{{cite book |title=Chile |last=Minnis |first=Natalie |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2002 |publisher=Langenscheidt Publishing Group |location= |language= |isbn=9812348905, 9789812348906 |chapter= |page= |pages=381 |quote= |url=http://books.google.com/?id=Nf8SnJ_ZJbkC&amp;pg=PA27&amp;lpg=PA27&amp;dq=inca+did+not+conquer+araucanians}}&lt;/ref&gt;. As the Spaniards would after them, the Incas encountered fierce resistance and so were unable to exert control in the south. During their attempts at conquest in 1460 and again in 1491, the Incas established forts in the Central Valley of Chile, but they could not colonize the region. The [[Mapuche]] fought against the Sapa [[Tupac Inca Yupanqui]] (AD 1471-93)&lt;ref name=Garcilaso&gt;{{cite book |title=Comentarios reales |last=De la Vega |first=Garcilaso |authorlink=Inca Garcilaso de la Vega |coauthors= |year=1616 |publisher= |location= |language=Spanish |isbn= |chapter=Segunda Parte: Libro VII Cap. 18, 19 &amp; 20 |page= |pages= |quote= |url=http://es.wikisource.org/wiki/Comentarios_reales}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his army. The result of the bloody three-day confrontation known as the [[Battle of the Maule]] was that the Inca conquest of the territories of Chile ended at the [[Maule river]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/1981.htm&lt;/ref&gt;, which subsequently became the boundary between the Incan empire and the Mapuche lands until the arrival of the Spaniards.

Scholars speculate that the total Araucanian population may have numbered 1 million at most when the Spaniards arrived in the 1530s; a century of European conquest and disease reduced that number by at least half. During the conquest, the Araucanians quickly added horses and European weaponry to their arsenal of clubs and bows and arrows. They became adept at raiding Spanish settlements and, albeit in declining numbers, managed to hold off the Spaniards and their descendants until the late nineteenth century. The Araucanians' valor inspired the Chileans to mythologize them as the nation's first national heroes, a status that did nothing, however, to elevate the wretched living standard of their descendants.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mapuches&quot; /&gt;

==Spanish conquest and colony==
[[Image:Pedro de Valdivia.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Pedro de Valdivia]]]]
The first European to sight Chilean territory was [[Ferdinand Magellan]], who crossed the [[Strait of Magellan]] on November 1, 1520. However, the title of discoverer of Chile is usually assigned to [[Diego de Almagro]]. Almagro was [[Francisco Pizarro]]'s partner, and he received the Southern area.('''Nueva Toledo'''). He organized an expedition that brought him to central Chile in 1537, but he found little of value to compare with the gold and silver of the Incas in Peru. Left with the impression that the inhabitants of the area were poor, he returned to Peru, later to die in a Civil War.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

After this initial excursion there was little interest from colonial authorities in further exploring modern-day Chile. However, [[Pedro de Valdivia]], captain of the army, realizing the potential for expanding the Spanish empire southward, asked Pizarro's permission to invade and conquer the southern lands. With a couple of hundred men, he subdued the local inhabitants and founded the city of Santiago de Nueva Extremadura, now [[Santiago de Chile]], on February 12, 1541&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Carta a sus apoderados en la corte |last=Valdivia |first=Pedro de |authorlink=Pedro de Valdivia |coauthors= |date=October 15, 1550 |publisher= |location=  |language=Spanish |isbn= |page= |pages= |quote=...y llegado al valle de Copiapó, lo que trabajé en hacer la guerra a los naturales e fuertes que les rompí y la guerra que hice por todos los valles adelante, hasta que llegué al valle de Mapocho, que es cien leguas de Copiapó, e fundé la cibdad de Sanctiago del Nuevo Extremo, a los veinte e cuatro de hebrero del año de mill quinientos e cuarenta e uno, formando Cabildo, Justicia e Regimiento. |url=http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/servlet/SirveObras/12593842001258285209068/index.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Although Valdivia found little gold in Chile he could see the agricultural richness of the land. He continued his explorations of the region west of the Andes and founded over a dozen towns and established the first [[encomienda]]s. The greatest resistance to Spanish rule came from the [[Mapuche]] culture, who opposed European conquest and colonization until the 1880s; this resistance is known as the [[Arauco War]]. Valdivia died at the [[Battle of Tucapel]], defeated by [[Lautaro (toqui)|Lautaro]], a young Mapuche ''[[toqui]]'' (war chief), but the European conquest was well underway. The Spaniards never subjugated the Mapuche territories; various attempts at conquest, both by military and peaceful means, failed. The Great Uprising of 1598 swept all Spanish presence south of the [[Bío-Bío River]] except Chiloé (and Valdivia which was decades later reestablished as a fort), and the great river became the frontier line between Mapuche lands and the Spanish realm.
North of that line cities grew up slowly, and Chilean lands eventually became an important source of food for the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]].

Valdivia became the first governor of the [[Captaincy General of Chile]]. In that post, he obeyed the viceroy of Peru and, through him, the King of Spain and his bureaucracy. Responsible to the governor, town councils known as [[Cabildo (council)|''Cabildo'']] administered local municipalities, the most important of which was Santiago, which was the seat of a Royal Appeals Court ({{lang-es|Real Audiencia}}) from 1609 until the end of colonial rule.

Chile was the least wealthy realm of the Spanish Crown for most of its colonial history. Only in the 18th century did a steady economic and demographic growth begin, an effect of the reforms by Spain's [[Bourbon Spain|Bourbon dynasty]] and a more stable situation along the frontier.

==Independence (1810-1826)==
[[Image:ohiggins.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Bernardo O'Higgins]]]]
The drive for independence from Spain was precipitated by usurpation of the Spanish throne by [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]]'s brother [[Joseph Bonaparte]]. The Chilean War of Independence was part of the larger [[Spanish American wars of independence|Spanish American independence movement]], and it was far from having unanimous support among Chileans, who became divided between independentists and royalists. What started as an elitist political movement against their colonial master, finally ended as a full-fledged civil war between pro-Independence [[Criollo people|Criollos]] who sought political and economic independence from Spain and [[royalist (Spanish American Revolution)|royalist]] Criollos, who supported the continued allegiance to and permanence within the [[Spanish Empire]] of the [[Captaincy General of Chile|Kingdom of Chile]]. The struggle for independence was a war within the upper class, although the majority of troops on both sides consisted of conscripted mestizos and native Americans.

The beginning of the Independence movement is traditionally dated as September 18, 1810 when a national junta was established to govern Chile in the name of the deposed king [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Ferdinand VII]]. Depending on what terms one uses to define the end, the movement extended until 1821 (when the Spanish were expelled from mainland Chile) or 1826 (when the last Spanish troops surrendered and [[Chiloé]] was incorporated to the Chilean republic). The independence process is normally divided into three stages: ''Patria Vieja'', ''Reconquista'', and ''Patria Nueva''. 

Chile's first experiment with self-government, the &quot;Patria Vieja&quot; (''old republic'', 1810–14), was led by [[José Miguel Carrera]], an aristocrat then in his mid-twenties. The military-educated Carrera was a heavy-handed ruler who aroused widespread opposition. Another of the earliest advocates of full independence, [[Bernardo O'Higgins]], captained a rival faction that plunged the Criollos into civil war. For him and for certain other members of the Chilean elite, the initiative for temporary self-rule quickly escalated into a campaign for permanent independence, although other Criollos remained loyal to Spain. Among those favoring independence, conservatives fought with liberals over the degree to which French revolutionary ideas would be incorporated into the movement. After several efforts, Spanish troops from Peru took advantage of the internecine strife to reconquer Chile in 1814, when they reasserted control by winning the [[Battle of Rancagua]] on October 12. O'Higgins, Carrera and many of the Chilean rebels escaped to Argentina.

The second period was characterized by the Spanish attempts to reimpose arbitrary rule during the period known as the ''[[Reconquista (Spanish America)|Reconquista]]'' of 1814-17 (&quot;Reconquest&quot;: the term echoes the ''[[Reconquista]]'' in which the Christian kingdoms retook Iberia from the Muslims). During this period, the harsh rule of the Spanish loyalists, who punished suspected rebels, drove more and more Chileans into the insurrectionary camp. More members of the Chilean elite were becoming convinced of the necessity of full independence, regardless of who sat on the throne of Spain. As the leader of guerrilla raids against the Spaniards, [[Manuel Rodríguez]] became a national symbol of resistance.

[[Image:Battle of Chacabuco.jpg|thumb|250px|Chilean and Argentinean troops going to the [[Battle of Chacabuco]] (February 12, 1817) lead by [[José de San Martín]].]]
In exile in Argentina, O'Higgins joined forces with [[José de San Martín]]. Their combined army freed Chile with a daring assault over the Andes in 1817, defeating the Spaniards at the [[Battle of Chacabuco]] on February 12 and marking the beginning of the ''Patria Nueva''. San Martín considered the liberation of Chile a strategic stepping-stone to the emancipation of Peru, which he saw as the key to hemispheric victory over the Spanish. Chile won its formal independence when San Martín defeated the last large Spanish force on Chilean soil at the [[Battle of Maipú]] on April 5, 1818. San Martín then led his Argentine and Chilean followers north to liberate Peru; and fighting continued in Chile's southern provinces, the bastion of the royalists, until 1826.

A [[Chilean Declaration of Independence|declaration of independence]] was officially issued by Chile on February 12, 1818 and formally recognized by Spain in 1840, when full diplomatic relations were established.

==Republican period==
===Constitutional organization (1818-1833)===
From 1817 to 1823, Bernardo O'Higgins ruled Chile as [[supreme director]]. He won plaudits for defeating royalists and founding schools, but civil strife continued. O'Higgins alienated liberals and provincials with his authoritarianism, conservatives and the church with his anticlericalism, and landowners with his proposed reforms of the land tenure system. His attempt to devise a constitution in 1818 that would legitimize his government failed, as did his effort to generate stable funding for the new administration. O'Higgins's dictatorial behavior aroused resistance in the provinces. This growing discontent was reflected in the continuing opposition of partisans of [[José Miguel Carrera|Carrera]], who was executed by the Argentine regime in Mendoza in 1821, like his two brothers were three years earlier.

Although opposed by many liberals, O'Higgins angered the Roman Catholic Church with his liberal beliefs. He maintained Catholicism's status as the official state religion but tried to curb the church's political powers and to encourage religious tolerance as a means of attracting Protestant immigrants and traders. Like the church, the landed aristocracy felt threatened by O'Higgins, resenting his attempts to eliminate noble titles and, more important, to eliminate entailed estates.

O'Higgins's opponents also disapproved of his diversion of Chilean resources to aid San Martín's liberation of Peru. O'Higgins insisted on supporting that campaign because he realized that Chilean independence would not be secure until the Spaniards were routed from the Andean core of the empire. However, amid mounting discontent, troops from the northern and southern provinces forced O'Higgins to resign. Embittered, O'Higgins departed for Peru, where he died in 1842.

After O'Higgins went into exile in 1823, civil conflict continued, focusing mainly on the issues of anticlericalism and regionalism. Presidents and constitutions rose and fell quickly in the 1820s. The civil struggle's harmful effects on the economy, and particularly on exports, prompted conservatives to seize national control in 1830.

In the minds of most members of the Chilean elite, the bloodshed and chaos of the late 1820s were attributable to the shortcomings of liberalism and federalism, which had been dominant over conservatism for most of the period. The abolition of slavery in 1823—long before most other countries in the Americas—was considered one of the liberals' few lasting achievements. One liberal leader from the south, [[Ramón Freire]], rode in and out of the presidency several times (1823–27, 1828, 1829, 1830) but could not sustain his authority. From May 1827 to September 1831, with the exception of brief interventions by Freire, the presidency was occupied by [[Francisco Antonio Pinto]], Freire's former vice president. In August 1828, Pinto's first year in office, Chile abandoned its short-lived federalist system for a unitary form of government, with separate legislative, executive, and judicial branches. By adopting a moderately liberal constitution in 1828, Pinto alienated both the federalists and the liberal factions. He also angered the old aristocracy by abolishing estates inherited by primogeniture (mayorazgo) and caused a public uproar with his anticlericalism. After the defeat of his liberal army at the Battle of Lircay on April 17, 1830, Freire, like O'Higgins, went into exile in Peru.

===Conservative Era (1830-1861)===
[[Image:DiegoPortales.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Diego Portales]].]]
Although never president, [[Diego Portales]] dominated Chilean politics from the cabinet and behind the scenes from 1830 to 1837. He installed the &quot;autocratic republic&quot;, which centralized authority in the national government. His political program enjoyed support from merchants, large landowners, foreign capitalists, the church, and the military. Political and economic stability reinforced each other, as Portales encouraged economic growth through free trade and put government finances in order.

Portales was an agnostic who said that he believed in the clergy but not in God. He realized the importance of the Roman Catholic Church as a bastion of loyalty, legitimacy, social control, and stability, as had been the case in the colonial period. He repealed Liberal reforms that had threatened church privileges and properties.

Portales brought the military under civilian control by rewarding loyal generals, cashiering troublemakers, and promoting a victorious war against the [[Peru-Bolivia Confederation]] (1836–39). After defeating Peru and Bolivia, Chile dominated the Pacific Coast of South America. The victory over its neighbors gave Chile and its new political system a psychological boost. Chileans experienced a surge of national enthusiasm and cohesion behind a regime accepted as legitimate and efficacious.

Portales also achieved his objectives by wielding dictatorial powers, censoring the press, and [[electoral fraud|manipulating elections]]. For the next forty years, Chile's armed forces would be distracted from meddling in politics by skirmishes and defensive operations on the [[La Frontera, Chile|southern frontier]], although some units got embroiled in domestic conflicts in [[Revolution of 1851|1851]] and 1859.

The &quot;Portalian State&quot; was institutionalized by the [[Chilean Constitution of 1833]]. One of the most durable charters ever devised in Latin America, the Portalian constitution lasted until 1925. The constitution concentrated authority in the national government, more precisely, in the hands of the president, who was elected by a tiny minority. The chief executive could serve two consecutive five-year terms and then pick a successor. Although the Congress had significant budgetary powers, it was overshadowed by the president, who appointed provincial officials. The constitution also created an independent judiciary, guaranteed inheritance of estates by primogeniture, and installed Catholicism as the state religion. In short, it established an autocratic system under a republican veneer.

The first Portalian president was General [[Joaquín Prieto]], who served two terms (1831–36, 1836–41). President Prieto had four main accomplishments: implementation of the 1833 constitution, stabilization of government finances, defeat of provincial challenges to central authority, and victory over the Peru-Bolivia Confederation. During the presidencies of Prieto and his two successors, Chile modernized through the construction of ports, railroads, and telegraph lines, some built by United States entrepreneur William Wheelwright. These innovations facilitated the export-import trade as well as domestic commerce.

Prieto and his adviser, Portales, feared the efforts of Bolivian general [[Andrés de Santa Cruz]] to unite with Peru against Chile. These qualms exacerbated animosities toward Peru dating from the colonial period, now intensified by disputes over customs duties and loans. Chile also wanted to become the dominant South American military and commercial power along the Pacific. Portales got Congress to declare war on Peru in 1836.

===Liberal era (1861-1891)===
The political revolt brought little social change, however, and 19th century Chilean society preserved the essence of the stratified colonial social structure, which was greatly influenced by family politics and the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. A strong presidency eventually emerged, but wealthy landowners remained powerful.&lt;ref name=&quot;USDoS&quot;&gt;{{Cite web

[[File:Sinking_of_the_Esmeralda_during_the_battle_of_Iquique.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Battle of Iquique]] - the sinking of the Esmeralda (21 May 1879).]]
Toward the end of the nineteenth century, the government in Santiago consolidated its position in the south by persistently suppressing the [[Mapuche]] during the [[Occupation of the Araucanía]]. In 1881, it signed a treaty with [[Argentina]] confirming Chilean sovereignty over the [[Strait of Magellan]], but conceding all of oriental [[Patagonia]], and a considerable fraction of the territory it had during colonial times. As a result of the [[War of the Pacific]] with [[Peru]] and [[Bolivia]] (1879–1883), Chile expanded its territory northward by almost one-third and acquired valuable [[nitrate]] deposits, the exploitation of which led to an era of national affluence.

In the 1870s, the church influence started to diminish slightly with the passing of several laws that took some old roles of the church into the State's hands such as the registry of births and marriages. 

[[Image:JoseManuelBalmaceda.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[José Manuel Balmaceda]]]]
In 1886, [[José Manuel Balmaceda]] was elected president. His economic policies visibly changed the existing liberal policies. He began to violate the [[constitution]] and slowly began to establish a dictatorship. Congress decided to depose Balmaceda, who refused to step down. [[Jorge Montt]], among others, directed an armed conflict against Balmaceda, which soon extended into the [[Chilean Civil War]] of 1891. Defeated, Balmaceda fled to Argentina's embassy, where he committed suicide. Jorge Montt became the new president.

==Parliamentary republic (1891-1925)==
The so-called Parliamentary Republic was not a true parliamentary system, in which the chief executive is elected by the legislature. It was, however, an unusual regime in presidentialist Latin America, for Congress really did overshadow the rather ceremonial office of the president and exerted authority over the chief executive's cabinet appointees. In turn, Congress was dominated by the landed elites. This was the heyday of classic political and economic liberalism.

For many decades thereafter, historians derided the Parliamentary Republic as a quarrel-prone system that merely distributed spoils and clung to its laissez-faire policy while national problems mounted.&lt;ref name=&quot;country-data.com&quot;&gt;http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-2410.html&lt;/ref&gt; The characterization is epitomized by an observation made by President [[Ramón Barros Luco]] (1910–15), reputedly made in reference to labor unrest: &quot;There are only two kinds of problems: those that solve themselves and those that can't be solved.&quot; At the mercy of Congress, cabinets came and went frequently, although there was more stability and continuity in public administration than some historians have suggested. Chile also temporary resolved its border disputes with Argentina with the [[Puna de Atacama Lawsuit]] of 1899, the [[Boundary treaty of 1881 between Chile and Argentina]] and the [[1902 General Treaty of Arbitration]]. 

Political authority ran from local electoral bosses in the provinces through the congressional and executive branches, which reciprocated with payoffs from taxes on nitrate sales. Congressmen often won election by bribing voters in this clientelistic and corrupt system. Many politicians relied on intimidated or loyal peasant voters in the countryside, even though the population was becoming increasingly urban. The lackluster presidents and ineffectual administrations of the period did little to respond to the country's dependence on volatile nitrate exports, spiraling inflation, and massive urbanization.&lt;ref name=&quot;country-data.com&quot;/&gt;

In recent years, however, particularly when the authoritarian regime of Augusto Pinochet is taken into consideration, some scholars have reevaluated the Parliamentary Republic of 1891-1925.&lt;ref name=&quot;country-data.com&quot;/&gt; Without denying its shortcomings, they have lauded its democratic stability. They have also hailed its control of the armed forces, it respect for civil liberties, its expansion of suffrage and participation, and its gradual admission of new contenders, especially reformers, to the political arena. In particular, two young parties grew in importance - the Democrat Party, with roots among artisans and urban workers, and the [[Radical Party (Chile)|Radical Party]], representing urban middle sectors and provincial elites. By the early twentieth century, both parties were winning increasing numbers of seats in Congress. The more leftist members of the Democrat Party became involved in the leadership of labor unions and broke off to launch the [[Communist Party of Chile|Socialist Workers' Party]] ({{lang-es|Partido Obrero Socialista}} - POS) in 1912. The founder of the POS and its best-known leader, [[Luis Emilio Recabarren]], also founded the [[Communist Party of Chile]] ({{lang-es|Partido Comunista de Chile}} - PCCh) in 1922.

==Presidential republic (1925-1973)==
[[File:Arturo Alessandi Palma 2.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Arturo Alessandri Palma]].]]
By the 1920s, the emerging middle and working classes were powerful enough to elect a reformist president, [[Arturo Alessandri Palma]]. Alessandri appealed to those who believed the social question should be addressed, to those worried by the decline in nitrate exports during World War I, and to those weary of presidents dominated by Congress. Promising &quot;evolution to avoid revolution&quot;, he pioneered a new campaign style of appealing directly to the masses with florid oratory and charisma. After winning a seat in the Senate representing the mining north in 1915, he earned the sobriquet &quot;Lion of Tarapacá.&quot; As a dissident Liberal running for the presidency, Alessandri attracted support from the more reformist Radicals and Democrats and formed the so-called Liberal Alliance. He received strong backing from the middle and working classes as well as from the provincial elites. Students and intellectuals also rallied to his banner. At the same time, he reassured the landowners that social reforms would be limited to the cities.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-2412.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Alessandri soon discovered that his efforts to lead would be blocked by the conservative Congress. Like Balmaceda, he infuriated the legislators by going over their heads to appeal to the voters in the congressional elections of 1924. His reform legislation was finally rammed through Congress under pressure from younger military officers, who were sick of the neglect of the armed forces, political infighting, social unrest, and galloping inflation. whose program was frustrated by a conservative congress.

A double military coup set off a period of great political instability that lasted until 1932. First military right-wingers opposing Alessandri seized power in September 1924, and then reformers in favor of the ousted president took charge in January 1925. The ''[[Saber noise]]'' (ruido de sables) incident of September 1924, provoked by discontent of young officers, mostly lieutenants from middle and working classes, lead to the establishment of the [[September Junta]] led by General [[Luis Altamirano]] and the exile of Alessandri.  However, fears of a conservative restoration in progressive sectors of the army led to [[1925 Chilean coup d'état|another coup in January]], which ended with the establishment of the [[January Junta]] as interim government while waiting for Alessandri's return. The latter group was led by two colonels, [[Carlos Ibáñez del Campo]] and [[Marmaduke Grove]]. They returned Alessandri to the presidency that March and enacted his promised reforms by decree. The latter re-assumed power in March, and a [[Chilean Constitution of 1925|new Constitution]] encapsulating his proposed reforms was ratified in a plebiscite in September 1925. The new constitution gave increased powers to the presidency. Alessandri broke with the [[classical liberalism]]'s policies of ''[[laissez-faire]]'' by creating a [[Chilean Central Bank|Central Bank]] and imposing a [[revenue tax]]. However, social discontents were also crushed, leading to the [[Marusia massacre]] in March 1925 followed by the [[La Coruña massacre]].

The longest lasting of the ten governments between 1924 and 1932 was that of General Carlos Ibáñez, who briefly held power in 1925 and then again between 1927 and 1931 in what was a ''de facto'' dictatorship. When constitutional rule was restored in 1932, a strong middle-class party, the Radicals, emerged. It became the key force in coalition governments for the next 20 years. 

The [[Seguro Obrero Massacre]] took place on September 5, 1938, in the midst of a heated three-way election campaign between the ultraconservative [[Gustavo Ross Santa María]], the radical [[Popular Front (Chile)|Popular Front]]'s [[Pedro Aguirre Cerda]], and the newly-formed Popular Alliance candidate, [[Carlos Ibáñez del Campo]]. The [[National Socialist Movement of Chile]] supported Ibáñez's candidacy, which had been announced on September 4. In order to preempt Ross's victory, the National Socialists mounted a [[coup d'état]] that was intended to take down the rightwing government of [[Arturo Alessandri Palma]] and place Ibáñez in power.

During the period of [[Radical Party (Chile)|Radical Party]] dominance (1932–52), the state increased its role in the economy. In 1952, voters returned Ibáñez to office for another 6 years. [[Jorge Alessandri]] succeeded Ibáñez in 1958.

The [[Chilean presidential election, 1964|1964 presidential election]] of [[Christian Democrat]] [[Eduardo Frei Montalva]] by an [[absolute majority]] initiated a period of major reform. Under the slogan &quot;Revolution in Liberty&quot;, the Frei administration embarked on far-reaching social and economic programs, particularly in education, housing, and [[agrarian reform]], including rural unionization of agricultural workers. By 1967, however, Frei encountered increasing opposition from leftists, who charged that his reforms were inadequate, and from conservatives, who found them excessive. At the end of his term, Frei had accomplished many noteworthy objectives, but he had not fully achieved his party's ambitious goals.

==Collapse of democracy==
[[File:Allende supporters.jpg|thumb|250px|Marchers for [[Salvador Allende]].]]
In the [[Chilean presidential election, 1970|1970 presidential election]], Senator [[Salvador Allende|Salvador Allende Gossens]] won a [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]] of votes in a three-way contest. He was a [[Marxism|Marxist]] physician and member of Chile's [[Socialist Party of Chile|Socialist Party]], who headed the &quot;[[Popular Unity]]&quot; (UP or &quot;Unidad Popular&quot;) coalition of the Socialist, Communist, Radical, and Social-Democratic Parties, along with dissident Christian Democrats, the [[Popular Unitary Action Movement]] (MAPU), and the Independent Popular Action. Allende had two main competitors in the election — [[Radomiro Tomic]], representing the incumbent Christian Democratic party, who ran a left-wing campaign with much the same theme as Allende's, and the right-wing former president [[Jorge Alessandri]]. In the end, Allende received a plurality of the votes cast, getting 36% of the vote against Alessandri's 34% and Tomic's 27%. 

Despite pressure from the government of the United States,&lt;ref name=CIA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/news/20001113/|title=Chile: 16,000 Secret Documents Declassified|year=2000|publisher=Chile Documentation Project, The National Security Archive|location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[National Congress of Chile|Chilean Congress]], keeping with tradition, conducted a runoff vote between the leading candidates, Allende and former president [[Jorge Alessandri]]. This procedure had previously been a near-formality, yet became quite fraught in 1970. After assurances of legality on Allende's part, the murder of the Army Commander-in-Chief, General [[René Schneider]] and Frei's refusal to form an alliance with Alessandri to oppose Allende - on the grounds that the Christian Democrats were a workers' party and could not make common cause with the oligarchs - Allende was chosen by a vote of 153 to 35. 

The Popular Unity platform included the nationalization of U.S. interests in Chile's major [[copper]] mines, the advancement of workers' rights, implementation of [[land reform]], reorganization of the national economy into socialized, mixed, and private sectors, a foreign policy of &quot;international solidarity&quot; and national independence and a new institutional order (the &quot;people's state&quot; or &quot;poder popular&quot;), including the institution of a unicameral congress. Immediately after the election, the United States expressed its disapproval and raised a number of economic sanctions against Chile.&lt;ref name=&quot;CIA&quot;/&gt; In addition, the [[CIA]]'s website reports that the agency aided three different Chilean opposition groups during that time period and &quot;sought to instigate a coup to prevent Allende from taking office&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;CIA&quot;/&gt; The action plans to prevent Allende from coming to power were known as Track I and [[Project FUBELT|Track II]].&lt;ref name=Kornbluh&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kornbluh |first=Peter |date=1998-10-25 |title=The Chile Coup -- The U.S. Hand |journal=If Magazine |url=http://globalresearch.ca/articles/KOR309A.html |accessdate=2009-09-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, indigenous and peasant forces across the country violently started to take control of agricultural lands, forcibly fulfilling Allende's land redistribution promises. 

In the first year of Allende's term, the short-term economic results of Economics Minister [[Pedro Vuskovic]]'s [[Vuskovic plan|expansive monetary policy]] were unambiguously favorable: 12% industrial growth and an 8.6% increase in [[Gross domestic product|GDP]], accompanied by major declines in inflation (down from 34.9% to 22.1%) and unemployment (down to 3.8%). Allende adopted measures including price freezes, wage increases, and tax reforms, which had the effect of increasing consumer spending and redistributing income downward. Joint public-private [[public works]] projects helped reduce unemployment. Much of the banking sector was [[nationalization|nationalized]]. Many enterprises within the copper, [[coal]], [[iron]], [[nitrate]], and [[steel]] industries were [[expropriation|expropriated]], nationalized, or subjected to state intervention. Industrial output increased sharply and [[unemployment]] fell during the administration's first year. However, these results were not sustainable and in 1972 the Chilean ''escudo'' had runaway [[inflation]] of 140%. An [[economic depression]] that had begun in 1967 peaked in 1972, exacerbated by [[capital flight]], plummeting private investment, and withdrawal of bank deposits in response to Allende's socialist program. Production fell and unemployment rose. The combination of inflation and government-mandated price-fixing led to the rise of [[black market]]s in rice, beans, sugar, and flour, and a &quot;disappearance&quot; of such basic commodities from supermarket shelves&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glamorama.cl/medio/articulo/0,0,38035857_178048856_151840537,00.html]&lt;/ref&gt;.

As a result, the [[Richard Nixon]] administration [[United States intervention in Chile|organized and inserted secret operatives]] in Chile, in order to quickly destabilize Allende's government.&lt;ref name=Kornbluh/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB8/ch01-01.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB8/ch27-01.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB8/ch05-01.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB8/nsaebb8.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Nixon gave instructions to make the Chilean economy scream,&lt;ref name=Times/&gt; and international financial pressure restricted economic credit to Chile. Simultaneously, the [[CIA]] funded opposition media, politicians, and organizations, helping to accelerate a campaign of domestic destabilization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.derechos.org/nizkor/chile/doc/hinchey.html]&lt;/ref&gt; By 1972, the economic progress of Allende's first year had been reversed, and the economy was in crisis. Political polarization increased, and large mobilizations of both pro- and anti-government groups became frequent, often leading to clashes.

By 1973, Chilean society had grown highly polarized, between strong opponents and equally strong supporters of Salvador Allende and his government. Military actions and movements, separate from the civilian authority, began to manifest in the countryside. A failed military [[coup d'état|coup]] was attempted against Allende in June 1973&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://foia.state.gov/Reports/HincheyReport.asp|title=CIA Activities in Chile|date=September 18, 2000|publisher=Hinchey Report|location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In its &quot;[[Wikisource:Agreement of the Chamber of Deputies of Chile|Agreement]]&quot;, on August 22, 1973, the [[Chamber of Deputies of Chile]] asserted that Chilean democracy had broken down and called for &quot;redirecting government activity&quot;, to restore constitutional rule. Less than a month later, on September 11, 1973, the Chilean military deposed Allende, who apparently [[Death of Salvador Allende|shot himself in the head]] to avoid capture&lt;ref name=Kornbluh/&gt;&lt;ref name=Allende&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.eluniversal.com.mx/pls/impreso/noticia.html?id_nota=164983&amp;tabla=notas |title=Admite hija de Allende suicidio de su padre |date=August 17, 2003|publisher=[[El Universal (Mexico City)|El Universal]]|location=Mexico City, Mexico |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the [[Palacio de La Moneda|Presidential Palace]] was surrounded and bombed. Subsequently, rather than restore governmental authority to the civilian legislature, [[Augusto Pinochet]] exploited his role as Commander of the Army to [[Chilean coup of 1973|seize total power]] and to establish himself at the head of a [[Military dictatorship|junta]].

The first years of the regime were marked by [[human rights violation]]s. On October 1973, at least 72 people were murdered by the [[Caravan of Death]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/850932.stm| work=[[BBC News]]|title=Flashback: Caravan of Death| accessdate=2008-05-02 | date=July 25, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; At least a thousand people were executed during the first six months of Pinochet in office, and at least two thousand more were killed during the next sixteen years, as reported by the [[Rettig Report]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.usip.org/library/tc/doc/reports/chile/chile_1993_toc.html&lt;/ref&gt; About 30,000 left the country, and tens of thousands of people were detained and tortured, as investigated by the 2004 [[Valech Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4050655.stm] Chile torture victims win payout&lt;/ref&gt; A new [[Constitution]] was approved by [[plebiscite]] characterized by the absence of registration lists, on September 11, 1980, and General Pinochet became president of the republic for an 8-year term. 
In the late 1980s, the government gradually permitted greater freedom of assembly, [[Freedom of speech|speech]], and association, to include trade union and political activity. The government launched market-oriented reforms, which have continued ever since. Chile moved toward a [[free market economy]] that saw an increase in domestic and foreign private investment, although the copper industry and other important mineral resources were not opened for competition. In a plebiscite on October 5, 1988, General Pinochet was denied a second 8-year term as president (56% against 44%)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/chile/88.htm|title=Country Study of Chile: Authoritarianism Defeated by Its Own Rules|date=March 31, 1994|publisher=US Library of Congress|location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[Image:GDP per capita LA-Chile.png‎|thumb|right|250px|Chilean (blue) and average Latin American (orange) [[GDP per capita]] (1950-2007).]]

The junta embarked on a radical program of [[liberalization]] and [[privatization]], slashing [[tariff]]s as well as government welfare programs and [[deficit]]s.&lt;ref&gt;http://crs.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/17/2/57&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973, Chile was in shambles - [[inflation]] was hundreds of percents, the country had no [[foreign reserves]], and [[Depression (economics)|GDP was falling]].&lt;ref name=&quot;brauchle&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecaef.org/klex/user/1/41894820_10_10.ppt|title=Applied Theory: The Reforms in Chile|author=Manfred Bräuchle}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to halt the ongoing economic collapse, [[Miracle of Chile|economic reforms]] were drafted by a group of technocrats known as the [[Chicago Boys]] because many of them had been trained or influenced by [[University of Chicago]] professors. The first reforms were implemented in three rounds - 1974-1983, 1985, and 1990.&lt;ref name=&quot;brauchle&quot;/&gt;

After the economic crisis of 1982, [[Hernan Buchi]] became Minister of Finance from 1985 to 1989.  He allowed the peso to float and reinstated restrictions on the movement of capital in and out of the country. He introduced banking legislation, simplified and reduced the corporate tax. Chile pressed ahead with privatizations, including public utilities plus the re-privatization of companies that had returned to the government during the 1982–1983 crisis. Under these new policies, the rate of inflation dropped from about 1,000% per year to about 10% per year. While this was still a high rate of inflation, it allowed the economy to start recovering. From 1984 to 1990, Chile's gross domestic product grew by an annual average of 5.9%, the fastest on the continent. Chile developed a good export economy, including the export of fruits and vegetables to the northern hemisphere when they were out of season, and commanded high prices.

An important initiative begun in 1981 and carried on until today, aimed at modernizing the use of [[Information and Communication technology]], greatly contributed to disentangle the traditional bureaucratic and cumbersome clerical procedures in all dealings with branches of the government, from [[civil registry]] to import/export documentation, thereby fostering a more agile economy and a more efficient [[public administration]].

The military junta began to change during the late 1970s. Due to problems with Pinochet, Leigh was expelled from the junta in 1978 and replaced by General [[Fernando Matthei]]. Due to the [[Caso Degollados]] (&quot;slit throats case&quot;), in which three [[Chilean Communist Party|Communist party]] members were assassinated, [[César Mendoza]], member of the junta since 1973 and representants of the [[Carabineros de Chile|carabineros]], resigned in 1985 and was replaced by [[Rodolfo Stange]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} The next year, [[Carmen Gloria Quintana]] was burnt alive in what became known as the [[Burnt Alive case|Caso Quemado]] (&quot;Burnt Alive case&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}}http://www.cidh.oas.org/annualrep/87.88sp/Chile9755.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Problems with Argentina coming from the 19th century reached a high in 1978, with disagreements over the Beagle Canal. The two countries agreed to papal mediation over the canal. Chilean-Argentine relations remained bad, however, and Chile helped Britain during the [[Falklands War]].

Chile's [[Constitution of Chile|constitution]] was approved in a national plebiscite held in September 1980. It came into force in March 1981. It established that in 1988 there would be another plebiscite in which the voters would accept or reject a single candidate proposed by the Military Junta. Pinochet was, as expected, the candidate proposed, and he was denied a second 8 year term by 54.5% of the vote.

==Return to democracy==
Chileans elected a new president and the majority of members of a two-chamber congress on December 14, 1989. Christian Democrat [[Patricio Aylwin]], the candidate of a coalition of 17 political parties called the ''[[Coalition of Parties for Democracy|Concertación]]'', received an absolute majority of votes (55%)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE6DD1E3BF935A25751C1A96F948260|title=Man in the News: Patricio Aylwin; A Moderate Leads Chile|work=[[The New York Times]]| accessdate=2008-05-02 | first=Shirley | last=Christian | date=December 16, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;. President Aylwin served from 1990 to 1994, in what was considered a transition period. In February 1991 Aylwin created the [[National Commission for Truth and Reconciliation]], which released in February 1991 the [[Rettig Report]] on human rights violations committed during the military rule. This report counted 2,279 cases of &quot;[[forced disappearance|disappearances]]&quot; which could be proved and registered. Of course, the very nature of &quot;disappearances&quot; made such investigations very difficult. The same problem arose, several years later, with the [[Valech Report]], released in 2004 and which counted almost 30,000 victims of [[torture]], among testimonies from 35,000 persons.

[[File:Edo.Frei.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle]].]]
In December 1993, Christian Democrat [[Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle]], the son of previous president [[Eduardo Frei Montalva]], led the Concertación coalition to victory with an absolute majority of votes (58%)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1P2-8257609.html|title=Chile elects new leader Late president's son wins big|accessdate=2008-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Frei Ruiz-Tagle was succeeded in 2000 by Socialist [[Ricardo Lagos]], who won the presidency in an unprecedented [[runoff election]] against [[Joaquín Lavín]] of the rightist [[Alliance for Chile]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2000/WORLD/americas/01/17/chile.elex.01/|title=Moderate socialist Lagos wins Chilean presidential election|publisher=[[CNN]]|date=January 16, 2000| accessdate=2008-05-02}} {{Dead link|date=August 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;, by a very tight score of less than 200,000 votes (51,32%).

In 1998, [[Augusto Pinochet]] traveled to London for back surgery. But under orders of Spanish judge [[Baltasar Garzón]], he was [[Augusto Pinochet's arrest and trial|arrested there]], attracting worldwide attention, not only because of the past history of Chile and South America, but also because this was one of the first arrest of a former president based on the [[universal jurisdiction]] principle. Pinochet tried to defend himself by referring to the [[State Immunity Act of 1978]], an argument rejected by the British justice. However, [[Home Secretary|UK Home Secretary]] [[Jack Straw]] took the responsibility to release him on medical grounds, and refused to extradite him to Spain. Thereafter, Pinochet returned to Chile in March 2000. Upon descending the plane on his wheelchair, he stood up and saluted the cheering crowd of supporters, including an army band playing his favorite military march tunes, which was awaiting him at the airport in Santiago. President [[Ricardo Lagos]] later commented that the retired general's televised arrival had damaged the image of Chile, while thousands demonstrated against him&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/665342.stm|title=Thousands march against Pinochet|date=March 4, 2000|publisher=[[BBC News]]|location=London, UK|accessdate=2008-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;.


The ''Concertación'' coalition has continued to dominate Chilean politics for last two decades. In January 2006 Chileans elected their first woman president, [[Michelle Bachelet]], of the Socialist Party&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/10819903/|title=Chile elects first woman president|publisher=[[msnbc.com]]|accessdate=2008-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;. She was sworn in on March 11, 2006, extending the ''Concertación'' coalition governance for another four years&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/03/11/AR2006031101381.html|title=Bachelet Sworn In As Chile's President|publisher=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=2008-05-02 | first=Monte | last=Reel | date=March 12, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

In 2002 Chile signed an association agreement with the [[European Union]] (comprising FTA, political and cultural agreements), in 2003, an extensive free trade agreement with the United States, and in 2004 with [[South Korea]], expecting a boom in import and export of local produce and becoming a regional trade-hub. Continuing the coalition's free-trade strategy, in August 2006 President Bachelet promulgated a [[free trade agreement]] with the [[People's Republic of China]] (signed under the previous administration of Ricardo Lagos), the first Chinese free-trade agreement with a Latin American nation; similar deals with Japan and India were promulgated in August 2007. In October 2006, Bachelet promulgated a multilateral trade deal with New Zealand, [[Singapore]] and [[Brunei]], the [[Trans-Pacific Strategic Economic Partnership]] (P4), also signed under Lagos' presidency. Regionally, she has signed bilateral free-trade agreements with [[Panama]], [[Peru]] and [[Colombia]].

After 52 years, Chile is now heading in a new direction.  Over half of the registered voting population of Chile has opted for a change away from center-left politics by electing a right-wing candidate, [[Sebastián Piñera]], during the [[Chilean presidential election, 2009–2010]]; although Pinochet was considered right-wing and was affirmed in the 1980 election. Piñera is also Chile's first billionaire to be elected.''&lt;ref&gt;PBS Newshour [http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/2010/01/radical-change-in-chile-with-new-right-wing-president.html Chile Elects First Right-Wing President in 52 Years]&lt;/ref&gt;'' The new president has voiced a desire for a government of national unity, and promises to move his coalition to the center, away from the political polarization that has plagued Chilean politics and society since the coup d'état of 1973. Piñera will also inheret a $16 billions USD surplus attained by Chile while copper prices were high.''&lt;ref&gt;The Economist [http://www.economist.com/world/americas/displaystory.cfm?story_id=15330886 Piñera promises a gallop]&lt;/ref&gt;''

      <text xml:space="preserve">====Chapter I: Metroland====

The housing developments that lined the Metropolitan Railway line, from Wembley to Harrow... and on to Northwood Hills, started at the behest of the government’s call: to give work to the unemployed building workers, stimulate the national economy, provide new homes for the white collar workers of London, and house the new industrial workers manufacturing the latest home gadgets and electrical tools. Mostly the inhabitants were: young, optimistic, forward thinking and well educated. These were people starting out in life, ready to make a go of it! It was a period, just after the arts and crafts movement; a utilitarian, mass produced construction style, for the masses.There were no factories in such dormitory towns, no large offices, or distribution centres. Most of the men, and the few women, who were working, were white collar workers. The majority of outer London citizens voted Conservative - who was in office. This was the time of Baldwin’s Second Ministry. Two years later, in 1928, women achieved the vote – were enfranchised, at the age of twenty-one.

The General Election in May 1929, brought Ramsey MacDonald, and the Labour Party, into office. Their main programme was to sort out the unemployment problems – to return the nation to work. Their majority was small. MacDonald called on the Liberals to help. They were influenced by the economist thinking of Keynes who advised a massive programme of public works inline with the thinking of the Labour Minister, Oswald Moseley, and the party back benchers. This solution was eminently sensible but was rejected by the cabinet. Sixteen weeks later the Stock Market Crash occurred in New York which, coming on top of Britain’s already critical industrial scene, was immediate and devastating. It is unnecessary to describe how the government and the nation considered this event. By 1930 there were two and a half million unemployed. It did not stop there! In Germany the banking system collapsed. There was a run on the pound. The cabinet would not agree to cuts in spending or in reducing the unemployment benefit.

There was no unemployment… the majority of women stayed at home - looking after the house, and children. No child went to school without shoes or socks; there were no soup kitchens or riots, pickets or disturbances. It was calm and tranquil, clean and bright. The town had a full range of shops, and one cinema. There wasn’t a theatre, factory, office block or car park in sight. The policeman walked his beat; the road sweeper swept the leaves into the gutters – the colourful piles defying the wind. A time when the rag-and-bone-man sang his call… the milkman, coalman, and baker, delivered by horse and cart, and the onion seller, knife grinder and scrap-iron merchant circled the roads, shouting their wares.

Outside many of the houses a coachwork pram is parked with a fringed canopy, its charge asleep, inside – it is outside the front-door, catching the morning sun - creating a shadow on the ground. The frill of the stretched sun-shade flutters gently. Leading off, down the tiled front path, the bow topped gate swings on its hinges. Not a sound disturbs the sleeping youngster… all is at peace. The mother is inside the house preparing a meal feeling secure and content. The picture is complete.

From many sources it has been declared, ‘a time of depression’ - coming from a lowering of workers wages. This industrial slump, or sharp decline, had, as its source, The First World War. Britain lost its position as the worlds leading economy in the late thirties - just before that war. The depression was all that was needed to cast Britain down… to finally lose out to the other main European economies, forty years later - in the 1970s. 

In May 1929, a General Election gave Labour 287 seats, while the Conservatives had 260. Baldwin resigned, and MacDonald took office again. This Labour government needed the support of the Liberals, for on its own it lacked power to affect change - limited radical thinking. Later that year, the Stock Market Crash in New York, saw the beginning of The American Depression which had a knock-on effect to Britain. The main effect was felt in the north where most of Britain’s heavy industry is located. The opposition parties demanded further cuts including the public sector workers wages, putting a brake on government projects. What further hurt the poor was a cut ordered in the payment of unemployment benefits. MacDonald appointed four Ministers – Thomas, Lansbury, Johnston, and Mosley. This special body of politicians had the specific task to deal with the problem of unemployment.

The period from the General Strike in 1926, when the union leaders fully appreciated the political implications of their industrial action wouldn’t lead anywhere, till today, has seen the integration of the unions into all processes of government. State assistance to particular industries integrated the Government into both what the managements and unions wanted. This was necessary with the beginnings of rearmament and ultimately war. The General Strike set the momentum of the unions back, losing half a million members from the congress.

The Government feared complete industrial and social dislocation, which seemed inevitable. There were thousands of trained officers and men in civilian life and a sufficiency of army transport; this body of people would save the country from disaster. The Territorial Army was a considerable force. Plans were made to stock food and petrol. Reliable men drove Underground trains, buses and used their private cars as taxis. The trade unions had been given through the media convincing proof that this was going on, and that the rest of the country was not prepared to see chaos. Arrangements were made for the Territorial Army to act as Auxiliary Police, and even be paid a subsidiary allowance. They had little to do for the strike soon over. However, the trades union were left in no doubt of the effective use which could be made of the Territorial Force.

After WWI the troops returned home – most to return to their previous jobs. As they did so, the women who had been doing some of those jobs were dispensed with – pushing them aside to find work in domestic service, the retail trade, and the clothing industry. Britain had to change from war production to peacetime using worn out machine tools and inappropriate production lines. It was an impossible task; there was no chance of amassing sufficient capital - from a depleted order book, to reach a pre-war investment position. The government was advised by The Bank of England to make the pound the same value as the pre-war dollar, nearly five dollars to the pound –convertible to its value in gold. The result made British exports more expensive, reduced demand, cut productivity and naturally, increased unemployment.

The country already had a large number of unemployed, mainly in the north; employers knew they could replace discontented workers, they also knew they could lower the price of their goods if they reduced wages… which they did! The workers were already paid very little objected to a further reduction. The Trades Union Council called for a General Strike, to support the miners who were already on strike against wage cuts and longer hours. Although it was called a general strike it was only for key workers: in transport, iron and steel, building, printing and electricity. Naturally enough this had the effect of shutting down most union controlled businesses for want of power. Even though the strike was over quickly the effects of this, on top of returning the pound to the Gold Standard was that the country stayed in recession…

Cartage Managers managing the distribution and collection of freight, from main line stations, organized their managers, office workers, and sympathetic university students to carry on moving the freight. When possible they loaded and drove a team of horses, in company with others, all through the strike period. The Transport and General Workers Union’s finances were in a dire straight. Not only was the union losing members but those that were members were not paying their membership fees. This was in keeping with my father’s record, who also drove horse wagons, tractors, and vans to help break the strike. 

When looking at Government Figures of central government spending, to give some sort of overview indicating hard times, and times of plenty, the conclusions can only be an approximation. However, what figures one can research do give an expected graph – the national debt in 1920 was gradually reduced, to rise to the same point twenty-four years later –showing a uniform curve. Thereafter, the rise maintained. What we are interested in are the figures for the end of our period and what they were preparing us for. Over the thirties the government department showing the greatest rise is Social Services. This includes health, welfare and education. That department drops back to allow Military Defence to outstrip all others, peaking out in 1943/4. The drop continues… to an expected result. 

Arguments in the Labour party, including some ministers, split the government. Stock market investors took fright withdrawing their money… destabilizing the economy. The upset, caused by the social welfare cuts, broke up the government. Instead of resigning MacDonald accepted a commission from the King to form a so-called ‘National’ Government, dominated by Tories – particularly by, the Tory Chancellor of the Exchequer, Neville Chamberlain. The Labour party objected to this coalition, abandoning MacDonald and his supporters. The weak political strength of the government contributed towards the call for a General Election… the result was a landslide victory for the Tories. The National Party continued in power, still lead by MacDonald, whose efforts - put into restoring national confidence in the government and nation, came to naught… The Liberals withdrew support. The Government started to inject some effort into rearmament which caused a split in the Government ranks. The Party was prepared to provide greater rearmament but only if they had support from the League of Nations. The crisis came over sanctions against Mussolini for invading Abyssinia. Lansbury resigned and Attlee elected Leader of the Labour Party, took his place.

At the start of this period, just before 1930, the country’s unemployment figures rose to one and a quarter million. This figure gradually increased adding a further million; a year later, the figure rose to almost a million a year after that. 1933 was unemployment’s peak, when there were four men for every three jobs. Forty per cent of the unemployed were to be found in coal-mining, iron and steel, shipbuilding, and textiles. After that peak, there was a decline until the 1930. From there, the figures climbed back - to those of the peak, six years later. All these industries were mainly found in the North, Wales and Scotland. The South of England and in the southeast - particularly southern city and town suburbs, the population fared considerably better. Chamberlain forced down interest rates which kicked off the house-building boom. Great Britain started to emerge from the Great Depression…
The budget of 1931 instituted a new round of cuts in public spending and wages, including the pay of the Navy. There was a Naval Mutiny, which created renewed pressure on the pound. The Government abandoned the gold standard. That had an immediate effect of easing pressure – it was a practical decision - allowing exports to compete with prices abroad – that lead the way to an eventual recovery… Gradually employment picked up. Britain was again competitive. 

It is clear that in some parts of the country, and some sections of society, The General Strike and The Years of Depression did not unduly affect some communities. For instance: Middlesex, and particularly Harrow, felt little from the effects of the depression…, perhaps you might included all the Home Counties. To a degree they were cushioned by: the construction of new towns and the production of the necessary materials, and components parts including: the manufacturing of furniture, soft furnishings, kitchen, and household equipment, which had to keep pace. All these commodities continued to flourish stimulated by the low interest rates. There was a demand too: for new electrical gadgets and communication equipment, and as in any new towns it is the furnishing of the baby’s bedroom and the provision of its clothes that has first demand on excess cash. The production of cars, and lorries, also reached an all time high, as did the need for the latest farming equipment.

The Government nationalized London Transport, creating the London Passenger Transport Board - to control buses and trains. This was not the only measure to influence the upturn; the Government started the Marketing Boards which guaranteed farm prices. Later that year, MacDonald resigned, replaced by Baldwin. The governments of both Baldwin [1935-7] and Chamberlain [1937 - 40] were in reality conservative administrations. It is recorded, in a number of books, that the early period [1931-1935] was in fact a coalition. There were many, from all parties, who did not want such an alliance. It was the party leaders who formed a National Government, for this is what it was. The technical advances in transport and communication continued to be advanced by consumer demand and factory mass production methods… These mechanical innovations were slowly adopted by the armed services which tried to keep pace with the call for expansion. This rise in demand was slow to start … but continued throughout the period, pushing forward with increasing urgency…

The 1921 – 1931 censuses show a population increase of eleven per cent for Greater London. Beyond London, in the outer northwest suburbs, the increase was even greater – in Harrow it was fifty per cent. It was estimated that during 1919 – 1928 twelve thousand homes had been built within half a mile of the railway track, and that a further seventeen thousand were planned.
In 1929 a large housing development was started in Rayners Lane called Harrow Garden Village. The development included all the services, population amenities, re-built railway station, and Odeon, art-deco cinema. All the property developed during 1929 – 1936 was substantial, using good materials, not scrimping with meagre wood mouldings and sub-standard doors. The designs are still good today, giving space and amenity to a family of five. The lower middle-class were increasingly to be found in the cities and towns suburbs, during the summer months, clipping hedge, mowing the grass verge, reading the newspaper over a cup of tea and perambulating in the park whilst  listen to the band or watching cricket. In the winter, the population listened to the Light Programme, read Coward, Sayers, Christie, Johns and Blyton. The Garden Suburb of North Harrow was grandly advertised as ‘The suburb in the country’, and was fast filling up. By the time my parents occupied a house there the town had been completed. 

In the main, the population making up the new town were young middle aged couples, about to start a family or had young children… people looking ahead - for a new life - not able to find what they were looking for in the old Victorian/Edwardian estates. Some had experienced being unemployed, some had attended the marches into London - to protest about the economic situation, and the lack of jobs, but in the main, they were white collar workers, drawn from the Home Counties, enticed by the property developers slogans.

This page can easily become a coatrack for promotion, with editors showing up who have only that purpose. A common result is that the whole page gets deleted, as the community loses patience with it. That's a shame. Because any on-line book worth its salt would link to resources useful to those studying or learning about a topic. In particular, patients with some disorder or condition can often find invaluable help from, say, organizations devoted to the topic, or discussion groups. Some of these might be commercial in character, that is not one of the crucial criteria that a book publisher would consider. Rather, a responsible publisher will consider usefulness to patients. A publisher might list controversial treatments and places to find out more about them, but would also warn readers about the controversy.

Wikibooks, which means us, should act as a responsible publisher, and resist efforts to, on the one hand, censor information because it is &quot;commercial&quot; or &quot;fringe,&quot; but, on the other hand, to hide the commercial character of a web site, say, or the lack of general acceptance of a treatment modality or practitioner. Looking at history here, I see a single-purpose account that revert warred to keep information about a controversial practitioner out. Supposedly this was libelous. Properly presented, it would not be. And that's our task. I'll be watching here to help with the process. I have no attachment to any position on treatment, I'm purely interested as an editor and reader. I know a person with Rosacea, that's about the extent of my involvement.

To all who edit this book: please do not revert war, i.e., do not repeatedly remove or restore information. It can lead to warnings and blocks if the warnings are ignored. Instead, ''discuss'' the issue on this page, seek consensus with other editors, and refer controversies that cannot be resolved here to the Wikibooks community. Failure to properly take care of this page could easily result in its total removal, see [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:Requests_for_deletion&amp;oldid=1930016#Rosacea.2FWebsites_and_Organisations permanent link to deletion discussion] (current as of this comment) --[[User:Abd|Abd]] ([[User talk:Abd|talk]]) 00:51, 7 September 2010 (UTC)

I have removed the following sections from the article, as they appear to be promotional as listed, as if they were advertisements, for for other reasons. I ask that they not be restored to the article without consensus, and especially they should not be unilaterally restored by anyone connected with the organization or web site involved. This is not intended as some strict exclusion of these sites, and I may easily err in my judgment, but please discuss, and if facts about the site or material are involved, please provide references. Thanks. --[[User:Abd|Abd]] ([[User talk:Abd|talk]]) 05:24, 7 September 2010 (UTC)

Please also note: a few possibly questionable web sites were left in. Just a matter of the time needed to look at everything. --[[User:Abd|Abd]] ([[User talk:Abd|talk]]) 05:33, 7 September 2010 (UTC)

==Australian Sciences==
Australian Sciences is a research company dedicated to the understanding of the mechanisms involved in rosacea and in the development of safe and long term treatments. The site contains a free booklet that gives readers a practical understanding of how heat regulation is involved in rosacea and facial flushing.
*http://www.ausci.com/rosacea.htm
===Comments on Australian Sciences===
The booklet looks pretty good. It would help to know more about this company and their position in the Rosacea world. This was the least problematic of all the links I removed today. Perhaps the booklet should be linked directly. --[[User:Abd|Abd]] ([[User talk:Abd|talk]]) 05:24, 7 September 2010 (UTC)
==New Rosacea Treatment by Dr. Nase: Rosadyn==
Dr. Geoffrey Nase, Dr. Patrick Bitter, Sr. and Vascular Health Specialists LLC developed the first oral Nutraceutical for the treatment of rosacea called Rosadyn.  Rosadyn addresses the three main changes encountered in rosacea - vascular changes, skin changes and neural changes.  Recent studies on the safety and efficacy of Rosadyn show a 91% response rate with regards to facial flushing, redness and inflammation.

*http://www.drnase.com
===Comments on New Rosacea Treatment by Dr. Nase: Rosadyn===
This reads like an ad, and there has been revert warring over this. There may also be undue weight given to this source throughout the book, it should be examined. I see that there is a great deal of controversy of this source; there should be consensus for this to be in the book, caution is required. --[[User:Abd|Abd]] ([[User talk:Abd|talk]]) 05:24, 7 September 2010 (UTC)
==Rosacea in the UK==
Myrosacea.co.uk is a comprehensive rosacea information website, created in 2008, that has been set up specifically for people in the UK. The website aims to increase knowledge of rosacea by providing information about rosacea symptoms, trigger factors and available treatments, and how a doctor can help with diagnosis and treatment.

== Rosacea natural treatment site ==
The Rosacea site is a website dedicated to helping rosacea sufferers treat and help their symptoms naturally and safely without medication. There are also new breakthroughs in the treatment of rosacea.  It is important that all rosacea sufferers be educated in the condition and understand how important it is to be able to manage their rosacea as safely as possible. As such this site is written by researchers in this field.

This looks like a site dedicated to selling certain products.
==Rosaceans, Rosacea 101, and the Rosacea Diet==
The ''rosaceans'' yahoo group is the fourth largest online rosacea community. The sister site rosaceans.com is a clearinghouse of commercial information for rosacea. Brady Barrows the webmaster of the site is also the author of the books,&quot;Rosacea 101: Includes the Rosacea Diet,&quot; and the ''Rosacea Diet,'' which are availiable to purchase from the sites.

&lt;small&gt;*http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/rosaceans/&lt;/small&gt;
*http://www.rosaceans.com
*http://www.rosacea-101.com
*http://www.rosacea-diet.com/html/diet.html
*http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/rosacea-diet-users-support-group/
===Comment on Rosaceans, Rosacea 101, and the Rosacea Diet===
Somewhat questionable as promotional. rosacians.com was a dead link. I left the yahoogroup in, created a yahoogroups section, and adding a larger yahoogroup, but deleted the information about &quot;fourth-largest rosacea community&quot; and the other book promotional material. rosacea-diet-users-support-group appears to be run by the same person as the other yahoogroup listed above, and is almost entirely announcements, and nothing recently. rosacea-101 and rosacea-diet.com were dead links. Presumably if there is a bibliography for this book, and if the book is valuable, it would be listed and perhaps reviewed there. --[[User:Abd|Abd]] ([[User talk:Abd|talk]]) 05:24, 7 September 2010 (UTC)
*Rosaceans.com is now up. However, this site is linked from the yahoogroup home page. By the way, my removal of a site from the page is not a denigration of the site; and that a site is commercial is not automatic grounds for exclusion. But it does mean that caution is required, and especially we should avoid what amount to multiple links to sites which are closely related and which link to each other, unless there are clear grounds for multiple listings (such as an implementation of some categorization system that would review the sites according to specific criteria). --[[User:Abd|Abd]] ([[User talk:Abd|talk]]) 18:01, 7 September 2010 (UTC)
*Rosaceans-101 is also up now. This, however, is really just about the book, it appears, and is (probably properly) linked from [[Rosacea/Books]]. Rosacea-diet.com now redirects to rosaceans.com. --[[User:Abd|Abd]] ([[User talk:Abd|talk]]) 18:19, 7 September 2010 (UTC)

==International Rosacea Foundation==
The International Rosacea Foundation (IRF) is a information website. The Better Business Bureau reliability report on Bass &amp;amp; Boney listed the IRF website as part of Bass &amp;amp; Boney (the makers of Rosacea-LTD III). There is also some confusion whether the IRF is really a non-profit organization.&lt;ref&gt;International Rosacea Foundation - The Mystery. An Editorial by Brady Barrows. (http://rosaceans.com/html/irf.html)&lt;/ref&gt;
*http://internationalrosaceafoundation.org
===Comment on International Rosacea Foundation===
Some of the material I looked at seemed poorly written. There is no information about the organization there, which is odd. It looks like Brady Barrows (who is the person behind the Rosaceans yahoo group) may be on to something. But the reference is dead, it was on Barrow's Rosaceans.com web site. --[[User:Abd|Abd]] ([[User talk:Abd|talk]]) 05:24, 7 September 2010 (UTC)

== /*Patient's Guide to Rosacea*/ ==

==Patient's Guide to Rosacea==
The Patient's Guide offers information about treatment of the symptoms of this common skin condition. The most common sign of rosacea is the formation of tiny blood vessels just under the surface of the skin causing facial redness and flushing. These blood vessels are best treated with laser or IPL as these treatments can effectively destroy the blood vessels.
*http://www.rosaceatreatment.org
===Comment on Patient's Guide to Rosacea===
This appears to be an advertising vehicle. Please discuss here if you would like to restore this to the resources, but, please remember, more links are not necessarily better; emphasis should be on the links of highest quality and usefulness, and sites which largely present information that will also be found elsewhere, perhaps more completely, should be deprecated. --[[User:Abd|Abd]] ([[User talk:Abd|talk]]) 17:41, 7 September 2010 (UTC)

== Merger ==

I propose merging {{bad link|Rosacea/Books}} and {{bad link|Rosacea/Websites and Organisations}} together and renaming the page [[Rosacea/Resources]]. I think there aren't enough links/resources to justify having books, websites, and organizations split across multiple pages at this time. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 17:29, 18 September 2010 (UTC)

:Yes, I'd thought of doing that myself. I support it. --[[User:Abd|Abd]] ([[User talk:Abd|talk]]) 23:18, 18 September 2010 (UTC)

Adrignola apparently decided to merge the two pages as part of the finishing touches of closing the RFD. I went ahead and renamed the page as proposed since Adrignola hadn't. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 08:38, 10 October 2010 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Parashat D’varim - Deuteronomy 1:1 - 3:22
Isaiah 1:1-27; John 15:1-17

The name “Deuteronomy comes from the Greek (Septuagint), and means “second law”.  It is not actually a “second torah” but a repetition and expansion of commentary on the first four books of Torah.  Therefore it is also called the Mishneh Torah, “repetition of the Torah” which clarifies and explains the first four books (Deut17:18).  The first four books of the Torah were dictated to the prophet Moshe, letter by letter, and written down with precision. Thus they became the foundation for the fifth book.  These five books, that are called the Torah of Moshe, are in turn, the foundation for the rest of the Scriptures. The prophetic books that were later added, beginning with Joshua), doesn’t change anything in the foundation, as it is written in Deuteronomy 4:2,   “You shall not add to the word which I command you, neither shall you diminish from it”.   The Torah of Moshe, therefore, has the highest level of authority among the inspired Scriptures. Not even the Messiah Yeshua himself came to change or add anything to that which Moshe wrote. His words changed nothing of that which was given by the Eternal through Moshe. Yeshua did not come to break, but to give the true meaning and the final explanation to that which his heavenly Father had in his heart when he gave us the commandments through Moshe, as it is written in Matthew 5:17-19

Deuteronomy is in essence, three sermons, one song, and one blessing!  It can be divided into three sections, which correspond with the three books: Exodus, Leviticus, and Numbers.  These are:
*1:1 - 5:5            Morals and Admonitions
*5:6 - 27:8           Diverse Laws
*27:9 - 34:12         Blessings and Curses

This section of the torah reading is a look back at what the Israelites have been through to get to the point they were at,  entering the Promised Land.  Moshe tells about all of the places they went through and the commands that Yahweh gave and they followed to get there. The rebellions of the people when first commanded, and the blessings when they followed the commands.  It is largely for the benefit of the younger generation of Israelites who did not have a clear recollection of what went on in Egypt or in the wilderness either because they were too young or because they had not been born yet.  It was a recitation or synopsis of the Torah commands to prepare the younger generation for entering the Promised Land.   Moshe sets this out to make it as plain as possible and simple to understand.  For this reason it has always been popular and quoted from eighty times in the apostles writings and used widely by the Qumran Essenes. 


'''The Legacy of Moshe'''

“These are the words that Moshe spoke”   (d’varim). ...  ‘words’ - ‘d’var’ is one of the strongest roots in Hebrew and is linked to the words ‘desert’ and ‘plague’ which come from the same root.  Here Moshe delivers a sermon containing strong words of rebuke against Israel.  His words link the hardship of the desert to their failure to hear the ‘word’ of Yahweh, delivered through him.  So before he departs he gives them this ‘sermon’ - the entire book of Devarim is a commentary which he expounded before his death as his last will and testament to them, an exhortation for them to remember and to keep them on the path of life, words to live by for every day of their lives.  This was their memo from their leader and instruction manual for the new advent of their future life in the promised land.  

The book is structured in the same manner as the ancient treaties between an overlord and his subjects of that era contracted a covenantal agreement.  It is similar to others that have been found by archaeologists, from the Hittites and other Oriental peoples of the period 1500 - 1300 BCE. This always included a preamble of background and historical information to the setting up of the treaty - stipulations and conditions of the treaty - its blessings and curses dependant upon keeping the covenant - and the finalising recapitulation.  However, contrary to ancient treaties, this was not a law-code but a true covenant between Yahweh and His people, and all of it is based upon His grace and mercy toward His redeemed people who live by faith and love in Him.

With this introduction Moshe begins his recap of the children of Israel’s long arduous journey to the promised land.  He is speaking to those who have grown up in the wilderness who were either not personal witnesses of the manifestation at Sinai or else were under 20 years of age.  As part of this exhortation, he goes back over their sins at the various places to serve as historical lessons and as a future warning.  He does it tactfully to avoid overwhelming them with a sense of embarrassment and condemnation with their failures, but rather seeks to exhort them to believe His Word in future.
As well as Moshe’s departure from them, the Cloud of His Presence will also leave them at the journey’s end, having overseen their flight from Egypt and guided and protected them through the long wilderness journey to the promised land.   Moshe had done his job, he had accomplished the task Yahweh set out before him.  He must have felt a certain sense of accomplishment with the mission completed.


'''Overcoming in the Wilderness'''

Horeb (i.e. Sinai) (means waste) to Kadesh Barnea (meaning set-apart fruitful fields) was but 11-days journey to the edge of the Promised Land (Kadesh Barnea) yet Israel wandered 40 years because of their unbelief. The statement that the journey from Mt. Sinai to Kadesh-Barnea takes only 11 days is a reminder of the price of sin.  An entire generation missed the Promised Land because of their unbelief and bad conduct (disobedience to Yahweh’s commands, lack of trust and faith in Yahweh’s word evidenced by complaining, murmuring and even outright rebellion). 

Being in the desert is never easy but our encouragement comes from the knowledge of who Messiah is and His Word to them was Deut.1:29 ....'Don’t be fearful, don’t be afraid of them, Yahweh your God, who is going ahead of you, will fight on your behalf, just as He accomplished all those things in Egypt before your eyes’.

We need to discern what is holding us back from going forward in our spiritual walk.  What sin, what fear, what wrong beliefs or false religious concepts are we not letting go, that is a hindrance to going on?  It is a time to be serious about serving Yahweh and to repent and go onward and upward in Yeshua!

Many times in our spiritual walk we are just at the point of spiritual breakthrough, but we receive an evil report about the giants of the land and our resolve to go forward melts.  If we could just see what lies ahead of us how much easier it would be to go forward!  Yet Yeshua said, Blessed are those who haven’t seen, yet still believe in Yahweh’s promises (John 20:29).  We need to have what it takes to go on without being deterred by the world, the flesh and the devil.  To go on without being able to see where one is going, takes faith and it gets down to personal and intimate relationship with your Heavenly Father, through Yeshua and being led by his Spirit.  That involves a walk of constantly abiding in Him.   John 15: 1-17

Edom (Esau, brother of Jacob) and Moab and Ammon (sons of Lot) were blood relatives of the Israelites - 2:2-9.  Often those of our own family will stand in our way as we go in to possess our spiritual, God-given inheritance and spiritual destiny.  What is the lesson from this passage of Scripture on how to deal with less than cooperative family members who fail to recognize the calling on your life?  Are we to make war with them?  Are we in anyway to be beholden to or dependent on them for our physical needs? If we became dependent upon them could this help or hinder our chances of entering our Promised Land?  Yahweh desires our families to be saved (Acts 16:31; 2 Peter 3:9)  How then can we be a light to our families if we are fighting and attempting to destroy those who would spiritually stand in our way?

On the other hand, Yahweh instructed the Israelites to make war with and to destroy some of the Canaanites who were not relatives of Israel.  The Believer’s battle to enter into the Promised Land is a spiritual one (2 Cor. 10:3-5 and Eph. 6:10-18).  Who and what are enemies with whom we must constantly do battle and by the power of the Ruach HaKodesh utterly destroy their influence in our lives? (See 1 John 2:15-17; 1 Peter 5:8; James. 5:7 to name a few.)

Yahweh gave victory to the Israelites over King Og and the 60 cities of his kingdom - 3:1-11.  When Yahweh gives us a mandate to encounter the spiritual forces of this world and the devil, nothing must stand in our way.  What are the weapons of our warfare? (1 John 5:4; Luke 9:1: 10:19)  Israel fought with swords and spears to possess a physical kingdom.  We are taking possession of a spiritual kingdom.  The warfare is just as intense, but the weapons are spiritual.  (Eph.6:10-18)   Are you engaging the enemy, or are you in retreat? Those who are not moving forward spiritually will not encounter the enemy.   At the very least, one should be overcoming the flesh.  That is the greatest battle of all _ to put on the mind of Messiah and to be conformed into His image. 


'''The Seven Main Sins of Israel In the Wilderness''' 

In the opening verses there is a list of place names which various Rabbis take as code words for the main sins which Israel had committed during its time in the wilderness (See Artscroll Stone Edition Chumash, p. 939, notes on verse 1).  “Beyond the  Jordan…in the wilderness…in the Arabah…beside Suph…between Paran and Tophel…Laban and Hazeroth and Di-zahab”  (1: 1)  The Israelites had sinned (in  wilderness, provoked him in the Arabah, murmured beside the Yam Suph [Sea of Reeds], spoke with contempt [tophel] about manna [which was white, laban], and in Hazeroth they angered him with a Calf made from gold [dizahab].  These are the seven most outstanding sins which resulted in Israel being condemned to wander the wilderness for 40 years.

We need to be reminded of our sins and challenged to grow and overcome them or else we will wander in a spiritual wilderness never entering into our spiritual inheritance. Let us not become like the Laodiceans of Revelation 3. We are told that they were rich and increased with goods, yet poor, blind, miserable, naked and lukewarm. We must be constantly overcoming and striving against sin.  There is no place for complacency, apathy, lukewarmness or indifference. That is why many of us are searching out the Hebrew roots of our spiritual faith _ the status quo in the Church has not been acceptable. We are called to be overcomers and more than conquerors through Yeshua. There is nothing in Scripture to justify the position of “pew warmer” (see John 16:33; 1 John 5:4; Rev. 2:7, 11, 26; 3:5, 12).

1- '''Wilderness of Sin''' (meaning thorns located near Mt. Sinai): Here Israel complained about lack of food (Exod. 16:1-3)
• No trust or faith in Yahweh.
• Their perspective is skewed by their carnality. If Yahweh had wanted to kill them he could have easily done so at the Red Sea, but rather he miraculously preserved them there. They did not trust the consistency of the character of Yahweh.
• They encountered their first spiritual pothole in the wilderness road and their faith melts.
• They accused Moshe of planning to starve them. How often a faithless and carnal people turn the good intents of selfless and self-sacrificing leadership into evil and malicious intent against them?
• They undervalued their deliverance and wished they had died in Egypt.  Where would we be if Yahweh had not delivered us from our past?  A praiseworthy and thankful heart-attitude will carry us safely through to the other side of many of life’s trials and adversities.  Never take your eyes off of the goodness of Yahweh and focus them on the complaints of the flesh.

2- '''Arabah''' (meaning desert plain, wilderness); a steppe or narrow plain or valley near the southern tip of the Sea of Galilee extending to the Gulf of Aqaba and to the highlands of the east): Here Israel was seduced by Midianite women (Num. 36:13).
• Spiritual and Physical Whoredoms.
• Israel was enticed by the lusts and appetites of the flesh.  Up to this point Israel had resisted many frontal military attacks and would have done so again had King Balak tried this means to overcome Israel.  But the enemies of Israel attacked her (with help from Balaam, the false prophet) through subtlety and seduction.  If the enemy can’t get us one way, he’ll try another!  Lusts of the flesh can be a real snare, especially for men. To wit: Solomon and his wives or Adam with Eve.

3- '''Opposite the Red Sea''': Here Israel complains that they’re going to die _ they manifest sarcasm and cynicism against Elohim in their statement against Moshe: “...because there were no graves in Egypt...?!” (Exod. 14:11)
• Fear, Faithlessness, False Accusation and Malcontentment.
• The straits of their physical circumstances propel them into fear and accusation (i.e. faithlessness) against God and Moshe.  The comforts of slavery, servitude and bondage in Egypt seemed good to them now, though a short time earlier while suffering in Egypt they had cried out to God for deliverance from the very thing to which they now wanted to return.  The fickleness and vicissitudes of human nature!  The grass is always greener on the other side.  Man is never content with his circumstances.

4- '''Between Paran''' (meaning beauty): The spy incident. (Num. 13-14)
• Again, Walking By Sight and Not By Faith.
• Though Moshe had charged them “to be of good courage,” they were not.  Courage springs from strong faith which Caleb and Joshua alone possessed.  They distrusted God’s power and promise.  Unbelief overlooks the greatness, goodness and power of God and focuses on the human plane.  Fear/faithlessness/unbelief magnifies every danger and difficulty and fills the heart with discouragement and hopelessness.  We must resist that within ourselves.

5- '''Tophel''' (meaning calumny, a reference to the false charges or misrepresentation maliciously calculated to damage another’s reputation) and Laban (white, a reference to the color of manna [Ex. 16:34]): There are no places where Israel camped by these names. Rather, the rabbis teach that these names are references to Israel complaining twice about manna (Num. 10:12; 11:6).
• Lust , Ungratefulness and False Accusation -  There is no pleasing a lustful, carnal, faithless and ungrateful heart!
• Manna, God’s supernatural answer to one of Israel’s first complaints itself becomes a source of complaint and contempt. 

6- '''Hazeroth''' (meaning enclosures) _ Korah’s rebellion (Num. 12:1-16)
• Rebellion Against God-Ordained Authority

7- '''Di-zahab''' (meaning gold) _ God blessed Israel with an abundance of gold when they left Egypt and they used his gifts to make the golden calf.
• Riches Lead to Idolatry.
• God’s overabundant blessings can become a snare.  We become “rich and increased with goods having need of nothing” including God, as was the case with the Laodicean church in Revelation 3.

One of the main purposes of Torah community (the local assembly) is to provoke one another to good works (Hebrews 10:24-25).
The purpose of Torah needs to be reiterated again and again! 

The scripture says, “Beware brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the living God; but exhort one another daily, while it is called ‘today’, lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.  For we become partakers of Messiah, IF we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast to the end,”  Hebrews 3:12-14


'''Passing the Baton'''

As Moshe prepared to speak to the children of Israel one last time on the first day of the month, he would have understood the significance of this new moon day. Certainly it was symbolic of an ending of one chapter in Israel’s history and the beginning of a new era.  Moshe had been through his time of testing and in the end he had completed the task God had laid out for him.  After taking the nation through 40 years of trial, testing, and purifying in what should have been an eleven day journey, Moshe stood with the prize before him. Yet he couldn’t enter the land. One mistake had cost him the opportunity of a lifetime. 

Moshe did everything Yahweh asked of him, he was a man of honor, courage, character, and obedience, yet during a brief episode of anger he disobeyed his Heavenly Father.  Moshe stood in Yahweh’s stead on this earth and in that brief moment of losing control of his emotions and actions he brought great reproach upon Yahweh’s name and reputation.  Moshe failed to sanctify Yahweh in the eyes of the people.  It could appear God was being harsh because of Moshe’ disobedience in striking the rock instead of speaking to it.  Moshe had become frustrated with the continuing complaining of the Children of Israel. In his anger at the people, Moshe allowed his frustration to get the better of him and in lashing out at the rock it would seem he was lashing out at God.  Could it be Moshe’ old frustration in being called to lead Israel was surfacing and while he may have been tired with the attitude of Israel could it possibly be Moshe was really angry at God?  How many times have we been in the same situation as Moshe and in our anger at some supposed situation, we are really expressing our frustration with God because we had expected something to go the way we planned and it did not turn out the way we had hoped.  Any area of our flesh which we allow to remain undealt with, will someday cause us to stumble.

The time had come for Israel to move into the next phase of God’s plan for them and Moshe was not the one to lead them. He was part of Egypt and the many rebellions in the Wilderness. In his own way he had rebelled against God and was doomed to a similar fate of the generation who had come up out of Egypt. Though Joshua had come out of Egypt and had seen what Israel had done in the Wilderness he had his sights set on the goal and did not rebel against God. His faith had seen him through and he would finish the task Moshe had begun.

As a spiritual father Moshe sought to ensure that this new generation would overcome and enter into their inheritance, even though he had not done so himself.  Only Joshua and Caleb of all that first generation had qualified and were going into the land.


'''Taking the Challenge'''

As Israel had refused to obey Yahweh’s command to fight their way into the land almost 40 years earlier, this new generation had already begun the battle by defeating the two Amorite kings, Sihon and Og.  They were enthusiastic, ready to take what was rightfully theirs, they had embraced their inheritance in this land of promise.   

Joshua as Moshe protege had qualified to the leadership and was prepared to take the baton and lead the new generation through.  Joshua was the right hand man of Moshe.  Moshe knew Joshua was worthy to undertake the task set before him, to take them into the land and he successfully fulfilled his commission and by his strong leadership, led Israel to conquer and inherit the land.

Caleb was a man of a different spirit and had wholly followed Yahweh the scriptures tells us (Numbers 14:24).  He was the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite (one of the tribes of Canaan - probably one of the mixed multitude of slaves that came with them from Egypt) but showed more faith than those from a generational heritage of Israeli blood.   Forty-five years later he comes to Joshua and claims the land promised him,  “Now then, give me this hill country about which Yahweh spoke on that day, for you heard on that day that Anakim were there, with great fortified cities; perhaps Yahweh will be with me, and I will drive them out as Yahweh has spoken.’  So Joshua blessed him and gave Hebron to Caleb the son of Jephunneh for an inheritance.  Joshua14:6-15).

Caleb received as an inheritance the land that contained the very caves of Machpelah where the patriarchs Abraham, Isaac and Jacob were buried with Sarah and Rebecca.  What a remarkable testimony of a faithful son of Israel who had been adopted into the family, risen to a prestigious place as one of the princes of Judah, spied out the land, came back with a good report, and then faithfully waited some forty-five years for his inheritance.

Here on the brink of the promised land the two men who had been faithful and brought back a good report are to take the nation into the land and we see the prophetic significance of this, in that these two men representing the tribes of Judah and Ephraim, Ezekiel later prophesies will join together to bring about a united Israel in the events leading up to the establishment of the Kingdom in these last days.  Ezekiel 37:15-28

Some of the areas mentioned by Moshe  -   commentators suggest that the term from the river Euphrates actually means from the western segment of the river in northern Syria.  This area was conquered in David’s time and was under the dominion of Israel through Solomon’s reign and beyond.  The Captorim are the Philistines who migrated from Crete in approx.1200 BC. and settled Gaza.  The area in Ch.3:8 from Arnon to Hermon which belonged to the king of Bashan, is the modern day Golan Heights.   This is more than Israel at present holds, and includes the disputed areas which confirms that Yahweh gave this territory to them.


'''Bringing Forth New Life'''

Even though the people did not follow what they were told and doubted, Yahweh is forgiving.  We are all in the wilderness journeying to the Promised Land.   Every one can look into their past and find times that they doubted or stumbled in some way or other.  Once you get yourself back on the path, blessings continued to flow.  We must trust that Yahweh will go before us, fight for us, and carry us through this wilderness as he did the Israelites.   (1:30,31) 

In John 15:1-10 Yeshua talks about how we are the vine and Yahweh is the Vine-dresser.  He takes care of all of our needs but we need to produce fruits to justify our staying on the vine.  As each person or branch of the vine grows, the whole vine flourishes and grows stronger, able to withstand the storms that come with this world.  ‘I am the real vine and my Father is the gardener’;  -  ‘No greater love has a person who lays down his life for his friends’.   (Vs.1,3)

When we are born again in Messiah, we become the branches of the vine. The vine dresser carefully lifts the branches and places them so that they may grow to his desire.  Those branches that are delinquent or grow incorrectly are removed by the vine dresser.  The process of pruning is painful and often the plant may go into shock.  We need to rest in the fact the vine dresser knows best and that He is pruning us so that we may produce finer fruit.  Yahweh is glorified by our fruit but only after the process of pruning. We need to stay fixed on Him, the source of life, if not the shock of pruning may end in the death of the plant. The basis of remaining in the vine is by obeying His commands (vs.9-10) Only then will be be partaking of the Tree of life, the sap of the Vine.  The commands of which He speaks are those given to Israel - His Father’s commands.

Yeshua’s command to us was, “(v.12) This is my command: that you keep on loving each other just as I have loved you”. Sometimes the depth of our love for one another is stretched and tested but we have to remember we are commanded to love one another as He loved us.  Love bears all things, believes all things, Love never  fails.  1 Corinthians 13

We are no longer slaves we are free men!  By our exodus from slavery in Egypt and by our salvation by the blood of the Lamb from the law of sin that was at work in us, we are free.  This liberation allows us to obey His Word - we are no longer under bondage to sin that we should serve it, but are now ‘servants’ of righteousness.  Romans 6:15-23

We each have a choice everyday of our lives as to whether we are going to be like a Caleb and press on to the mark and not let the giants of our world intimidate us.  Or we can allow people to move us away from doing what the Scriptures obviously tell us and thereby put the Testimony of Yeshua and obedience to the Torah, off into a future time.

Sometimes our greatest enemies are those like Moab and Edom - of the same heritage, but living outside the promises and indulging in fleshly lusts and idolatrous worship.  These things must be overcome before we can gain an entrance into our inheritance, whether they are within ourselves or coming from without - they are positioned before the entrance to the inheritance and will seek to bring us under their dominion either by subtlety as with Moab or by outright  contest as with Edom.

It is each of our choice, whether we receive a “well done good and faithful servant” at the end of the journey or whether He will say “I never knew you”.  The deciding factor will be our relationship - being in the Vine through an observance of His commands. We need to get to know Him Who is life eternal, for He is the Way the Truth and the Life and no one comes to the Father except through Him.  Only in an ongoing relationship of knowing Him are we ‘branches’ for the flow of His divine life.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Va’Etchanan - And I Pleaded Deuteronomy3:23-7:11

This section of the torah begins with a reiteration of Moses’ plea to Yahweh to let him cross into the promised land with the children of Israel.  We know that his plea was rejected and Yahweh instead orders him to strengthen Yehoshua and embolden him.  That does not refer to encouraging him with words, but to building up military strength and ensuring that Yehoshua develops a bold and aggressive strategy for taking the land, “for he shall cross over before this kinfolk” leading them into battle.   Moshe has prepared and trained Yehoshua beforehand to assume the leadership,  and is now instructed to pass on the ‘baton’ and equip Yehoshua for the task ahead, of leading Israel in conquering the land.

The overwhelming theme of Va’aetchanan  or “And I Pleaded” is obedience to Yahweh.  In this portion, Moshe reemphasizes the need for the Israelites to obey Yahweh and be blessed, or not obey Him and be cursed.  Certainly, as he writes, Moshe is reminded of his own mistake and urges the Israelites not to disobey, lest they be ejected from the Promised Land.


'''The Re-iteration of the Law'''

What Moses clearly understood in repeating and emphasizing all of these commandments to the children of Israel just before they were to cross into the land, is that Yahweh’s ways are superior to any man-made laws or rules, and he wanted to ensure that his words made a deep impression upon them. Life and authority over wickedness are the very essence of our Father’s Torah.  Yahweh revealed His law to Israel for their benefit and edification. When they followed His ways they were blessed.  When they went their own way, or followed the practices of the nations around them, they were cursed.

We read in Deut. 4:1-2, “And now, O Israel, listen to the statutes and to the ordinances, which I teach you, to do them; that you may live, and go in and possess the land which Yahweh, the Elohim of your fathers, is giving you.  You shall not add to the word which I command you, neither shall you diminish from it, that you may keep the commandments of Yahweh your Elohim which I command you.”

The rest of this section deals with the laws, statues, and ordinances Israel was to abide by once they entered into their promised inheritance.  There are two benefits Israel will reap by doing the statutes and ordinances of Yahweh.  

Firstly they will live.  Remember what Deut. 8:3 says, “.....man does not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of Yahweh does man live.”  The very words of our Elohim are life to us.  It’s a promise we see put forth many times in the inspired scriptures.

The second benefit to the Israelites for keeping the words of Yahweh was that they would possess the land He was giving to them.  Israel was going into a land that already had a population of various nations and peoples.  Yahweh promised them that they would be able to drive out these wicked nations if they would follow His words.  The Bible testifies of Israel’s many successes and failures in this regard. 

Moshe counsels them to hearken to the statutes (khuqim) and to the commandments (mishpatim) which I Myself teach you, to do so in order that you shall live, i.e. be quickened to life. ( takhayu, the hiphil, means “your lives shall be restored - enlivened or resurrected) His Words are life-giving to those who live by them and hence the warning not to change them by adding or taking from them.  Moshe puts upon the words which he has delivered to Israel the seal of perfection and prohibits any additions or subtractions from it (4.2) — “Don’t add to the Saying which I myself order (metzaveh)you as a commandment (mitzwah), and don’t diminish from it; but be watchguarding (shomeir) the commandment of Yahweh your God that I Myself order you.” (literal interpretation)   
Not one additional word was to be thereafter legislated nor one word of original Torah thereafter eliminated. Henceforth the adaptation of application to situations of life called “halakhah” was limited to the interpretation of earlier legislations of the Torah as by a Beit Din, the governing body of elders such as the Sanhedrin.  


'''Learning From Experience'''

Finally, in 4:32-39, Moshe summarizes all the great wonders that the nation has witnessed since the Exodus, to encourage them to solidify their belief in God - and properly face the challenges that await them:   “For ask now of the days past... since the day that God created man upon the earth, and from the one end of heaven unto the other, whether there hath been any such thing as this great thing is, or hath been heard like it?  Did ever a people hear the voice of God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as you have heard, and live?    Has God ever taken a nation from the midst of another nation, by trials, by signs, and by wonders, and by war, and by a mighty hand, and by an outstretched arm...    “This was shown to you that you should know that Yahweh,    He is God; there is none else beside Him.   Out of heaven He made you hear His voice...   “And because He loved your fathers... he brought you out of Egypt with His presence, with great power... to give you their land for an inheritance, as it is this day;  Therefore, know this day, and lay it to your heart, that Yahweh, He is God in heaven above and upon the earth beneath; there is none else.”  (see 4:32-39)

This speech introduces the lengthy speech of laws that will follow in chapter five and Moshe reminds them:  “And you shall keep [God’s] laws and commandments which I  command you this day, that it will be good for you and your children, and so that you may prolong your days upon the land, which Yahweh has given you, for ever.” (see 4:40)


'''The Judgement on Idolatry'''

In the final section of his speech (4:25-40), Moshe warns that should Bnei Yisrael follow other gods, He will exile them for their land:  
“When you shall have children, and children’s children, and be living for along time in the land, and shall deal corruptly, and make a graven image, even the form of any thing....     I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that you shall soon utterly perish from off the land....    And God will scatter you among the peoples...  And there you shall serve gods, the work of men’s hands...”     (see 4:25-28)  “But from there you will seek Yahweh your God and you will find him if you search for him with all your heart and all your soul” (Deuteronomy 4:29).

Moshe is speaking prophetically here making it quite clear that the covenant will not be broken but in being ‘forsaken’ by Yahweh because of their sin - that their exile could be ‘misunderstood’ by the people that God has left them for ever.  Hence, Moshe must explain in 4:29-31 that no matter how severe their punishment may be, Yisrael will remain forever God’s nation His covenant with them remains eternal as well, and ultimately He will return them to the Promised Land after they come to true repentance.
“Then you will seek Yahweh and find Him, if you search after Him with all thy heart and with all thy soul.  In your distress, when all these things will come, in the end of days, you will return to Yahweh and hearken unto His voice... (see 4:29-31)
“In the latter days you will return to Yahweh your God”  --  

This has yet to have its complete fulfillment.
This is alluding to them coming to full repentance and restoration and fulfilling the Shema -- 
“You shall love Yahweh your God with all your heart, with all your soul and with all your strength (ability).”  (6: 5)
“With all your soul” - This means being willing to give one’s life in love for him and to live only for him.
“With all your ability” - The Hebrew word that is normally translated as “might” is “meodecha”, which does not only mean “your might”, but also “your ability”, “your possessions”, and it comes from the word “meod”, “much”.   This word is not primarily speaking of physical strength, but of all that we are and have, which also includes material possessions. Love for the Eternal is also expressed in the way we administer our material possessions, but love always begins on the inside from our heart and works its way out in all that we do.


'''The Ten Commands'''

In Hebrew tradition, a thing is encompassed by the mere speaking of it.  This is derived from the description that Yahweh spoke things into being.  He said “Let there be ... “ and it was so (Genesis Ch 1).   Hence, it would also be quite correct to render this phrase as the “Ten Matters” that Yahweh ordered as commands (mitzwot) in that these ten “matters” are that which He spoke into being and they are ten entities which He created.  

Yeshua said, “The words that I speak unto you, they are spirit and they are life” (John 6:63), Paul also carrying this forward said that the Torah (given at Sinai) is spiritual (Romans 7:14).  These ten words of Yahweh impart life to those who live by them.

The first of the Aseret ha-Dibrot is “You shall have no other gods before Me (al-panai; on/over My Face) (5: 7).  This phrase is an Hebrew idiom meaning “on the surface of.” This phrase implies that physical likenesses of the non-physical Creator are like a mask, “over His Face,” that intervenes between the worshipper and Yahweh.  Since Yahweh is spirit, those who insist on a physical semblance to worship, have only the mask (the image), the only physical thing they can visualize and “focus on” to worship. 

No matter what the worshipper may claim that the physical image “symbolizes,” it is idolatry.  No physical mask can symbolize the non-dimensional Being of Yahweh.  It can only interfere and prevent the worship of the true God.  In 4:12 Moshe said to the people, “Yahweh spoke to you out of the midst of the fire.  You heard the sound of the words, but saw no form; you only heard a voice.”   The Hebrew word that is translated “form” is “temunah”, which means “picture”, “figure”, “image”, “silhouette”, “impression”. This teaches us that Yahweh does not have a form perceptible to our physical senses.

5.8  - Making a ‘likeness’ -- A 2-dimensional depiction or a picture isn’t equivalent to a “likeness” ( temunah).  Early Judaic practice is that, as long as depictions or pictures weren’t objects of worship, 2-dimensional representations of actual things in the heavens or on earth aren’t prohibited by this passage.  The prohibited images are those that are, or have been, worshipped - but not all pictures, photographs, paintings, sculptures and the like, are idols.

We can ask ourselves some questions to see if we have any other gods in our lives:   Who rules my life?  Who or what is the source of my enjoyment in life?   Who or what do I place my trust in?     What is my passion or interest in life?   Who do I praise?

5.9 — “Who visits the sins...” -- “Visits” is not a good rendering of the Hebrew word ‘poqeid’ (he musters, monitors, audits).  Contrary to the English, this doesn’t imply that sons are punished for the misdemeanors of the fathers.  Rather, it states clearly that, like a concerned Father, Yahweh especially monitors, not “punishes,” sons for the misdemeanors their fathers did.  So it has the sense of Yahweh monitoring the posterity to see that the offspring don’t follow the parent’s example in that trespass.

5:11 — “Do not bear the Name of Yahweh your God vainly, for Yahweh will not cleanse whomever bears His Name vainly.”   “Don’t take the name...,” as if it meant “Don’t cuss using the Name.”  But, although that would be included, that isn’t what the it means!  This has two meanings:

1. swearing by the name of Yahweh was an intrinsic element of testifying in a Beit Din (Elders Council) or today in a court of law - i.e. giving testimony as a witness.

2. doing something in the name of Yahweh entails crediting Yahweh for an action, such as claiming His direction in what you do.  When a “believer” is doing nothing - i.e. not practicing the faith, and he or she bears the Name of Yahweh,  that’s bearing/carrying the Name is for nothing, in vain.  Since one who carries the name is not living/practicing the Word, he isn’t “cleansed,” and therefore forfeits his inheritance in the age to come, unless he repents.  Yahweh’s command “Do not mention My name in vain,” in a sense means “Do not exploit My ‘name’ “ - by religion - as a means of justification for your iniquities.  Do not attempt to cover them up with a veil of righteousness and virtue.  Therefore when people are led to follow the teachings of man, they also are worshipping Him in vain, for their ‘worship’ will have no redemptive value, even if well-intentioned.  For this reason Yeshua strongly condemned those false teachers of His day who were leading the people astray.  Matthew15.9 quoting from Isaiah 29:13

5:12  -  Resting one day a week makes sense to many people, since even a machine needs rest, and how much more so a human body.  Moreover, thanks to the rest period, the person functions better when he works, compensating for any loss caused by the day of rest. While this makes sense, Shabbat was not given to Yahweh’s people as a mere day off.   In the wilderness the Jews did not have to work to earn a livelihood since their food and all basic needs were provided. Nonetheless, at Marah, Yahweh already gave them the commandment of Shabbat before He gave them the totality of His Torah.  There is a twofold purpose for the observance of Shabbat:
1) To remind us that Yahweh created the entire world in six days and rested on the seventh.
2) To remind us that we were freed from Egyptian and spiritual bondage by Yahweh in order to keep His commands.

To keep entails having an attitude of watchfulness, of not doing anything that the Torah forbids for Shabbat. We are watchful not to go over the time with our work and not to begin work before the sun has gone down at the end of the Shabbat.  In this way we can keep the Shabbat and be careful not to profane it.  By this we make sure that it is consecrated, set apart for the exclusive use of Yahweh and occupy ourselves with Him in a special way. 
5:20  --  “And don’t answer your companion with a nothing / vain witness, unreliable testimony”.  This command prohibits falsely claiming “I didn’t see it” to evade one’s responsibility as a witness.  This also involves turning a blind eye to your brother’s sin and failing to correct him out of your love for him.

5:21  -- “and don’t yearn for the wife of your companion. The operative verb here is khamad; he yearned for, longed for, desired, lusted after sexually; (and don’t you long for) the house of your companion.  In this mitzwah, the operative verb is (ivah; he craved, desired, longed for, lusted after).  Here the prohibition is not against admiring something belonging to your companion, but rather, against being obsessed with it and plotting or scheming to get it.
“And these words which I command you this day shall be in your heart.” (5: 6)  -  we are responsible for the Word to be in our heart and therefore the performing of the commands to come forth from our hearts out of love for Yahweh God.


'''Hearing the Word in our Heart'''

Yeshua gave the parable of the Sower in Mark 4:3-20,  and explained it to them with these words  “The farmer sows the word. These are the ones by the road, where the word is sown; and when they have heard, immediately Satan comes, and takes away the word which has been sown in them. These in like manner are those who are sown on the rocky places, who, when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with joy. They have no root in themselves, but are short-lived. When oppression or persecution arises because of the word, immediately they stumble. Others are those who are sown among the thorns. These are those who have heard the word, and the cares of this age, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful. These are those which were sown on the good ground: such as hear the word, and accept it, and bear fruit, some thirty times, some sixty times, and some one hundred times.'&quot;(HNV)

In verse 3, the Messiah says, “Listen!” (shema), which hails from the “Shema” (6: 4-9) and he ends with the words, “Whoever has ears to hear, let him hear”. He points out the importance of listening, just as Moshe does in the Shema text.
In verse 20, it is written,  “These are those which were sown on the good ground: such as hear the word, and accept it, and bear fruit, some thirty times, some sixty times, and some one hundred times.&quot;(HNV)

The great mystery in the Kingdom is to receive the seed that the farmer sows.  The ground is man, who was once made from the dust of the earth.  Depending on how the seed enters the ground, it will bear fruit.  The great mystery of the Kingdom is to make sure that the Torah enters into the depths of the heart. According to this parable, there are four kinds of people:

1.      Those who are like the road - who are hard around their hearts so that the seed cannot enter. The roads that existed at that time had been made by people walking on them many times. The more people walked on the road, the harder it became. The traditions of men are, therefore, the first hindrance to receiving the seed into the heart. We are used to walking where everyone walks, and we do not want to make the changes that the Torah demands, so satan comes and removes the precious seed.

2.      Those who have rocks - who have a positive, receptive attitude in their minds, but in their innermost being, are obstacles and objections and they are not willing to change its lifestyle. They like to listen and they receive the word with great emotion, but when the moment of truth comes and there is persecution because of the Torah, they pull back since they are only looking for pleasure and do not want to suffer for the sake of the Kingdom.

3.      Those who have thorns - who have heard and obeyed the Torah, but are more interested in the things of this world than the Kingdom. They seek to fulfill their own desires, the cares of this life consume them, rather than the desires of the heavenly Father. With time they loose the zeal for the Kingdom because they are more interested in what will bring short term pleasure than in obeying the commandments, which will produce greater long term pleasure.

4.      Those who are good soil - who hear the Torah and receive it with all of its consequences, with inner conflicts and persecution from the outside. They allow the Torah to penetrate deep into their hearts and adapt their lives according to its teaching, in spite of the pain that comes because of it. They are not temporary, but they last and with time there will be a lovely result because of their faithfulness to the Word that was sown inside of them. They give harvest on three different levels, which shows us that there are three different kinds of people who are faithful to the Kingdom.

In Mark 4:24, it is written, “Take heed what you hear.&quot;(HNV)
The secret of the Kingdom is to put the Torah in our hearts. We can find the same thing in Mark 4:26-28, where it is written,
“He said, ‘The Kingdom of God is as if a man should cast seed on the earth, and should sleep and rise night and day, and the seed should spring up and grow, he doesn’t know how. For the earth bears fruit: first the blade, then the ear, then the full grain in the ear.&quot;(HNV revised)

When you have succeeded in getting the seed down into your heart, you will have a unique experience.  The seed will bear fruit on its own. You are not the one who must produce fruit in your life; the Torah will produce fruit on its own. Your worry is not whether or not you will bear fruit, but how you will get the seed down into your heart.  The rest will come by itself.

How much fruit do you want in your life? Thirty, sixty, or a hundred fold? 
It depends on the measure of seed you manage to put into your heart, as it is written in Mark 4:24b,
“With whatever measure you measure, it will be measured to you, and more will be given to you who hear.&quot;(HNV)

How are we to deposit the seeds into our hearts?  The Shema answers this question: “you shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall talk of them when you sit in your house, and when you walk by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise up.”  (5: 7)   This is instructing us to constantly relate everything in life to the Torah, every minute of every day, from the moment you arise to the moment you go to bed.  The next verse goes on to bind them as a sign upon your hand and between your eyes and on your door-posts.  This is identifying everything we do and everything we are and all our possessions as belonging to Yahweh for all the world to see, i.e. nothing which gives an appearance of evil or unrighteousness.  It involves giving a clear testimony to what we are before the world, labelling ourselves as observant followers of the Most High God, either by fulfilling the commands literally and/or by lifestyle.


'''Wearing Tefillin'''

“You shall bind them as a sign on your hand and they shall be as frontals on your forehead.” (Deuteronomy 6:8) This statute has been traditionally interpreted as the law of tefillin (phylacteries).   Tefillin consist of small, hollow, black leather boxes that contain several parchments of relevant Scripture verses: Exodus 13:1–10; 13:11–16; Deuteronomy 6:4–9; 11:13–21. The small black boxes are bound on the arm and forehead by means of long, black leather straps, thus literally fulfilling the commandment of binding the Torah on the hand and the forehead.

The Master criticized certain Pharisees for broadening their tefillin, but it should go without saying that the Master Himself wore tefillin.  In the days of the Master, the straps of the tefillin were far less encumbering than the modern version, and they were worn all day long.  During the Hadrianic persecutions in the Second Century CE, Rome outlawed the wearing of tefillin.  During those days, “Many Jews risked their lives in order to wear tefillin.”  (b.Shabbat 130a)  As a result, Jews began wearing tefillin only during the morning prayers, a practice which continues to this day.
The tefillin boxes bear the Hebrew letter shin ש, a sign indicating God’s Name. This has a connection with those passages of Revelation which speak of the saints who bear God’s Name upon their foreheads and the wicked who take the name of the beast on their arm and forehead.
There is some argument over whether the commandment of tefillin was meant to be taken literally, or if it is just a figurative language. In the Near East, it was once common for blood covenant partners to exchange amulet-like pouches which contained tokens, or even full copies, of their covenant obligations to one another.   These were worn as bracelets or necklaces. The commandment of tefillin is consistent with that ancient ritual, especially when one considers the rabbinic tradition that God Himself has ‘tefillin’ with Israel’s name on them.  In that sense, the tefillin are similar to wedding rings.  In fact, while a Jew winds the black leather straps for tefillin of the hand about his middle finger like a ring, he recites the betrothal passage from the book of Hosea:   “I will betroth you to Me forever; Yes, I will betroth you to Me in righteousness and in justice, in lovingkindness and in compassion, a I will betroth you to Me in faithfulness. Then you will know Yahweh.” (Hosea 2:19–20)   The binding on of tefillin is a tangible, ritual reminder of our obligation to bind God’s commandments on our very lives. God’s Word is to be between our eyes, filtering all that we see and think. It is to be bound on our hands, weighing all that we set our hands to do.


'''Stewards of the Counsel of God'''

“See, I have taught you statutes and judgments just as Yahweh my God commanded me, that you should do thus in the land where you are entering to possess it.  So keep and do them, for that is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the peoples who will hear all these statutes and say, ‘Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people.’  For what great nation is there that has a god so near to it as is Yahweh our God whenever we call on Him?  Or what great nation is there that has statutes and judgments as righteous as this whole Torah which I am setting before you today?

Being that the Torah comes from God it must contain the wisdom of God. 
Moshe tells the Israelites that if they keep God’s commandments and His Torah that they will become a very wise and understanding people.  They will become so wise that the heathen nations around them will say, “What other nation is as wise and prudent as this!” (New Living Translation).  This is something extremely important to grasp,  Yahweh tells us that if we want to be wise, and have the heathen astonished at us, that we must obey His commandments.  If we obey His commandments, then those outside of us will see how blessed we are and will hopefully want to enter in.  They will want to know why we are blessed and it should give us the chance to minister the good news of Yeshua.  Those that would reject His Torah and keeping its commandments demonstrate that they are not wise, and don’t desire to be a real witness to others.  As individual Believers empowered by the Holy Spirit and who want to emulate Messiah Yeshua, we have a serious responsibility to be that example and that light to other people.  

The keeping and doing of God’s commands were to be the wisdom and understanding of Israel in the eyes of the nations”  History has confirmed this.  Not only did the wisdom of a Solomon astonish the queen of Sheba (1Ki 10:4), but the divine truth which Israel possessed in the law of Moshe attracted all the more earnest minds of the heathen world to seek the satisfaction of the inmost necessities of their heart and the salvation of their souls in Israel’s knowledge of God.”  The Torah is the source of all that His people need to keep close to Him.  When they took their eyes off the Torah they wandered around and lost sight of God. 

Moses reminds the sons of Israel that they were a small number of people but that Yahweh separated out a people chosen by Him to be His possession among the nations of the earth.  The Almighty made an oath to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob that He is bound to keep so that His Name will be glorified (Deuteronomy 7:6-8).  We need to be those faithful bearers of the light to the rest of the world.  We tend to take Yahweh lightly because we can not see Him.  Seeing is believing to many, but if that is what God desired, I am sure He would have done it.  When Yeshua came 2,000 years ago and walked the earth He was God in the flesh and yet most of mankind saw Him but did not believe in Him.  Yet the remnant that did, held fast to their faith and spread the truth of Yeshua throughout the world.  Yeshua is the heart, soul and spirit of Scripture because He is the living Word of His Father.  

We need to search the Torah, as well as the New Covenant scriptures, to find ways we can please our Father and reap the blessings He has in store for us.  Sometimes following the seemingly most insignificant commandments may bless us in ways we can’t imagine and give us fullness of life.  May you be blessed as you search His word and follow His ways.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Ekev (As a Result)  Deuteronomy 7:12-11:25


The Ekev portion falls literally “on the heels” of the last exhortation from the Va’ethanan portion where Moshe commands the children of Israel to “faithfully observe the instructions or the commandments, statutes and judgments” that he has received and, in turn, given to Israel.  The conjunctive word ekev, which means “on the heels of” from which this portion gets its title, is translated as “if” or “because” or “as a result of” in different translations and it indicates the results of obedience to the list of instructions or the Torah.  The opening verses describe many of the blessings that flow from listening to and doing the commandments of God:

'''Because --'''''Italic text''

“So now, Israel, all that Yahweh your El asks from you is to fear Yahweh your El, follow all his ways, love him and serve Yahweh your El with all your heart and all your being; to obey,…….” 
WHY? BECAUSE  .... it’s “for your own good, the mitzvoth and regulations of Yahweh which I am giving you today.” 
BECAUSE… “Only Yahweh took enough pleasure in your ancestors to love them and choose their descendants after them---yourselves---above all peoples, as he still does today. Therefore, circumcise the foreskin of your heart; and don’t be stiff-necked any longer!” 
BECAUSE… “Yahweh your El is Elohim of El and Lord of lords, the great, mighty and awesome Elohim, who has no favorites and accepts no bribes. You are to fear Yahweh your El, serve him, cling to him and swear by his name.” 
BECAUSE….”He is your praise, and he is your El, who has done for you these great and awesome things,…”
“No one will be able to withstand you;” 
BECAUSE… “Yahweh your El will place the fear and dread of you on all the land you step on, as he told you.”  

He gives us some reasons to obey his commandments. He tells us why he has chosen Israel.  In these scriptures we have the reasons to obey our Father.  And “because” we obey we have some promises of blessings.
Starting with verse 12: Yahweh will keep the covenant he made with our ancestors BECAUSE we are listening to the rulings, keeping and obeying them. Do not show the enemy any pity, and do not serve their gods, BECAUSE that will become a trap for us. (verse 16)  We are not to be frightened of them, BECAUSE Yahweh our El is there with us, a El great and fearsome. (v. 21)  We are to remember Yahweh our El, BECAUSE it is He who is giving us the power to get wealth, in order to confirm His covenant….. (ch.8 v.18)   

We will perish just like the nations, BECAUSE we have not heeded the voice of Yahweh our El. (ch.8 v.20)
It is BECAUSE of the wickedness of these nations that Yahweh your El is driving them out ahead of you, and also to confirm the word which Yahweh swore to your ancestors, Avraham, Yitz’chak and Ya’akov.” Therefore, understand that it is not BECAUSE of your righteousness that Yahweh is giving you this good land to possess. (ch.9 vs. 4-6)


'''The Grace and Mercy of Yahweh'''

The overwhelming theme of Ekev is that the Israelites have been preserved and protected BECAUSE of their God and Who He is -not because of themselves. Devarim/Deuteronomy- 9:3-6
“Know therefore today that it is Yahweh your God who is crossing over before you as a consuming fire.  He will destroy them and He will subdue them before you, so that you may drive them out and destroy them quickly, just as Yahweh has spoken to you.  Do not say in your heart when Yahweh your God has driven them out before you, - ‘Because of my righteousness Yahweh has brought me in to possess this land,’ but it is BECAUSE of the wickedness of these nations that Yahweh is dispossessing them before you.  It is not for your righteousness or for the uprightness of your heart that you are going to possess their land, but it is BECAUSE of the wickedness of these nations that Yahweh your God is driving them out before you, in order to confirm the oath which Yahweh swore to your fathers, to Abraham,Isaac and Jacob.  Know, then, it is not BECAUSE of your righteousness that Yahweh your God is giving you this good land to possess, for you are a stubborn people. “

In the excerpt above from Ekev, Yahweh clearly tells us why the heathen peoples occupying the Promised Land are to be destroyed and driven from it.  It is not because of the overwhelming righteousness of the Israelites, who we know consistently disobeyed Him while in the desert.  It is because the heathen peoples occupying the Land are in great sin and unrighteousness and they must be purged from the covenant territory.  Moshe warned Israel here against thinking that their own righteousness merited their success and not to become haughty and proud so as to think that it is because of “them” that He will do all this for them.

We would do well to take the same warning. Though there are always blessings for obedience and punishments for disobedience, it would be foolish of us to assume that our righteousness amounts to anything.  A person busily engaged in keeping the commandments might assume that he is a pretty righteous person and that God owes him some reward.  It’s a wrong assumption.  

Moshe reminded Israel that if not for his own intercession on their behalf, they would not have survived the trip from Sinai to the Promised Land. Therefore, they should not imagine that their righteousness amounted to anything.  In the same way, if we are ever tempted to imagine that our own righteousness has amounted to something, we had best remind ourselves that if not for Yeshua’s intercession on our behalf, we would never survive the journey.

Even if one’s righteousness did accumulate enough to merit a reward, that is God’s business, not ours. We are not supposed to keep Torah (His commandments) for the sake of receiving a reward.  The Master teaches us to obey God simply on the basis that it is what we are supposed to do.   Our obedience to God does not deserve any special accolades.  It is what we were created to do.  We are his servants, and a servant’s job is to obey his master.  Yeshua said that when we have done all the things which are commanded that we are to say, “We are unworthy slaves; we have done only that which we ought to have done.” (Luke 17:7–10)

Among many Believers today there are many who believe that they are called to “do things for God. “ Such individuals believe that they are called to “do this” or “do that” to please God. While many are indeed called, we as humans with a fallen sin nature are not supposed to necessarily “do things” for God.  This will gender pride in what ‘we’ have done.  On the contrary, we are called to serve Him.  We serve God because we love Him, and our obedience to Him comes naturally because we love Him.  We are not supposed to do things in our own strength -&quot;for Him,” deciding ourselves what we think we should to do for Him.  Rather, we are supposed to diligently obey Him and do what He tells us, as His Spirit leads, and do those things.  Many are led by their own spirit and do not truly seek Yahweh diligently to know His will. 

Pride has many dangers.   It can cause us to be lifted up in our own heart, by our own reasonings, and go astray from the way of His paths, presumptuously assuming we have His blessing and are doing His will.   His Word alone is the measuring rod of truth.

Pride is evidenced in many ways -  
“The people of Israel are compared to a vine to teach us that just as a vine has large and small clusters of grapes, the larger ones hanging lower than the smaller ones, the greater a person is (the heavier his wisdom), the profounder his humility” (A Torah Commentary For Our Times, p. 120-121, UHAC Press).
“King Solomon teaches that pride causes a person to speak dishonestly.  It forces a person to deviate from the truth and to make accusations that are unfounded.  God weeps over those who are filled with pride” (ibid. p. 121).


'''Serving God Acceptably'''

After reviewing some of the details of his intercession because of their waywardness, Moshe, poses a rhetorical question and the answers to his question as,  “And now, O Israel, what does Yahweh your God demand of you?”  In the NASB version it reads: “Now, Israel, what does Yahweh your God require from you?”  giving us the list of requirements that our Father demands and requires of us, His children.  It is these admonitions that summarize not only what God requires of His people, but also how the sons of Israel can actually do certain things to fulfill these requirements.  Let’s first look at the passage from Deuteronomy 10:12-22 from the NASB:  “Now, Israel, what does Yahweh your God require from you, but to fear Yahweh your God, to walk in all His ways and love Him, and to serve Yahweh your God with all your heart and with all your soul, and to keep Yahweh’s commandments and His statutes which I am commanding you today for your good?  “Behold, to Yahweh your God belong heaven and the highest heavens, the earth and all that is in it.  “Yet on your fathers did Yahweh set His affection to love them, and He chose their descendants after them, even you above all peoples, as it is this day.  “So circumcise your heart, and stiffen your neck no longer.  “For Yahweh your God is the God of gods and Yahweh of lords, the great, the mighty, and the awesome God who does not show partiality nor take a bribe. “He executes justice for the orphan and the widow, and shows His love for the alien by giving him food and clothing.  “So show your love for the alien, for you were aliens in the land of Egypt.  “You shall fear Yahweh your God; you shall serve Him and cling to Him, and you shall swear by His name.  “He is your praise and He is your God, who has done these great and awesome things for you which your eyes have seen.  “Your fathers went down to Egypt seventy persons in all, and now Yahweh your God has made you as numerous as the stars of heaven” (Deuteronomy 10:12-22).

This is the sum total of the whole of the Torah, the essence of it all  -  love God and love your neighbour, as Yeshua reiterated it in Matthew 22.37 - 40  -  “Yeshua said unto him, You shall love Yahweh your God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind” and “You shall love your neighbour as yourself”, and all the gospel writers likewise. 

James refers to this scripture when he exhorts the believers  to be doers of the Word, keeping themselves from being defiled by worldliness and to exercise “pure and undefiled religion” in meeting the needs of the orphans and widows.  (1:22-27)           

Moshe says to them, “Fear Yahweh your God” (10:12).  There are two levels of fearing God. The higher of the two is the sense of awe and reverence, and that is what Moshe calls for here.  Such fear is easy to imagine, hard to walk out.  The second fear, and the lesser of the two, is the fear of physical punishment because of disobedience to Yahweh. Motivated by love we can achieve this higher level of fear and maintain it as a constant force in our lives which will keep us on the straight and narrow path of righteousness,  walking in intimacy with our heavenly Father.

John says, “And this is love, that we walk after his commandments.  This is the commandment, that, as you have heard from the beginning, you should walk in it.”  (2 John 6)   The “beginning” that John is referring to is the beginning at Mount Sinai (Har Sinai) where Yahweh gave Torah to Yisrael.  

We love Him because He first loved us and brought us to Himself.  (1 John 4: 9-11)   Out of that love we keep His commandments and thereby abide in Him through the Spirit He has given us.  (John 14:15; 1 John 3:24)  Maintaining a reverential fear of Yahweh will guard us against becoming contaminated with the things of this world and allowing our love to grow cold.  1 John 2:15-17

“Here is how we know that we love Yahweh’s children: when we love Yahweh, we also do what he commands. For loving Yahweh means obeying his commands. Moreover, His commands are not burdensome, BECAUSE everything which has Yahweh as its Father overcomes the world. And this is what victoriously overcomes the world: our trust.” And then back to chapter 4 verse 19: “We ourselves love now BECAUSE He loved us first.”   I John 5:2-4 

Hebrews 12.28 exhorts us  -  “Wherefore, receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace, whereby we may serve Yahweh acceptably with reverence and godly fear”


'''Yeshua - the Living Word''' 

Yeshua is a tree of life to those who take hold of Him,  His ways are ways of pleasantness and all of His paths are shalom.  
In the study of the Torah let us never forget that YESHUA THE MESSIAH is the Living Torah, the Torah-Word of Elohim made flesh.  He is the way, truth and life – the Living Manna sent from heaven.  Without Him living in our lives through the indwelling Presence of his Set-apart/Kadosh Spirit (Who leads us into all truth and revelation) the Written Torah can become the dead letter of the law!   The written Word is a modern invention, His Word needs to be in our heart so He can make it alive and we ‘hear’ it.

In 11:13, the Hebrew this phrase literally reads, “If hearken, you will hearken...”  Rashi interprets the double usage of this verb to mean, “If [you] listen to the old, you will listen to the new” meaning that if one listens to what one has already learned by taking care to review and understand it, one will gain new insights or fresh insights into the Torah (ArtScroll Sapirstein Edition Rashi – Devarim, p. 110; AS Chumash, p. 995).   This requires consistent study and an attentive ear to His Spirit.
Yahweh gave the Israelites fresh (not stale) manna every day and watered the land of Israel with the early and latter rains so that it would be fruitful without the need of man-made irrigation.  Manna and rain both came from heaven and are used as figures of speech to represent Torah-truth.  Our spiritual life needs to be renewed regularly with fresh revelation and insights into the Word of Yahweh, entering into His very heart and character.  Fresh manna refreshes, nourishes and sustains the ground of our lives so that it yields an abundant spiritual crop of joy, shalom, intimacy with the Father and anointing. 

“Truly, truly, I say to you, he who believes has eternal life. I am the bread of life.  Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died. This is the bread which comes down out of Heaven, that a man may eat of it and not die. I am the living bread which came down out of Heaven; if anyone eats of this bread, he will live forever; and the bread also which I will give is My flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.’ John 6:40-66).

Yeshua was teaching that He was their source of spiritual sustenance - He was the living Word of the Father which would be given for their eternal life.   In living by faith and in union with Him, we have life!
But in order to feast on the words that come forth from the mouth of the Holy One, a person really needs to make a choice.  After all, the flesh and its desire for gratification is a strong advocate of feasting on the tangible things in the earthly realm to those who are operating in the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes and the boastful pride of life (1 John 2:16).  

When you think about it, the things that attract you and get your attention and time are things that originate in the world system in which we live.  The devil knew this, because as the prince of the power of air and the god of this world (Ephesians 2:2), he was used to watching mankind succumb to his wily ways.  When you review the account of the “Wilderness Temptation of Yeshua,” you can see that the enemy of our souls did his utmost for the physically weakened Son of God to fall under his dominion.
His victory, even when in His weakened condition, is a great example of how we can also meet with the tests, trials and tribulations that we know we will have in our lifetime.  The question we have to ask ourselves is whether we belief enough in the promises and do we have enough faith to take our time and invest it in feasting on the Word of God.  After all, there are a number of other things we could be doing with our time and the enemy of our souls will offer many seemingly legitimate alternatives.

It is a matter of placing our priorities on the things above, on the eternal things of the kingdom.
“Now, Israel, what does Yahweh your God require from you, but to fear Yahweh your God, to walk in all His ways and love Him, and to serve Yahweh your God with all your heart and with all your soul, and to keep Yahweh’s commandments and His statutes which I am commanding you today for your good? . . . . So circumcise your heart, and stiffen your neck no longer”   Deuteronomy 10:12-16.

This passage stipulate that we serve with BOTH — heart and nephesh.  This takes in the two facets of our being: [1] our physical heart and body in this physical universe and [2] our spiritual nephesh in the spiritual realm.  Both need to be brought into subjection to His commandments.   This is the relationship between faith and works. A literal translation of verse 12 would read 
“And now Yisrael, what is Yahweh your God, asking of you; other than to revere Yahweh your God, to walk in every one of His Ways and for the love of Him, to serve Yahweh your God, with all of your heart and with all of your soul; .. .. .. “  

This reveals a thought not usually recognized  ‘to walk’    
1. in all of His Ways
2. for the love of Him

If we truly want to walk in His ways and love Him and serve Him with all of our heart and soul, we are going to have to prioritize what we are going to do with our time.  Are we going to let the washing of the water of the Word penetrate into our spirits, so that we can begin to truly have the mind of the Messiah?  For it is when we have the mind of the Messiah that we can deal with the temptations of life with the Word that has proceeded out of the mouth of God.  He knows just what temptations are going to come our way and at each one, we are all individually going to have to make a decision.  Are we going to react the way Yeshua reacted or are we going to react out of our own strength and inclination, responding according to our own nature?
The Scriptures admonish us to make sure that we are in the faith.  “Test yourselves, to see whether you are in the faith.  Examine yourselves! Or do you not recognize this about yourselves, that Yeshua the Messiah is in you, unless indeed you fail the test?  But I hope that you will know that we ourselves do not fail the test” (2 Corinthians 13:5-6).
Remember “you are what you eat.”  Our life depends on what we eat.


'''What God Requires: Faith'''

Do we walk by faith or by sight (i.e. by logic - our own reasonings)?  Was it logical to think that Israel could dispossess a fortified land full of people mightier and greater in number than themselves?  Fear and logic are often the enemies of faith in Yahweh’s Word and promises.  (7:17-18)  

Without faith it is impossible to please Yahweh (Heb. 11:6),  and the just shall walk by faith (Heb. 10:38).  What is faith? (see Heb. 11:1).  By faith the physical creation came into existence (Heb. 11:3), therefore, faith preceded the physical creation and is the “mother” of it.  From the “womb” of faith, if you will, came forth all that we see and know. That “womb” is the very heart, character and mind of Yahweh Elohim.  It is spiritual.  We live in a physical dimension.   The new heaven and the new earth, and the Jerusalem from above, will be spiritual dimensions.   Those who plan on being there have got to learn to walk in that dimension here and now by trusting in the Word and promises of Yahweh for all of their needs. 

Remember! An essential element of a strong faith in the promises of Yahweh (7:18; 8:2,11)  --   is to remember Yahweh’s past accomplishments in your life: how he has healed you, prospered you, answered your prayers, transformed your life, delivered you from enemies and troubles, given meaning, hope and purpose to your life.   Some of these promises for Israel are --- 
prosperity - verse 13; fruitfulness of womb - verse 14; healing - verse 15; victory over enemies - verse 16; etc.  

We need faith to go forward spiritually – to trust in Yahweh’s leading when it means going out of our comfort zone into unknown, unchartered areas where we are completely dependant upon Him (8:7-9).   If we harden our heart we will find ourselves in a spiritual wilderness wandering around the same old mountain.   It is this attitude that kept the older generation of Israelites out of the Promised Land (9:6-7; Heb. 4:1-7). 

Faith is a matter of loving God and our fellow man after that, but it is not a works based salvation but salvation that evidences works caused by turning to the ways of God.   Torah was not given by God to show us how sinful we are.   It was given because God loved us so much He wanted us to see what it was that would please Him and cause Him to bless us if we did what He wanted us to.   On the other hand He presented us with curses that come on us as a consequence if we break His laws.  
The subsequent blessings for our obedience are stated in Deuteronomy 7:12-24 in which we see what a great and awesome God the sons of Israel have as their Provider, Protector and Champion against all of the other gods of the world.  But while rejoicing in all of the wonderful things that the Holy One will do for this nation of priests, there is the conditional “if” that qualifies it in v.12.

Lack of faith in Yahweh is the root of disobedience as Moshe has seen with the entire generation which perished in the desert because of their rebellion, stiff necks and unbelief, in spite of the visible presence of the Most High in their midst.  Even with the daily provision of manna for bread, quail for meat, water from various rocks, protection and victory over the enemies of Israel and a myriad of other miracles during the desert journey, Moshe has witnessed the unbelief and the consequences of disobedience.  Seeing is not necessarily believing, it takes faith to be born in the heart to obey and faith comes by hearing the Word of God.

That is why Moshe continually exhorts them ‘to listen/hear’ the word of Yahweh so that they will come to faith.  Romans 10:9-10. Moshe’ concern is further heightened by the visions he received about the future scattering of the sons of Israel due to their collective disobedience.  Just a few chapters earlier we can read a statement that describes what Moshe has already perceived:
“Yahweh will scatter you among the peoples, and you will be left few in number among the nations where Yahweh drives you” (Deuteronomy 4:27).  When you combine this realization with the fact that Moshe also recognizes that his limited days are coming to an end, the urgency of his appeal is better understood.  With some of his last activities on earth, as the Rabbis believe that Deuteronomy was written over a period of thirty or so days, he continues to exhort the children of Israel to obey the commandments in order to receive the blessings that are promised.  The heart of a shepherd over his flock is evident.  Almost to his last breath, Moshe continues to repeat the words of instruction that lead to life and the promises of blessings.


'''Walking in Faith and Love'''

Paul tells us that each man has been given a measure of faith (Romans 12:3).  But let us also by reminded that our faith in Yeshua does not exempt us from loving, serving, obeying, and clinging to the Living God.  Those actions come as a result of our faith in the accomplished work of the Messiah, since we are unable to comply perfectly with the dictates of Torah in our own strength.

The apostles understood when they came to faith in Yeshua’s atoning work for sin that it did not however, change their need to continue in the Torah obedient life that they had lived prior to the Resurrection.  In a like manner, as those of us in the 21st Century return to our Hebraic Roots, it is critical to understand that we likewise need to be following the dictates of the Torah with all of our heart, mind, souls and strength.  With the Comforter and Teacher indwelling our now circumcised heart, we should understand more clearly what Moshe is saying when we read this section of Deuteronomy.  Through the comforting promptings of the Ruach, we can each appreciate what truly fearing and revering Yahweh is all about, as we pursue Him in prayer and supplication.   We should desire to walk in His ways so that we can please our Heavenly Father as we are being conformed to the image of Yeshua.  We can learn to love Him more, as we understand the greater depths of His love for us and seek to serve Him with all of our heart, mind, soul and strength, knowing that we can literally be living sacrifices  so that our spiritual service of praise and worship ministers to Him.  As we each seek to obey His commandments, He can bless us according to His Word, recognizing that in Messiah, our sins are forgiven as we confess and repent from our misdeeds.

Through service to the Holy One, in whatever capacity, you are putting His interests ahead of your own and learning to be sensitive to what His demands are for your usefulness in the work of the Kingdom.  By serving Him, you display a willingness to let Him use you in the circumstances of life that you find yourself.  

Whatever our circumstances, whatever our stage of spiritual growth, Yahweh can use us in His kingdom.  He does not expect immediate cleansing from all the contaminating effects of sin in our lives straight away.  He gives us time to drive out the enemy.  Yahweh said to the Israelites entering the land, “Yahweh your God will cast out those nations before you by little and little: you may not consume them at once, lest the animals of the field increase on you.&quot;(HNV revised) - The children of Israel had to experience many adjustments when they entered into the land. When you make major changes, it is better to do it bit by bit, in order not to be overcome by strategies of the enemy directed against you.  (7:22)  The conquest may take a long time, where there has been a strong entrenchment of the enemy, to battle them until they are eliminated from our territory.  But this is not an excuse for not obeying.  

“Moreover Yahweh your God will send tzirah among them (our enemies), until those who are left, and hide themselves, perish from before you.&quot;(7:20) - The Hebrew word that is normally translated as “hornets”, and sometimes as “panic” is “tzirah”, which, according to Rashi, is a type of flying insect that sprays poison on its enemies which paralyzes and blinds them, no matter where they are hiding. Yahweh’s presence in our lives has a paralysing effect upon the enemy’s perceptions and activities in our lives and will enable us to overcome and drive them out of our ‘territory’ and claim the total inheritance which we have been given.

      <text xml:space="preserve">====Chapter II: The Town====

After the war, many of the families owning large country estates - holding positions of responsibility and likely to be future heads of the family, were dead... in many cases their younger brothers were dead too. In time, their parents became too old and impoverished to retain and manage the family home, business, and estate. These were then broken up and sold to maintain their only home which ultimately became too much for them too – this was also broken up and sold. In this way the countryside lost the traditional squire in his manor house and the once fine estate sold to be split up and got rid of piecemeal, some to be for building land. The countryside was never the same again... and this is what happened, starting gradually after WWI, until the older, moneyed population, had died. By about 1938 – twenty-years after the war ended, the class structure had lost its top tier. The bottom layer too, had been removed – the very poor and the destitute had been taken care of by The State.

The reduced class levels speeded up what was likely to take place by natural evolution. Taxation in the form of death duties saw to it that over a period of time there would be a redistribution of wealth. The enclosure act forced some of the poor off the land. They gravitated, as did others, to the towns and factories. The agricultural depression at the end of the nineteenth century changed the balance of the working population between town and country. The war hurried this change along. The 1919 budget raised death duties to forty per cent to estates over two million. A million acres of land was sold over that year. By the end of 1921 a quarter of England had changed hands… A quarter of agricultural land had passed from being tenanted into that of the farmer-owner. Land sales had reached their peak - three years of land sales, now the new owners totted up what their purchases had given them… The repeal of the Corn Production Act saw massive grain imports from Canada, America and Russia. The price of cereals plummeted. What large estates had survived started again to be split up and houses attached to them sold to become detached dwellings. A quarter of country houses were torn down or left derelict. By the first years of the Second World War there was less arable land. What land there was, was not being farmed properly. It took the war and the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries to take Britain close to self sufficiency. 

The result of all this was, a large reduction of wealth owned by the top one per cent of the population – mainly the landed gentry. This land found its way to the next social layer down. Seventy-five per cent of Britain’s population still held less than one hundred pounds in their estate. The change in the population’s occupations – from country to town – from working the land to working the production line, gave an opportunity for skills to be learned and entrepreneurship to blossom. This flattened-out the social class graph, and reduced the layers. Within this now reduced, or flattened out, layer of wealth is accorded a class position defined by occupation, background, education, speech, fashion and hobby – giving social structure.

For those who are interested in class and where they fit into the structure the concept is of interest… for it is a perceived thing. You may like to think of yourself as belonging to one class but your neighbours may not agree with you. In the period and setting we are discussing, 1929 – 1939, in suburban Harrow, class was not of over-riding concern. There were no aristocrats, gentry or Gentlemen – rich men, without occupation. It was a working environment – of mainly men, travelling to and from their work, mostly by rail. There were very few cars and the local bus routes took prospective rail passengers to access a different rail network. It was not an area of heavy industry, textiles, mining or farming, but one of light engineering, service industries, office, and shop work.

North Harrow did not have any grand houses… Its premier houses lined the Pinner Road leading to Harrow. They had an extra living room and bedroom above, were detached, and designed in a similar style to all the rest of the town. If North Harrow had no houses for the very rich it neither had houses for the very poor… the town was made up of similar houses. Some streets had a better place upon the map – close to the park. Others had trees that lined the road. Those that backed upon the railway, positioned next to the shops, or linked to the council houses, had a disadvantage. But in the main, all were very much like each other… held a suburban likeness… there was very little to separate each individual family.

The first railway to be opened locally was The London &amp; Birmingham Railway, later to be called the London &amp; North Western, in 1837. It ran from Euston to Boxmore passing through Harrow, later to be called Harrow &amp; Wealdstone station. A second line, the Metropolitan, originally ran from Paddington to Farringdon, operating in 1863, as the first underground railway. Over the next twenty years was extended linking up with the District Railway and the Inner Circle in 1884. During this time, branch lines ran from Baker Street to Swiss Cottage in 1868, and Willesden to Harrow in 1880. This was extended to Pinner five years later, a station being built there within the year. It took a further twelve years to push the tack-laying to Chesham, Chalfont, Watford, Amersham and Aylesbury. By the turn of the century the company stretched over fifty miles from central London – out to Buckinghamshire. The whole railway was electrified by 1905, and by 1927 North Harrow station was up and running. The electric Metropolitan District line, inaugurated 1904 operated between Park Royal and Roxeth - which included a halt at Rayners Lane. The company was not slow in planning the purchase of additional land for more lines, sidings and depots. This land was negotiated on the principle that the land could be used for other purposes. In the event it was used for housing instead. The first housing estates were built at Wembley and Pinner in the early 1900s. A few years later more land was let go all along the line which was only bought to a halt by The First World War.

However, the start of the war did not stop the railway company’s publicity department continuing to operate - before its operations temporarily closed down. Its declared policy aim was to publicise the line. It had adopted the brand name of Metro-Land to title an advertising brochure aimed at promoting the company’s land for development. This was not a one-off publication… for it continued publication for another twelve years - until the Metropolitan Railway ceased trading as an independent company, before becoming part of London Transport. A year after the war, a property company called The Metropolitan Railway Country Estates Limited [MRCE] was set up to manage and develop the railway’s holdings. It was this company’s policy to plan and built residential estates all along the line, including Pinner, North Harrow, Rayners Lane, Northwick Park and Eastcote. The scale of the enterprise required the services of local property developers who were allowed to build to their own specifications. To advertise the housing projects all the railway’s route maps, timetables and station posters carried detailed accounts of the sites, plans and local facilities. This was done under the slogan ‘a better way of life’, and, ‘rural traditions with civilized progress’. This marketing ploy worked and the houses were soon snapped up not just for owner occupation but by investors renting out property.

Tramways were laid at the end of the nineteenth century – they were company owned horse tramways. By 1897 electric tramways were operated, a number of tramway companies formed the Tramways and Light Railway Association. It wasn’t long before the Omnibus Owners Association was formed to look after the interests of the horse drawn public transport. In the 1920s and 1930s the three forms of public transport – buses, trolleybuses and trains operated in and around London. The Road Traffic Act 1930 regulated road transport. There were two bus routes which served North Harrow. The 183 ran from Golders Green Bus Station to either Pinner or Northwood Terminus…, and the 230, which covered Wealdstone Bus Station to Rayners Lane Terminus. In 1930. Both routes operated single Decker buses with a driver and conductor. Tickets were obtained from a ticket stick by the conductor, punched when the passenger first boarded the bus… these had to be shown to any Inspector when demanded. During rush hours both routes operated a ten minute service using regular stopping places and request stops. Passengers could stop the bus at request stops by operating a bell. Orderly queues formed beside each bus and request stop.

North Harrow did not appear on the map by chance. It was ordained by the government of the day and the local authority planning department… to cater for the increase in population, and expanding businesses in and around the capital city. The problems of mass unemployment and the need to stimulate the economy lead the government to press local councils for the need to produce residential schemes for house building, and instigate ancillary projects to service that increase in population. The Government Acts of 1919 – 1925 ordered ten council-house estates to be built. Amongst these was one of fifty-three houses to be erected in North Harrow.

The need for workers houses close to their work, the location of the country’s capital city London on a main river, with warehouses and dockland facilities, turned the southeast of England into Britain’s most populous place. People and goods need to be moved from home to work, from factory to warehouse. Rivers, canals, roads, and railways are essential for moving troops, supplying goods, communication and personal travel. The direction of city developments happened along its lines of communication, both the roads and railways. As the city expanded farmland was built over. In 1929 the most desirable land left close to London of easy access to a railway was in Middlesex and Hertfordshire. The suburban sprawl of settlements along the railways came to Harrow, North Harrow and Pinner following the main Harrow and Pinner Road in the early thirties. It was not a geographical feature that suggested a settlement but an existing railway network. 

Before The First World War most people and goods travelled by the power of the horse. After the war the use of steam and then petrol - to power motors accelerated – the development of paved highways and improvements in road construction continued apace. The unemployed were given relief work which further accelerated what had begun. This government sponsored unemployment relief pushed forward road construction. More vehicles were manufactured giving a stimulus to proposals for arterial routes and side roads. Under the Local Government Act 1929 County Councils became responsible for County Highways in their areas. They in turn proposed the building of town and city bypass to ease congestion. As the new garden towns were built in Metro-Land so the road layouts progressed to cover all the open fields.

It wasn’t many years after the town was started that the Ministry of Transport directed the introduction of road markings, road signs and pedestrian crossings. By 1934 the Road Traffic Act placed a speed limit of thirty miles per hour for all town and city roads throughout Britain. The outbreak of War in 1939 brought an end to the expansion of trunk road construction but towards the end of the War the Ministry favoured the provision of a network of high standard routes. Post War saw the enactment of the 1946 Trunk Road Act. North Harrow lies between Harrow and Pinner, on the Metropolitan Railway - which runs on an east to west bearing. Harrow, a main railway junction - services three railway companies. Pinner, in the north-eastern corner of Harrow parish, was a large medieval hamlet in 1750… enlarged to village status a hundred years later… then town, by the turn of the century. Pinner Town had an existing railway station built at the sometime the track was laid. Both these towns are situated on the A404, Pinner Road.

The development of farmland started in the 1920s and 30s. The electrification of the London &amp; North Western Railway in 1917, and permission given for the Piccadilly Line to run over the Metropolitan District line in 1932 gave access to most of that land. By 1933 there were twenty-one stations including North Harrow available for commuters. Baker Street station was the company’s headquarters incorporating the largest and most luxurious apartment block in London – completed in 1929. Land speculation and property development operated over the whole area continuously from 1925 till 1939. By 1926 the road layout was mapped out and road building started, provisions made for main services included, and by 1939 the network was complete. In 1933 Harrow Urban District Council produced residential schemes for house building using the existing main access roads of Harrow Road and Pinner Road to accommodate Alexandra Avenue, Imperial Drive, and George V Avenue. Side roads lead off main thoroughfares, giving today’s existing road layout.

On a north south axis, North Harrow lies between Wealdstone – to the north, and, Rayners Lane, to the south - on the A4090, situated on the crossroads of two main arterial roads. The local authorities appreciated the need to build a new town with all its attendant services at this place. Private house building flourished in the 1920s and 30s. By 1932 building was continuous alongside the railway, referred to a ribbon development, and main roads laid from Harrow to Pinner, Wealdstone to Rayners Lane. Most of the countryside between Pinner and Roxeth was built during the 30s. By 1938 North Harrow was complete in all respects.

It is difficult now to explain the average workers feelings and opinions regarding house ownership prior to The First World War and shortly afterwards. Only a very small percentage of the population owned their own house. This ten per-cent of owner-occupiers bought because they had the money to do so without needing a loan. Many aristocrats, landed gentry and upper classes rented either their own home or a second home in the country – it was the done thing. There was no shame in not owning your own home, the rent was low and you had the benefit of being able to move quickly as a job became available. As inflation was low and static there was no point in buying to hedge inflation, or to use as a long-term investment. To a degree this attitude was accepted as ‘normal’ and not questioned. There was a certain amount of ‘what’s the point of owning a house and having to maintain it – then, having to pass it on – why should I save for another generation?’ With a growing family you could move to increase the number of bedrooms without over extending your income. Then, where the children left, you could rent something smaller as your income became smaller in retirement. At least ten per-cent of the population lived in tied accommodation – policeman, firemen, estate workers, mill workers, railway workers, servants, miners, land workers, the armed services and teachers – the house went with the job. In the twenties, houses held about one-quarter of the country’s annual fixed-capital security. Ten years later the amount was one-third.

During this period over three million homes were built. The architectural style of the period was Arts and Crafts – a style of decoration with a romantic return to previous ages using solid wood panelling, and Georgian windows; Mock Tudor, aping the Tudor period with sham wooden framing and leaded lights, and Cottage Style, long- sloping tiled roofs and divided windows. The lower outer walls were built of red brick, above, pebbledash with half-timbering. Red clay tile roofs and tile hung bays. Georgian small windows set in metal casements with wooden frames and cills. Previous craftsmanship gave way to machine made products. Furniture used white wood and ply stained to resemble polished walnut. Carpet squares surrounded by lino. Parquet hall floors and decorated stair spindles. All treated with dark oak stain. Quarry tile kitchen floors, butler sinks, fire-back water boilers and gas cookers. Open fires in all living rooms, with wood mantle above tile surrounds. Bedrooms had iron fire grates and fitted wardrobes. Sash windows, landing lights, front door lights and side windows leaded with stained glass.

Between large scale building sites of semi-detached houses, Bungalows, Modern and Art Deco Styles existed, dividing the more conventional style with their flat roofs, ziz-zag and fan window patterns, painted concrete bays and sun-trap curved windows. The construction sites were organized for multiple building techniques on a grand scale that gave a quick turn round of work completing large sites in a four year period – mostly all before 1936.

The majority houses built in North Harrow were Cutler homes. Albert Benjamin Cutler came from Tottenham. He began building in 1909 but most of his work was in North Harrow and Pinner during the early thirties. His son Horace took over becoming Mayor of Harrow, then Leader of the Greater London Council finally knighted in 1979. Albert Cutler lived in Beresford Road, Marsh Road and lastly in Eastcote Road. He was closely associated with the Imperial Properties Investment Company then Amalgamated London Properties. During the period, 1925-1939 T F Nash Ltd., had three large estates for developing. One was at Eastcote where he lived, another at Kenton and a third at Rayners Lane… they the most economical… then on the way to Pinner that ranged from £595 to £750 – four up and two down, with a garage.

Depending on the industry, production started to push ahead in the early thirties. The first factories to set the wheels in motion were the new electric consumer goods – cookers, refrigerators, irons, toasters and vacuum cleaners. Radios, telephone equipment and cameras also felt greater sales being recorded. All these items needed ancillary parts to be manufactured. Indeed this was not ‘heavy industry’ but it had to start somewhere. Steel output rose from a low five million tons in 1932, to thirteen by 1937. Coal production had stabilized and productivity started to rise at a steady pace to reach its old peak by 1938. It was a marked change in textiles. Cotton never succeeded in reaching its previous high but woollens did. Generally the thirties, in comparison to other European countries, are described as being an improvement on the previous era – in the twenties.

When the local council were asked to submit schemes for land development in the late 1800s they considered the supply of water. These concerns were passed onto the Coln Valley Water Company who undertook to supply the necessary piped water as early as 1884. Ten years later the then local authority had installed a new sewage system. The house building schemes thirty years later gratefully used these provisions, altering the gauge and pipe material whilst retaining the essential main service. As the dwellings were being designed and built provision had to be made for recreation and open spaces to give health and a green environment for its inhabitants. This was first investigated at the time of The Great Exhibition. By 1910, a Local Board of Health committee of the Harrow Urban District Council gave consideration for recreation grounds for Harrow and Roxeth. By 1925 Headstone Park was acquired, then Pinner Park in 1930. In 1938 Harrow reserved 962 acres for a green belt. The 1894 Harrow sewage farms were turned into Kenton’s recreation ground after a larger site found. West Harrow Park and Streamside Walk, [or Yeading Walk], joined the others, as the building estates grew.

Property speculators and house buyers could obtain a mortgage with an interest rate of 4.25 per cent. These Building Societies did not require large deposits. Abbey National, then called Abbey Road, registered a seven-hundred per cent increase in borrowers, in the ten years, 1926 – 1936. This allowed most of the lower middle class and better off working class the opportunity to buy. The interest rate was set at this low point to stimulate the market, which is what it did. The population of Harrow Weald raised from fifteen hundred to eleven thousand and that of Pinner three thousand to twenty-three. North Harrow was, prior to 1919, undeveloped. Twenty years later all the farmland was gone – the one-time farmland built over. Due north of Harrow, lies the village of Stanmore. The gas-works were opened there in 1859, supplying Harrow through a private contractor named John Chapman - whose business was called Stanmore Gas Company. In 1894, it was joined with Harrow District Gas Company – the two becoming Harrow and Stanmore Gas Company, the gas holders were sited at South Harrow. This company was later taken over by Brentford Gas Company in 1924 - formed part of the Gas Light and Coke Company - two years later.

This growth coming from these new enterprises entailed electricity, in one form or another. The development of the electricity supply was the most important industrial event of that period. Legislation was required to carry forward a bill that became the Electricity Supply Act of 1925. This created the Central Electricity Board formed at the time of the General Strike – in 1926. The Boards task was to rationalize the myriad local power stations into larger units – to build a new generation of power stations, all connected to a national grid - of high-power transmission lines. By 1933 this goal was almost complete. It was a world-wide first - having the most advanced system of electrical supply available produced by coal fired power stations. Prior to The First World War, the use of electricity was for the very few. In 1920 there being almost three-quarters of a million users rising to nine million by 1939. In 1927 one house in seventeen, using electricity… by 1930 one house in three rises to two out of three, by 1939.

It is difficult to imagine the difference having electricity made to the population, particularly to those living in the country. Before electricity, illumination in the towns was by gas, commonly used by the time of The Great Exhibition in 1851. Gradually, by the turn of the twentieth-century, in the country cottage, candle power gave way to oil, then oil to gas [In country towns close to a supply]. It took until the nineteen thirties for the majority of homes to be lit by electricity. At my grandmothers cottage in Somerset I went to bed, in the 1940s, by candle light, leaving the family below playing cards by the light of an oil lamp. The radio was powered by an accumulator and the milk was kept in the stream.

After all wars there is a surge of new inventions and discoveries… brought onto the market. The First World War was no different. In the nineteen-twenties electricity and gas appliance started to appear. Cookers, refrigerators, water heaters and all sorts of household gadgets including vacuum cleaners, radio sets, record players and toasters appeared first in advertising then in the shops. Prior to WWI cooking and water heating was achieved on a kitchen range, with an open fire next to a bread oven. The fuel would have been wood and coal. Many outhouses were built or converted to kitchen use using paraffin. Similarly lighting was by candle and oil. Gas was being used extensively for street lighting. By the middle of the nineteenth century domestic lighting and heating was a matter of fact. However, this relied upon the nearness of the gas line and gas holder - to ensure continuous pressure. The nearest gas holders servicing North Harrow was at South Harrow, on the way to Northolt. 

When the Garden Suburbs were being planned and executed gas was laid on and customers could have a choice of which power to use – Coal, Gas or Electricity - for water and space heating, and cooking. Most domestic water and space heating was by burning coal – welsh nuts and coke – burnt coal, high grade coal, or steam-coal, was the preserves of the industrial sector. Delivery was by horse and cart from coal depots – normally at the local railway siding, the coal was carried in hundred-weight sacks, on the back of the coalman who deposited in your coal-bunker. Fires were started either by mentholated [soaked] fire lighters, gas-irons or kindling – chopped wood. If the coalman had spare coal he would call at each house to see if he could sell some. During this ten year period coal began to become scarce. The shortage of coal was the result of increased demand. Throughout the thirties, into the fifties, the production of coal continued to escalate, until oil fired power stations took up the strain. It was the Clean Air Act and over capacity that ultimately saw the demise of this once proud industry.

Domestic coal became low grade either slack – coal dust, or quantities of slate. Increasingly coal briquettes were made industrially, to supplement the coal that was rationed. Normally coal-sheds were filled during the summer to last the winter. Whatever the grade of coke, and there were at least two, coke needed a good draught - to make the fire ‘keep-in’ - a mixture of coke and coal was used. The coalman judged to a nicety how much bagged coal the horse could pull unloading as near to the coal depot as possible, early on his round. The coalman was a very important member of pre-war society his produce a very necessary item, particularly during winter. Carrington’s were the largest hauliers and distributers. 

The mass extraction of coal was a development of the mid-nineteenth century – eighty years before. The advent of the steam engine thirty years later made coal a more viable product – transportable. Fortunately the coal produced was high grade, very profitable. By the nineteen-thirties the miners were some of the highest paid workers in British industry. When manufacturing suffered a decline so too did the coal industry – there were too many mines producing too much coal. Closures were inevitable. The government compelled firms to participate in a marketing quota scheme to maintain price levels. The 1930 Coal Mines Act established price controls… the following year the government compelled coal-owners to use a central marketing agency. By 1938 the possibility of war, the rearmament programme, and higher industrialisation, all prompted the government to insist upon amalgamations which ultimately lead to Nationalization, eight years later.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Great work! some suggestions ==

Hi, I'm not an academic but I'm always fascinated by science. Sadly, there are things I don't understand but your text is very compelling for people like me, helped by practical examples and comparison with &quot;real and mundane&quot; things except in a few cases. Here it is:

&quot;Negatively curved surfaces also exist - they are shaped somewhat like an infinitely extended saddle - and Euclidean geometry does not apply to these surfaces either.&quot;

&quot;For example, the angles of a triangle add up to less than 180o.&quot;

&quot;If we extend these ideas to three dimensions, (do not be worried if you can't imagine a three-dimensional surface of a sphere...&quot;

&quot;Space (...) it is shaped as a hypersphere(3D spherical surface)&quot;

&quot;Space (...) it is shaped like a so-called hypersaddle&quot;

&quot;This predicts that if a giant triangle was to be constructed around the sun (***) these lines are in fact the straightest lines possible (geodesics) in this warped geometry&quot;

&quot;This local curvature can be described in mathematical terms using tensor calculus, an incredibly elegant tool which provides consistent results, regardless of the chosen frame of reference.&quot;

The quotations above could be easier with some examples. Maybe there's no examples for that (and I have no idea about what I'm talking about :) but maybe an illustration or an animated gif could make your writings even more tasteful. Informations or pictures of this &quot;tensor calculus&quot; would be amazing! 

For instance, a &quot;hypercube&quot;. Shamefully I read a lot about it and didn't get it at all. But an simple animation of a 4 dimensional cube rotation make it possible to read about it again with a better understanding and then the impossible, to assimilate it and make it understandable in the naive mind.

Thank you!</text>

'''Creativity''' is the ability to generate innovative [[ideas]] and manifest them from [[thought]] into [[reality]]. The process involves original thinking and then producing.

The process of [[creation]] was historically reserved for [[deity|deities]] creating &quot;from nothing&quot; in [[Creationism]] and other [[creation myths]]. Over time, the term '''creativity''' came to include human [[innovation]], especially in [[art]] and [[science]] and led to the emergence of the [[creative class]].

==Etymology==
Creativity comes from the [[Latin]] term ''creō&quot;, &quot;to create, make&quot;. The ways in which societies have perceived the [[concept]] of creativity have changed throughout history, as has the term itself. Originally in the [[Christianity|Christian]] period: ''creatio''&quot; came to designate God's act of ''[[Ex nihilo]]'', &quot;creation from nothing&quot;. &quot;&quot;Creatio''&quot; thus had a different meaning than &quot;''facere''&quot; (&quot;to make&quot;) and did not apply to human activities. The ancient view that art is not a domain of creativity persisted during this period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tatarkiewicz80&quot;&gt;(Tatarkiewicz, 1980)&lt;/ref&gt;

===History of the term and the concept===
A shift occurred in modern times. [[Renaissance]] men developed a sense of their own independence, freedom, and creativity, and sought to give voice to this sense. The first to actually apply the word, &quot;creativity&quot;, was the Polish poet [[Maciej Kazimierz Sarbiewski]], who applied it exclusively to poetry. For more than a century and a half, the idea of ''human'' creativity met with resistance because of the fact that the term &quot;creation&quot; was reserved for creation &quot;from nothing&quot;. [[Baltasar Gracián]] (1601–58) only would venture to write: &quot;Art is the completion of nature, as if it were ''a second Creator''...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, pp. 247–48.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ancient Greek concept of [[art]] (in Greek, τέχνη, ''téchnē''—the root of &quot;technique&quot; and &quot;technology&quot;), with the exception of [[poetry]], involved not freedom of action but subjection to ''rules''. In [[ancient Rome|Rome]], this Greek concept was partly shaken, and [[visual art]]ists were viewed as sharing, with poets, [[imagination]] and [[artistic inspiration|inspiration]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz|Tatarkiewicz]], pp. 244–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although neither the Greek nor the Roman language had a word that directly corresponded to the word, &quot;creativity&quot;, Greco-Roman art, architecture, music, inventions, and discoveries provide numerous examples of what today would be described as creative works. The Greek scientist of [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]], [[Archimedes]], experienced the creative moment in his [[Eureka (word)|Eureka]] experience, finding the answer to a problem he had been wrestling with for a long time. At the time, the concept of an external creative &quot;[[daemon]]&quot; (Greek) or &quot;[[genius]]&quot; (Latin), linked to the sacred or the divine, probably came closest to describing the creative talents that brought forth such works.&lt;ref name=&quot;Albert99&quot;&gt;(Albert &amp; Runco, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 18th century and the [[Age of Enlightenment]], the concept of creativity was appearing more often in art theory, and had been linked with the concept of [[imagination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tatarkiewicz80&quot;/&gt;

The Western view of creativity can be contrasted with the Eastern view. For [[Hinduism|Hindus]], [[Confucianist]]s, [[Taoist]]s and [[Buddhist]]s, creation was at most a kind of discovery or mimicry, and the idea of creation &quot;from nothing&quot; had no place in these philosophies and religions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Albert99&quot;/&gt;

In the West, by the 19th century not only had art come to be regarded as creative, but ''it alone'' was so regarded. When later, at the turn of the 20th century, there began to be discussion of creativity in the sciences (e.g., [[Jan Łukasiewicz]], 1878–1956) and in nature (e.g., [[Henri Bergson]]), this was taken generally as the transference to the sciences of concepts that were proper to art.&lt;ref name= &quot;Tatarkiewicz80&quot;/&gt;

==Creative process==
In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, leading mathematicians and scientists such as [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] (1896) and [[Henri Poincaré]] (1908) began to reflect on and publicly discuss their creative processes, and these insights were built on in early accounts of the creative process by pioneering theorists such as [[Graham Wallas]] (1926) and [[Max Wertheimer]] (1945).

However,the formal starting point to the scientific study of creativity, from the standpoint of orthodox [[psychological]] literature, is generally considered to have been [[J.P. Guilford]]'s 1950 address to the [[American Psychological Association]], which helped popularize the topic&lt;ref name=&quot;Sternberg99&quot;&gt;(Sternberg, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; and focus attention on a scientific approach to conceptualizing creativity and measuring it [[psychometric]]ally.

In parallel with these developments, other investigators have taken a more pragmatic approach, teaching practical [[creativity techniques]]. Three of the best-known are:
* [[Alex Osborn]]'s &quot;[[brainstorming]]&quot; (1950s to present),
* [[Genrikh Altshuller]]'s Theory of Inventive Problem Solving ([[TRIZ]], 1950s to present),
* and [[Edward de Bono]]'s &quot;[[lateral thinking]]&quot; (1960s to present).

==Creative thought==
Creative thought is a mental process involving [[creative problem solving]] and the discovery of new [[idea]]s or [[concept]]s, or new associations of the existing ideas or concepts, fueled by the process of either conscious or unconscious [[insight]].

From a scientific point of view, the products of creative thought (sometimes referred to as [[convergent and divergent production|divergent thought]]) are usually considered to have both originality ''and'' appropriateness.

Although intuitively a simple phenomenon, it is in fact quite complex. It has been studied from the perspectives of [[behavioral psychology]], [[social psychology]], [[psychometrics]], [[cognitive science]], [[artificial intelligence]], [[philosophy]], [[aesthetics]], [[history]], [[economics]], [[design research]], [[business]], and [[management]], among others. The studies have covered everyday creativity, exceptional creativity and even [[artificial creativity]]. Unlike many phenomena in science, there is no single, authoritative perspective or definition of creativity. And unlike many phenomena in psychology, there is no standardized measurement technique.

Creativity has been attributed variously to [[miracle|divine intervention]], [[cognitive]] processes, the [[social]] environment, [[trait theory|personality traits]], and [[randomness|chance]] (&quot;accident&quot;, &quot;[[serendipity]]&quot;). It has been associated with [[genius]], [[mental illness]], [[humor]] and [[REM sleep]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Cai&quot;/&gt; Some say it is a [[trait (biological)|trait]] we are born with; others say it can be taught with the application of [[creativity techniques|simple techniques]]. Creativity has also been viewed as a beneficence of a muse or [[muse]]s.

Although popularly associated with [[art]] and [[literature]], it is also an essential part of [[innovation]] and [[invention]] and is important in professions such as [[business]], [[economics]], [[architecture]], [[industrial design]], [[graphic design]], [[advertising]], [[game design]], [[mathematics]], [[music]], [[science]] and [[engineering]], and teaching.

Despite, or perhaps because of, the ambiguity and multi-dimensional nature of creativity, entire [[creative industries|industries]] have been spawned from the pursuit of creative ideas and the development of [[creativity techniques]].

[[File:Leonardo da Vinci helicopter and lifting wing.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Leonardo da Vinci]] is well known for his creative works.]]
Creativity has been associated with [[right brain|right or forehead brain activity]] or even specifically with [[lateral thinking]].

Some students of creativity have emphasized an element of [[randomness|chance]] in the creative process. [[Linus Pauling]], asked at a public lecture how one creates [[theory|scientific theories]], replied that one must endeavor to come up with ''many'' ideas, then discard the useless ones.

Another adequate definition of creativity, according to [[Otto Rank]], is that it is an &quot;assumptions-breaking process.&quot; Creative ideas are often generated when one discards preconceived assumptions and attempts a new approach or method that might seem to others unthinkable.

==Distinguishing between creativity and innovation==
It is often useful to explicitly distinguish between ''creativity'' and ''innovation''.

Creativity is typically used to refer to the act of producing new ideas, approaches or actions, while innovation is the process of both generating ''and applying'' such creative ideas in some specific context.

In the context of an organization, therefore, the term ''innovation'' is often used to refer to the entire process by which an organization generates creative new ideas and converts them into novel, useful and viable commercial products, services, and business practices, while the term ''creativity'' is reserved to apply specifically to the generation of novel ideas by individuals or groups, as a necessary step within the innovation process.

For example, Amabile et al. (1996) suggest that while [[innovation]] &quot;begins with creative ideas,&quot;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;...creativity by individuals and teams ''is a starting point for innovation''; the first is a necessary ''but not sufficient'' condition for the second.&quot;&lt;ref name='(Amabile et al., 1996 p. 1154-1155, emphasis added)'&gt;{{cite journal |author=Amabile, T.M., R. Conti, H. Coon, et al. |year=1996 |title=Assessing the work environment for creativity |journal=Academy of Management Review |volume=39 |issue=5 |pages=1154–1184 |doi=10.2307/256995 |url=http://jstor.org/stable/256995}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although the two words are novel, they go hand in hand. In order to be innovative, employees have to be creative to stay competitive.

==Creativity in psychology and cognitive science==
The study of the mental representations and processes underlying creative thought belongs to the domains of [[psychology]] and [[cognitive science]].

A [[psychodynamic]] approach to understanding creativity was proposed by [[Sigmund Freud]], who suggested that creativity arises as a result of frustrated desires for fame, fortune, and love, with the energy that was previously tied up in frustration and emotional tension in the neurosis being sublimated into creative activity. Freud later retracted this view.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

===Graham Wallas===
[[Graham Wallas]], in his work ''Art of Thought'', published in 1926, presented one of the first models of the creative process. In the Wallas stage model, creative insights and illuminations may be explained by a process consisting of 5 stages:
:(i) ''preparation'' (preparatory work on a problem that focuses the individual's mind on the problem and explores the problem's dimensions),
:(ii) ''incubation'' (where the problem is internalized into the unconscious mind and nothing appears externally to be happening),
:(iii) ''intimation'' (the creative person gets a &quot;feeling&quot; that a solution is on its way),
:(iv) ''illumination'' or insight (where the creative idea bursts forth from its [[preconscious]] processing into conscious awareness); and
:(v) ''verification'' (where the idea is consciously verified, elaborated, and then applied).

In numerous publications, Wallas' model is just treated as four stages, with &quot;intimation&quot; seen as a sub-stage. There has been some empirical research looking at whether, as the concept of &quot;incubation&quot; in Wallas' model implies, a period of interruption or rest from a problem may aid creative problem-solving. Ward&lt;ref&gt;(Ward, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; lists various hypotheses that have been advanced to explain why incubation may aid creative problem-solving, and notes how some empirical evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that incubation aids creative problem-solving in that it enables &quot;forgetting&quot; of misleading clues. Absence of incubation may lead the problem solver to become [[fixation (psychology)|fixated]] on inappropriate strategies of solving the problem.&lt;ref&gt;(Smith, 1981)&lt;/ref&gt; This work disputes the earlier hypothesis that creative solutions to problems arise mysteriously from the unconscious mind while the conscious mind is occupied on other tasks.&lt;ref&gt;(Anderson, 2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

Wallas considered creativity to be a legacy of the [[evolution]]ary process, which allowed humans to quickly adapt to rapidly changing environments. Simonton&lt;ref name=&quot;Simonton99&quot;&gt;(Simonton, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; provides an updated perspective on this view in his book, ''Origins of genius: Darwinian perspectives on creativity''.

===J.P. Guilford===
[[J.P. Guilford|Guilford]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Guildford67&quot;&gt;(Guilford, 1967)&lt;/ref&gt; performed important work in the field of creativity, drawing a distinction between [[convergent and divergent production]] (commonly renamed convergent and divergent thinking). Convergent thinking involves aiming for a single, correct solution to a problem, whereas divergent thinking involves creative generation of multiple answers to a set problem. Divergent thinking is sometimes used as a synonym for creativity in psychology literature. Other researchers have occasionally used the terms ''flexible'' thinking or [[fluid and crystallized intelligence|fluid intelligence]], which are roughly similar to (but not synonymous with) creativity.

===Arthur Koestler===
In ''[[The Act of Creation]]'', [[Arthur Koestler]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Koestler64&quot;&gt;(Koestler, 1964)&lt;/ref&gt; lists three types of creative individual - the ''Artist'', the ''Sage'' and the ''Jester''.

Believers in this trinity hold all three elements necessary in [[business]] and can identify them all in &quot;truly creative&quot; [[company (law)|companies]] as well. Koestler introduced the concept of ''bisociation''—that creativity arises as a result of the intersection of two quite different frames of reference.

===Geneplore model===
In 1992, Finke et al. proposed the &quot;Geneplore&quot; model, in which creativity takes place in two phases: a generative phase, where an individual constructs mental representations called preinventive structures, and an exploratory phase where those structures are used to come up with creative ideas. Weisberg&lt;ref&gt;(Weisberg, 1993)&lt;/ref&gt; argued, by contrast, that creativity only involves ordinary cognitive processes yielding extraordinary results.

===Conceptual blending===
In the '90s, various approaches in cognitive science that dealt with [[metaphor]], [[analogy]] and [[structure mapping]] have been converging, and a new integrative approach to the study of creativity in science, art and humor has emerged under the label [[conceptual blending]].

===Creativity and everyday imaginative thought===
In everyday thought, people often spontaneously imagine alternatives to reality when they think &quot;if only...&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Roese, N.J. &amp; Olson, J.M. (1995). ''What Might Have Been: The Social Psychology of Counterfactual Thinking''. Mahwah, New Jersey: Erlbaum&lt;/ref&gt; Their [[counterfactual thinking]] is viewed as an example of everyday creative processes.&lt;ref&gt;Markman, K. Klein, W. &amp; Suhr, E. (eds) (2009). ''Handbook of mental simulation and the human imagination.'' Hove, Psychology Press&lt;/ref&gt; It has been proposed that the creation of counterfactual alternatives to reality depends on similar cognitive processes to rational thought.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ruth M.J. Byrne|Byrne, R.M.J.]] (2005). The Rational Imagination: How People Create Counterfactual Alternatives to Reality. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychological examples from science and mathematics==

===Jacques Hadamard===
[[Jacques Hadamard]], in his book ''Psychology of Invention in the Mathematical Field'', uses [[introspection]] to describe mathematical thought processes. In contrast to authors who identify [[language]] and [[cognition]], he describes his own mathematical thinking as largely wordless, often accompanied by [[mental images]] that represent the entire solution to a problem. He surveyed 100 of the leading physicists of his day (ca. 1900), asking them how they did their work. Many of the responses mirrored his own.

Hadamard described the experiences of the [[mathematician]]s/[[theoretical physicist]]s [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]], [[Hermann von Helmholtz]], [[Henri Poincaré]] and others as viewing entire solutions with &quot;sudden spontaneity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hadamard, 1954, pp. 13-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

The same has been reported in literature by many others, such as Denis Brian,&lt;ref name=&quot;Brian, 1996, p. 159&quot;&gt;Brian, 1996, p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt; [[G.H. Hardy]],&lt;ref&gt;G.H. Hardy cited how the mathematician [[Srinivasa Ramanujan]] had &quot;moments of sudden illumination.&quot; See Kanigel, 1992, pp. 285-286.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Walter Heitler]],&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Walter Heitler by John Heilbron (March 18, 1963. Archives for the History of Quantum Physics), as cited in and quoted from in Gavroglu, Kostas ''[[Fritz London]]: A Scientific Biography'' p. 45 (Cambridge, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; [[B.L. van der Waerden]],&lt;ref&gt;von Franz, 1992, p. 297 and 314. Cited work: B.L. van der Waerden, ''Einfall und Überlegung: Drei kleine Beiträge zur Psychologie des mathematischen Denkens'' (Gasel &amp; Stuttgart, 1954).&lt;/ref&gt; and Harold Ruegg.&lt;ref&gt;von Franz, 1992, p. 297 and 314. Cited work: Harold Ruegg, ''Imagination: An Inquiry into the Sources and Conditions That Stimulate Creativity'' (New York: Harper, 1954).&lt;/ref&gt;

To elaborate on one example, [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]], after years of fruitless calculations, suddenly had the solution to the general theory of relativity revealed in a dream &quot;like a giant die making an indelible impress, a huge map of the universe outlined itself in one clear vision.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Brian, 1996, p. 159&quot;/&gt;

Hadamard described the process as having steps (i) preparation, (ii) incubation, (iv) illumination, and (v) verification of the five-step [[Graham Wallas]] creative-process model, leaving out (iii) intimation, with the first three cited by Hadamard as also having been put forth by Helmholtz:&lt;ref&gt;Hadamard, 1954, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marie-Louise von Franz===
[[Marie-Louise von Franz]], a colleague of the eminent psychiatrist [[Carl Jung]], noted that in these unconscious scientific discoveries the &quot;always recurring and important factor ... is the simultaneity with which the complete solution is intuitively perceived and which can be checked later by discursive reasoning.&quot; She attributes the solution presented &quot;as an [[archetypal]] pattern or image.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;von Franz, 1992, pp. 297-298.&lt;/ref&gt; As cited by von Franz,&lt;ref&gt;von Franz, 1992 297-298 and 314.&lt;/ref&gt; according to Jung, &quot;Archetypes ... manifest themselves only through their ability to ''organize'' images and ideas, and this is always an unconscious process which cannot be detected until afterwards.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Jung, 1981, paragraph 440, p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creativity and affect==
Some theories suggest that creativity may be particularly susceptible to affective influence.

===Creativity and positive affect relations===
According to Isen, positive affect has three primary effects on cognitive activity:
# Positive affect makes additional cognitive material available for processing, increasing the number of cognitive elements available for association;
# Positive affect leads to defocused attention and a more complex cognitive context, increasing the breadth of those elements that are treated as relevant to the problem;
# Positive affect increases cognitive flexibility, increasing the probability that diverse cognitive elements will in fact become associated. Together, these processes lead positive affect to have a positive influence on creativity.

Fredrickson in her [[Broaden and Build Model]] suggests that positive emotions such as joy and love broaden a person's available repertoire of cognitions and actions, thus enhancing creativity.

According to these researchers, positive emotions increase the number of cognitive elements available for association (attention scope) and the number of elements that are relevant to the problem (cognitive scope).

===Creativity and negative affect relations===
On the other hand, some theorists have suggested that negative affect leads to greater creativity. A cornerstone of this perspective is empirical evidence of a relationship between affective illness and creativity. In a study of 1,005 prominent 20th century individuals from over 45 different professions, the University of Kentucky's Arnold Ludwig found a slight but significant correlation between [[major depressive disorder|depression]] and level of creative achievement. In addition, several systematic studies of highly creative individuals and their relatives have uncovered a higher incidence of affective disorders (primarily [[bipolar disorder]] and depression) than that found in the general population.

===Creativity and affect at work===
Three patterns may exist between affect and creativity at work: positive (or negative) mood, or change in mood, predictably precedes creativity; creativity predictably precedes mood; and whether affect and creativity occur simultaneously.

It was found that not only might affect precede creativity, but creative outcomes might provoke affect as well. At its simplest level, the experience of creativity is itself a work event, and like other events in the organizational context, it could evoke emotion. Qualitative research and anecdotal accounts of creative achievement in the arts and sciences suggest that creative insight is often followed by feelings of elation. For example, Albert Einstein called his 1907 general theory of relativity &quot;the happiest thought of my life.&quot; Empirical evidence on this matter is still very tentative.

In contrast to the possible [[incubation (psychology)|incubation]] effects of affective state on subsequent creativity, the affective consequences of creativity are likely to be more direct and immediate. In general, affective events provoke immediate and relatively-fleeting emotional reactions. Thus, if creative performance at work is an affective event for the individual doing the creative work, such an effect would likely be evident only in same-day data.

Another longitudinal research found several insights regarding the relations between creativity and emotion at work. First, a positive relationship between positive affect and creativity, and no evidence of a negative relationship. The more positive a person's affect on a given day, the more creative thinking they evidenced that day and the next day—even controlling for that next day's mood. There was even some evidence of an effect two days later.

In addition, the researchers found no evidence that people were more creative when they experienced both positive and negative affect on the same day. The weight of evidence supports a purely linear form of the affect-creativity relationship, at least over the range of affect and creativity covered in our study: the more positive a person's affect, the higher their creativity in a work setting.

Finally, they found four patterns of affect and creativity affect can operate as an antecedent to creativity; as a direct consequence of creativity; as an indirect consequence of creativity; and affect can occur simultaneously with creative activity. Thus, it appears that people's feelings and creative cognitions are interwoven in several distinct ways within the complex fabric of their daily work lives.

==Creativity and intelligence==
{{Cerebrum map|Cerebral Cortex|caption=The [[frontal lobe]] (shown in blue) is thought to play an important role in creativity}}
There has been debate in the psychological literature about whether [[intelligence]] and creativity are part of the same process (the conjoint hypothesis) or represent distinct mental processes (the disjoint hypothesis). Evidence from attempts to look at correlations between intelligence and creativity from the 1950s onwards, by authors such as Barron, Guilford or Wallach and Kogan, regularly suggested that correlations between these concepts were low enough to justify treating them as distinct concepts.

Some researchers believe that creativity is the outcome of the same cognitive processes as intelligence, and is only judged as creativity in terms of its consequences, i.e. when the outcome of cognitive processes happens to produce something novel, a view which Perkins has termed the &quot;nothing special&quot; hypothesis.&lt;ref name=&quot;OHara99&quot;&gt;(O'Hara &amp; Sternberg, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

A very popular model is what has come to be known as &quot;the threshold hypothesis,&quot; proposed by [[Ellis Paul Torrance]], which holds that a high degree of intelligence appears to be a [[necessary and sufficient conditions|necessary but not sufficient condition]] for high creativity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guildford67&quot;/&gt; This implies that, in a general sample, there will be a positive [[correlation]] between creativity and intelligence, but this correlation will not be found if only a sample of the most highly intelligent people are assessed. Research into the threshold hypothesis, however, has produced mixed results ranging from enthusiastic support to refutation and rejection.&lt;ref&gt;(Plucker &amp; Renzulli, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative perspective, Renzulli's three-rings hypothesis, sees giftedness as based on both intelligence and creativity. More on both the threshold hypothesis and Renzulli's work can be found in O'Hara and Sternberg.&lt;ref name=&quot;OHara99&quot;/&gt;

==Neurobiology of creativity==
The [[neurobiology]] of creativity has been addressed&lt;ref name=&quot;NeuroPsychiatry&quot;&gt;[http://neurology.med.ohio-state.edu/cognitivelab/CreativityMechanisms.pdf (Kenneth M Heilman, MD, Stephen E. Nadeau, MD, and David Q. Beversdorf, MD. &quot;Creative Innovation: Possible Brain Mechanisms&quot; Neurocase (2003)]&lt;/ref&gt; in the article &quot;Creative Innovation: Possible Brain Mechanisms.&quot; The authors write that &quot;creative innovation might require coactivation and communication between regions of the brain that ordinarily are not strongly connected.&quot; Highly creative people who excel at creative innovation tend to differ from others in three ways:
* they have a high level of specialized knowledge,
* they are capable of [[convergent and divergent production|divergent thinking]] mediated by the [[frontal lobe]].
* and they are able to modulate [[neurotransmitters]] such as [[norepinephrine]] in their frontal lobe.

Thus, the frontal lobe appears to be the part of the [[cerebral cortex|cortex]] that is most important for creativity.

This article also explored the links between creativity and sleep, [[mood disorder|mood]] and [[substance dependence|addiction disorders]], and [[depression (mood)|depression]].

In 2005, Alice Flaherty presented a three-factor model of the creative drive. Drawing from evidence in brain imaging, drug studies and lesion analysis, she described the creative drive as resulting from an interaction of the frontal lobes, the [[temporal lobe]]s, and [[dopamine]] from the [[limbic system]]. The frontal lobes can be seen as responsible for idea generation, and the temporal lobes for idea editing and evaluation. Abnormalities in the frontal lobe (such as depression or anxiety) generally decrease creativity, while abnormalities in the temporal lobe often increase creativity. High activity in the temporal lobe typically inhibits activity in the frontal lobe, and vice versa. High dopamine levels increase general [[arousal]] and goal directed behaviors and reduce [[latent inhibition]], and all three effects increase the drive to generate ideas.&lt;ref&gt;(Flaherty, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Working memory and the cerebellum===
Vandervert&lt;ref&gt;Vandervert 2003a, 2003b; Vandervert, Schimpf &amp; Liu, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; described how the brain's frontal lobes and the cognitive functions of the [[cerebellum]] collaborate to produce creativity and innovation. Vandervert's explanation rests on considerable evidence that all processes of [[working memory]] (responsible for processing all thought&lt;ref&gt;Miyake &amp; Shah, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;) are adaptively modeled by the cerebellum.&lt;ref&gt;Schmahmann, 1997, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The cerebellum (consisting of 100 billion neurons, which is more than the entirety of the rest of the brain&lt;ref&gt;Andersen, Korbo &amp; Pakkenberg, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;) is also widely known to adaptively model all bodily movement. The cerebellum's adaptive models of working memory processing are then fed back to especially frontal lobe working memory control processes&lt;ref&gt;Miller &amp; Cohen, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; where creative and innovative thoughts arise.&lt;ref&gt;Vandervert, 2003a&lt;/ref&gt; (Apparently, creative insight or the &quot;aha&quot; experience is then triggered in the temporal lobe.&lt;ref&gt;Jung-Beeman, Bowden, Haberman, Frymiare, Arambel-Liu, Greenblatt, Reber &amp; Kounios, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;) According to Vandervert, the details of creative adaptation begin in &quot;forward&quot; cerebellar models which are anticipatory/exploratory controls for movement and thought. These cerebellar processing and control architectures have been termed Hierarchical Modular Selection and Identification for Control (HMOSAIC).&lt;ref&gt;Imamizu, Kuroda, Miyauchi, Yoshioka &amp; Kawato, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; New, hierarchically arranged levels of the cerebellar control architecture (HMOSAIC) develop as mental mulling in working memory is extended over time. These new levels of the control architecture are fed forward to the frontal lobes. Since the cerebellum adaptively models all movement and all levels of thought and emotion,&lt;ref&gt;Schmahmann, 2004,&lt;/ref&gt; Vandervert's approach helps explain creativity and innovation in sports, art, music, the design of video games, technology, mathematics, the [[child prodigy]], and thought in general.

===REM sleep===
Creativity involves the forming of associative elements into new combinations that are useful or meet some requirement. Sleep aids this process.&lt;ref&gt;Wagner U., Gais S., Haider H., Verleger R., Born J. (2004). Sleep inspires insight. Nature. 427(6972):352-5. PMID 14737168&lt;/ref&gt; [[REM sleep|REM]] rather than [[NREM sleep]] appears to be responsible.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cai&quot;&gt;Cai D.J., Mednick S.A., Harrison E.M., Kanady J.C., Mednick S.C. (2009). REM, not incubation, improves creativity by priming associative networks. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 106: 10130–10134. PMID 19506253&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Walker M.P., Liston C., Hobson J.A., Stickgold R. (2002). Cognitive flexibility across the sleep-wake cycle: REM-sleep enhancement of anagram problem solving. Brain Res Cogn Brain Res. 14(3):317-24. PMID 12421655&lt;/ref&gt; This has been suggested to be due to changes in [[cholinergic]] and [[noradrenergic]] neuromodulation that occurs during REM sleep.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cai&quot;/&gt; During this period of sleep, high levels of acetylcholine in the [[hippocampus]] suppress feedback from the hippocampus to the [[neocortex]], and lower levels of acetylcholine and norepinephrine in the neocortex encourage the spread of associational activity within neocortical areas without control from the hippocampus.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Hasselmo|Hasselmo M.E]]. (1999). Neuromodulation: acetylcholine and memory consolidation. Trends Cogn Sci. 3(9):351-359. PMID 10461198&lt;/ref&gt; This is in contrast to waking consciousness, where higher levels of norepinephrine and acetylcholine inhibit recurrent connections in the neocortex. It is proposed that REM sleep would add creativity by allowing &quot;neocortical structures to reorganize associative hierarchies, in which information from the hippocampus would be reinterpreted in relation to previous semantic representations or nodes.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cai&quot;/&gt;

==Creativity and mental health==
{{Main|Creativity and mental illness}}
A study by psychologist [[J. Philippe Rushton]] found creativity to correlate with [[intelligence (trait)|intelligence]] and [[psychoticism]].&lt;ref&gt;(Rushton, 1990)&lt;/ref&gt; Another study found creativity to be greater in [[schizotypal]] than in either normal or [[schizophrenic]] individuals. While divergent thinking was associated with bilateral activation of the [[prefrontal cortex]], schizotypal individuals were found to have much greater activation of their ''right'' prefrontal cortex.&lt;ref&gt;http://exploration.vanderbilt.edu/news/news_schizotypes.htm ([http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.schres.2005.06.016 Actual paper])&lt;/ref&gt; This study hypothesizes that such individuals are better at accessing both hemispheres, allowing them to make novel associations at a faster rate. In agreement with this hypothesis, [[ambidexterity]] is also associated with [[schizotypal]] and [[schizophrenic]] individuals.

Particularly strong links have been identified between creativity and [[mood disorder]]s, particularly [[manic-depressive disorder]] (a.k.a. [[bipolar disorder]]) and [[depressive disorder]] (a.k.a. [[unipolar disorder]]). In ''Touched with Fire: Manic-Depressive Illness and the Artistic Temperament'', [[Kay Redfield Jamison]] summarizes studies of mood-disorder rates in '''[[writers]]''', '''[[poets]]''' and '''[[artists]]'''. She also explores research that identifies [[mood disorder]]s in such famous writers and artists as [[Ernest Hemingway]] (who shot himself after [[electroconvulsive treatment]]), [[Virginia Woolf]] (who drowned herself when she felt a depressive episode coming on), composer [[Robert Schumann]] (who died in a mental institution), and even the famed [[visual artist]] [[Michelangelo]].

==Measuring creativity==

===Creativity quotient===
Several attempts have been made to develop a ''creativity quotient'' of an individual similar to the [[intelligence quotient]] (IQ), however these have been unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;(Kraft, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; Most measures of creativity are dependent on the personal judgement of the tester, so a standardized measure is difficult, if not impossible, to develop.

===Psychometric approach===
[[J.P. Guilford]]'s group,&lt;ref name=&quot;Guildford67&quot;/&gt; which pioneered the modern [[psychometric]] study of creativity, constructed several tests to measure creativity in 1967:
* Plot Titles, where participants are given the plot of a story and asked to write original titles.
* Quick Responses is a word-association test scored for uncommonness.
* Figure Concepts, where participants were given simple drawings of objects and individuals and asked to find qualities or features that are common by two or more drawings; these were scored for uncommonness.
* Unusual Uses is finding unusual uses for common everyday objects such as bricks.
* Remote Associations, where participants are asked to find a word between two given words (e.g. Hand _____ Call)
* Remote Consequences, where participants are asked to generate a list of consequences of unexpected events (e.g. loss of gravity)

Building on Guilford's work, [[Ellis Paul Torrance|Torrance]]&lt;ref&gt;(Torrance, 1974)&lt;/ref&gt; developed the [[Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking]] in 1966. They involved simple tests of divergent thinking and other problem-solving skills, which were scored on:
* '''Fluency''' – The total number of interpretable, meaningful, and relevant ideas generated in response to the stimulus.
* '''Originality''' – The statistical rarity of the responses among the test subjects.
* '''Elaboration''' – The amount of detail in the responses.

The [[Creativity Achievement Questionnaire]], a self-report test that measures creative achievement across 10 domains, was described in 2005 and shown to be reliable and valid when compared to other measures of creativity and to independent evaluation of creative output.&lt;ref&gt;(Carson, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; The psychometric approach has been criticized by [[Robert Sternberg]] for falling &quot;short of distinguishing imagination from fantasy, relevant from irrelevant material, and contextually valid from rambling associations&quot;.

===Social-personality approach===
Some researchers have taken a social-personality approach to the measurement of creativity. In these studies, personality traits such as independence of judgement, self-confidence, attraction to complexity, aesthetic orientation and risk-taking are used as measures of the creativity of individuals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sternberg99&quot;/&gt; Other researchers&lt;ref&gt;for example McCrae (1987)&lt;/ref&gt; have related creativity to the [[Big Five personality traits|trait]], ''openness to experience''.

===Other approaches to measurement===
[[Genrich Altshuller]] in the 1950s introduced approaching creativity as an ''exact science'' with [[TRIZ]] and a [[Level of Invention|Level-of-Invention]] measure.

The creativity of thousands of Japanese, expressed in terms of their problem-solving and problem-recognizing capabilities, has been measured in Japanese firms.&lt;ref&gt;Info: http://iccincsm.at.infoseek.co.jp&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Howard Gruber]] insisted on a case-study approach that expresses the existential and unique quality of the creator. Creativity to Gruber was the product of purposeful work and this work could be described only as a confluence of forces in the specifics of the case.

==Creativity in various contexts==
Creativity has been studied from a variety of perspectives and is important in numerous contexts. Most of these approaches are undisciplinary, and it is therefore difficult to form a coherent overall view.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sternberg99&quot;/&gt; The following sections examine some of the areas in which creativity is seen as being important.

===Creativity Profiles===
Creativity comes in different forms. There are kinds to produce growth, innovation, speed, etc. There are four &quot;Creativity Profiles&quot; that can help achieve such goals.&lt;ref&gt;(DeGraff, Lawrence 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;
:(i) ''Incubate'' (Long-term Development)
:(ii) ''Imagine'' (Breakthrough Ideas)
:(iii) ''Improve'' (Incremental Adjustments)
:(iv) ''Invest'' (Short-term Goals)

===Creativity in diverse cultures===
Francois Jullien in &quot;Process and Creation, 1989&quot; is inviting us to look at that concept from a Chinese cultural point of view. Fangqi Xu&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cct.umb.edu/fangqi.pdf [[Fangqi Xu]], et al. ''A Survey of Creativity Courses at Universities in Principal Countries'']&lt;/ref&gt; has reported creativity courses in a range of countries. Todd Lubart has studied extensively the cultural aspects of creativity and innovation.

===Creativity in art and literature===
[[Image:HenryMoore RecliningFigure 1951.jpg|thumb|300px|left|[[Henry Moore]]'s ''Reclining Figure'']]
Most people associate creativity with the fields of [[art]] and [[literature]]. In these fields, ''originality'' is considered to be a sufficient condition for creativity, unlike other fields where both ''originality'' and ''appropriateness'' are necessary.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amabile98&quot;&gt;(Amabile, 1998; Sullivan and Harper, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the different modes of artistic expression, one can postulate a continuum extending from &quot;[[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]]&quot; to &quot;innovation&quot;. Established [[art movements|artistic movements]] and [[genre]]s pull practitioners to the &quot;interpretation&quot; end of the scale, whereas original thinkers strive towards the &quot;innovation&quot; pole. Note that we conventionally expect some &quot;creative&quot; people (dancers, actors, orchestral members, etc.) to perform (interpret) while allowing others (writers, painters, composers, etc.) more freedom to express the new and the different.

Contrast alternative theories, for example:
* [[artistic inspiration]], which provides the transmission of [[vision (religion)|visions]] from divine sources such as the [[Muse]]s; a taste of the Divine. Compare with [[invention]].
* artistic [[evolution]], which stresses obeying established (&quot;classical&quot;) rules and imitating or [[appropriation (art)|appropriating]] to produce subtly different but unshockingly understandable work. Compare with [[crafts]].
* artistic conversation, as in [[Surrealism]], which stresses the depth of communication when the creative product is the language.

In the [[art]] practice and [[theory]] of [[Davor Dzalto]], human creativity is taken as a basic feature of both the personal [[existence]] of [[human being]] and [[art]] production. For this thinker, creativity is a basic cultural and anthropological category, since it enables human manifestation in the world as a &quot;real presence&quot; in contrast to the progressive &quot;virtualization&quot; of the world.

===Creative industries and services===
Today, creativity forms the core activity of a growing section of the [[world economy|global economy]]—the so-called &quot;[[creative industries]]&quot;—capitalistically generating (generally non-tangible) [[wealth]] through the creation and [[exploitation]] of [[intellectual property]] or through the provision of [[creative services]]. The [http://www.culture.gov.uk/global/publications/archive_2001/ci_mapping_doc_2001.htm Creative Industries Mapping Document 2001] provides an overview of the creative industries in the UK. The [[creative professional]] workforce is becoming a more integral part of industrialized nations' economies.

Creative professions include writing, art, design, theater, television, radio, motion pictures, related crafts, as well as marketing, strategy, some aspects of scientific research and development, product development, some types of teaching and curriculum design, and more. Since many creative professionals (actors and writers, for example) are also employed in secondary professions, estimates of creative professionals are often inaccurate. By some estimates, approximately 10 million US workers are creative professionals; depending upon the depth and breadth of the definition, this estimate may be double.

===Creativity in other professions===
[[Image:NewtonsPrincipia.jpg|thumb|175px|right|[[Isaac Newton]]'s [[law of gravity]] is popularly attributed to a ''creative leap'' he experienced when observing a falling apple.]]
Creativity is also seen as being increasingly important in a variety of other professions. [[Architecture]] and [[industrial design]] are the fields most often associated with creativity, and more generally the fields of [[design]] and [[design research]]. These fields explicitly value creativity, and journals such as ''Design Studies'' have published many studies on creativity and creative problem solving.&lt;ref&gt;for a typical example see (Dorst et al., 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

Fields such as [[science]] and [[engineering]] have, by contrast, experienced a less explicit (but arguably no less important) relation to creativity. Simonton&lt;ref name=&quot;Simonton99&quot;/&gt; shows how some of the major scientific advances of the 20th century can be attributed to the creativity of individuals. This ability will also be seen as increasingly important for engineers in years to come.&lt;ref&gt;(National Academy of Engineering 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

Accounting has also been associated with creativity with the popular euphemism ''[[creative accounting]]''. Although this term often implies unethical practices, Amabile&lt;ref name=&quot;Amabile98&quot;/&gt; has suggested that even this profession can benefit from the (ethical) application of creative thinking.

===Creativity in organizations===
Amabile&lt;ref name=&quot;Amabile98&quot;/&gt; argued that to enhance creativity in business, three components were needed:
* Expertise (technical, procedural and intellectual knowledge),
* Creative thinking skills (how flexibly and imaginatively people approach problems),
* and Motivation (especially [[intrinsic motivation]]).

There are two types of motivation:
* [[extrinsic motivation]] – [[external]] factors, for example [[threat]]s of being fired or money as a [[reward]],
* [[intrinsic motivation]] – comes from inside an individual, satisfaction, enjoyment of work etc.

Six managerial practices to encourage motivation are:
* Challenge – matching people with the right [[assignment]]s;
* Freedom – giving people [[autonomy]] choosing means to achieve goals;
* [[Resource]]s – such as time, money, space etc. There must be balance fit among resources and people;
* Work group features – [[diverse]], supportive teams, where members share the excitement, willingness to help and recognize each other's talents;
* [[Supervisory]] encouragement – recognitions, cheering, praising;
* Organizational support – value emphasis, information sharing, [[collaboration]].

Nonaka, who examined several successful Japanese companies, similarly saw creativity and knowledge creation as being important to the success of organizations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nonaka91&quot;&gt;(Nonaka, 1991)&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, he emphasized the role that [[tacit knowledge]] has to play in the creative process.

In business, [[originality]] is not enough. The idea must also be appropriate—useful and [[actionable]].&lt;ref&gt;Amabile, T.M. (1998). &quot;How to kill creativity&quot;. Harvard Business Review&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic views of creativity===
In the early 20th century, [[Joseph Schumpeter]] introduced the economic theory of ''[[creative destruction]]'', to describe the way in which old ways of doing things are endogenously destroyed and replaced by the new.

Creativity is also seen by economists such as [[Paul Romer]] as an important element in the recombination of elements to produce new technologies and products and, consequently, economic growth. Creativity leads to [[capital (economics)|capital]], and creative products are protected by [[intellectual property]] laws.

The ''[[creative class]]'' is seen by some to be an important driver of modern economies. In his 2002 book, ''The Rise of the Creative Class'', [[economist]] [[Richard Florida]] popularized the notion that regions with &quot;3 T's of economic development: Technology, Talent and Tolerance&quot; also have high concentrations of [[creative professional]]s and tend to have a higher level of economic development.

==Fostering creativity==
{{Main|creativity techniques}}
Daniel Pink, in his 2005 book ''A Whole New Mind'', repeating arguments posed throughout the 20th century, argues that we are entering a new age where creativity is becoming increasingly important. In this ''conceptual age'', we will need to foster and encourage ''right-directed thinking'' (representing creativity and emotion) over ''left-directed thinking'' (representing logical, analytical thought).

Nickerson&lt;ref&gt;(Nickerson, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; provides a summary of the various creativity techniques that have been proposed. These include approaches that have been developed by both academia and industry:
# Establishing purpose and intention
# Building basic skills
# Encouraging acquisitions of domain-specific knowledge
# Stimulating and rewarding curiosity and exploration
# Building motivation, especially internal motivation
# Encouraging confidence and a willingness to take risks
# Focusing on mastery and self-competition
# Promoting supportable beliefs about creativity
# Providing opportunities for choice and discovery
# Developing self-management (metacognitive skills)
# Teaching techniques and strategies for facilitating creative performance
# Providing balance

Some see the conventional system of [[education|schooling]] as &quot;stifling&quot; of creativity and attempt (particularly in the [[pre-school]]/[[kindergarten]] and early school years) to provide a creativity-friendly, rich, imagination-fostering environment for young children. Compare [[Waldorf School]].

A growing number of psychologists are supporting the idea that there are methods of increasing the creativity of an individual. Several different researchers have proposed approaches to prop up this idea, ranging from [[psychological]]-cognitive, such as:
* Osborn-Parnes [[Creative Problem Solving Process]]
* [[Synectics]];
* Inventium and science-based creative thinking;
* Purdue Creative Thinking Program;

and
* [[lateral thinking]] (courtesy of [[Edward de Bono]]),

to the highly-structured, such as:
* [[TRIZ]] (the Theory of Inventive Problem-Solving);
* [[Algorithm of Inventive Problems Solving|ARIZ]] (the [[Algorithm of Inventive Problems Solving|Algorithm of Inventive Problem-Solving]]), both developed by the Russian scientist [[Genrich Altshuller]]; and

==Understanding and enhancing the creative process with new technologies==
A simple but accurate [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6WGR-4G65VJ1-1&amp;_user=10&amp;_coverDate=10%2F31%2F2005&amp;_alid=527112635&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=summary&amp;_orig=search&amp;_cdi=6829&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=3ad4369ed718542426a8f4ace61c7d8f review] on this new Human-Computer Interactions (HCI) angle for promoting creativity has been written by Todd Lubart, an invitation full of creative ideas to develop further this new field.

Groupware and other Computer Supported Collaborative Work (CSCW) platforms are now the stage of Network Creativity on the web or on other private networks. These tools have made more obvious the existence of a more connective, cooperative and collective nature of creativity rather than the prevailing individual one. [http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/l/Letaief:Rafik.html Creativity Research on Global Virtual Teams] is showing that the creative process is affected by the national identities, cognitive and conative profiles, anonymous interactions at times and many other factors affecting the teams members, depending on the early or later stages of the cooperative creative process. They are also showing how NGO's cross-cultural virtual team's innovation in Africa would also benefit from the pooling of best global practices online. Such tools enhancing cooperative creativity may have a great impact on society and as such should be tested while they are built following the Motto: &quot;Build the Camera while shooting the film&quot;. Some European FP7 scientific programs like [http://www.paradiso-fp7.eu/ Paradiso] are answering a need for advanced experimentally-driven research including large scale experimentation test-beds to discover the technical, societal, and economic implications of such groupware and collaborative tools to the Internet.

On the other hand, creativity research may one day be pooled with a computable metalanguage like [http://www.ieml.org IEML] from the University of Ottawa Collective Intelligence Chair, Pierre Levy. It might be a good tool to provide an interdisciplinary definition and a rather unified theory of creativity. The creative processes being highly fuzzy, the programming of cooperative tools for creativity and innovation should be adaptive and flexible. [http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs/research/em/publications/papers/091 Empirical Modelling] seems to be a good choice for Humanities Computing.

If all the activity of the universe could be traced with appropriate captors, it is likely that one could see the creative nature of the universe to which humans are active contributors. After the web of documents, the Web of Things might shed some light on such a universal creative phenomenon which should not be restricted to humans. In order to trace and enhance cooperative and collective creativity, Metis Reflexive Global Virtual Team has worked for the last few years on the development of a [http://www.iamot.org/conference/index.php/ocs/10/paper/view/1351/604 Trace Composer] at the intersection of personal experience and social knowledge.

Metis Reflexive Team has also identified a paradigm for the study of creativity to bridge European theory of &quot;useless&quot; and non-instrumentalized creativity, North American more pragmatic creativity and Chinese culture stressing more creativity as a holistic process of continuity rather than radical change and originality. This paradigm is mostly based on the work of the German philosopher Hans Joas, one that emphasizes the creative character of human action. This model allows also for a more comprehensive theory of action. Joas elaborates some implications of his model for theories of social movements and social change. The connection between concepts like creation, innovation, production and expression is facilitated by the [http://www.press.uchicago.edu/presssite/metadata.epl?mode=synopsis&amp;bookkey=45339 creativity of action] as a metaphore but also as a scientific concept.

The Creativity and Cognition conference series, sponsored by the ACM and running since 1993, has been an important venue for publishing research on the intersection between technology and creativity. The conference now runs biennially, next taking place in 2011.{{update after|2011|12|31}}

==Social attitudes to creativity==
Although the benefits of creativity to society as a whole have been noted,&lt;ref&gt;(Runco 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; social attitudes about this topic remain divided. The wealth of literature regarding the development of creativity&lt;ref&gt;see (Feldman, 1999) for example&lt;/ref&gt; and the profusion of [[creativity techniques]] indicate wide acceptance, at least among academics, that creativity is desirable.

There is, however, a dark side to creativity, in that it represents a ''&quot;quest for a radical autonomy apart from the constraints of social responsibility&quot;''.&lt;ref&gt;(McLaren, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, by encouraging creativity we are encouraging a departure from society's existing norms and values. Expectation of conformity runs contrary to the spirit of creativity. Sir Ken Robinson argues that the current education system is &quot;educating people out of their creativity&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cod5az5EcX0&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mddD1yGREKQ&amp;feature=related&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, employers are increasingly valuing creative skills. A report by the Business Council of Australia, for example, has called for a higher level of creativity in graduates.&lt;ref&gt;(BCA, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; The ability to &quot;[[think outside the box]]&quot; is highly sought after. However, the above-mentioned paradox may well imply that firms pay lip service to thinking outside the box while maintaining traditional, hierarchical organization structures in which individual creativity is not rewarded.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Sudoku are logic puzzles in which an array of boxes, each an array of numbers or other unique symbols, has been designed, so that each row and column in the overall array contains the complete list of allowed symbols, and each box also contains that same complete list.

The original and most common Sudoku consists of a 9 x 9 grid of cells, divided into nine 3 x 3 boxes, and the unique symbols are the numbers from one to nine. However, this is not a mathematical puzzle, and letters or other symbols could be used.

In the puzzle as presented, symbols are missing, and the object of the game is to find the unique pattern of symbols that satisfies the conditions, using logic. A presented puzzle with more than one possible solution would usually be considered defective.

#[[/4 by 4/]] (4 boxes of 4 cells, 2 x 2 each)
#[[/6 by 6/]] (6 boxes of 6 cells, 2 x 3 each)
#[[/9 by 9/]] (9 boxes of 9 cells, 3 x 3 each)
#[[/Sudoku X/]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">Books of Sudoku puzzles are very common, and typically categorize the Sudoku into Easy, Difficult, and Very Difficult. There is no clear standard for classification, and the Very Difficult puzzles of some books can be solved by relatively elementary techniques. However, all Sudoku require that the solver make no mistakes, or the puzzle becomes a mess and can be difficult to clean up.

The instructions found in these books all point out that one should never simply guess, except with very difficult Sudoku where one may choose one of two options, to solve by some variation of [[w:Ariadne's thread|Ariadne's thread]].

One approach to solving Sudoku is given at [[/Approach to solutions/]].

The following is an example of a relatively easy or moderate 9 x 9 Sudoku.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Temperature and Thermal Equilibrium ==

Seems appropriate start talking about thermodynamics defining the concept of '''Temperature''', however we should first note some intuitive notions from everyday life.

First of all, humans have awareness of temperature; we can sense cold and hot things, and we historically set a numerical value to that sensation (we'll see later how).

Then, we have to look at how evolve temperature. Let say that we have two litres of water separated and at different temperatures, say &lt;math&gt;T_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;T_2&lt;/math&gt;. When we mix them, together they will get to a new temperature, &lt;math&gt;T_3&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;T_1&lt;T_3&lt;T_2&lt;/math&gt;. So, we can say that the evolution of temperature have a direction towards equality. Note that although is not always this way, we are saying that a whole body have a temperature, so the two litres together are a perfect mix between the two litres separated.

We don't need to mix bodies to have equality of temperatures; experience tell us that bodies touching each other tend to equalize. So, we can say that two bodies are at the same temperatures when they don't change temperature if touching each other. It may seem obvious, but it's worth to put it that way. We are talking here of '''Thermal Equilibrium'''.

== Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics ==

As a direct consequence of the definition of thermal equality, is that temperature measure is ''transitive''; so, if we have three bodies, A,B and C, such that
:&lt;math&gt;T(A)=T(B)&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;T(B)=T(C)&lt;/math&gt;
then
:&lt;math&gt;T(A)=T(C)&lt;/math&gt;.
This is known as '''Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics'''.

== The Thermometer ==

We should say that this property allow us to build a ''thermometer'', if we are able to translate temperature to a repeatable numeric value.
In the above example (two litres of water evolving to a new temperature), we used the same quantity of water. The temperature scale is based in taking the final temperature as
:&lt;math&gt;T_3=\frac{T_1+T_2}2&lt;/math&gt;
for different masses of water we would have the weighted average
:&lt;math&gt;T_3=\frac{m_1 T_1+ m_2 T_2}{m_1+m_2}&lt;/math&gt;
By changing the masses of water of known temperatures &lt;math&gt;T_1, T_2&lt;/math&gt; we could achieve by this mechanism every temperature between them and calibrate another (more comfortable) device that translates temperature to a repeatable numeric value.
The most common device of this kind is the mercury thermometer, which is practically a bulb connected to a thin tube (a capilar). It was seen that the space that the mercury occupies in the tube increases with temperature lineally, so
:&lt;math&gt;l-l_0=l_0\alpha(T-T_0) \,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; is the occupied space, and &lt;math&gt;l_0&lt;/math&gt; is the space occupied at a reference temperature &lt;math&gt;T_0&lt;/math&gt;; &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is a constant (the ''linear thermal expansion coefficient''). Celsius chose the temperatures &lt;math&gt;T_1,T_2&lt;/math&gt; as the temperatures of solidification and condensation of water, setting them as &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;100&lt;/math&gt; and took the measure of a degree as a division of this range by 100. Fahrenheit instead, used the temperature of freezing brine as the &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; of the scale and the human temperature as 96 (the water solidification was set to 32°F). Later this scale was modified to have the condensation of water exactly 180°F above the solidification.

Note that to build a temperature scale, one used a thermal stable mixture, a mixture that maintain constant temperature for a while. This is easily achieved using a compound which is changing state, like melting ice: the water is at the temperature of the ice, because they are at thermal equilibrium; the water then tend to get hotter (to reach equilibrium with air), and also the ice is in this process; when the ice melts, it turns into more water, that stabilizes the equilibrium with the existing water. Additionally, it was seen that there's an anomaly at change of states: thermal equilibrium between water and ice, for example, can be reached above (liquid) or beneath (solid) the solidification temperature, but also at the very solidification temperature, having as the final product a mixture between liquid and solid, or just liquid or just solid. This phenomenon is known as '''latent heat''', and will be described further.


We have not given yet a definition of temperature. That's another story.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:9dots.svg|thumb|right|The &quot;nine dots&quot; puzzle. The goal of the puzzle is to link all 9 dots using four straight lines or less, without lifting the pen. One solution appears below.]]
'''Thinking outside the box''' (sometimes erroneously called &quot;thinking out of the box&quot; or &quot;thinking outside the square&quot;) is to think differently, unconventionally or from a new perspective.  This phrase often refers to novel, creative and smart thinking. 

This is sometimes called a process of lateral thought.  The catchphrase, or cliché, has become widely used in business environments, especially by management consultants and executive coaches, and has spawned a number of advertising slogans. To think outside the box is to look further and try not to think of the obvious things, but try and think beyond that.

== Analogy==
A simplified definition for ''paradigm'' is a habit of reasoning or a conceptual framework. 

A simplified analogy is &quot;the box&quot; in the commonly used phrase &quot;thinking outside the box&quot;. What is encompassed by the words &quot;inside the box&quot; becomes analogous with what we know or what we assume.

Conservationist Lawrence Anthony acknowledges and rejects the paradigm analogy.  He argues &quot;I have never understood the saying 'To think outside the box.' Why would anyone sit inside of a box and then think outside of it. Rather just get out of the box.&quot;{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

== Nine dots puzzle ==
[[Image:Ninedots.svg|thumb|right|One of many solutions to the puzzle at the beginning of this article is to go beyond the boundaries to link all dots in 4 straight lines.]]
The notion of something outside a perceived &quot;box&quot; is related to a traditional topographical puzzle called the ''nine dots puzzle''.&lt;ref&gt;Kihn, Martin. [http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/95/debunk.html &quot;'Outside the Box': the Inside Story,&quot;] ''FastCompany'' 1995; Random House: [http://www.randomhouse.com/wotd/index.pperl?date=20000204 &quot;Outside the Box Thinking&quot;].&lt;/ref&gt; 

The origins of the phrase &quot;thinking outside the box&quot; are obscure; but it was popularized in part because of a nine-dot puzzle, which John Adair claims to have introduced in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;The Art of Creative Thinking: How to Be Innovative and Develop Great Ideas&lt;/ref&gt;Management consultant Mike Vance has claimed that the use of the nine-dot puzzle in consultancy circles stems from the corporate culture of the Walt Disney Company, where the puzzle was used in-house.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.creativethinkingassoc.com/mikevance.html Biography of Mike Vance] at Creative Thinking Association of America.&lt;/ref&gt;  

The puzzle proposed an intellectual challenge&amp;mdash;to connect the dots by drawing four straight, continuous lines that pass through each of the nine dots, and never lifting the pencil from the paper.  The conundrum is easily resolved, but only if you draw the lines outside the confines of the square area defined by the nine dots themselves.  The phrase &quot;thinking outside the box&quot; is a restatement of the solution strategy.  The puzzle only seems difficult because we imagine a boundary around the edge of the dot array.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Kies, [http://papyr.com/hypertextbooks/comp2/9dots.htm  &quot;English Composition 2: Assumptions: Puzzle of the Nine Dots&quot;], retr. Jun. 28, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The heart of the matter is the unspecified barrier which is typically perceived.

[[Image:Eggpuzzle.jpg|thumb|right|''Christopher Columbus's Egg Puzzle'' as it appeared in Sam Loyd's ''Cyclopedia of Puzzles''.]]
The nine dots puzzle is much older than the slogan. It appears in Sam Loyd's 1914 ''Cyclopedia of Puzzles''.&lt;ref&gt;Sam Loyd, ''Cyclopedia of Puzzles''. (The Lamb Publishing Company, 1914)&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1951 compilation ''The Puzzle-Mine: Puzzles Collected from the Works of the Late Henry Ernest Dudeney'', the puzzle is attributed to Dudeney himself.&lt;ref&gt;J. Travers, ''The Puzzle-Mine: Puzzles Collected from the Works of the Late Henry Ernest Dudeney''. (Thos. Nelson, 1951)&lt;/ref&gt;  Sam Loyd's original formulation of the puzzle&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mathpuzzle.com/loyd/cop300-301.html Facsimile from ''Cyclopedia of Puzzles'' - Columbus's Egg Puzzle is on right-hand page]&lt;/ref&gt; entitled it as &quot;Christopher Columbus's egg puzzle.&quot;  This was an allusion to the story of Egg of Columbus.

==Metaphor of a &quot;box” is real==
&quot;The &quot;box&quot; in the phrase &quot;outside the box&quot; is not only a metaphor&amp;mdash;it is real, measurable. Speculating beyond its restrictive confines the box can be both: 
:(a) positive&amp;mdash; fostering creative leaps as in generating wild ideas (the conventional use of the term);&lt;ref&gt;Lupick, Travis. [http://www.straight.com/article-158377/clone-wars-galactic-task &quot;Clone Wars proved a galactic task for production team.&quot;] ''The Georgia Straight'', August 21, 2008; &quot;...  budgetary constraints forced the production team to &lt;u&gt;think outside the box in a positive way&lt;/u&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; and 
:(b) negative&amp;mdash; penetrating through to the &quot;bottom of the box.&quot; This could result in a frank and insightful re-appraisal of a situation, oneself, the organization, etc.&lt;ref name=&quot;bandrowski&quot;&gt;Bandrowski, James F. ''et al.'' (2009). ''Discover Your Inner Strength'', p. __.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, the process of thinking &quot;inside the box&quot; isn't always a bad thing. It is crucial for accurately parsing and executing a variety of tasks &amp;mdash; making decisions, analyzing data, and managing the progress of standard operating procedures, etc.&lt;ref name=&quot;bandrowski&quot;/&gt;

Hollywood screenwriter Ira Steven Behr appropriated this concept to inform plot and character in the context of a television series.  Behr imagined a core character:
:He is going to be &quot;thinking outside the box,&quot;, you know, and usually when we use that cliché, we think outside the box means a new thought. So we can situate ourselves back in the box, but in a somewhat better position&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.premiumhollywood.com/2009/08/03/tca-tour-you-asked-for-it-ira-steven-behrs-opening-remarks TCA Tour – You Asked For It: Ira Steven Behr’s opening remarks]&lt;/ref&gt;
Behr also speculated about what happens next in a multi-stage design thinking process.

'''Creativity techniques''' are methods that promote original thoughts by facilitating divergent and/or convergent thinking.  Some techniques require groups of two or more people while other techniques can be accomplished alone.  These methods include word games, written exercises and different types of improvisation.  Creativity techniques can be used to develop new materials for artistic purposes or to solve problems.

Most creativity techniques use associations between the goal (or the problem), the current state (which may be an imperfect solution to the problem), and some stimulus (possibly selected randomly). There is an [[analogy]] between many creativity techniques and methods of [[evolutionary computation]].

==Randomness==

[[Randomness]], or [[aleatory]], is the introduction of [[chance]] elements. Aleatory is commonly found in music, art, and literature, particularly in poetry.  In film, [[Andy Voda]] made a movie in 1979 called &quot;Chance Chants&quot; which he produced by a flip of a coin, or roll of a dice. In music, [[John Cage]], an avant-garde musician, composed music by superimposing star maps on blank sheet music, by rolling dice, and by preparing open ended scores that depended on the spontaneous decisions of the performers. (1) Other ways of practicing randomness include coin tossing, picking something out of a hat, or selecting random words from a dictionary.

In short, aleatory is a way to introduce new thoughts or ideas into a creative process.

==Improvisation==

[[Improvisation]] is a creative process which can be spoken, written, or composed without prior preparation.&lt;ref&gt;http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/improvisation&lt;/ref&gt;
Improvisation, also called extemporization, can lead to the discovery of new ways to act, new patterns of thought and practices, or new structures. Improvisation is used in the creation of music, theatre, and other various forms.  Many artists also use improvisational techniques to help their creative flow.

Here are two significant methods:

* '''Improvisational Theater''' is a form of theater in which actors use improvisational acting techniques to perform spontaneously. Many “improv” techniques are taught in standard drama classes. The basic skills of listening, clarity, confidence, and performing instinctively and spontaneously are considered important skills for actors to develop.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cognos.com/newsletter/decisions/st_070307_01.html&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Free Improvisation''' is real time composition. Musicians of all kinds “improv” music; this music is not limited to particular genre. Two contemporary musicians that use free improvisation are [[Anthony Braxton]] and [[Cecil Taylor]].  Through free improvisation, musicians can develop increased spontaneity and fluency.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.musilosophy.com/jazz-improvisation.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Each type of improvisation improves the thinking and acting skill of the actor, this is made by using no practise, a similar set of techniques is called  ''[[Alienation]]'' since one of its many techniques uses actors that haven't rehearsed or even read the play, improvisation is an acting skill where actors make up a storyline, start and ending on the spot and actors have to try their best to keep in character.

==Problem Solving==

In [[problem-solving]] contexts, the random word creativity technique is perhaps the simplest method. A person confronted with a problem is presented with a randomly generated word, in the hopes of a solution arising from any associations between the word and the problem. A random image, sound, or article can be used instead of a random word as a kind of creativity goad or [[provocation]].&lt;ref&gt;http://ideaflow.corante.com/archives/2003/05/09/more_on_idea_generation_tools_and_techniques.php&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://mitsloan.mit.edu/vc/Ideationpaper022805.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Therapeutic Applications==

[[Projective therapy]] is a form of psychotherapy which uses synthesis to produce original interpretation and problem solving strategies. Fiction is read in the form of a novel or observed in the form of a film. In this therapeutic technique, patients analyze the fictional work and immerse themselves in this fictional world. Rather than focusing on their problems, they analyze the author- or actors- motivation, plot-development and cinematography during the group process. By reading/viewing many consecutive works during this process, the patients are able to achieve a creative link between their own issues and those of the fictional characters. This synthesis is usually unique to each individual since it bypasses the conscious and directly accesses the  unconscious by linking with semiotic objects and archetypes which populated this otherwise inaccessible part of the mental process.&lt;ref&gt;AJ Giannini. Use of fiction in therapy. Psychiatric Times. 18(7):56-57,2001.&lt;/ref&gt; This technique was first used by Dr. A James Giannini  at Yale University using the [[World of Tiers]] science-fiction series written by [[Philip Jose Farmer]]. A later novel in this series, [[Red Orc's Rage]], was produced by both Farmer and Giannini. This particular novel reviewed the technique of projective therapy; the use of the creativity unleashed in this process: and the evolution of the Tiers series itself.&lt;ref&gt;AJ Giannini. Afterword. In PJ Farmer, Red Orc's Rage. New York, NY. Tor Press, 1990. Pp. 280-282.ISBN 0-312-85036-0&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Creative problem solving''' is the mental process of creating a solution to a problem. It is a special form of problem solving in which the solution is independently created rather than learned with assistance.

Creative problem solving always involves creativity. However, creativity often does not involve creative problem solving, especially in fields such as music, poetry, and art. Creativity requires newness or novelty as a characteristic of what is created, but creativity does not necessarily imply that what is created has value or is appreciated by other people.

To qualify as creative problem solving the solution must either have value, clearly solve the stated problem, or be appreciated by someone for whom the situation improves.&lt;ref name =&quot;Fobes1993&quot;&gt;Richard Fobes, ''The Creative Problem Solver's Toolbox: A Complete Course in the Art of Creating Solutions to Problems of Any Kind'' (1993) ISBN 0-96-322210-4&lt;/ref&gt;

The situation prior to the solution does not need to be labeled as a problem. Alternate labels include a challenge, an opportunity, or a situation in which there is room for improvement.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fobes1993&quot;/&gt;

Solving school-assigned homework problems does not usually involve creative problem solving because such problems typically have well-known solutions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fobes1993&quot;/&gt;

If a created solution becomes widely used, the solution becomes an innovation and the word innovation also refers to the process of creating that innovation. A widespread and long-lived innovation typically becomes a new tradition. &quot;All innovations [begin] as creative solutions, but not all creative solutions become innovations.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Fobes1993&quot;/&gt; Some innovations also qualify as inventions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fobes1993&quot;/&gt;

Inventing is a special kind of creative problem solving in which the created solution qualifies as an invention because it is a useful new object, substance, process, software, or other kind of marketable entity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fobes1993&quot;/&gt;

==Techniques and tools==
Many of the techniques and tools for creating an effective solution to a problem are described in creativity techniques and problem solving.

Creative-problem-solving techniques can be categorized as follows:
* Creativity techniques designed to shift a person's mental state into one that fosters creativity. These techniques are described in creativity techniques. One such popular technique is to take a break and relax or sleep after intensively trying to think of a solution.
* Creativity techniques designed to reframe the problem. For example, reconsidering one's goals by asking &quot;What am I really trying to accomplish?&quot; can lead to useful insights.
* Creativity techniques designed to increase the quantity of fresh ideas. This approach is based on the belief that a larger number of ideas increases the chances that one of them has value. Some of these techniques involve randomly selecting an idea (such as choosing a word from a list), thinking about similarities with the undesired situation, and hopefully inspiring a related idea that leads to a solution. Such techniques are described in creativity techniques.
* Creative-problem-solving techniques designed to efficiently lead to a fresh perspective that causes a solution to become obvious. This category is useful for solving especially challenging problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fobes1993&quot;/&gt; Some of these techniques involve identifying independent dimensions that differentiate (or separate) closely associated concepts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fobes1993&quot;/&gt; Such techniques can overcome the mind's instinctive tendency to use &quot;oversimplified associative thinking&quot; in which two related concepts are so closely associated that their differences, and independence from one another, are overlooked.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fobes1993&quot;/&gt;

The following formalized and well-known methods and processes combine various creativity and creative-problem-solving techniques:
* TRIZ, which is also known as Theory of Inventive Problem Solving (TIPS), was developed by Genrich Altshuller and his colleagues based on examining more than 200,000 patents.&lt;!--40,000 is mentioned in TRIZ article--&gt; This method is designed to foster the creation and development of patentable inventions, but is also useful for creating non-product solutions.
* Mind mapping is a creativity technique that both reframes the situation and fosters creativity.
* Brainstorming is a group activity designed to increase the quantity of fresh ideas. Getting other people involved can help increase knowledge and understanding of the problem and help participants reframe the problem.
* Edward de Bono has published numerous books that promote an approach to creative problem solving and creative thinking called lateral thinking.
* The Creative Problem Solving Process (CPS) is a six-step method developed by Alex Osborn and Sid Parnes that alternates convergent and divergent thinking phases.

A frequent approach to teaching creative problem solving is to teach critical thinking in addition to creative thinking, but the effectiveness of this approach is not proven. As an alternative to separating critical and creative thinking, some creative-problem-solving techniques focus on either reducing an idea's disadvantages or extracting a flawed idea's significant advantages and incorporating those advantages into a different idea.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fobes1993&quot;/&gt;

Creative-problem-solving tools typically consist of software or manipulatable objects (such as cards) that facilitate specific creative-problem-solving techniques. Electronic meeting systems provide a range of interactive tools for creative-problem-solving by groups over the Internet.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Creative Problem Solving Process''' (CPS), also known as the Osborn-Parnes CPS process, was developed by Alex Osborn and Dr. Sidney J. Parnes in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url=http://creativeproblemsolving.com/ |title=Creative Problem Solving: Resources for CPS Practitioners |accessdate=2010-06-08 |publisher=OmniSkills, LLC }}&lt;/ref&gt; CPS is a structured method for generating novel and useful solutions to problems. CPS follows three process stages, which match a person's natural creative process, and six explicit steps:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.creativeeducationfoundation.org/?page_id=41 What is CPS?]. Creative Education Foundation, 2010. Retrieved on 2010-06-13.&lt;/ref&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Process Stage !! Steps
|-
| rowspan=&quot;3&quot; | Explore the Challenge || Objective Finding (identify the goal, wish or challenge)
|-
| Fact Finding (gather the relevant data)
|-
| Problem Finding (clarify the problems that need to be solved in order to achieve the goal)
|-
| Generate Ideas || Idea Finding (generate ideas to solve the identified problem)
|-
| rowspan=&quot;2&quot; | Prepare for Action || Solution Finding (move from idea to implementable solution)
|-
| Acceptance Finding (plan for action)
|}

CPS is flexible, and its use depends on the situation. The steps can be (and often are) used in a linear fashion, from start to finish, but it is not necessary to use all the steps. For example, if one already has a clearly-defined problem, the process would begin at Idea Finding.

What distinguishes the Osborn-Parnes CPS process from other &quot;creative problem solving&quot; methods is the use of both divergent and convergent thinking during each process step, and not just when generating ideas to solve the problem. Each step begins with divergent thinking, a broad search for many alternatives. This is followed by convergent thinking, the process of evaluating and selecting.

This method is taught at the International Center for Studies in Creativity,&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url=http://www.buffalostate.edu/creativity/graduatecourses.xml |title=ICSC Course Descriptions |accessdate=2007-12-22 |publisher=International Center for Studies in Creativity }}&lt;/ref&gt; the Creative Problem Solving Institute,&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url=http://cpsiconference.com/ |title=Creative Problem Solving Institute |accessdate=2007-12-22 |publisher=Creative Education Foundation }}&lt;/ref&gt; and CREA Conference.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url=http://www.creaconference.com/EN/core-programs.html |title=Programs |accessdate=2008-01-07 |work=CREA Conference |publisher=Creativity European Association }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is specifically acknowledged as a key influence for the Productive Thinking Model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hurson | first = Tim | coauthors = | title = Think Better: An Innovator's Guide to Productive Thinking | publisher = McGraw Hill | year = 2007 | location = New York, New York | pages = xii | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-0071494939 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Brainstorming''' is a group creativity technique designed to generate a large number of ideas for the solution of a problem. In 1953 the method was popularized by Alex Faickney Osborn in a book called ''Applied Imagination.'' Osborn proposed that groups could double their creative output with brainstorming.&lt;ref name=&quot;Osborn, A.F. 1963&quot;&gt;Osborn, A.F. (1963) ''Applied imagination: Principles and procedures of creative problem solving'' (Third Revised Edition). New York, NY: Charles Scribner’s Son.&lt;/ref&gt; A recent politically-correct movement is claiming the word &quot;brainstorm&quot; is offensive to epileptics, whose attacks are sometimes referred to as such, so the expression &quot;ideas shower&quot; has been suggested.

Although brainstorming has become a popular group technique, when applied in a traditional group setting, researchers have not found evidence of its effectiveness for enhancing either quantity or quality of ideas generated. Because of such problems as distraction, social loafing, evaluation apprehension, and production blocking, conventional brainstorming groups are little more effective than other types of groups, and they are actually less effective than individuals working independently.&lt;ref&gt;Nijstad, B. A., Stroebe, W. Lodewijkx, H. F. M. (2003). Production blocking and idea generation: Does blocking interfere with cognitive processes? ''Journal of Experimental Social Psychology'', ''39'', 531-548.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Diehl, M., &amp; Stroebe, W. (1991). Productivity loss in idea-generating groups: tracking down the blocking effect. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology'', ''61'', 392-403.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mullen, B., Johnson, C., &amp; Salas, E. (1991). Productivity loss in brainstorming groups: a meta-analytic integration. ''Basic and Applied Social Psychology''. ''12'', 3-23.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Encyclopedia of Creativity, Tudor Rickards, in his entry on brainstorming, summarizes its controversies and indicates the dangers of conflating productivity in group work with quantity of ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Rickards, T., (1999) Brainstorming, M Runco &amp; S Pritzker, Eds, Encyclopedia of Creativity, San Diego: Academic Press Vol 1 219-228.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although traditional brainstorming does not increase the productivity of groups (as measured by the number of ideas generated), it may still provide benefits, such as boosting morale, enhancing work enjoyment, and improving team work. Thus, numerous attempts have been made to improve brainstorming or use more effective variations of the basic technique.

Professor Olivier Toubia of Columbia University has conducted extensive research in the field of idea generation and has concluded that incentives are extremely valuable within the brainstorming context.&lt;ref&gt;Toubia, Olivier, &quot;Idea Generation, Creativity, and Incentives,&quot; ''Marketing Science'' (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

From these attempts to improve brainstorming, electronic brainstorming stands out. Mainly through anonymization and parallelization of input, electronic brainstorming enforces the ground rules of effective brainstorming and thereby eliminates most of the deleterious or inhibitive effects of group work.&lt;ref&gt;Nunamaker, J., Dennis, A. R., Valacich, J. S., Vogel, D. R. and George, J. F. (1991), &quot;Electronic Meeting Systems to Support Group Work,&quot; Communications of the ACM, Vol. 34, No. 7, pp. 40-61&lt;/ref&gt; The positive effects of electronic brainstorming become more pronounced with group size.&lt;ref&gt;Dennis, A. R. and Valacich, J. S. (1993), &quot;Computer Brainstorms:  More Heads are Better than One,&quot; Journal of Applied Psychology, Vol. 78, No. 4, pp. 531-537.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ground Rules==
There are four basic rules in brainstorming.&lt;ref name=&quot;Osborn, A.F. 1963&quot;&gt;Osborn, A.F. (1963) ''Applied imagination: Principles and procedures of creative problem solving'' (Third Revised Edition). New York, NY: Charles Scribner’s Sons.&lt;/ref&gt; These are intended to reduce social inhibitions among group members, stimulate idea generation, and increase overall creativity of the group.
#'''Focus on quantity''': This rule is a means of enhancing divergent production, aiming to facilitate problem solving through the maxim ''quantity breeds quality''. The assumption is that the greater the number of ideas generated, the greater the chance of producing a radical and effective solution.
#'''Withhold criticism''': In brainstorming, criticism of ideas generated should be put 'on hold'. Instead, participants should focus on extending or adding to ideas, reserving criticism for a later 'critical stage' of the process. By suspending judgment, participants will feel free to generate unusual ideas.
#'''Welcome unusual ideas''': To get a good and long list of ideas, unusual ideas are welcomed. They can be generated by looking from new perspectives and suspending assumptions. These new ways of thinking may provide better solutions.
#'''Combine and improve ideas''': Good ideas may be combined to form a single better good idea, as suggested by the slogan &quot;1+1=3&quot;. It is believed to stimulate the building of ideas by a process of association.

==Method==
===Set the problem===
Before a brainstorming session, it is critical to define the problem. The problem must be clear, not too big, and captured in a specific question such as &quot;What service for mobile phones is not available now, but needed?&quot;. If the problem is too big, the facilitator should break it into smaller components, each with its own question.

===Create a background memo===
The background memo is the invitation and informational letter for the participants, containing the session name, problem, time, date, and place. The problem is described in the form of a question, and some example ideas are given. The memo is sent to the participants well in advance, so that they can think about the problem beforehand.

===Select participants===
The facilitator composes the brainstorming panel, consisting of the participants and an idea collector. A group of 10 or fewer members is generally more productive. Many variations are possible but the following composition is suggested.

* Several core members of the project who have proved themselves.
* Several guests from outside the project, with affinity to the problem.
* One idea collector who records the suggested ideas.

===Create a list of lead questions===
During the brainstorm session the creativity may decrease. At this moment, the facilitator should stimulate creativity by suggesting a lead question to answer, such as ''Can we combine these ideas?'' or ''How about looking from another perspective?''. It is best to prepare a list of such leads before the session begins.

===Session conduct===
The facilitator leads the brainstorming session and ensures that ground rules are followed. The steps in a typical session are:

# A warm-up session, to expose novice participants to the criticism-free environment. A simple problem is brainstormed, for example ''What should be the CEO's retirement present?'' or ''What can be improved in Microsoft Windows?''.
# The facilitator presents the problem and gives a further explanation if needed.
# The facilitator asks the brainstorming group for their ideas.
# If no ideas are forthcoming, the facilitator suggests a lead to encourage creativity.
# All participants present their ideas, and the idea collector records them.
# To ensure clarity, participants may elaborate on their ideas.
# When time is up, the facilitator organizes the ideas based on the topic goal and encourages discussion.
# Ideas are categorized.
# The whole list is reviewed to ensure that everyone understands the ideas.
# Duplicate ideas and obviously infeasible solutions are removed.
# The facilitator thanks &lt;shubham&gt; and gives each a token of appreciation.

[[Image:Activity conducting.svg|thumb|400px|right|Process of conducting a brainstorming session]]

===The process===
* Participants who have ideas but were unable to present them are encouraged to write down the ideas and present them later.
* The idea collector should number the ideas, so that the chairperson can use the number to encourage an idea generation goal, for example: ''We have 44 ideas now, let’s get it to 50!''.
* The idea collector should repeat the idea in the words he or she has written verbatim, to confirm that it expresses the meaning intended by the originator.
* When many participants are having ideas, the one with the most associated idea should have priority. This is to encourage elaboration on previous ideas.
* During a brainstorming session, managers and other superiors may be discouraged from attending, since it may inhibit and reduce the effect of the four basic rules, especially the generation of unusual ideas.

===Evaluation===
Brainstorming is not just about generating ideas for others to evaluate and select. Usually the group itself will, in its final stage, evaluate the ideas and select one as the solution to the problem proposed to the group.
* The solution should not require resources or skills the members of the group do not have or cannot acquire.
* If acquiring additional resources or skills is necessary, that needs to be the first part of the solution.
* There must be a way to measure progress and success.
* The steps to carry out the solution must be clear to all, and amenable to being assigned to the members so that each will have an important role.
* There must be a common decision making process to enable a coordinated effort to proceed, and to reassign tasks as the project unfolds.
* There should be evaluations at milestones to decide whether the group is on track toward a final solution.
* There should be incentives to participation so that participants maintain their efforts.

==Variations==
===Nominal group technique===
The nominal group technique is a type of brainstorming that encourages all participants to have an equal say in the process. It is also used to generate a ranked list of ideas.

Participants are asked to write their ideas anonymously. Then the moderator collects the ideas and each is voted on by the group. The vote can be as simple as a show of hands in favor of a given idea. This process is called distillation.

After distillation, the top ranked ideas may be sent back to the group or to subgroups for further brainstorming. For example, one group may work on the color required in a product. Another group may work on the size, and so forth. Each group will come back to the whole group for ranking the listed ideas. Sometimes ideas that were previously dropped may be brought forward again once the group has re-evaluated the ideas.

It is important that the facilitator be trained in this process before attempting to facilitate this technique. The group should be primed and encouraged to embrace the process. Like all team efforts, it may take a few practice sessions to train the team in the method before tackling the important ideas.

===Group passing technique===
Each person in a circular group writes down one idea, and then passes the piece of paper to the next person in a clockwise direction, who adds some thoughts. This continues until everybody gets his or her original piece of paper back. By this time, it is likely that the group will have extensively elaborated on each idea.

The group may also create an &quot;Idea Book&quot; and post a distribution list or routing slip to the front of the book. On the first page is a description of the problem. The first person to receive the book lists his or her ideas and then routes the book to the next person on the distribution list. The second person can log new ideas or add to the ideas of the previous person. This continues until the distribution list is exhausted. A follow-up &quot;read out&quot; meeting is then held to discuss the ideas logged in the book. This technique takes longer, but it allows individuals time to think deeply about the problem.

===Team idea mapping method===
This method of brainstorming works by the method of association. It may improve collaboration and increase the quantity of ideas, and is designed so that all attendees participate and no ideas are rejected.

The process begins with a well-defined topic. Each participant brainstorms individually, then all the ideas are merged onto one large idea map. During this consolidation phase, participants may discover a common understanding of the issues as they share the meanings behind their ideas. During this sharing, new ideas may arise by the association, and they are added to the map as well. Once all the ideas are captured, the group can prioritize and/or take action.

===Electronic brainstorming===
Electronic brainstorming is a computerized version of the manual brainstorming technique. It is typically supported by an electronic meeting system (EMS) but simpler forms can also be done via email and may be browser based, or use peer-to-peer software.

With an electronic meeting system, participants share a list of ideas over the Internet. Ideas are entered independently. Contributions become immediately visible to all and are typically anonymized to encourage openness and reduce personal prejudice. Modern EMS also support asynchronous brainstorming sessions over extended periods of time as well as typical follow-up activities in the creative-problem-solving process such as categorization of ideas, elimination of duplicates, assessment and discussion of prioritized or controversial ideas.

Electronic brainstorming eliminates many of the problems of standard brainstorming, such as production blocking and evaluation apprehension. An additional advantage of this method is that all ideas can be archived electronically in their original form, and then retrieved later for further thought and discussion. Electronic brainstorming also enables much larger groups to brainstorm on a topic than would normally be productive in a traditional brainstorming session.&lt;ref&gt;Gallupe, R. B., Dennis, A. R., Cooper, W. H., Valacich, J. S., Bastianutti, L. M. and Nunamaker, J. F. (1992), &quot;Electronic Brainstorming and Group Size,&quot; Academy of Management Journal, Vol. 35, No. 2, pp. 350-369.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some web based brainstorming techniques allow contributors to post their comments anonymously through the use of avatars.  This technique also allows users to log on over an extended time period, typically one or two weeks, to allow participants some &quot;soak time&quot; before posting their ideas and feedback.  This technique has been used particularly in the field of new product development, but can be applied in any number of areas where collecting and evaluating ideas would be useful.

===Directed brainstorming===
Directed brainstorming is a variation of electronic brainstorming (described above). It can be done manually or with computers. Directed brainstorming works when the solution space (that is, the criteria for evaluating a good idea) is known prior to the session.  If known, that criteria can be used to intentionally constrain the ideation process.

In directed brainstorming, each participant is given one sheet of paper (or electronic form) and told the brainstorming question. They are asked to produce one response and stop, then all of the papers (or forms) are randomly swapped among the participants. The participants are asked to look at the idea they received and to create a new idea that improves on that idea based on the initial criteria. The forms are then swapped again and respondents are asked to improve upon the ideas, and the process is repeated for three or more rounds.

In the laboratory, directed brainstorming has been found to almost triple the productivity of groups over electronic brainstorming.&lt;ref&gt;Santanen, E., Briggs, R. O., &amp; de Vreede, G-J. (2004). Causal Relationships in Creative Problem Solving: Comparing Facilitation Interventions for Ideation.  ''Journal of Management Information Systems''. ''20(4)'', 167-198.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Individual brainstorming===
&quot;Individual Brainstorming&quot; is the use of brainstorming on a solitary basis. It typically includes such techniques as free writing, free speaking, word association, and drawing a mind map, which is a visual note taking technique in which people diagram their thoughts. Individual brainstorming is a useful method in creative writing and has been shown to be superior to traditional group brainstorming.&lt;ref&gt;Furnham, A., &amp; Yazdanpanahi, T. (1995). Personality differences and group versus individual brainstorming. ''Personality and Individual Differences'', ''19'', 73-80.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Question Brainstorming===
This process involves brainstorming the ''questions'', rather than trying to come up with immediate answers and short term solutions. This technique stimulates creativity and promotes everyone's participation because no one has to come up with answers. The answers to the questions form the framework for constructing future action plans. Once the list of questions is set, it may be necessary to prioritize them to reach to the best solution in an orderly way.&lt;ref&gt;Ludy, Perry J. Profit Building: Cutting Costs Without Cutting People. San Francisco: Berret-Koehler, Inc, 2000. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
Another of the problems for brainstorming can be to find the best evaluation methods for a problem.

Brainstorming all the questions has also been called ''questorming''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pynthan.com/vri/questorm.htm Questorming: An Outline of the Method], Jon Roland, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conclusion==
Brainstorming is a popular method of group interaction in both educational and business settings. Although it does not provide a measurable advantage in creative output, conventional brainstorming is an enjoyable exercise that is typically well received by participants. Electronic brainstorming effectively overcomes barriers inherent in group work like production blocking mainly through anonymization and parallelization of contributions.&lt;ref&gt;McFadzean, E. S. (1997), “Improving Group Productivity with Group Support Systems and Creative Problem Solving Techniques”, Creativity and Innovation Management, Vol. 6, No. 4, pp. 218-225.&lt;/ref&gt; Other variations of brainstorming that do not require an electronic system may also prove superior to the original technique. How well these methods work, and whether or not they should be classified as brainstorming, are questions that require further research.

==Controversy over term==

Some governmental organisations (The Welsh Development Agency and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment in Belfast) have reached the conclusion that the term 'brainstorming' is offensive to people with epilepsy&lt;ref name=&quot;Epilepsy Action, 2005&quot;&gt;[http://www.epilepsy.org.uk/node/1078] Epilepsy Action, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; (see political correctness) and have suggested the alternative &quot;thought-showers&quot;. However, research by the National Society for Epilepsy found of those affected by epilepsy questioned, 93% considered the term inoffensive. A specific comment states that changes need not be made since that could promote an undesirable image of epileptics being easily offended&lt;ref name=&quot;Epilepsy Action, 2005&quot;/&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''6-3-5 Brainwriting ''' (also known as the 6-3-5 Method, or Method 635) is a group creativity technique used in marketing, advertising, design, writing and product development originally developed by Professor Bernd Rohrbach in 1968&lt;ref&gt;''Rohrbach, Bernd'': &quot;Kreativ nach Regeln – Methode 635, eine neue Technik zum Lösen von Problemen&quot;. ''Creative by rules - Method 635, a new technique for solving problems'' first published in the German sales magazine &quot;Absatzwirtschaft&quot;, Volume 12, 1969. p73-75 and Volume 19, 1 October 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Based on the concept of [[../Brainstorming/]], the aim of 6-3-5 Brainwriting is to generate 108 new ideas in half an hour. In a similar way to brainstorming, it is not the quality of ideas that matters but the quantity.

The technique involves 6 participants who sit in a group and are supervised by a moderator. Each participant thinks up 3 ideas every 5 minutes. Participants are encouraged to draw on others' ideas for inspiration, thus stimulating the creative process. After 6 rounds in 30 minutes the group has thought up a total of 108 ideas.

The '''Creative Class''' is a socioeconomic class that economist and social scientist [[Richard Florida]], a professor and head of the Martin Prosperity Institute at the [[Rotman School of Management]] at the [[University of Toronto]], identifies as a key driving force for economic development of [[post-industrial]] [[cities]] in the [[United States]]. 

Florida describes the Creative Class as comprising 40 million workers—30 percent of the U.S. workforce—and breaks the class into two broad sections, derived from [[Standard Occupational Classification System]] codes:
* [[Super-Creative Core]]: This group comprises about 12 percent of all U.S. jobs. It includes a wide range of occupations (e.g. science, engineering, education, computer programming, research), with arts, design, and media workers forming a small subset. Florida considers those belonging to this group to “fully engage in the creative process” (2002, p.&amp;nbsp;69). The Super-Creative Core is considered innovative, creating commercial products and consumer goods. The primary job function of its members is to be creative and innovative. “Along with problem solving, their work may entail problem finding” (Florida, 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;69).
* [[Creative Professional]]s: These professionals are the classic [[Knowledge workers|knowledge-based workers]] and include those working in healthcare, business and finance, the legal sector, and education. They “draw on complex bodies of knowledge to solve specific problems” using higher degrees of education to do so (Florida, 2002).

In addition to these two main groups of creative people, the usually much smaller group of [[Bohemianism|Bohemian]]s is also included in the Creative Class.

Florida concludes that the Creative Class will be the leading force of growth in the economy, and is expected to grow by over 10 million jobs in the next decade.

== Background ==
The social theories advanced by Florida have sparked much debate and discussion. Florida's work proposes that a new or emergent class—or demographic segment made up of knowledge workers, intellectuals and various types of artists—is an ascendant economic force, representing either a major shift away from traditional agriculture- or industry-based economies or a general restructuring into more complex economic hierarchies.

The theses developed by Florida in various publications were drawn from, among other sources, U.S. Census Bureau demographic data, focusing first on economic trends and shifts apparent in major U.S. cities, with later work expanding the focus internationally.

The nebulous Creative Class has been on the rise for at least four decades, with a shift towards technology, research and development, and the internet (and related fields) occurring in the postwar economies of many countries.  

A number of specific cities and regions (including [[California]]'s [[Silicon Valley]], [[Boston]]’s [[Route 128 (Massachusetts)|Route 128]], [[Research Triangle|The Triangle]] in North Carolina, [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], [[Seattle]], [[Bangalore, India]], [[Dublin, Ireland]] and [[Sweden]]) have come to be identified with these economic trends. In Florida's publications, the same places are also associated with large Creative Class populations.

Florida argues that the Creative Class is socially relevant because of its members' ability to create and increase economic outcomes in the form of new ideas, new high-tech businesses, and regional growth (2002).

== Creative Class occupations ==
Florida says that the Creative Class is a class of workers whose job is to create meaningful new forms (2002). It is composed of scientists and engineers, university professors, poets and architects, and also includes &quot;people in design, education, arts, music and entertainment, whose economic function is to create new ideas, new technology and/or creative content” (Florida, 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;8). The designs of this group are seen as broadly transferable and useful. Another sector of the Creative Class includes positions that are [[Knowledge economy|knowledge intensive]]; these usually require a high degree of formal education (Florida, 2002). Examples of workers in this sector are health professionals and business managers, who are considered part of the sub-group called Creative Professionals. Their primary job is to think and create new approaches to problems. [[Creativity]] is becoming more valued in today’s global society. Employers see creativity as a channel for self-expression and job satisfaction in their employees. About 38.3 million Americans and 30 percent of the American workforce identify themselves with the Creative Class. This number has increased by more than 10 percent in the past 20 years.

The Creative Class is also known for its departure from traditional workplace attire and behavior. Members of the Creative Class may set their own hours and dress codes in the workplace, often reverting to more relaxed, casual attire instead of business suits and ties. Creative Class members may work for themselves and set their own hours, no longer sticking to the 9–5 standard. Independence is also highly regarded among the Creative Class and expected in the workplace (Florida, 2002).

== The Creative Class and the global economy ==
The Creative Class is not a class of workers among many, but a group believed to bring economic growth to countries that can attract its members. The economic benefits conferred by the Creative Class include outcomes in new ideas, high-tech industry and regional growth. Even though the Creative Class has been around for centuries, the U.S. was the first large country to have a Creative Class dealing with information technology, in the 1960s and 1970s. In the 1960s less than five percent of the U.S. population was part of the Creative Class, a number that has risen to 26 percent. Seeing that having a strong Creative Class is vital in today’s global economy, Europe is now almost equal with America's numbers for this group. Inter-city competition to attract members of the Creative Class has developed.

Following an empirical study across 90 nations, Rindermann, Sailer and Thompson (2009) argued that high-ability classes (or smart classes) are responsible for economic growth, stable democratic development, and positively valued political aspects (government effectiveness, rule of law, and liberty).

== Places of high Creative Class populations ==
Florida's use of census and economic data, presented in works such as ''The Rise of the Creative Class'' (2002), ''Cities and the Creative Class'' (2004), and ''The Flight of the Creative Class'' (2007), as well as ''[[Bobos in Paradise]]'' by David Brooks (whose &quot;bobos&quot; roughly correspond to Florida's Creative Class), and [http://www.amazon.com/dp/192121502X NEO Power] by Ross Honeywill (which introduces the NEO Neighborhood), has shown that cities which attract and retain the Creative Class prosper, while those that do not stagnate. This research has gained traction in the business community, as well as among politicians and urban planners. Florida and other Creative Class theorists have been invited to meetings of the National Conference of Mayors and numerous economic development committees, such the [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]] mayor's [http://www.denvergov.org/economicdevelopment/template328864.asp Task Force on Creative Spaces] and [[Michigan]] governor [[Jennifer Granholm]]'s [[Cool Cities Initiative]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.michigan.gov/gov/0,1607,7-168--75516--,00.html|title=Governor Partners with Local Communities to Develop &quot;Cool Cities,&quot; Spur Economic Growth|accessdate=2003-09-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Cities and the Creative Class'', Florida devotes several chapters to discussion of the three main prerequisites of creative cities (though there are many additional qualities which distinguish creative magnets). For a city to attract the Creative Class, he argues, it must possess &quot;the three 'T's&quot;: Talent (a highly talented/educated/skilled population), Tolerance (a diverse community, which has a 'live and let live' ethos), and Technology (the technological infrastructure necessary to fuel an entrepreneurial culture). In ''Rise of the Creative Class&quot;, Florida argues that members of the Creative Class value meritocracy, diversity and individuality, and look for these characteristics when they relocate (2002).

As Florida demonstrates in his books, [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], [[New Orleans]] and [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]] are examples of cities which have tried to attract the Creative Class but, in comparison to cities which better exemplify the &quot;three 'T's&quot;, have failed. Creative Class workers have sought out cities that better accommodate their cultural, creative, and technological needs, such as  [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina|Chapel Hill]], [[San Francisco]], [[Washington, D.C.]], [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], [[Seattle]], [[Toronto, Ontario]] and [[Portland, Oregon]]. Florida also notes that [[Lexington, Kentucky|Lexington]] and [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]] have the ingredients to be a &quot;leading city in a new economy&quot;.

The “Creativity Index” is another tool that Florida uses to describe how members of the Creative Class are attracted to a city. The Creativity Index includes four elements: “the Creative Class share of the workforce; innovation, measured as patents per capita; high tech industry, using the Milken Institute's widely accepted Tech Pole Index…; and diversity, measured by the Gay Index, a reasonable proxy for an area’s openness&quot; (2002, pp. 244–5). Using this index, Florida rates and ranks cities in terms of innovative high-tech centers, with San Francisco being the highest ranked (2002).

Florida and others have found a strong correlation between those cities and states that provide a more tolerant atmosphere toward culturally unconventional people, such as gays, artists, and musicians (exemplified by Florida's &quot;Gay Index&quot; and &quot;Bohemian Index&quot; developed in ''The Rise of the Creative Class''), and the numbers of Creative Class workers that live and move there (2002). 

Research involving the preferences and values of this new socioeconomic class has shown that where people choose to live can no longer be predicted according to conventional industrial theories (such as &quot;people will go to where the jobs/factories are&quot;). Sociologists and urban theorists have noted a gradual and broad shift of values over the past decade. Creative workers are looking for cultural, social, and technological climates in which they feel they can best &quot;be themselves&quot;.

==Lifestyle==
The diverse and individualistic lifestyles enjoyed by the Creative Class involve active participation and experiential activities that are multidimensional. Florida (2002) uses the term Street Level Culture to define this kind of stimulation. Street Level Culture may include a “teeming blend of cafes, sidewalk musicians, and small galleries and bistros, where it is hard to draw the line between participant and observer, or between creativity and its creators” (p.&amp;nbsp;166). Members of the Creative Class enjoy unique experiences like traveling and antique shopping, and outdoor activities like bike riding and running, and would rather be participants than spectators (Florida, 2002).

==Criticisms==
Numerous studies have found fault with the logic or empirical claims of the Creative Class theory. Hoyman and Faricy (2009), using Florida’s own indices, find no statistical evidence that cities with higher proportions of Creative Class workers correlated with any type of economic growth from 1990–2004. In &quot;Urban Development and the Politics of the Creative Class&quot;, Ann Markusen (2006) argues that workers qualified as being in the Creative Class have no concept of group identity, nor are they in occupations that are inherently creative. Markusen also notes that the definition of the Creative Class is based largely on educational attainment, suggesting that Florida’s indices become insignificant after controlling for education (p.&amp;nbsp;1923). Jamie Peck's (2005) &quot;Struggling with the Creative Class&quot; argues that the Creative Class theory offers no causal mechanism and suffers from circular logic. John Montgomery (2005) writes that “what Florida has devised is a set of indices which simply mirror more fundamental truths about creative milieux or dynamic cities” (p.&amp;nbsp;339). Montgomery also disagrees with the cities that Florida designates as most creative, writing that London, not Manchester and Leicester, should be one of the top in the U.K. A critique of Florida's research and theoretical framework has been developed by Matteo Pasquinelli (2006) in the context of Italian [[Operaismo]].

Creative Class Struggle, a Toronto-based collective, has brought these criticisms outside academic circles, challenging Florida's Creative Class theories as well as their widespread adoption into urban policy. The group manages an online clearinghouse for information about creative city strategies and policies, publishes a newsletter and other materials, and works to engage the media and public in critical discussion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Creative Class Struggle.&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://creativeclassstruggle.wordpress.com|title=Creative Class Struggle.|accessdate=2009-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2009, Creative Class Struggle and art magazine ''Fuse'' organized a public forum in Toronto to debate these issues.&lt;ref name=&quot;Whyte, Murray.

The '''creative industries''' refers to a range of economic activities which are concerned with the generation or exploitation of knowledge and information. They may variously also be referred to as the [[cultural industry|cultural industries]] (especially in Europe {{Harv|Hesmondhalgh|2002|p=14}}) or the creative economy {{harv|Howkins|2001}}.

Howkins' creative economy comprises [[advertising]], [[architecture]], [[art]], [[crafts]], [[design]], [[fashion]], [[film industry|film]], [[music industry|music]], [[performing arts]], [[publishing]], [[research and development|R&amp;D]], [[software]], [[toys]] and [[game]]s, [[Television|TV]] and [[radio]], and [[computer games|video games]] {{harv|Howkins|2001|p=88-117}}. There remain, however, different definitions of the sector {{Harv|Hesmondhalgh|2002|p=12}}{{harv| DCMS| 2006}}.Yet so far Howkins has not been internationally recognized.

The creative industries have been seen to become increasingly important to economic well-being, proponents suggesting that &quot;human creativity is the ultimate economic resource,&quot; {{Harvard citation|Florida|2002|p=xiii}} and that “the industries of the twenty-first century will depend increasingly on the generation of knowledge through creativity and innovation,&quot; {{Harv|Landry|Bianchini|1995|p=4}}. 

== Definitions of the creative industries ==
Various definitions on what activities to include in the creative industries have been suggested {{harv|DCMS|2001|p=04}}{{Harv|Hesmondhalgh|2002|p=12}}{{harv|Howkins|2001|p=88-117}}{{Harv|UNCTAD|2008|p=11-12}} and even the name itself is a contested issue - there being significant differences and overlap between the terms 'creative industries', 'cultural industries' and 'creative economy' {{Harv|Hesmondhalgh|2002|p=11-14}}{{Harv|UNCTAD|2008|p=12}}. 

Lash and Urry suggest that each of the creative industries has an 'irreducible core' concerned with &quot;the exchange of finance for rights in intellectual property,&quot; {{harv|Lash|Urry|1994|p=117}}. This echoes the [[United Kingdom|UK]] Government [[Department for Culture, Media and Sport]] (DCMS) definition which describes the creative industries as:
:''“those industries which have their origin in individual creativity, skill and talent and which have a potential for wealth and job creation through the generation and exploitation of intellectual property.”'' {{harv|DCMS|2001|p=04}}

The current DCMS definition recognises eleven ''creative sectors'', down from fourteen in their 2001 document. They are:

* [[Advertising]]
* [[Architect]]ure
* [[Antiques|Arts and antique markets]]
* [[Handicraft|Crafts]]
* [[Design]] (see also [[communication design]])
* Designer [[Fashion]]
* [[Film industry|Film]], [[Videography|video]] and [[photography]]
* [[Software]], [[computer games]] and [[electronic publishing]]
* [[music industry|Music]] and the visual and [[performing arts]]
* [[Publishing]]
* [[Television]]
* [[Radio]] {{harv|DCMS|2006}}

('Film and video' became 'Film, video and photography; 'Music' and 'performing arts' were combined to form 'Music and the visual and performing arts'; 'Interactive leisure software' was combined with 'Computer services' to form 'Software, computer games and electronic publishing')

To this list John Howkins would add [[toys]] and games, and also include the much broader area of [[research and development]] in science and technology {{harv|Howkins|2001|p=88-117}}.

Hesmondhalgh reduces the list to what he terms 'the core cultural industries' of [[advertising]] and marketing, [[broadcasting]], [[Film industry|film]], internet and [[Music industry|music]] industries, [[publishing|print]] and [[electronic publishing]], and [[computer games|video and computer games]]. His definition only includes those industries that create 'texts' or 'cultural artefacts' and which engage in some form of industrial reproduction {{Harv|Hesmondhalgh|2002|p=12-14}}.

The DCMS list has been influential, and many other nations have formally adopted it. It has also been criticised. It has been argued that the division into sectors obscures a divide between [[lifestyle business]], non-profits, and larger businesses, and between those who receive state subsidies (e.g., film) and those who do not (e.g., computer games). The inclusion of the antiques trade is often questioned, since it does not generally involve production except of reproductions and fakes. The inclusion of all computer services has also been questioned {{harv|Hesmondhalgh|2002|p=13}}.

Some nations, such as [[Hong Kong]], have preferred to shape their policy around a tighter focus on copyright ownership in the [[value chain]]. They adopt the [[WIPO]]'s classifications, which divide the Creative Industries up according to who owns the copyrights at various stages during the production &amp; distribution of creative content.

Others have suggested a distinction between those industries that are open to mass production and distribution (film and video; videogames; broadcasting; publishing), and those that are primarily craft-based and are meant to be consumed in a particular place and moment ([[visual arts]]; [[performing arts]]; cultural heritage).

== How creative workers are counted ==
The DCMS classifies enterprises and occupations as creative according to what the enterprise primarily produces, and what the worker primarily does. Thus, a company which produces records would be classified as belonging to the music [[industrial sector]], and a worker who plays piano would be classified as a [[musician]].

The primary purpose of this is to quantify - for example it can be used to count the number of firms, and the number of workers, creatively employed in any given location, and hence to identify places with particularly high concentrations of creative activities.

It leads to some complications which are not immediately obvious. For example, a security guard working for a music company would be classified as a creative employee, although not as creatively occupied.

The total number of creative employees is then calculated as the sum of:

*all workers employed in creative industries, whether or not creatively occupied (e.g. all musicians, security guards, cleaners, accountants, managers, etc. working for a record company)

*all workers that are creatively occupied, and are not employed in creative industries (for example, a piano teacher in a school). This includes people whose second job is creative, for example somebody who does weekend [[Gig (musical performance)|gigs]], writes books, or produces artwork in her spare time

== Properties or characteristics of creative industries ==
[[File:Township Cat.JPG|thumb|200px|A toy cat produced in a South-African township, made from used plastic bags and old wire]]

According to Caves (2000), creative industries are characterized by seven economic properties:

#''Nobody knows principle'': Demand uncertainty exists because the consumers' reaction to a product are neither known beforehand, nor easily understood afterward.
#''Art for art’s sake'': Workers care about originality, technical professional skill, harmony, etc. of creative goods and are willing to settle for lower wages than offered by 'humdrum' jobs.
#''Motley crew principle'': For relatively complex creative products (e.g., films), the production requires diversely skilled inputs. Each skilled input must be present and perform at some minimum level to produce a valuable outcome.
#''Infinite variety'': Products are differentiated by quality and uniqueness; each product is a distinct combination of inputs leading to infinite variety options (e.g., works of creative writing, whether poetry, novel, screenplays or otherwise).
#''A list/B list'': Skills are vertically differentiated. Artists are ranked on their skills, originality, and proficiency in creative processes and/or products. Small differences in skills and talent may yield huge differences in (financial) success.
#''Time flies'': When coordinating complex projects with diversely skilled inputs, time is of the essence.
#''Ars longa'': Some creative products have durability aspects that invoke [[copyright]] protection, allowing a creator or performer to collect rents.

The properties described by Caves have been criticized for being too rigid (Towse, 2000). Not all creative workers are purely driven by 'art for art's sake'. The 'ars longa' property also holds for certain noncreative products (i.e., licensed products). The 'time flies' property also holds for large construction projects. Creative industries are therefore not unique, but they score generally higher on these properties relative to non-creative industries.

== Difference from the 'cultural industries' ==
There is often a question about the boundaries between creative industries and the similar term of '''[[Cultural industry|cultural industries]]'''. Cultural industries are best described as an adjunct-sector of the creative industries. Cultural industries include industries that focus on [[cultural tourism]] and [[Cultural heritage|heritage]], [[museum]]s and [[Library|libraries]], [[sports]] and [[outdoor activities]], and a variety of 'way of life' activities that arguably range from local pet shows to a host of [[Hobbies|hobbyist]] concerns. Thus cultural industries are more concerned about delivering other kinds of value—including cultural wealth and social wealth—rather than primarily providing monetary value. (See also [[Cultural Institutions Studies|cultural institutions studies]].)

== The creative class ==
Some authors, such as the American [[economist]] [[Richard Florida]], argue for a wider focus on the products of [[knowledge workers]], and judge the '[[creative class]]' (his own term) to include nearly all those offering professional knowledge-based services. 
=== Difference from the 'knowledge industries' ===

The term creative industries begins to elide with [[knowledge economy]] and questions of [[intellectual property]] ownership in general.

=== The creative class and diversity ===
Florida's focus leads him to pay particular attention to the nature of the creative [[workforce]]. In a study of why particular US cities such as San Francisco seem to attract creative producers, Florida argues that a high proportion of workers from the '[[creative class]]' provide a key input to creative production, which enterprises seek out. He seeks to quantitatively establish the importance of [[Multiculturalism|diversity]] and [[multiculturalism]] in the cities concerned, for example the existence of a significant public gay community, ethnic and religious variety, and tolerance. {{Harvard citation|Florida|2002}}

== Economic contribution ==
Globally, Creative Industries excluding software and general scientific [[research and development]] are said to have accounted for around 4% of the world's economic output in 1999, which is the last year for which comprehensive figures are currently available. Estimates of the output corresponding to scientific [[Research and Development]] suggest that an additional 4-9% might be attributable to the sector if its definition is extended to include such activities, though the figures vary significantly between different countries.

Taking the [[United Kingdom|UK]] as an example, in the context of other sectors, the creative industries make a far more significant contribution to output than [[hospitality]] or [[utilities]] and deliver four times the output due to [[agriculture]], [[fisheries]] and [[forestry]]. In terms of employment and depending on the definition of activities included, the sector is a major employer of between 4-6% of the UK's [[working population]], though this is still significantly less than employment due to traditional areas of work such as [[retail]] and [[manufacturing]].

Within the creative industries sector and again taking the UK as an example, the three largest sub-sectors are [[design]], [[publishing]], and [[television]] and [[radio]]. Together these account for around 75% of revenues and 50% of employment.

The complex [[supply chains]] in the creative industries sometimes make it challenging to calculate accurate figures for the [[gross value added]] by each sub-sector. This is particularly the case for the service-focused sub-sectors such as [[advertising]], whereas it is more straightforward in product-focused sub-sectors such as [[crafts]]. Not surprisingly, perhaps, competition in product-focused areas tends to be more intense with a tendency to drive the production end of the supply chain to become a [[commodity business]].

There may be a tendency for publicly-funded creative industries development services to inaccurately estimate the number of creative businesses during the mapping process. There is also imprecision in nearly all tax code systems that determine a person's profession, since many creative people operate simultaneously in multiple roles and jobs.  Both these factors mean that official statistics relating to the Creative Industries should be treated with caution.

== Wider role ==
As some first world countries struggle to compete in traditional markets such as [[manufacturing]], many now see the creative industries as a key component in a new [[knowledge economy]], capable perhaps of delivering [[urban regeneration]], often through initiatives linked to exploitation of [[cultural heritage]] that leads to increased [[tourism]]. It is often argued that, in future, the ideas and imagination of countries like the [[United Kingdom]] will be their greatest asset; in support of this argument, a number of universities in the UK have started to offer [[creative entrepreneurship]] as a specific area for study and research. Indeed, UK government figures reveal that the UK's creative industries account for over a million jobs and brought in £112.5 billion to the UK economy (DCMS ''Creative Industries Mapping Document'' 2001), although the data sets underlying these figures are open to question.

In recent years, creative industries have become ‘increasingly attractive to governments outside the developed world’&lt;ref&gt;Cunningham, Stuart, Ryan, Mark David, Keane, Michael &amp; Ordonez, Diego (2008), ‘Financing Creative Industries in Developing Countries’, in Diana Barrowclough and Zeljka Kozul-Wright eds, Creative Industries and Developing Countries: Voice, Choice and Economic Growth, Routledge, London and New York, pp. 65-110.&lt;/ref&gt;. In 2005, the [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] (UNCTAD) XI High Level Panel on Creative Industries and Development commissioned several studies to identify challenges and opportunities facing the growth and development of creative industries in developing industries. As Cunningham ''et al.'' (2009) put it, ‘the harnessing of creativity brings with it the potential of new wealth creation, the cultivation of local talent and the generation of creative capital, the development of new export markets, significant multiplier effects throughout the broader economy, the utilisation of information communication technologies and enhanced competitiveness in an increasingly global economy’. A key driver of interest in creative industries and development is the acknowledgement that the value of creative production resides in ideas and individual creativity, and developing countries have rich cultural traditions and pools of creative talent which lay a basic foundation for creative enterprises.

[[Mental disorder]]s and [[creativity]] are popularly considered to be related, particularly in the case of [[bipolar disorder]], whereas [[Major depressive disorder]] appears to be significantly more common among playwrights, novelists, biographers, and artists.&lt;ref&gt; Goodwin, F. and Jamison, K. R., ''Manic Depressive Illness'', Oxford University Press (Oxford, 1990), p. 353.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the association between bipolar disorder and creativity first appeared in literature in the 1970s, the idea of a link between &quot;madness&quot; and &quot;genius&quot; is much older, dating back at least to the time of [[Aristotle]], and reinforced by the views of the [[Romanticism]] era.&lt;ref name=&quot;simonton2005&quot;&gt;

== Creativity and bipolar disorder ==
Many famous historical figures gifted with creative talents may have been affected by bipolar disorder. In many instances, creativity and psychopathology share some common traits, such as a tendency for &quot;[[thinking outside the box]].&quot; In addition, many people with bipolar disorder may feel very powerful emotion, potentially aiding in creativity. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/display/article/10168/52456?pageNumber=3&lt;/ref&gt; Because (hypo)mania decreases social inhibition, performers are often daring and bold. As a consequence, creators commonly exhibit characteristics often associated with mental illness. The frequency and intensity of these symptoms appear to vary according to the magnitude and domain of creative achievement. At the same time, these symptoms are not equivalent to the full-blown psychopathology of a clinical manic episode which, by definition, entails significant impairment.&lt;ref name=&quot;simonton2005&quot;/&gt; Many of these have been posthumously diagnosed as suffering from bipolar or unipolar disorder based on biographies, letters, correspondence, contemporaneous accounts, or other anecdotal material, most notably in [[Kay Redfield Jamison]]'s book ''[[Touched with Fire|Touched with Fire: Manic-Depressive Illness and the Artistic Temperament]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;TWF&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Touched with Fire: Manic-Depressive Illness and the Artistic Temperament|author=Kay Redfield Jamison|publisher=Free Press|isbn=978-0684831831|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Touched With Fire'' presents the argument that bipolar disorder, and affective disorders more generally,&lt;ref&gt;Jamison, K. R., ''Touched with Fire'', Free Press (New York, 1993), pp 82 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; may be found in a disproportionate number of people with creative talent such as [[actors]], [[artist]]s, [[comedian]]s, [[musician]]s, [[author]]s, [[Performing arts|performer]]s and [[poet]]s.

Several recent clinical studies have also suggested that there is a positive [[Correlation does not imply causation|correlation]] between creativity and bipolar disorder, although the relationship between the two is unclear.&lt;ref name=santosa2006&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Re’eh  Deuteronomy 11:26- 16:18

From the beginning of the scripture in Deuteronomy 11:26 to Deuteronomy 16:17,  there is a pattern of life for the believer’s life in worship through obedience, selflessness, and maybe most of all, the pathway to Yahweh’s eternal kingdom.  It all starts with a choice to be either obedient or disobedient to His commandments. 

Re’eh is translated “see”.  The complete understanding of this word is, “sight, the inheritance of God by the Ruach”.  An exegesis of Re’eh from the word etymology of the Hebrew gives the understanding of, “light of God brought down to man as an inheritance” and indicates light as an energy source which comes from God as an inheritance imparting “sight” the gift of God. It takes light to see.  Without the Light of God, mankind could not see or perceive truth. Moshe is telling us to “See”


'''Living in the Light of His Word'''

Moshe says to them “Behold (Re’eh) I set before you today a blessing and a curse.  The blessing if you obey/hearken (shema)... and the curse if you do not obey/hearken (shema)”.  As the rabbis point out, to hear (shema) is a metaphor for blessing, while to not hear (lo-shema) is a metaphor for cursing (Artscroll Stone Edition Chumash, p. 999).

Many today do not “see” obedience to Yahweh’s commandments as a blessing.  They truly think that they will be more blessed by following their own understanding of what is to their profit, therein disobeying Him.   It becomes selective hearing. The choice is always ours as to what we inherit.   Our misguided self-centred thinking will make choices that we perceive to be to good in that they satisfy our desires, but we will reap destruction from disobedience - i.e. refusing His instruction and going off according to our own understanding.  Galatians 6: 7-8

In Hebraic thought and according to the meaning of the Hebrew word ‘shema’, hearing and doing, are synonymous.   If one hears, but does not do what he has heard, then he has not heard.  Obviously, hearing, Hebraically, is more than an auditory function, but involves the heart resulting in corresponding actions resulting in either blessing (if one hears and obeys Yahweh’s Word) or cursing (if one does not hear and obey Yahweh’s Word).  (11:27-28)

Scripture prophesies that in the future a problem would arise among the people of Yahweh.  The problem would not be a famine of food and water, but of the ability to hear (shema) and to do the Word of God (Amos 8:11).  Likewise,  Isaiah prophesied that there would be those who would say (or “draw near with their mouths”) but who would not do (“but their hearts are far from me”) (Isa. 29:13).  Yeshua accused the religious people of that time of the same thing (Matt. 15:8-9).  We need to examine our words and corresponding actions to judge ourselves, as to whether our actions perfectly align to our profession of faith, or do we stand convicted before Yahweh of disobedience and/or hypocrisy?


'''The Blessing and the Curse'''

This week the Reeh portion continues Moshe’s admonitions to the sons of Israel by listing a number of commandments that keep one spiritually orientated and which when obeyed results in blessings, but when disobeyed cause us to become disconnected from Yahweh and the result is that we become a recipient of the curses.  

The opening verses spell out the dire warnings and establish this theme for the balance of the reading:   “See, I am setting before you today a blessing and a curse: the blessing, if you listen to the commandments of Yahweh your God, which I am commanding you today; and the curse, if you do not listen to the commandments of Yahweh your God, but turn aside from the way which I am commanding you today, by following other gods which you have not known” (Deut. 11:26-28).

A choice is presented to them, the way of blessing or the way of the curse.  What they reap will depend on how they ‘shema’ (hear) His Word and do it.  The two mountains which would signify the blessing and the curse are Eval and Gerizim. The mountain Eval, 940 meters above sea level, faces the north, and Gerizim, 880 meters above sea level, faces the south. In the valley between the two mountains is the city of Shechem. There was an important road that led through that valley. It was Israel’s line of contact with the rest of the world. It was a meeting place for travelers who came from the north, south, east, and west. This was the place where Avraham built his first altar, see Genesis 12:6-7, and where Yosef was buried, see Joshua 24:32.

Moshe just cannot get away from his mantra to the children of Israel regarding the necessity to obey the commandments, statutes and ordinances of the Eternal One.  Without a doubt, Moshe is most concerned about the propensity for the sons of Israel to follow after strange gods, having witnessed how readily the sons of Israel succumbed to the temptations provided by the Midianite and Moabite women as they had enticed the men of Israel into the sexual sins of Baal-Peor.  Now that the time had arrived for Israel to cross the Jordan River into the Land of Promise, Moshe expands upon the types of temptations that will meet the children of Israel upon their crossing, and introduces them to even more insidious temptations of the eventuality of various people arising in their midst who will be either adding to or taking away from His teachings,  
“Whatever I command you, you shall be careful to do; you shall not add to nor take away from it” (Deuteronomy 12:32).


'''Tests from Within and Without'''

Moshe again exhorts the people to abstain from socializing with the idol-worshippers, from giving credence to pagan ideas and influences.  For this purpose they are to cut down any trees, statues and altars which have been used in pagan worship and finally he assures them that God is always near and will always hear a contrite and repentant heart which seeks forgiveness.

“If a prophet or a dreamer of dreams arises among you and gives you a sign or a wonder, and the sign or the wonder comes true, concerning which he spoke to you, saying, ‘Let us go after other gods (whom you have not known) and let us serve them,’ you shall not listen to the words of that prophet or that dreamer of dreams; for Yahweh your God is testing you to find out if you love Yahweh your God with all your heart and with all your soul.  “You shall follow Yahweh your God and fear Him; and you shall keep His commandments, listen to His voice, serve Him, and cling to Him.  “But that prophet or that dreamer of dreams shall be put to death, because he has counseled rebellion against Yahweh your God who brought you from the land of Egypt and redeemed you from the house of slavery, to seduce you from the way in which Yahweh your God commanded you to walk. So you shall purge the evil from among you” (Deuteronomy 13:1-5).

The first groups of people that Moshe warns the children of Israel about are the false prophets and dreamers of dreams that will arise among the followers of the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.  These deceived people will actually come from within the ranks of the faithful.  Many may not even know that they are deceived, but truly believe that they are speaking for God.  They might have “heard a voice” or “had a vision” or “received a call” that they swear is from the Most High.  These self-deceived prophets are some of the most difficult to encounter because they speak their words with such personal conviction.  If you have ever been exposed to people like this you can understand how convincing they appear.  But that does not excuse the children of Israel from following their words that subtly moves them away from the Torah of Moshe.  To make things even more difficult for the sons of Israel, some of these false prophets and dreamers will actually be known for various “signs and wonders” that accompany their messages.  Once someone has personally witnessed a sign or wonder, the perceived credibility of the prophet or dreamer is elevated in the eyes of the witness.  People then naturally have a tendency to let their spiritual defenses down and begin to believe the words of the false prophet.   Once a degree of credibility is attained, the insidious teaching is introduced.  This can be very confusing to the faithful because visible signs and wonders are difficult to refute.  But the teachings that they profess will subtly direct people away from the Almighty.   The test of a messenger of God, is in what they speak, it must be according to the Word, not in the demonstration of signs and powerful gifts.

Yeshua Himself warned His disciples about this -   “For false Messiahs and false prophets will arise and will show great signs and wonders, so as to mislead, if possible, even the elect” (Matthew 24:24).
“You shall follow Yahweh your God and fear Him; and you shall keep His commandments, listen to His voice, serve Him, and cling to Him” (Deuteronomy 13:4).  After Yahweh, your God, shall you go – and not after idols.  Do not accept upon yourself to follow other gods, but rather commit yourself wholeheartedly to obey only Yahweh. “Going” involves decision.

And Him shall you fear – and not idols.  “Fear”, and reverence of Yahweh must be exclusive -- not coming under the fear of man.  And His commandments shall you observe – and not the dictates of the other practices, even if they are not actual idol-worship.  “Observing” refers to paying homage to the customs associated with idolatry.  

And to His Voice shall you listen – and not to the teachings of idolatry. “Listening” is learning, i.e. the truth in the Torah.  And Him shall you serve – No “service,” no worship, is due any but Yahweh. One must not even accede to the prophet’s recommendation to worship differently.  

And to Him shall you cleave  -- “Cleaving” to Yahweh means attaching oneself to Him and His Word, and not to those who have gone astray.  By following Yahweh, fearing Him, keeping His commandments, listening to His voice, serving Him and clinging to  Him, one should be able to avoid the pitfalls of the deception that is destined to come to every generation of followers of the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.  The false ‘prophets’ or proponents of the Word are of a worldly mind-set and are not subject to the Word of truth.  By this we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error.   Whatever does not agree with His Word is not of Him.  Such a person is of the spirit of an anti-messiah.  (See 1 John 4: 4-6)  Yeshua said, “By their fruits you will know them”  	Matt.7:15-20

While the false prophets and dreamers are dealt with by just retribution (capital punishment), there is another group of tempters that come much closer to home.  These are the immediate relatives that test our allegiance to the Holy One of Israel:   
“If your brother, your mother’s son, or your son or daughter, or the wife you cherish, or your friend who is as your own soul, entice you secretly, saying, ‘Let us go and serve other gods ' .. .. .. .. you shall not yield to him or listen to him; and your eye shall not pity him, nor shall you spare or conceal him.  “But you shall surely kill him; your hand shall be first against him to put him to death, and afterwards the hand of all the people”  (Deuteronomy 13: 8-11).   

Yahweh is absolutely concerned about the subtle ability of loved ones to turn people away from loving Him.  Remember He is a jealous God.  One’s devotion to Yahweh must be complete and uncompromising.   He expects us to love Him more than we do our own family members.   We need to remember that Yahweh is longsuffering in His love and desires that no one should perish but rather come to the knowledge of the truth through repentance.   There is no recorded instance of this having been literally carried out.

Yeshua also taught this principle, saying,   “If anyone comes to Me, and does not hate his own father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters, yes, and even his own life, he cannot be My disciple” (Luke 14:26-27).

Yeshua is saying is that one must place his love and allegiance to Him above his or her love for one’s family members or even one’s very own life.   Here Yeshua essentially says that it is going to cost you all that you have.  In other words, it is going to cost you your entire life, if you are going to be a true disciple of the Messiah of Israel.  Understanding what Moshe had to say to his listeners can be summarized by this statement which Yeshua made.

In the gospel according to Luke, Yeshua uses a parable to describe the complete surrender that is required by the faithful to become a disciple of His and enter into His kingdom.  (Luke 14:16-35).  In this parable, the head of the household who is preparing a big banquet is likened to our Heavenly Father who is calling all who will listen to come and partake.  Note that the “Master” sends out his slaves or bondservants to make the declarations to all who would hear that they are invited to attend the meal.  This could be compared to the Holy One using various Prophets and servants like Moshe to make declarations about what is required to maintain the proper relationship with the Creator, or this can mean each one of us who is called to be a bondservant of the Most High and give total allegiance to Him.  

In this parable, the results of inviting different people to the banquet are explained.  Some are caught up in the business affairs of the world.  Others have recently married and are more concerned about their honeymoon and relationship building with their new spouse.  All are legitimate responsibilities in life, but none should take precedence over the call to attend our Master’s call. 


'''The High Places'''   12: 1-7

We do not today have literal ‘high places’ where idolatry is enacted, but what are the present-day high places where the world has placed its altars to its gods that as a called-out people and a set-apart nation Yahweh is calling us to cast down and to destroy.  The love of the things of this world are idols and spiritual strongholds which hinder and/or prevent us from serving and obeying Yahweh with all our heart.  What is it that causes us to be insensitive to Him?  We need to examine what things keep us from hearing His voice and honouring all His commandments, from prayer and intimate times with Him.   

Make a check list - is it television, sports, your job and work schedule, family and peer pressure, fear, sinful habits and addictions, lust, greed, materialism and so on - What changes need to made to dethrone the ‘high places’, the things which have pre-eminence in our lives which are not centred on worship of Yahweh?
We must ask ourselves the question, “Do I have anything in my life that is connected to idolatry? Do I watch, or allow my children to watch television programs that have anything to do with sorcery, occult or new age themes? 

If we see anything in our lives that can give room for idolatry, we must be ruthless with ourselves, as Yeshua said in Matthew 5:29a,  “If your right eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out and throw it away from you.&quot;(HNV)

“You shall obliterate [destroy, put to death] their names” [the names of pagan gods].  As the Art Scroll Edition Chumash points out, not only was Israel to remove the idols themselves, but they were not even to refer to them by their proper names


'''The Place of Worship'''

The Targums Onkelos and Johnathan both say to go  “to the house of His Shekinah”, that is, the place where His Presence dwells.  He will dwell and presence Himself in the place of His appointment.  The place of choice is where to bring your tithes and offering and worship before Him.  Verse 8 says, “You shall not do as we are doing here today - every man doing what is right in his own eyes.”  We are to follow His instructions as to where to worship.


'''Honouring God With Our Substance'''

The pattern of tithes and offerings were set in place for the benefit of the people as they came to worship Yahweh.   
“These are the statutes and judgements which you shall be careful to observe” (12: 1).

When there is a hesitancy or reluctance to give, it is overcome by continually making it a practice to do so,  in obedience to Torah.  They also teach that giving based upon an emotional response to someone’s need is not true ‘tzedakah’, but rather a satisfying of one’s own heart and that the ‘exalted way of giving’ is with a pure heart in obedience to Torah and not because your own heart is grieved.   
King Shlomo (Solomon) says, “Honor God with your wealth” (Proverbs 3:9) and this is done by giving.  “Every man according to what he can give according to the blessing which Yahweh your God gives you.” (16:17)

Our finances are tight so we look to “see” where we can cut corners.   We think we can have this much more money in our budget if we quit giving God His tithe.  Yet, God tells us that withholding the tithe brings curses (Malachai 3).  Then they establish their icons, a fancy new automobile or other sacred possession, as a replacement for God, by paying their tithes to the title holder of that sacred idol.  Do not think you will be blessed for doing this!  If you want God’s favor you have to obey Him.

“These are the decrees and the ordinances that you shall observe… Destroy all the places where… worshipped their gods… bring your offerings, your tithes … your vow offerings and your free will offerings…. You may not eat the tithe… “ Deut 12:1-17;12:5ff, 

These tithes and offerings were those brought to the place of worship.
Proverbs 3: 9-10 says, “ Honour Yahweh with thy substance, and with the firstfruits of all thine increase: so that your barns be filled with plenty...” 

Luke 6:38 says, “Give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men give into your bosom. For with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again.” Giving (tithes and offerings) is a spiritual, kingdom principle and a key to blessings and success.

Earlier He told them, “But you shall remember Yahweh your God for it is He that gives you the power to get wealth, that He may establish His covenant ….” Deuteronomy 8:18


'''The Voice of the Hireling'''

If there arise - “a prophet or a dreamer”... “a sign or a wonder”. 
A prophet may claim to receive his vision or “word from Yahweh” while he was awake in a vision or in a dream while asleep (ASE Chumash, , p. 1007). A sign is a supernatural event in heaven while a wonder is a miraculous event on earth.  There are those among the people of Yahweh who, as Adam Clark states in his commentary on this verse, “pretend to have a Divine influence, so as to be able to direct others in the way of salvation”,  or shows some “miraculous proof of his mission...or some type of representation of what he wishes to bring you over to” (Vol. 1, p. 774).  (13:2-6) 

“You shall walk after Yahweh your Elohim, and fear Him, and keep His commandments, and obey His voice, and you shall serve Him, and cleave unto Him.”  (13:4)   Only by following this will we be preserved from hearing a false ‘prophet’ and be able to discern the difference between truth and error, from that which agrees with the Word and that which is contrary.   Yeshua said “My sheep hear My voice”  (John 10: 4-5)  If we know the voice of the Master, we will not follow the voice of strangers.  His voice is that which sounded out at Sinai of which Moshe is reminding them to ‘hear’ again, His commandments to them.

The Dead Sea Scrolls Bible quoting the Dead Sea Scrolls renders this verse as follows: “You shall walk after Yahweh your Elohim, and you shall serve Him, and listen to His voice, and cling to Him, and fear Him, and keep His commandment.&quot;

The editors of The Dead Sea Scrolls Bible comment that the syntactically (word order) variation between the two versions is significant since the latter reading offers a definition of what it means to follow Yahweh and a sequence in which the specified actions should be undertaken (p. 166, translated by Abegg, Flint and Ulrich).  These commentators state that the order in the DSSB gives us a better definition and a more accurate sequence of steps in the Believer’s growth in their walk with Yahweh.

Yeshua warned about false prophets in the latter days who would deceive many (Matt. 24:11) and false Messiahs who might even deceive the “very elect” (v. 24).  Paul talks about a “man of sin” that would arise showing signs and lying wonders such that some would fall from the truth of the salvation message of the Gospel (2 Thessalonians 2:1-12).

Paul warns, “do not be soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word... let no man deceive you by any means” (verses 2-3).  He then (in verses 15-17) encourages the brethren to stand fast in the simple truths of the Gospel of Yeshua:
“Therefore, brethren, stand fast, and hold the traditions which ye have been taught, whether by word, or our epistle. Now our Master Yeshua the Messiah himself, and Elohim, even our Father, which hath loved us, and hath given us everlasting consolation and good hope through grace, comfort your hearts, and establish you in every good word and work.&quot;

We need to take care that we are not being led astray from the simple Word of Yahweh, whether as found in the Tanakh (OT) or in the Apostolic Scriptures (NT) by people claiming to speak as an oracle from heaven.  Deuteronomy 13:3 says that Yahweh proves his people “to know whether you love Yahweh your Elohim with all your heart and with all your soul” by allowing such.

Jude, the half brother of Yeshua, speaking of the spiritual delusion to occur in the last days exhorts us to “earnestly contend for the faith which was once and for all delivered unto the saints” (Jude 1:3).  We must stand firm and earnestly contend every day for the true faith and not be allured by the siren’s song of the false prophets and teachers with demonstrations of ‘power’ in signs and wonders who lead people away from the Gospel truth into spiritual delusion and eternal oblivion.

And what is the voice of the Yahweh?  Is it not the Torah commandments that he audibly thundered from Mt. Sinai to the Israelites?  We do not have the right to be selective in our hearing and be one who “does what is right in his own eyes” (12:8).  

Do you make excuses why Yahweh’s words do not apply to you, why you are an exception to the rule and why your situation is unique and special?  Perhaps your finances, your marriage, your health, your family relationships and other areas in your life are a in disorder because you are not obeying Yahweh’s voice.  Stop and reflect for a moment on this.  Let the Ruach speak to you on this matter.  Then repent and resolve before Yahweh to change your attitude and course of life today!  (13:18)

“Now these things took place as examples for us, that we might not desire evil as they did.  Do not be idolaters as some of them were; as it is written, “The people sat down to eat and drink and rose up to play.” [Exodus 32:6, 32:19]  We must not indulge in sexual immorality as some of them did, and twenty-three thousand fell in a single day.  We must not put Messiah to the test, as some of them did and were destroyed by serpents,  nor grumble, as some of them did and were destroyed by the Destroyer.  Now these things happened to them as an example, but they were written down for our instruction, on whom the end of the ages has come.”   1 Corinthians 10:6 
The way of life is like a path between fire and ice.  The slightest bend in either direction is fatal.  What to do?  Walk in the middle…(Mishnah)   There is no room for God in those who are full of themselves…(Chassidic)

 
'''His Holy Sanctuary and Treasured Possession'''

“You are...a peculiar/treasured people unto Himself”. The term treasured people/am segulah is used several times in the Torah: in Exodus 19:4-6 when Yahweh betrothed Himself to and married the people of Israel they became  am segulah or treasured possession among all the peoples of the nation, a kingdom of priests and a kadosh/set-apart nation; then again in the present verse under analysis Moshe restates this same idea to the younger generation Israelites about to enter the Promised Land; and finally in Deuteronomy 26:17-19 where He again calls them  “treasured people” and admonishes them to keep His Torah-commands that He might “make you high above all the nations which he has made, in praise, and in name, and in honor, and that you may be a set-apart people unto Yahweh your God.”   The prophet Malachi (3:17) uses the term.  So does the Psalmist who, singing in the Jerusalem Temple, praises God for having ‘chosen Jacob – Israel – as a treasured possession’” (135:3-4).  

With humility and gratefulness we should own this identity and make it a part of our innermost being.  This is brought forward by Peter for the Spirit-filled believers in 1 Peter 2:9.  Note that Yahweh has chosen us from among all the peoples of the earth as an ‘am segulah’ - a treasured possession, His holy dwelling place  - 

“Do you not know that your bodies are the temple of the Holy Spirit which is in you, whom you have from God, and you are not your own?  For you were bought with a price, therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit, which are God’s” 1 Cor.6:19-20

If we know that we are a special treasure and a called-out people destined for great things in the kingdom of God will not the reality of who we are and whose we are and what we are to become, effect our walk of righteousness here and now and inspire us to walk a little higher, a little more set-apart, a little closer to Yahweh, and to be a better spiritual light through our words, thoughts and deeds to the unbelievers around us?  It should, if we love Him.

“Only at the place that Yahweh will choose...to place His name there....shall you seek out His Presence [habitation] and come there.” (12:5)   The word Presence (as translated in the AS Edition Chumash) is the Hebrew word sheken/!kv (Strong’s H7933/TWOT 2387) and as a verb means to dwell or tabernacle, as a noun it means dwelling, or tabernacle.  According to TWOT the verb is used 129 times in the Tanakh (OT) of which 43 times Yahweh is the subject; that is, it describes where he dwells (e.g., on Mt. Zion [Psa. 74:2], among his people [Exod. 25:8], or in Jerusalem [Zech. 8:3]).  On several occasions it refers to His divine and glorious Presence dwelling among His people (e.g., Exod. 24:16; Psa. 85:9).  

The word mishkan which was the portable tabernacle, sanctuary or earthly dwelling place of the glorious Presence of Yahweh among His people is derived from this word.  Yahweh is saying  NOT to go just anywhere to worship Him, but to go only to where he has placed His name.  That will be where his manifest glory and Presence is to be found!  Where you fellowship and worship Him collectively with other Believers is the manifest glory and Presence of Yahweh. 

When David hungered and thirsted for Yahweh he would seek the Presence of Yahweh in the Set-apart Place where Yahweh’s name and glorious manifest Presence was to be found.  There he would literally experience the Presence and gain prophetic insight and understanding.   Those who are indwelt by His Spirit  today form His corporate ‘tabernacle’  in which He can manifest His Shekinah glory and Presence.   Yeshua said “where two or three are gathered together in My name, there I am in the midst”   
The criteria is in it being in His name  --  all that He is and all that He represents, for His Presence to be manifest.


'''Living As His Set Apart People'''

We are to be the kadosh, set apart and peculiar or treasured people of Yahweh. What we eat is a key factor in being set-apart unto Yahweh (14:2) .   We need to learn to live by the “whole counsel of the Word of God” (Acts 20:27) and come away from the paganized practices of other religious institutions.   Eating the true spiritual food of the Word goes hand-in-hand with eating ‘kosher’ (sanctified) physical food.  Yahweh calls these unclean foods  an “abominable thing” (verse 3).   Do we have strongholds and altars to pagan gods of pleasure and self-satisfaction --   Is our ‘belly’ our god” ?  Philippians 3:19

Yahweh has given very strict guidelines for eating.  In Deuteronomy 14 Yahweh clearly states what is clean and unclean. The observance of these food laws is a means of worship and showing respect to our God.   Of course, there is a health perspective also, as the eating of carnivores is inherently dangerous; their flesh carries more parasites and enzymes that cause physical problems.   There is a popular adage, “Man is what he eats.” The character of a person is affected and ultimately molded by his diet.  For instance, eating very spicy foods makes one excitable and temperamental while bland foods are calming and relaxing. Eating blood makes a person insensitive and even cruel.  Children inherit the character traits of their parents, so avoiding certain foods not only benefits the parents, but also prevents the children from inheriting undesirable character traits.

Yahweh has appointed set-apart times for His people to gather and worship Him and remember the covenant and His plan of redemption.  Three times a year He has ordained for them to appear before Him. (16:16)
The Israelites and first-century Messianic Believers planned their entire year’s schedule around them – they were that important to them.  The Feast Days are the skeletal framework of Yahweh’s entire plan of redemption (salvation) of Israel.  One cannot in good conscience keep the weekly Sabbath without keeping Yahweh’s annual Sabbaths.  They stand or fall together. 

Chapter 16 describes the appropriate means of observing Passover.  We need reminders of what our Father has done for us, and of Yeshua’s marvelous sacrifice for our sins.  Just as the Father tells us how to observe Passover, we are reminded in 1 Cor. 5: 9-13 of the importance of sanctification and separation.  Here reference is made to Deuteronomy 22:21,24, saying “Root out the wrongdoer from your community.”  The picture of leaven comes to mind, as we examine ourselves. Deuteronomy discusses eating with foreigners, slaves and family, but points out that there are times when, in order to please Yahweh,  one must be cautious about eating with unbelievers. 1 Cor. 5:11 (Oxford Study Bible) says “I meant that you are to have nothing to do with any so-called Christian who leads an immoral life, or is extortionate, idolatrous, a slander, a drunkard, or a swindler; with anyone like that you should not even eat.”  So, let us be careful.  It may seem that Yahweh has many rules for his people, but it all seems to come back to relationships.  

Our relationship with him, through Messiah Yeshua, our relationship with the brethren and our separateness from the world’s ways. 

An exemplification of His love in His people is characterised by their expressions of love for the poor and the needy. (15:7–11) Charity is one of the central pillars of Torah.  It is a reflection of God’s very nature.  It is grace itself.  The Master quotes the Deuteronomy 17:11 saying, “You always have the poor with you,” (John 12:8), and He expects us to give generously to them.  A majority of the Master’s teachings have to do with the subject of giving charity.  He assumes that we will give charity, saying, “When you give to the poor…” (Matthew 6:2)  He points out that even the hypocrites give charity. After all, the giving of charity is a commandment of the Torah.  Conversely, there is a prohibition, “not to deny charity to the poor.”  We are under obligation to ‘freely open our hand to our brother, to the needy and the poor.’ (15:11)
Knowing the natural heart of man, Moshe says, “your heart should not be grieved when you give to him, because for this thing Yahweh your God shall bless you in all your works and in all to which you put your hand to”  (15:10)

Yahweh Himself will repay those who give to the ones He cares for and protects.  Some excuse themselves as having insufficient themselves, and therefore are not able to give.   The Talmud states it this way: “Everybody is obliged to give charity; even one who himself is dependent on charity should give to those less fortunate than himself.” (b.Gittin 7a)  It is a fact that you can always find someone less fortunate.

All of the Apostolic Scriptures, and especially the Pauline epistles, are packed with encouragements to give to those in need and to give generously.  Giving generously was a natural reflex of the First Century believers.  Paul regards giving generously as a proper response of gratitude for the grace which God has bestowed upon us.
When we give charity, it should be done subtly and quietly.  Yeshua tells us that when we give, we are not to announce with trumpets, i.e. we are not to make a show out of it, “that your giving be in secret.” (Matthew 6:4)  The true disciple asks “How much more can I give?  How can I find a way to give more?”
In the Midrash Rabbah it says, “The poor man does more for the giver than the giver does for the poor man.” (Leviticus Rabbah 34:8).  In Acts it says, “It is more blessed to give than to receive”  (Acts 20:35)   When we come across those in need, our hearts should leap with joy because suddenly we have the opportunity to return to Yahweh some of the wealth he has bestowed upon us.

When we celebrate our feasts we are instructed to share with the “stranger, the fatherless and the widow that is within our gates” This related to going up to the three festive occasions at Jerusalem.   We are to invite the needy to our festive meals and assure that they too rejoice in Yahweh’s goodness.  Consequently, one must “send for the poor” - either invite them to rejoice together with him, or send food to them so that they may rejoice in their own homes.  (14:28-29)

A person’s spiritual character is tested by how he keeps Yahweh’s commandments.   As with all we do, we need to align our actions and our lifestyle by the Torah - His set of instructions for us.
“Test yourselves to see if you are in the faith; examine yourselves! Or do you not recognize this about yourselves, that Messiah Yeshua is in you-- unless indeed you fail the test?  But I trust that you will realize that we ourselves do not fail the test”.  For all of our lives we are each going to be tested from within and without.   (2 Corinthians 13:5-6)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Shoftim-Judges  Deuteronomy 16:18-21:9

A detailed description is given in this parasha of the government which is to be set up to rule over the people and to guide them. Defined in the Scriptures are: the status of judges, how they are to be appointed, the principle by which they are to serve, the judicial system, the qualifications and selection of the king, the roles of the prophets, priests and Levites. These include the requirements for a judicial system, specific guidelines for a government headed by a king or regent, inheritance for the priesthood, prohibitions against various forms of false worship, how to deal with true or false prophets, the establishment of cities of refuge, laws regarding boundaries, commands for military warfare, and how to handle the discovery of a slain person in any tribal territory.

The main theme of this portion of Torah is summed up in one of the first verses: “Justice, only justice, you must pursue;…” Whether discussing the testimony of witnesses or the support of the Levites or the cities of refuge; justice has to be pursued in our lives.  Moving boundary markers or going to war or cutting down trees; we must know what is just.  And the purpose of providing judges is that if we aren’t sure, because sometimes the issue can get muddled, then Yahweh has provided that there be men and women (i.e. Deborah) with wisdom who sit in the position of ‘judges’.


'''Justice'''

The Shoftim portion concentrates on justice and what God requires of His people as they enter the Land of Promise.  The Creator, who is absolutely righteous and just, is very concerned that His chosen people maintain justice as they establish a governing system in Canaan.  For without righteous justice, God knows that any society will fail due to the human inclination toward evil inherited in the fallen nature.  Yahweh is very specific about these different areas of concern, because He recognizes that conflict is inevitable and that people need absolute rules and regulations in order to resolve conflict.  By detailing these ordinances from God, Moshe is giving the sons of Israel some fundamental guidelines for handling the different issues that will arise in the life of the nation.  Chapter 20 deals with the national army and war, a natural continuation of the subject of government in Israel. 

Israel has been called to be a “light unto the nations.”  Now, as the sons of Israel are preparing to enter into the Promised Land, Moshe will no longer be the person to turn to for resolution of conflict as he did in the wilderness.  As the different tribes inherit their specific territories, it will be incumbent upon each tribe to appoint judges to handle the conflict that is inevitable in human affairs and then over all a high court (the Sanhedrin) where matters which are not resolved by the lower courts in each locality may be taken.

Moshe lists a number of commands and criteria for the people who are to be appointed by the various tribes to function as judges and officers over disputes between people.  Yahweh God has designed man to be self-correcting and self-governing in order to maintain a testimony before Him in order to not incur His stricter judgment.

These principles were that they were to “judge the people with righteous judgment”, “not distort justice; .. not be partial, .. not take a bribe, .. ..  “Justice, and only justice, you shall pursue, that you may live and possess the land which Yahweh your God is giving you” (Deuteronomy 16:18-20).

The three basic criteria that Jethro originally counseled Moshe to discern in a judge were:  “men who fear God, men of truth and those who hate dishonest gain.”  (Exodus 18:13-24)   In many respects, these are similar character traits that Moshe is instructing the sons of Israel to find in the judges that will preside over conflict in each of the cities that will be established in the tribal territories about to be conquered.   

The first attribute that a judge must have is a healthy fear of Yahweh.  In selecting judges, one must understand that the fear of Yahweh is the beginning of wisdom.   (Proverbs 9:10).
Therefore, in the selection of judges, the people must discern that the judges truly fear the Holy One of Israel.  Fear generates wisdom, which in turn gives one knowledge and then understanding of the Holy One.  By fearing the Creator, one recognizes that His justice is absolutely perfect in all of its ways.  The goal is then to attempt to emulate His perfect justice and be partial toward the wealthy or the poor. 

The second attribute that a judge must have is to be a man of truth.  In other words, one needs to recognize that truth comes from the very Word of God embodied in the covenants and the testimonies of the Almighty.  By studying and applying the absolutes of the written Word, a judge is not relying upon his own standards but the standards of the Holy One.   (Psalm 25:9-10).   

The third attribute that is required of a judge is that he hates dishonest gain.  Moshe elaborates this point in this portion to further qualify the perversion of justice that comes from a bribe:  “and you shall not take a bribe, for a bribe blinds the eyes of the wise and perverts the words of the righteous” (Deuteronomy 16:18).  In this statement Moshe indicates that even the wise and righteous will be blinded if he is bribed.  Therefore, the need to hate dishonest gain is paramount.

The etymology of the Hebrew word for bribery “shochad”  is “chad” - “one.”  When a judge accepts bribery from a litigant he becomes “one” with him and he can no longer judge objectively the argument of the other litigant.  (according to the Gemara (Ketubot 105b)  Alternatively, according to the Gemara (Shabbat 10a), when a judge rules a case honestly he becomes a partner with Yahweh God.  An honest judge is one who has a mind of his own.  He does not permit people to influence him, nor does he waiver one iota from Torah teaching.  An improper judge is one who permits himself to be easily influenced by the whims and wills of those around him.  He is compared to a tree since he bends and sways to all sides in the wind of public opinion, trying to satisfy the group with the most potential for advancing his interests.  The Torah must be the basis of all judgement and although Rashi advocates obedience even if the authorities are in error this is not the meaning of the scripture. 

The bottom line for Israel is that God requires His judges to exercise, to the best of their human ability, justice that is a reflection of His perfect justice.  By placing the above criteria upon the judges selected for the different cities, Israel, or any subsequent society has the best chance of administering justice in a fair and equitable manner.


'''The Legal System'''

“Judges (Shophtim) and  police (or officers - shotrim) shall you give yourselves in all of your gates...” (16:18).  If a matter arises which is too complex [lit. too wonderful] for them to adjudicate and there was a controversy or disagreement which arose as to the guilt or punishment to be executed in the lower court of an area, then they were to get up and go to the Place, where Yahweh had placed His name to the priests and presiding judge there of the high court (the Sanhedrin) and bring the matter to them for them to make a ruling which then would be binding upon the lower court to execute.

Thus, the lower courts would not dispute with one another and the High Court would take final responsibility for transmitting the laws accurately.  Hence the Torah prescribes a legal system that consists of two circles. The outer circle involves the establishment of courts in “all of your gates,” while the inner circle describes a court that is located in the “place that God will choose” (i.e. the Temple), which serves as the final arbiter in all matters of doubt arising in the courts that are “in your gates.”  
“...for out of Zion shall go forth the law and the word of God from Jerusalem (Isaiah 2:3).”  A full measure of justice can take place only in the ‘presence’ of God -  “...in the midst of the judges, He gives judgment” (Psalms 82:1).

There were three types of courts in Israel.  One had three judges, another had 23 judges, and the last one had 71 judges.  Cities with a population of less than 120 people had a court, beit din, with three judges.  Cities with a population greater than 120 people had a beit din that consisted of 23 judges, which was called “a little  sanhedrin”.  Courts consisting of three judges could only judge cases concerning money . There had to be a court with 23 judges in order to pass judgments concerning life and death.  In Yerushalayim there were three courts, two with 23 judges and one with 71, where the high priest presided as the leader.  The one with 71 judges was called “the great Sanhedrin”, and is often translated as “the Sanhedrin”.  The men who made up the great Sanhedrin had a designated gathering place in the temple.


'''Authorities Ordained by Yahweh'''

In Exodus 21:22 and 22: 8 instructions for courts to resolve disputes was taught.  Now a formal command is given that they be established in every city of Israel.   In addition to judges (shoftim),  ‘shoterim’ also are required which function as officers of the court to carry out the court’s decisions and enforce the laws of the shoftim (judges).  These would circulate in the public places and summon violators and bring them to the court for adjudication.   A modern counterpart would be the function of sheriffs and deputies as officers of the peace (i.e. - police)  Officers are necessary to execute the decisions of the courts of justice.

These men were to serve Yahweh and teach the people according to Torah.  The Father was so sure of His appointments that He told the people they should be put to death if the people did not “then act according to what they (the Judges) have told you.”   And, it was to be the hand of the witness to the offence that was to be the first to execute the judgement, thus making that person responsible for their testimony, knowing that they would have to follow through and put their hand to the person, making a witness more careful to be correct in his testimony, understanding that it would mean the person’s life if they made wrong assumptions or their ‘evidence’ was not valid.  The life sentence also deters offenders.

When we come to the new covenant, the apostles were chosen by our Messiah Himself. Those apostles then fasted and prayed before laying hands on others, thus imparting to them the ordained authority to judge.  In our scriptures in Timothy, Paul warns “Do not be hasty in granting s’mikhah to anyone,” S’mikhah is the granting of authority by the laying on of hands, a Hebrew custom.  Yeshua referred to this system of justice in Matthew 18:15-20 where two or three are to decree the judgement.

 We are supposed to be able to trust the authorities Yahweh places over us if they have been divinely appointed.  Yeshua transferred the role of the ‘shoftim’ and ‘shoferim’ from the scribes and Pharisees who had continued the line of succession and sat in “Moshe’s seat” of authority,  to His chosen ministry of apostles and prophets.  (Matthew 18:15-20; 16:19; 23:2-3)

We see the exercise of this authority in Acts 15 regarding regulations for the believers coming to the faith from the “Gentiles”. We must begin to pray for mature men to arise in our assemblies and fellowships.  People who are humble, but sure of the place Yahweh has chosen for them to serve Him.  Older women also are to have a role in teaching the younger women - Titus 2:4
Let us seek after the wisdom of Yahweh for the controversies in our lives.   He has set up those to be judges.   Let us not presume to know what is best.   1 Timothy 5:17-21

“If a case comes before you at your city gate which is too difficult for you to judge, concerning bloodshed, civil suit, personal injury or ANY OTHER controversial issue; you are to get up, go to the place which Yahweh your God will choose, and appear before the priests, who are Levites, and the judge in office at the time.  Seek their opinion, and they will render a verdict for you. You will then act according to what they have told you there in that place which Yahweh will choose; you are to take care to act according to all their instructions.  In accordance with the Torah they teach you, you are to carry out the judgment they render, not turning aside to the right or the left from the verdict they declare to you.  Anyone presumptuous enough not to pay attention to the priest appointed there to serve Yahweh your Elohim or to the judge---that person must die.  Thus you will exterminate such wickedness from Isra’el---all the people will hear about it and be afraid to continue acting presumptuously.”  (17:8-13) 
Moshe is teaching respect and obedient to the spiritual leaders Yahweh has placed over us.   We must follow their wise counsel at all times and not only when it suits our fleshly nature, understanding of course that the leader’s appointment is legitimate.  


'''Establishing Evidence'''

Evidence is to be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses  (17:6 and 19:15).  One could not be accused of a crime without the testimony of two or three eyewitnesses.  This admonition is repeated in the apostolic scriptures.

• Matthew 18:16, “But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.&quot;

• 2 Corinthians 13:1, “This is the third time I am coming to you. In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established.&quot;

• 1 Timothy 5:19, “Against an elder receive not an accusation, but before two or three witnesses.&quot;

• Hebrews 10:28, “He that despised Moshe’ law died without mercy under two or three witnesses.”


Most gossip and slander would stop if this commandment were followed, and hence much division and strife within the Body of Believers.  How many times have you repeated hearsay and gossip without checking the source. Even if you know it to be true, is it beneficial and righteous to report it to others?  One Jewish rabbi goes so far as to say that Messiah has not come back because of all our gossip and slander.  At the very least, the Ruach is greatly grieved, our intimacy with Yahweh God is diminished, our marriages, families, friendships and congregations are hurt or destroyed because we speak things which should not be uttered.

How often do we accuse, slander, gossip about other people through use of the “evil tongue” (lashon hora) without going through proper channels and following proper protocols as Yeshua instructed in Matthew 18?  How often do we attack others and spread our evil reports and accusations about others when we were not eyewitnesses to what occurred or were not even involved in the matter?  How often do we attack Yahweh’s leaders and accuse them of evil when there are no other witnesses?  Yahweh hates those who sow discord among brethren and lying false witnesses   (Prov. 6:16-17,19). 


'''Cities of Refuge'''

Our parasha details the command to establish cities that are intended so that “anyone who has killed may flee there.”  The parasha is quite similar to the command to establish cities of refuge found in parashat Mas’ei (Numbers 35). 

In the Numbers portion, the definition of intentional murder and unintentional murder is made (35: 3-28).    In Numbers, the impression is that the city of refuge has legal significance, and that it serves two functions.  Firstly, it serves as a sort of detention center, facilitating protection of the slayer until he is brought to justice: “The cities shall be for you a refuge from the avenger, so that the slayer shall not die before he stands before the congregation in judgment.”  Secondly, after the trial, it serves as a sort of prison, where the slayer must stay – even against his will – until the death of the Kohen Gadol.   During this period, he benefits from the protection that the city of refuge provides from the avenger of the blood who is threatening him but also it is a form of punishment, and even if he wishes to leave, he may not.  It appears that, in principle, even an unintentional slayer is deserving of death, and under certain conditions he may in fact be put to death by the court – if he leaves the city of refuge.  Because he killed unintentionally, the Torah treats him leniently and allows him to exchange the death penalty – which he deserves – for a punishment of imprisonment.  It would seem, according to the Torah’s approach in this parasha, that a person is always held responsible for causing another person’s death, even if he did so unintentionally.  Therefore, the city is referred to as a “city of refuge,” serving as a “refuge from the avenger.”  This is based on the view that an unintentional slayer needs a city where he will be protected from the avenger, who is entitled to kill him.   The congregation is to make judgement on the situation and restore his to the city of refuge where he fled after the incident,   if he is not found guilty of actual murder.  Numbers 35: 5-6   He must remain there  - until the death of the High Priest which then serves as an atonement for his life.  Numbers 35:25-28

In contrast, in our parasha here, it seems that the city of refuge is not a punishment, but rather – on the contrary – a privilege for the unintentional slayer.  The difference is that this passage covers a more accidental situation which were not so much a matter of negligence or events which were not premeditated.  Society is obligated to attend to the unfortunate plight of these truly unintentional slayers – similarly to the institutions that exist today, such as shelters for women who fear husbands who seek to harm or even kill them.  This, then, is a public obligation: to ensure convenient access to the cities of refuge.  No mention is made of the prohibition of not being able to leave the city here,  this arrangement arises from the wishes of the slayer and his fear of the avenger; if he so wishes, he may leave the city.  This is a type of amendment to cover more accidental types of manslaughter - compare negligent or drunken driving to an accident that occurred from lack of visibility or an unexpected heart attack.

The entire unit is intended precisely to prevent the shedding of the innocent blood of the unintentional slayer, and this is the reason for the establishment of the cities of flight and the signposting of the way to them.  Bloodshed has a particular power to corrupt and pollute the earth.  (Genesis 4:10;  Numbers 35:33)  Therefore, aside from the demands of justice that murder be punished, there is a social necessity first of all prevent unintentional murderer,  and secondly to atone for the blood spilled without any murderer apprehended. This is the responsibility of society as a whole, as part of the mechanism of setting up a working responsible government whose role is to protect the foundations of society.  No other sin (other than idolatry) has this social effect, this degree of social perniciousness.

Numbers 35.30 and Deuteronomy 17.6-7and 19.15 require that the death penalty not be imposed unless there are at least two eyewitnesses who identify the murderer.  Criminals convicted of murder without the required two eyewitnesses were sentenced to life without parole, actually living out their life and dying in prison. 
The requirement of two eyewitnesses was likely to avoid executing an innocent person based on false testimony of a lone vindictive enemy of the accused.  Complicity of two false witnesses was considerably more difficult and risky. Police today know, however, that eyewitnesses are notoriously inaccurate.  In the panic of the moment eyewitnesses often misperceive what actually transpired, later disagreeing with one another.  Modern standards of DNA pattern-matching, fingerprinting and the like arguably make murder convictions more certain than the testimony of two eyewitnesses. 


'''A King in Israel'''  (17:14-20). 

It was Yahweh’s will for Israel to be ruled by a king, although when they did ask for a king it was born out of their fleshly desires and was therefore a rejection of Yahweh’s direct reign over them.  It was the desire to have a king ‘like’ the nations around them, according to secular law, rather than have a king Of God’s appointment ruling according to His Torah.  They were in effect, in rebellion against Yahweh and His laws.  Their first king Saul was the people’s choice, the second, David, was God’s choice. 

We see in the negative things outlined in this passage,  its fulfilment in Solomon, through his spiritual decline. 1 Kings 4:26 Solomon also had 40,000 stalls of horses for his chariots, and 12,000 horsemen.
1 Kings 11:3 He had seven hundred royal wives and three hundred concubines; and his wives turned his heart away. Not only is this passage talking about Solomon but it is also talking about anyone who would sit on the throne of Israel who is not part of Israel (v.15)  “you may not put a foreigner over yourselves who is not your brother.”  (05237  nokri (648d)  Meaning: foreign, alien  Origin: from the same as 5235b)  A perfect example of this is Herod. He was not a native son of Israel but was a “nokri”, a foreigner.  

Yahweh ordained righteous leadership to help guide His people in the ways of truth and righteousness.  When there is no leadership everyone does what is right in his own eyes as occurred during the time of the judges. 
The king was to know the Torah so that he could rule righteously based on the Word of Yahweh (vs.18-19).   He was to make two copies of the Torah and he was do this in the presence of the Priests and keep it with him and study it all the days of his life.  He was to keep one in his treasure chamber and the other was to go with him when he wherever he went so he would read from it daily and follow it in all that he did so that all would be well with him and his sons who would follow after him.

We might take this for granted but we know from reading the books of 1 and 2 Kings and Chronicles that the kings of Israel and then Judah and Ephraim, in most cases, did not do what the Torah said to do here.  Had the kings followed the Torah as Moshe had instructed at the command of God, things might have turned out differently.  

The book of Revelation says that the saints will be kings and priests ruling with Yeshua in the Millennium.  To be in that position of leadership we need to be preparing ourselves now.  The study of Yahweh’s Word needs to be a priority in our lives so that we may know how to execute righteous judgement in His kingdom.   How we prepare now for the future by our study and practice of Torah - His commandments, will determine our level of reward in Yahweh’s kingdom.  See  Matthew 5:19


'''The Office of the Levites'''

Moshe outlines the support for the Levites (18:1-8) who are to serve the people and then goes on to define the abominable practices practices by which the idolatrous people round about them seek guidance for their lives in contrast to the system He has established through the general instructions in His Word and officers and judges for specific needs.  (18:9- )

The listed abominations are  --
By Divination through 
*An Astrologer:-  an observer of clouds,: a star gazer, :and a soothsayer.  A horoscope reader today.
*An Enchanter:-  an omen reader or a fortune teller, this also includes superstitions
*A Sorcerer :-  one who uses drugs or herbs to cure or inflict disease
*A Charmer:-  one who casts spells
*A Spiritualist:-  one who consults spirits or who impersonates the dead - a medium.
*A Wizard/Witch::	-  one who consults familiar spirits or who has a spirit guide, i.e. occult practices
*A Necromancer	-  one who enquires of the dead

Yahweh makes it very clear that He has not appointed this form of spiritual guidance and that it was the cause of His judgement on the nations inhabiting the land prior to them.   But that He will raise up a Prophet like unto Moshe and to Him we are to listen.  The prophetic word of Yahweh would come through that One to guide  and teach them in the way they should go. 


'''The Prophet Like Moshe'''

In Deuteronomy 18:15–19 Moshe told the Children of Israel that Yahweh would one day raise a prophet “like me from among you, from your own countrymen.”  
The greatest of the prophets is Moshe, therefore the Torah is the greatest source of revelation. Yet the Torah itself speaks of another prophet, a prophet equal to Moshe… Messiah is the prophet like unto Moshe.  Therefore the life and ministry of Moshe serve as a Messianic prototype that the ultimate Messiah is expected to reflect.  The Jewish commentaries often refers to Moshe and Messiah, respectively, as the First Redeemer and the Ultimate Redeemer.  As a prophet like Moshe, the life and work of Messiah must reflect the pattern set by Moshe.

Both Moshe and Messiah are born in a time of national bondage.  Both redeemers appear after Israel waits generations for redemption.  Both redeemers are destined to break the bondage of Israel and lead her into the promised land.  Both perform unparalleled signs and wonders to validate their ministry.  Both act in the role of Law-giver and singular authority of Torah.  Both fill the role of intercessor between God and the nation.  Both do the work of reconciliation, renewing God’s covenant relationship with Israel when that covenant is compromised.

Through the course of His ministry, Moshe filled all three of the ‘Messianic’ offices for which a person received anointing with oil: prophet, priest and king.  He was the quintessential prophet, speaking on God’s behalf to the entire nation.  He served in the priesthood, sacrificing and performing the rites of a priest before Aaron and his sons were ordained.  As leader, judge and law-giver, Moshe served as a sort of king over Israel.  As with the First Redeemer, so too the Ultimate Redeemer.  
Yeshua is prophet, priest and king!

Moshe was unlike all other prophets because God spoke directly to him: conversationally, without riddles or mysteries.  Because of this unique level of revelation, when Moshe spoke as a prophet, his voice was the equivalent of the voice of God.  No other prophet attained the level of prophecy in which Moshe operated.  But the writer of the book of Hebrews demonstrates that Messiah’s revelation supersedes even that of Moshe.  Messiah is like unto Moshe in that He alone speaks directly for the Father.

Therefore, it is a command to listen to and obey the words of Messiah as if they were the words of Moshe—and even greater.  By calling Him a prophet like unto Moshe, and instructing us to heed Him, the Torah grants its own authority to Yeshua the Messiah. In inaugurating the new covenant,  He imparted the spirit of the Father (Ruach haKodesh) to His people to guide and teach them.

This was the ultimate fulfilment of this prediction, where every man would “know Yahweh” and discern His will, through the prophetic guidance of the Ruach Ha Kodesh (the holy Spirit)   John 16:12-15


'''Idolatrous Practices'''

Idolatry was singled out in this parasha as transgressing the covenant.  (17:2-3).  It is not so much as having violated a specific commandment, but that he is undermining the covenant in the Land of Israel. 

The second section states the prohibition of planting an ‘ashairah’ which was a grove of trees that was planted by the ancients for the purposes of idolatry. “Do not plant for yourselves an ashairah (i.e. a grove) of any tree...”.   There is an ancient custom to plant trees at the entrance of pagan temples, see Judges 6:30.  For this reason it is forbidden to plant trees on the temple mount. 

In Canaanite culture the placement of the tree next to an altar signified the presence of this goddess  to whom the sacrifices were offered.  The same thing was done in Baal worship.   The tree thus represented the presence of the ‘god’ to whom the sacrifice was offered on the altar beside it.  The tree planted is like any other tree.  It is the concept attached to it that transforms it into a forbidden object.
The literal meaning of the text seems to indicate a connection between the tree and the act of calling in God’s Name.  It is therefore likely that the planting of the tree was meant to indicate the sanctity of the place, as an expression of a god’s presence.  Thus, we are forbidden to erect objects even if they are meant only to represent the presence of God, as it were, and not Yahweh Himself.  Even if this action is meant to indicate to Whom we are offering our sacrifices or make the place itself sanctified/holy. 
 

'''Child Sacrifice'''

Child sacrifice (the ancient form of modern abortion/infanticide) though a pagan practice that Yahweh abhorred was practiced by both Houses of Israel as they drifted into syncretism with the heathen cultures around them (see 1 Kings 11:7; 2 Kings 23:10,13; 2 Kings 16:3;21:6; Jer. 7:31; 11:5; Ezek. 16:20; 23:37).  Baal appears to be a synonym of Molach (see Jer. 19:5) (Ency. Britan. eleventh edit, vol. 18, p. 676).  The dead bodies of sacrificed children were thrown into the garbage dump of the Valley of Hinnom or Tophet just below the Temple Mount in Jerusalem (Jer. 7:31; 19:5-6).  Apparently, the children were not burned alive, but were slain (by knife) like any other sacrifice before being thrown into the fire and then into the garbage dump
  
The ancients sacrificed their children to appease their blood thirsty gods of prosperity, sensuality and fertility (The Story of Civilization, vol 1, by Will Durant, pp. 66-67, 297). 
It was done in honor of their deity, i.e., that which was the king of their lives, i.e. it ruled their lives.  The chief deities of the modern world are Money and wealth - Sex and pleasure - Fun and entertainment.   Today parents abort their babies for much the same ‘gods’  as those of the ancients:  prosperity, greed, hedonism and so on.  Are we any different or any more “civilized” than the ancients? Yahweh called abortion an abomination (which means disgusting, abominable, abhorrent, detestable or loathsome) (Deut. 17:9). 
 

'''The Ultimate Prophet and Judge of All'''

In this passage that Moshe is declaring that eventually Yahweh will raise up a prophet like him, whose words MUST be followed.  It is from this passage that the ultimate justice for humanity will be executed.  Moshe declares that a future prophet will make declarations that must be believed.  As he introduces this future prophet, Moshe recalls the incidence that takes place at Mt. Horeb when he is receiving the Ten Commandments directly from the Almighty:  (Ex. 20:18-22).

The thunder, the lightning, the sound of the Heavenly Shofar and the smoking mountain terrified the sons of Israel witnessing this awesome display of His power.  It was at this time that they asked that Moshe be the spokesperson for Yahweh to avoid Him speaking to them personally again with all the manifestations thereof.   As Moshe describes a future prophet, he adds a statement that the sons of Israel MUST listen to him.  In fact, the future prophet will serve a similar role as Moshe.  God will put His words in his mouth which he will speak to all that he is commanded to speak.  

“Yahweh your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among you, from your countrymen, you shall listen to him.”  Then this sobering caveat is added:  ‘It shall come about that whoever will not listen to My words which he shall speak in My name, I Myself will require it of him”  (Deut. 18:15-19).

In the Gospel of John, Yeshua brings this passage of Scripture to light as He declares in so many words that He is the prophet that Moshe was speaking of in this passage rebuking them for not listening to him.   “For if you believed Moshe, you would believe Me, for he wrote about Me.  “But if you do not believe his writings, how will you believe My words?”  (John 5:18-47)

Yeshua makes it perfectly clear that He is from the Father and that He does nothing on His own initiative.  The words that He declares are the words of the Father.  These are the words that the Holy One requires all to heed.
Interestingly, it is in this passage that Yeshua states that in searching the Scriptures, men think they have eternal life.  Instead, it is the words of Scriptures that actually testify about the Messiah.  Those who search the Scriptures and do not understand that Yeshua is the future prophet that Moshe speaks of, are unwilling to come to Him in order that they might receive eternal life.

After Shavuot (Pentecost), the Apostle Peter is explaining about the Resurrection and Ascension of the Messiah to his listeners in Jerusalem and he had these words to declare:
“But the things which God announced beforehand by the mouth of all the prophets, that His Messiah would suffer, He has thus fulfilled.  “Therefore repent and return, so that your sins may be wiped away, in order that times of refreshing may come from the presence of Yahweh; and that He may send Yeshua, the Messiah appointed for you, whom heaven must receive until the period of restoration of all things about which God spoke by the mouth of His holy prophets from ancient time.  “Moshe said, ‘Yahweh GOD WILL RAISE UP FOR YOU A PROPHET LIKE ME FROM YOUR BRETHREN; TO HIM YOU SHALL GIVE HEED to everything He says to you.  ‘And it will be that every soul that does not heed that prophet shall be utterly destroyed from among the people.’  “ (Acts 3:18-26).   As Moshe had said, God would require it of the person who did not listen to Him. 

When you take this to heart and read and consider the words of Yeshua, recognizing that He is the future prophet that Moshe is speaking of in the Shoftim portion, you realize that His words MUST be believed or you will face eternal separation from the Holy One.  According to the statements of Moshe, Yahweh will require His children to believe the words of this future prophet.  
For those without faith, it is impossible to believe His words.  And yet God requires us to believe in them.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Ki Tetse-When You Go Out   Deuteronomy 21:10-25:19

Mostly Devarim (Deuteronomy) is a book of reminders of laws and statutes given previously and is preparation for entering the promised land.  If these commandments and list of admonitions had been adhered to perfectly, then it would seem that the results would be a society that is absolutely pleasing to the Holy One of Israel.  Situations regarding inheritance, rebellious children, capital punishment, property rights, clothing adornment, bird eggs, parapets, horticulture, fabric usage, marital and sexual relations, standards for the illegitimate, regulations regarding their relations with the neighbouring peoples, nocturnal emissions, sanitation, slave relations, promiscuity, lending restrictions, vow commitments, agricultural allowances, kidnapping, leprosy situations, prompt payment of wages, judicial regulations, treatment of widows and orphans, proper punishment laws (lashings), sibling relations, equal weights and measures, handling the Amalek (their enemy) problem just to name some of the details.

Moshe prescribes principles of domestic life, family laws, laws of equity, relationship of employer and worker, exercise of justice for the stranger, the orphan, the widow; kindness to animals and justice to their owners in regard to livestock; honesty and integrity in weights and measures.  It actually contains a total of seventy-four positive and negative commandments. 

Moshe gives a number of additional laws here that are to be observed as part of the new society, including rules about maintaining the purity of the military camp; prohibitions about returning an escaped slave; the duty to pay a worker on time; the proper treatment of a debtor and the prohibition against charging interest on a loan; the laws of divorce; the penalty of 39 lashes for transgression of a Torah prohibition; and the procedures for yibbum (“levirate marriage”) of the wife of a deceased childless brother. The degrading chalitzah ceremony (“removing of the shoe”) is explained for the case of a brother-in-law who is unwilling to marry the wife of his deceased brother.

In this Torah portion we see a plethora of laws concerning many seemingly small details regarding human life.  As we make our way back to a more biblically-based lifestyle and orientation we begin to see that Yahweh cares about the details of our lives.  Matthew Henry in his commentary says of these various laws: “God’s providence extends itself to the smallest affairs, and his precepts do so, that even in them we may be in the fear of Yahweh, as we are under his eye and care...If we would prove ourselves to be God’s people, we must have respect to his will and to his glory, and not to the vain fashions of the world. Even in putting on our garments, as in eating or in drinking, all must be done with serious regard to preserve our own and other’s purity in heart and actions.”   (22: 5-12)

Many of the laws of Yahweh’s penal code are preventative in nature.  Such is the case with the wayward and rebellious son. In ancient Israel there were no prisons since it was the goal of Yahweh’s Torah-laws to root out evil before it spread endangering society.  Parents’ love for Yahweh must supersede that of their children to uphold His standards and to prevent them from going down the path of faithlessness and rebellion  (21:18-21) 
Many of the mitzvot (commands) appearing in Parshat Ki Tetzei deal with relationships between men and women, several dealing specifically with marriage. According to the beginning of the Talmudic Tractate Kiddushin, the first verse of chapter 24 - when a man takes a wife” - serves as the textual basis for the contracting of marriages. 

A society depends upon the faith people place in one another.  Without people feeling that they can rely upon one another that others are looking out for what belongs to me and I must look out for what belongs to them society collapses in suspicion, selfishness, and bitter contention” (A Torah Commentary For Our Times, vol. 3, p. 149).   On the passage of returning lost property, one rabbinical commentator states: “The commandment to return lost property is ‘fundamental’ and that ‘all society depends upon it.’   In this respect let us not forget the second half of the shema: You shall love your neighbor as yourself.  It is not just a matter of one person taking care of another’s possessions or of ‘loving’ another. What is important here is the critical matter of ‘trust’ among human beings.   22:1-4


'''The Essence of Iniquity'''

Yahweh has given to us the model for living righteously in accordance with His principles and in harmony with  our fellow-man.  Using our own reasonings against complying with them,  is in effect lawlessness.  By rendering them of non-effect in our lives and thereby placing ourselves above Yahweh’s Torah-law,  we become a law unto ourselves, which scripture identifies as iniquity.  This is humanism: every man doing what is right in his own eyes, instead of obeying Yahweh whatever the cost.  The bottom line is, is Yahweh master of our life, or have we placed self on the throne of our life?  The essence of sin is living in independence of God, establishing for ourselves what is right and wrong in our own eyes and thereby being ‘as god’.   It was our rebellious sin nature which is bent on going our own way that took Him to the torture stake.

“All of us like sheep have gone astray, each of us has turned to his own way; but Yahweh has caused the iniquity of us all to fall on Him. .. .. ..  He was cut off out of the land of the living for the transgression of my people, to whom the stroke as due? .. .. .. Therefore, I will allot Him a portion with the great, and He will divide the booty with the strong; because He poured out Himself to death, and was numbered with the transgressors; yet He Himself bore the sin of many, and interceded for the transgressors” 
“For You do not desire sacrifice; else would I give it: You delight not in burnt offering. (51:17) The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart, O God, You wilt not despise.”   Isaiah 53: 6, 8,12;  Psalms 51:16

All of our service for Him and worship does not compensate for humble submission to His will to obey the statutes and judgements of God.  There is no special status which places anyone above keeping His commandments.  We can be someone special however, and have a part in Yahweh’s eternal plan and share in the glory of His will being done on earth as it is in heaven, simply by being obedient.  We cannot otherwise partake in His kingdom purposes.

As Yeshua said, “Not everyone who says to Me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ shall enter into the kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of My Father in heaven.  Many will say unto Me in that day ‘Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in Your name, cast out demons in Your name, and done many wonders in Your name?’  And then I will declare unto them, ‘I never knew you; depart from Me, you who practice lawlessness.  Therefore whoever hears these sayings of Mine and does them, I will liken him to  a wise man who built his house on the rock”   Matthew 7:21-24
   
Yahweh does not actually need us to fulfil His eternal plan, He doesn’t need you or me to get His job done!  He has an eternal plan and whether or not we obey His statutes and judgements, whether or not we clean up our acts and return to Him in repentance, whether or not we go out and come in when we’re told,  He will work out His eternal plan with, or without us.  He doesn’t depend on your or my obedience, or your or my ministry to get the job done, but whether we do or not will determine our eternal destiny. When we are submitted to Yahweh in the right manner, we’ll do the things He likes and we’ll make ourselves available to be used by Him.  When we’re submitted to Him we’ll be gathered under the shadow of His wings.

What do you do personally with laws about women wearing mens-type clothing, mixed fibres in clothing, lending without interest; caring for the widows and orphans, personal hygiene, family purity laws (e.g. men not having physical relations with their wives during their cycles), removing blood from all meat before eating it, men wearing beards, faithfully tithing, eating only kosher meats, keeping Yahweh’s Sabbaths (weekly and annual); etc.?  These are lifestyle changing laws, many of which go contrary to the culture of our society.  We are called to be a kadosh, set-apart, special and peculiar (i.e., treasured) people before Yahweh.  We need to examine what progress we are making to bring our lives into conformity to His standards of righteousness.


'''Rebellion in Society'''

The originators of a family are the parents, who are analogous to a vine, and the offspring are compared to the grapes.  The quality of the vine will determine its produce.   When a man and woman enter into marriage, it is extremely important that  they have similar views and mutual goals for the family they hope to raise. Unfortunately, the husband and wife sometimes do not see eye to eye in their aspirations for their children. The Torah is telling us that when a child is exposed to a “kol aviv” - “a father’s voice” - and a “kol imo” - “a mother’s voice” - each one telling the child different things, it is possible that the child, receiving mixed signals, may end up being wayward and rebellious.

“If an ish (man) have a stubborn and rebellious son, who will not obey the voice of his ‘ab (father), or the voice of his ‘em (mother), and, though they chasten him, will not listen to them;  then shall his ‘ab and his ‘em lay hold on him, and bring him out to the elders of his city, and to the gate of his place;  and they shall tell the elders of his city, This our son is stubborn and rebellious, he will not obey our voice; he is a glutton, and a drunkard.  All the men of his city shall stone him to death with stones: so shall you put away the evil from the midst of you; and all Yisrael shall hear, and fear.”   Deuteronomy 21:18-23

This appears like a cruel and heartless act especially if you are a loving parent.  Take a closer look at what we are being told here.  First of all careful reading of this passage clearly informs us that the subject is not your ordinary child. It could seem from the text that the judges simply took the parents word as to the condition of the child and immediately passed judgment and had the child stoned to death but cases were always judged on the testimony of two or three witnesses.  Deut.17:6-7
A thorough investigation of the situation had to follow the charges supported by eye witnesses to the conduct of the child.  The fact that the ‘ab and ‘em chastened him/her, obviously countless of times due to stubbornness and rebellion, clearly indicates that these parents tried everything possible to correct their child so as to get them back on the right track.  Nothing obviously worked.  In total exasperation and frustration over the situation and the condition of their child; stubborn, rebellious, a glutton and a drunkard (remember these charges), they bring him/her to the Shoftim who were always available at the gates of each city.

The biblical implications of the charges made against the child of stubbornness, rebellion, gluttony and drunkenness are all direct affronts to Yahweh Himself when parents are teaching their children His principles.   Such a child is set upon rebellion against Yahweh and the judgement to be administered is for the preservation of a righteous community by removing the leaven from the midst of it.   This was to prevent the inevitable crimes which he would commit if allowed to enter into society as an adult.
The phrase “stubborn and rebellious” in Hebrew has the implication of one who throws off the authority of both parents and Yahweh God.  It is not simply a ‘naughty child’, and the expression of a ‘glutton and a drunkard’ is more than eating and drinking in excess, it is literally a lifestyle of riotous debauchery - a person who has no control over his passions and his life.

There are no recorded instances of this judgement being executed.  The decree itself was a preventative measure and a strong incentive for parents to fulfill their obligation to teach their children and instill in them the Torah and also cautioned the children, knowing the ultimate judgement that awaited them if they continued in rebellion (Deut. 6:6-9).  We have the results of this principle not being applied today in laws favouring children over their parents.  As a result laws actually punish the parents who try to strongly discipline stubborn and rebellious children.  These are the chaotic results of our disobedience to His laws.

In Luke 7:34, Yeshua alludes to this passage when He says, “The Son of Man has come eating and drinking, and you say, ‘Behold, a gluttonous man and a drunkard…’” These are two of the criteria the Torah requires for putting a rebellious son to death.  Yeshua was contrasting His approach to piety with that of John the Immerser. Unlike Yeshua, John practiced a severe asceticism and ate only locusts and honey, whereas Yeshua ate and drank freely. The same people who criticized Yeshua for eating and drinking freely, regarded John’s behavior as demonic.  Regarding John’s asceticism, Yeshua remarked, “For John the Immerser has come eating no bread and drinking no wine, and you say, ‘He has a demon!’” (Luke 7:33)  In other words, the opponents of the gospel of repentance dismissed John on the basis that he was an ascetic, and they dismissed Yeshua because He was not an ascetic.  Accusing Him of being a glutton and drunkard, they attempted to associate Him with the rebellious son of Deuteronomy 21.


'''Co-laborers with Him”'''

The children of Israel were to be a holy nation with just laws and a righteous judicial system which was covered in the previous parasha, Shoftim.  The logical next step in the process of building a nation based on righteousness, would be to regulate how individuals relate to each other.  It is for this purpose that KiTeitzei recites all these commandments.  We all as children of our heavenly father need to come under His discipline and be corrected that He may receive us as true sons.

“For consider Him who endured such hostility from sinners against Himself, lest you become weary and discouraged in your souls.  You have not yet resisted to bloodshed striving a against sin. .. .. My son, do not despise the chastening of Yahweh, nor be discouraged when you are rebuked by Him;  For whom Yahweh loves He chastens, and scourges every son whom He receives”   Hebrews 12: 3-4, 5-6

Yeshua was judged and found guilty in the Roman court of justice by the testimony of false witnesses and executed by the hand of Rome’s might.   In this regard, Yeshua was initially charged with blasphemy by the Jewish leaders of His day (Matt. 26:65; Mark 14:64; John 10:33) - an offence that was punishable by stoning (Lev. 24:11-16).  However, the provision made in the Law for an offender to be “hung on a tree” was used to justify the sentence of death by Roman crucifixion (Matt. 27:31; Mark 15:13-4; Luke 23:21; John 19:6, 15).   He stood in for us when it should have been us who should have been placed on the tree to die for our sin.  The Father loved us so much that He asked His Son to die in our place because He knew only the death of His Son could wipe the slate clean.  
Paul wrote, “Messiah redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us - for it is written, “Cursed is everyone who is hanged on a tree” (Gal. 3:13).  The Apostle Peter also had this in mind when he wrote: “The God of our fathers raised Yeshua, whom you killed by hanging him on a tree” (Acts 5:30; cp. Acts 10:39-40); and, “He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, that we might die to sin and live to righteousness.  By his wounds you have been healed.”   (1 Peter 2:24).

These scriptures relate to a person whose sin is worthy of death, if he is hung on a tree, his body is to be taken down and buried that same day so that the land is not defiled by the accursed person (21:22-23).  This is what happened to Yeshua the Messiah, but He suffered this death because of our sin of rebellion, not His own!  We were the ones who were rebellious, acting like gluttons and drunkards in our rebellious attitude towards our heavenly Father, by disobeying Him even when He took the time to teach us His ways over and over. 

According to the Mishnah (Sanhedrin 6:4), a pole with a horizontal beam was erected and the dead man’s hands were bound and slung over the beam, leaving the body suspended.   In so doing it served as  a warning to others.  Besides the shame and degradation of this manner of death, the one so executed would be unable to fall to their knees as a final act of repentance before God, thereby implying that they were under the irrevocable curse of God.

Yahweh has two main plans that are work, for people individually and collectively as a nation.  The first is his plan for individuals and requires our participation and of course our cooperation.  How we as individuals as part of the greater community respond to these commands (mitzvot) effects our personal future, our communal future and over the short term, our nations future.  Our responsibility as children of God is to participate in His eternal plan by adhering to His commandments.  In doing so we will bring harmony to our lives and be CO-laborers with Him in accomplishing His will on earth.


'''Construction of Houses'''

When you build a new house, you shall make a parapet (MA’AKEH) for your roof, so you will not place blood (DAMIM) in your house if one falls from it (Deut. 22:8).   Although the word MA’AKEH has no parallel in the Tanach, it is clear from the context that it refers to an enclosure around the roof, a parapet or guardrail.  It is a provision for taking account for not being liable for another’s death.  “You shall not stand by while your fellow’s blood is shed”  Leviticus (Vayikra) 19:16   We are obligated to be concerned, beyond our own health and safety, with the health and safety of our fellow members of society.

In the “Laws of the Murderer and Protecting Life”, chapter 11, the Jewish sage Rambam codifies some of the details of these laws: Any house that is at least four cubits by four cubits, and is used for dwelling, requires the construction of a sturdy ma’akeh of ten handbreadths’ height. By extension, one must erect a sand wall around his well or cistern. One is similarly obligated to remove or repair every hazard: “R. Nathan says: Whence is it derived that nobody should breed a bad dog in his house, or keep a wobbly ladder in his house?  From ‘and you will not place blood (DAMIM) in your house’” (Bava Kamma 15b).


'''Marriage Laws'''

When a man hath taken a wife, and married her, and it come to pass that she find no favor in his eyes, because he hath found some uncleanness in her [Stone Edition Tanach: found in her a matter of immorality; found her offensive in some respect] then let him write her a bill of divorcement, and give it in her hand, and send her out of his house.   And when she is departed out of his house, she may go and be another man’s wife.   And if the latter husband hate her, and write her a bill of divorcement, and giveth 
it in her hand, and sends her out of his house; or if the latter husband die, which took her to be his wife;  Her former husband, which sent her away, may not take her again to be his wife, after that she is defiled; for that is abomination before Yahweh: and thou shalt not cause the land to sin, which Yahweh your Elohim giveth thee for an inheritance. (24:1-4)


'''''Divorce laws and a Get.''''' 

This verse forms the basis of the divorce laws of the Torah and the actual get or bill of divorce which was a written document that a husband gave to his wife because of some immoral activity on her part. (ASE Chumash, p. 1058). Yahweh himself divorced Israel and gave her a ‘get’ because of her unfaithfulness to him, though he never remarried. The prophetic implications of this are astounding in light of Yahweh’s divorce of unfaithful Israel and his eventual remarriage to her made possible by Yeshua’s death on the cross.  

The word uncleanness or immorality is the Hebrew word ervah (Strong’s #6172) which according to The Theological Wordbook of the Old Testament refers simply to nakedness or the resulting shame therefrom. Strong’s Expanded Concordance adds to this definition: an indecent thing or figuratively the idea of disgrace or blemish. According to Strong’s this word is used in a various ways in the Hebrew Scriptures (OT) with reference to shameful sexual exposure or nudity as in the case of unlawful cohabitation (Lev. 18:6), or the shame resulting from Israel’s spiritual adultery (Lam. 1:8); or any “indecent thing” that represents defilement or uncleanness resulting from the misuse of the physical body (e.g. uncleanness [due to not burying human excrement] in the military camp, or violation of any laws of sexual abstinence, or being in a state of impurity from sexual cohabitation or nocturnal emissions). With regard to Deuteronomy 24:1 Strong’s comments, “ervah appears to bear this emphasis on any violation of the laws of purity if a groom is dissatisfied with his bride ‘because he hath found some uncleanness in her,’ he may divorce her. Obviously this evidence is not of previous cohabitation (adultery), since such a sin merits death (Deut. 22:13ff).&quot;

The verse in 24:1 neither specifically states, nor implies that this is the first marriage for both of them. This is underscored by the Torah’s use of the Hebrew word ishah (wife or woman) in verse one as opposed to either the words bethulah or almah both of which lexically have stronger references to a virgin, youthful bride or young maiden as opposed to the more generic term ishah. Therefore, based on the generic meaning of the word ervah (as discussed above) a broader meaning than actual immorality is implied as to why the husband was compelled to “put his wife away”. 

Laws regarding Sexual Immorality. A man who falsely accuses his bride of being unfaithful to him before their marriage is to receive lashes and a fine. If the charges prove correct, however, the wife is to be stoned. If a woman commits adultery, both she and the man involved are to be killed.  One should not marry his father’s wife, or a member of Ammon or Moab.  Adultery and a lustful heart seriously endanger the soul and can lead one to eternal perdition.


'''The Priesthood of the Firstborn'''

“If a man has two wives, the one loved and the other unloved, and both the loved and the unloved have borne him children, and if the firstborn son belongs to the unloved, then on the day when he assigns his possessions as an inheritance to his sons, he may not treat the son of the loved as the firstborn in preference to the son of the unloved, who is the firstborn,  but he shall acknowledge the firstborn, the son of the unloved, by giving him a double portion of all that he has, for he is the firstfruits of his strength. The right of the firstborn is his”.  Deuteronomy 21:15-17

The first born son (haBen habechor) is to inherit a double portion from his father, regardless of the status of the mother. This passage is given in Scripture on how the inheritance of the firstborn is to be passed on.  In several situations man conspired to bypass this and in others God chose who would be the inheritor of the promise. Allowing man his free will Yahweh determines the fulfilment of His purposes, knowing in advance the disposition and the choices each person will make. This was the case with Jacob and Esau, where Esau defaulted in his calling of being the firstborn and Jacob inherited the blessing.  This was established by Yahweh’s foreknowledge before they were born  -  Genesis 25:23 

Esau’s fate was sealed before he was even created because God knew what was in his heart from before his conception. We are told Esau grew up to despise his birthright and the events worked out that Jacob obtained the birthright. Genesis 25:34 
Strongs gives the meaning for ‘despise’ as  - 0959 hz&quot;B’ bazah (102b)  Origin: a prim. root  Usage: careless(1), contempt(1), despicable(1), despise(5), despised(32), despises(2), disdained(1), disdained*(1)

The reality is God knew Esau’s heart as well as Jacobs. Though Jacob used fleshly methods to obtain the inheritance, Yahweh knew Jacob was the one who would seek after the things of the kingdom and therefore was qualified to receive the inheritance.  This also happened in the passing of the blessing of the firstborn from Reuben (firstborn of Jacob), to Ephraim the youngest son of Joseph and it would seem this particular commandment would fit the situation with Reuben and Joseph perfectly for two reasons.  Firstly Reuben defaulted in his sexual sin and thereby defiled his father’s marriage-bed whereas in contrast Joseph was proven under testing in this area and secondly,  Joseph was the firstborn son of Rachel the beloved wife of Jacob.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You want to insert or update attributes in a document.

(Note: The XQuery Update syntax below is specific to eXist and is not necessarily identical to that in the W3C XQuery Update spec. Full documentation of eXist's XQuery Update syntax can be found at http://exist-db.org/exist/apps/doc/update_ext.xml)

== Example Input Document ==

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;root&gt;
    &lt;message&gt;Hello World&lt;/message&gt;
&lt;/root&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Example of Attribute Insert ==
To insert a new attribute with the name of &quot;foo&quot; and a value of &quot;bar&quot; you an use the following example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
xquery version &quot;1.0&quot;;
let $doc := doc('/db/test.xml')/root
let $update := update insert attribute foo {'bar'} into $doc
return 
    $doc
&lt;/source&gt;

This will add a foo=&quot;bar&quot; attribute to the root element

== Result Document ==
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;root foo=&quot;bar&quot;&gt;
    &lt;message&gt;Hello World&lt;/message&gt;
&lt;/root&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Example of Attribute Update ==
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
let $doc := doc('/db/test/update-attribute/root.xml')/root

return update value $doc/@foo with 'new-value'
&lt;/source&gt;

== Result Document ==
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;root foo=&quot;new-value&quot;&gt;
    &lt;message&gt;Hello!&lt;/message&gt;
&lt;/root&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">The SMART-SIGNAL (Systematic Monitoring of Arterial Road Traffic and SIGNAL) system, developed by the University of Minnesota, offers an easily implementable approach to collect and archive continuous and high-resolution traffic data on signalized arterials (Liu et al., 2008). In this system, a complete history of traffic signal control, including all vehicle actuation events and signal phase change events, is archived and stored. Based on the event-based data, arterial performance measures, such as arterial travel time, intersection queue length, and level of service, are produced. The SMART-SIGNAL system has been installed on 11 intersections along France Avenue in Hennepin County, Minnesota, and 6 intersections along Trunk Highway 55, Minnesota, since February 2007. Event-based traffic data are being collected in a 24/7 mode and then archived in a database system, thus yielding a tremendous amount of field data available for research. This chapter will briefly introduce the system architecture, data collection hardware, and data processing procedure of the SMART-SIGNAL. 

== System Architecture ==
As illustrated in the following figure, the SMART-SIGNAL system has three major components, data collection, performance measurements, and performance presentation through user interfaces. The data collection component collects high resolution raw data directly from the field on an event-by-event basis. Signal phase change events and vehicle-detector actuation events are acquired separately from data collection units located in traffic signal cabinets. The data are recorded in daily log files and sent to a data server at the master cabinet by serial port communication. The daily log files are finally transmitted to a database located at the Minnesota Transportation Observatory (MTO) lab at the University of Minnesota through the Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) or wireless communication. The second component of the SMART-SIGNAL system is performance measure calculation using the field-collected data. Analysis of the stored data log files yields a set of performance measures, one covers intersection level measures (e.g. queue length) and a second related to arterial level measures (e.g. travel time). Once all performance measures have been derived from the raw data, the results are made accessible to a variety of users. 

[[Image: Smart-Signal-Fig1.PNG|SMART-SIGNAL System Architecture]]

== Data Collection Unit ==

The key element of the SMART-SIGNAL is the data collection unit, which consists of an industrial PC and a data acquisition card. At each intersection, an industrial PC with a data acquisition card is installed, and event data collected at each intersection is transmitted to the data server in the master controller cabinet through the existing communication line (in this case, spare twisted pair) between signalized intersections. The data acquisition cards (PCI-6511 from National Instruments (2006)) used in the SMART-SIGNAL system, as shown in Figure 2 2a, have 64 input channels. If the total number of detector inputs and signal phases for one intersection exceed 64, an additional data acquisition card needs to be installed. A terminal box is used in order to limit the input direct current (DC) to a safe range and establish the connection between the data acquisition card and back panel of the traffic cabinet, as shown in Figure 2 2b. The terminal box allows digital voltage changes on the back panel, which indicate different traffic events in the field, to be captured by the data acquisition card installed in the industrial computer. A traffic event recorder software program, developed using the Microsoft Visual C# program, runs on the industrial computer in the field to record the events (for example, a phase 1 green change from “ON” to “OFF”) into a log file. 

[[image: Smart-Signal-Fig2.PNG |Demonstration of the Traffic Data Collection Components ]]

Data communication between two controller cabinets is done using the existing twisted pair communication lines. A protocol of RS-485 is used to transmit data and synchronize time between cabinets (B&amp;B Electronics, 2007). After the data in the local cabinets is transferred to the master cabinet, DSL or a wireless unit installed in the master cabinet is used to send the data back to the database located in the MTO.

A sample of data is shown in the figure. Each logged event starts with a time stamp that includes the date, hour, minute, second and millisecond based on the computer system time, followed by different types of event data including phase changes, detector actuation and pedestrian calls. A complete history of traffic signal events is thus recorded.

For the Assembly Programmer:  This small program toggles the parser flag.  When the system executes an instruction, it checks the state of the parser flag to see if it is currently running a basic program.  If you ask me, that was a stupid thing they did, because it removes functionality from programs and the home screen.  If the parser flag is set, you cannot Archive or UnArchive, but if it is reset, you cannot test small snippets of code from the home screen.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The SMART-SIGNAL (Systematic Monitoring of Arterial Road Traffic and SIGNAL) system, developed by the University of Minnesota, offers an easily implementable approach to collect and archive continuous and high-resolution traffic data on signalized arterials (Liu et al., 2008). In this system, a complete history of traffic signal control, including all vehicle actuation events and signal phase change events, is archived and stored. Based on the event-based data, arterial performance measures, such as arterial travel time, intersection queue length, and level of service, are produced. The SMART-SIGNAL system has been installed on 11 intersections along France Avenue in Hennepin County, Minnesota, and 6 intersections along Trunk Highway 55, Minnesota, since February 2007. Event-based traffic data are being collected in a 24/7 mode and then archived in a database system, thus yielding a tremendous amount of field data available for research. This chapter will briefly introduce the system architecture, data collection hardware, and data processing procedure of the SMART-SIGNAL. 

== System Architecture ==
As illustrated in the following figure, the SMART-SIGNAL system has three major components, data collection, performance measurements, and performance presentation through user interfaces. The data collection component collects high resolution raw data directly from the field on an event-by-event basis. Signal phase change events and vehicle-detector actuation events are acquired separately from data collection units located in traffic signal cabinets. The data are recorded in daily log files and sent to a data server at the master cabinet by serial port communication. The daily log files are finally transmitted to a database located at the Minnesota Transportation Observatory (MTO) lab at the University of Minnesota through the Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) or wireless communication. The second component of the SMART-SIGNAL system is performance measure calculation using the field-collected data. Analysis of the stored data log files yields a set of performance measures, one covers intersection level measures (e.g. queue length) and a second related to arterial level measures (e.g. travel time). Once all performance measures have been derived from the raw data, the results are made accessible to a variety of users. 

[[File: Smart-Signal-Fig1.PNG|SMART-SIGNAL System Architecture]]

== Data Collection Unit ==

The key element of the SMART-SIGNAL is the data collection unit, which consists of an industrial PC and a data acquisition card. At each intersection, an industrial PC with a data acquisition card is installed, and event data collected at each intersection is transmitted to the data server in the master controller cabinet through the existing communication line (in this case, spare twisted pair) between signalized intersections. The data acquisition cards (PCI-6511 from National Instruments (2006)) used in the SMART-SIGNAL system, as shown in Figure 2 2a, have 64 input channels. If the total number of detector inputs and signal phases for one intersection exceed 64, an additional data acquisition card needs to be installed. A terminal box is used in order to limit the input direct current (DC) to a safe range and establish the connection between the data acquisition card and back panel of the traffic cabinet, as shown in Figure 2 2b. The terminal box allows digital voltage changes on the back panel, which indicate different traffic events in the field, to be captured by the data acquisition card installed in the industrial computer. A traffic event recorder software program, developed using the Microsoft Visual C# program, runs on the industrial computer in the field to record the events (for example, a phase 1 green change from “ON” to “OFF”) into a log file. 

[[File: Smart-Signal-Fig2.PNG |Demonstration of the Traffic Data Collection Components ]]

Data communication between two controller cabinets is done using the existing twisted pair communication lines. A protocol of RS-485 is used to transmit data and synchronize time between cabinets (B&amp;B Electronics, 2007). After the data in the local cabinets is transferred to the master cabinet, DSL or a wireless unit installed in the master cabinet is used to send the data back to the database located in the MTO.

A sample of data is shown in the figure. Each logged event starts with a time stamp that includes the date, hour, minute, second and millisecond based on the computer system time, followed by different types of event data including phase changes, detector actuation and pedestrian calls. A complete history of traffic signal events is thus recorded.

      <comment>/* The use of &quot;44&quot; */ new section</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">What about the alleged &quot;2&quot; in &quot;square&quot;? The problem, as stated, explicitly allows the square operator, and using ^2 or superscript 2 is only one of a number of ways of expressing that operator. The square of X equals X * X. It's really the same with the square root operator: we may represent the root to be found with the normal root symbol, and a number, i.e., 2 for a square root, or 3 for a cube root, etc., but, routinely, the root is taken as the square root if another number is not specified.

If the square or square root is not to be used, the problem should state that. Instead, it states the opposite, so the claims of an IP editor that these are not allowed, because they contain a &quot;two,&quot; are assertions involving a different problem. Many classical solutions found to the four fours problem involve the use of the square root operator, for some of the numbers, so it cannot be claimed that this is some deviation here. --[[User:Abd|Abd]] ([[User talk:Abd|talk]]) 20:56, 8 September 2010 (UTC)

Doing some more research on this, some sources -- including the Wikipedia article, don't allow the square, and some don't allow the square root on the same argument that would be used for the square. However, if we want to change the answers to not allow squares and/or square roots, the problem should be restated.

[http://wheels.org/math/44s.html] allows square root but not square.

Looking about, I see mostly the exclusion of the square operator, but, oddly enough, in one place, the allowance of the &quot;sqrt&quot; operator, which, of course, implies &quot;2.&quot; I.e., it is equivalent to exponentiation at 1/2.

The problem is arbitrary, actually. The set of allowed operators could be smaller or larger. A smaller set makes the problem harder, perhaps. The source I cite did have solutions for all integers up to 116 without using the square operator, but using the square root.

[http://www.math.toronto.edu/mathnet/questionCorner/fourfours.html] claims that without using the square root operator, it is impossible to represent 10. However, our page shows an obvious counterexample for ten. It's a good example of how a little knowledge is a dangerous thing, and especially when &quot;little&quot; is &quot;more than your average bear.&quot; Even a lot more. Experts make mistakes! --[[User:Abd|Abd]] ([[User talk:Abd|talk]]) 21:28, 8 September 2010 (UTC)

[http://www.dwheeler.com/fourfours/] explicitly considers the problem. The author, David Wheeler, establishes a hierarchy of allowed operators. For reasons which escape me, he considers square root part of the basic operators, but lists square -- a very simple operation known to grade schoolers early on -- as number six. He calls this an &quot;impurity factor,&quot; and, with the exception of square root, the operators he lists as basic don't imply some number. Percent, for example, impurity factor number 5, is division by 100. Before using square, he would prefer to use the overline, which, by the way, implies ten as a number base (as do some representations such as 44), an arbitrary root power (i.e., not merely two or four), the gamma function, i.e., (x-1)!, and percent. And he lists two more &quot;impure&quot; operators. Oddly, he seems to have a missing &quot;impurity level,&quot; because the basic levels are called &quot;zeroth,&quot; and he starts his numbering with level 2.

:I did not necessarily agree with the IP editor who stated we can't use squares either.  IMO, if squares are disallowed, sqrt should be too, and for the reasons Abd has stated.  Interestingly, the use of concatentation (i.e., 44) may or may not imply a base.  For example, the solution I added for 10 earlier today (44-4)/4 works for other bases as well, perhaps any base that can represent &quot;4&quot;. (I know it's true for bases 5, 8, and 16, but the answer of &quot;10&quot; is in the selected base.  Maybe that disqualifies it.) This is an unsupported assertion, but it could be correct. It's another example of &quot;little knowledge ;-)   Of course, that doesn't mean that concatenation works in other problems either.  All that being said, I do prefer solutions without sqrt or square, so I tried to find some. It's a fun exercise! --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 02:35, 9 September 2010 (UTC)
::Well, no matter what the base, (44-4)/4 is equal to 11-1 or 10, that's true. Obviously this is any base 5 or higher. However, what we are looking for is to calculate an actual integer, the tenth item in the list of integers, with nine items before it! I have ten fingers, &quot;ten&quot; is just name for that integer. If the base is 5, using the digits 0-4, &quot;10&quot; is equal to 5 base ten. It doesn't work, it's the fifth integer, i.e., the one matching the fingers on one hand.... So using positional notation as in 44 does require a &quot;number&quot; -- the base -- to be specified. It's base 10 in all the examples I've seen. If we really wanted to be tricky, we'd require the base to be four! But would this use up one of our 4s? Heh! This gives us another way to use a 4 in the process.... Anyway, I found those IP comments to be a bit rude, so certain of being right, as if there couldn't be variant rules. --[[User:Abd|Abd]] ([[User talk:Abd|talk]]) 05:05, 9 September 2010 (UTC)
:::But if the base were 4, we couldn't use &quot;4&quot; anywhere else in the numbers, as 4 is not a valid digit in base 4. :-)  I agree that the IPs comments were rude and that it was right to remove them. Thanks for doing so. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 11:13, 9 September 2010 (UTC)

== Square root operator ==

The problem allows the usage of the square operator and not the square root operator. Many revisions, including ones I worked on, overlooked this. Some users also used 44, contrary to another problem condition. (The problem is number base independent, to parse 44 requires assuming a number base, 10 was assumed, i.e., 44 = 4 x 10 + 4.) I have restored the answers given by the original author. I have not checked every one, that should still be done. --[[User:Abd|Abd]] ([[User talk:Abd|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Abd|contribs]]) 13:18, 5 March 2014 (UTC)

== The use of &quot;44&quot; ==

For one number, 43, I have been unable to find a solution that does not use either the square root function or the base-10 number &quot;44.&quot;

The original statement of the problem did not disallow &quot;44.&quot; This was added by [https://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Puzzles/Arithmetical_puzzles/Four_4s_Equal...&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=870399 this edit]. All versions here did not allow the square root operator, but most versions of the solution allowed that use.

So we have

43 = 44 - 4/4, very simple, fits the original problem, without the restriction on the use of 44. I have it listed with a note that this is the only answer that requires 44.

There is another answer, 44, which is much simpler that what is given if 44 is allowed: 44 = 44 +4 -4.

Many other versions on the internet of this problem do allow the square root operator.

I was temped to do as had been done for quite a while, list 43 as &quot;missing.&quot; Perhaps someone can think of a way to represent 43 without using 44. Or perhaps someone can prove that 44 is necessary (or the square root operator).

I personally prefer the problem as incompletely solved, it is pedagogically much more interesting that way. --[[User:Abd|Abd]] ([[User talk:Abd|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Abd|contribs]]) 23:03, 5 March 2014 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">====Chapter III: Living Standards====
 
The growth of the British economy kept pace with the population. There was a baby boom in the twenties, which is not surprising. At the other end of the age scale the advances in medicines - sulpha drugs and penicillin, stress prevention, and the treatment of shock, were some of the experiences gained from the battlefield. All these, and other treatments, raised life expectancy levels. This rise in the working population added over three and a quarter million to the workforce. This did not just improve production but also raised demand. This increase in working population now included a much larger share for women. Even though returning men from the war eased women out of jobs more associated with ‘men’s work’ the role of women would never return to those of pre-war. A far greater number of women were independent, earning their own living. Professions and occupations previously closed to women now received a number of applicants granted inclusion.

Reading certain history books - giving a social history of Britain, you might be lead to believe that by 1929 the mass of the population were leading a life different from that lived ten years before. It is not so. Some men had not worked continuously since returning home from the war... others engaged on one job at a time - competing for vacancies every morning. In the early thirties the newspapers were filled with stories of the nation’s economic troubles. There were millions unemployed and stories of unrest among the workers. There was real human suffering and the picture from the north of England was bad. The mills were silent, groups of idle workers on every street corner. Clogs were worn - echoed on the cobbles. Scores of children were undernourished. In many towns factories were being torn down for the bricks to be sold on as seconds. As will be pointed out this was a true picture of the industrial sector - up north.
  
1931 saw the faint glimmer of hope. The Chancellor of the Exchequer, Neville Chamberlain, was a skilled financier; he had already made a name for himself for being an excellent administrator when Minister of Health, now he was to show his skill attending to the nation’s money. His plan was to save by introducing cuts in wages and salary of all people, not just the lower paid. In a series of stringent budgets he presided over a policy of protectionism, great saving were made by converting two thousand million pounds of the five per cent War Loan to three and a half. By this time the schemes for house building had begun and more of the money saved went on rearming the nation. In 1937 the fifteen to sixty-four age group represented nearly seventy per cent of the working population. This added three-quarters of a million to the workforce over a period of thirteen years. The increase, in birth rate, life expectancy, and the resultant consumer spending generated by both, increased national output. These five key decisions: protectionism, reduced wages, realigned interest rate, stimulated house building, and rearmament saw the nation slowly begin its recovery - to begin a ten year cycle of improvement. This programme was mainly directed towards the industrial sector of society. Light engineering, the new sources of power, communications, and the service industries, were never as seriously affected by the depression.

During The National Government's years in office there was a steady improvement in the public’s standards of health. As well as a reduction in the death rate there was an improvement in a child’s life expectancy - deaths dropping by ten per cent. The normal teenager’s death rates: from scarlet fever, diphtheria, whooping cough, and measles, improved greatly – doubling in twenty years. There was a steady improvement in adult height and weight. The 1937, 'Survey of the Social Structure of England and Wales', considered that it was the improvement in: housing, water provision, sanitation, hygiene, and advances in medical skill which contributed to rise. This improvement was common throughout England. All covered by the 1936 Public Health Act, extended later to include the Food and Drugs Act. 

The new housing estates, the local planning authorities concern for recreational space, the nations completed sewer system, improved, nutritional diets, and greater health provision - through local cottage hospitals, maternity units and nursing and auxiliary services, all contributed to improved standards in public health. In 1934, an act was passed empowering local authorities to make free or subsidized milk available to schoolchildren. This was distributed in third of a pint bottles by classroom monitors providing a straw for each child. Three years later over three million children had the opportunity to drink milk. By 1935, there were two thousand three hundred doctors and five thousand three hundred nurses engaged in servicing the school’s medical services. In 1936, local authorities had to provide trained midwives. Three years later all schools in Harrow and District provided subsidized school meals, plus a percentage free for the needy.

The National Insurance Act 1912, applied to nearly twelve million workers… by 1921, fifteen million, and finally twenty million by 1938. The scheme provided a free doctor service. For families of insured workers – included most of the middle classes, reliance placed on private schemes and sick clubs. Other health services had to be paid for. Payment for a visit to the hospital in 1928 was a two tier arrangement split between local authorities and voluntary hospitals. Only the very poor had free treatment. Harrow was considered to be the best place to receive medical treatment and your chances of survival from treatment far greater. It has always been the case that life expectancy is greater where there is an improvement in living conditions - environment and diet.  In 1930, the BMA suggested a system of health insurance for practically all adults and their dependants. This would include dentists, maternity and ophthalmology. It took over fifteen years for the National Health Service to be fully operational – until after The Second World War.

All towns were provided with public lavatories, some more elaborate than others. North Harrow’s was a brick built and tiled roofed building - in an architectural style in keeping with all the local buildings, sited next to the services road. It boasted a permanent staff of an aged couple who were most particular how their toilets were turned out. The brass work shone and the tiled floor sparkled. The Association for the provision of Drinking Fountains and Horse Troughs had its beginnings in 1847 when the Liverpool local government bought out the private water companies. Their object was to construct public baths and stimulate interested parties to built drinking fountains. Twelve years later Samuel Gurney, a London MP, started an association with the aim of building drinking fountains to provide pure cold water… the first to be built on Holborn Hill on 21st April 1859. With the collaboration of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals drinking fountains for both humans and animals acclaimed as necessary public amenities… linking up with the evangelical movement gave the movement a strong link with the church. It became so popular that thousands of water troughs were installed on city and town streets. Henceforth, it became obligatory for local councils to provided space in all new town development. North Harrow had two, one on Station Road the other on Pinner Road, close to the town’s main cross-roads. By 1936, the association stopped building new troughs, as cars and trucks took over from the horse. However, more fountains were built at schools and parks… the metal cups chained to the bowls gave way to a small jet, for the sake of hygiene. West Harrow Park, Headstone Park and Pinner Park all were provided with a fountain, the most elaborate sited at West Harrow the oldest park of the three. The standard 1929 design can be seen at each in addition to the more elaborate commemorative fountains.

The dust cart came round once a week – on a Wednesday. The lorry was painted green and the collection was tipped into domed compartments covered by bowed sliding doors. Anything which could not be placed in the back of the cart was put on the roof. Every house had its own metal bin. I do not remember any complaint about having too much rubbish or throwing away an awkward shape or extra heavy item. Everything was taken away without question by the dustmen. The Road Sweeper pushed his metal sided cart to his allotted station, there he took from the rack his broad headed broom to sweep the pavements pushing the rubbish into the gutters. When he had finished the pavement he swept the rubbish into neat piles in the gutter to be later shovelled up and placed in his cart. At the end of his day he pushed the cart to a collection place behind the shops where the council dust cart carried the waste to the dump. All the pavements and roads were similarly treated there was never any rubbish left lying about. 

As unemployment rose, after The General Strike, into the thirties, a series of Government Acts were passed to provide extra levels of benefit. It was soon transparent that there were gaps in the payments, benefits and contributions. Many of the poor still had to apply to the Poor Law, and after 1929, to the Public Assistance Committees, of the local authorities. The government soon recognised the gaps - especially the exceptional diversity of employment. The Unemployment Assistance Board Acts of 1934/5 still didn’t seal the gaps and a further series of acts were needed. It took until 1937 for the majority of the unemployed that received assistance under the Public Assistance Committees of the local authority transferred to the Unemployment Assistance Board. By the early 20s the Family Endowment Society was advising a national family allowance system, providing 12s. 6d. per week for mothers, 5s. 0d. for the first child and 3s. 6d. for each subsequent child. This suggestion never got off the ground for it was considered by the government that this would destroy work incentives and reduce the mobility of labour. In 1931/2 Chamberlain took the issue out of the local authority hands and set up the Unemployment Assistance Board in 1934. By 1939/40 the government give way, but not for the original social reasons but to suppress wage claims, labour disputes, and therefore, to control inflation.  But the principle was laid…! The Beveridge Report 1942, made family allowance a cornerstone of social insurance.

It is perfectly understandable to find, in census figures, that congregations shrunk after each war, and did so throughout the passing centuries. The First World War had a profound affect on a society staggering from the unsettling results of a shifting population, buffeted, and confused, by industrialization. These uncertainties took their toll. Increasingly, in the twenties, Nonconformist, made inroads upon the established church. It was not because they required less commitment, but less ridged, and prescribed behaviour. Their services: complimented by, song, colourful-tracts, and religious-leaflets, drew-in their congregations - giving them a sense of belonging. Although the graph for York shows that Anglican attendees continued to dominate until after the Second World War, the Nonconformists were waiting to take up the reins soon after that. The figures for Catholicism, on the other hand, show a steady rise throughout the whole period. This is born out by what was happening in North Harrow. Between the wars the attendance figures for Baptists, Wesleyan, Methodists, United Free Church and Congregationalists showed little change. Their attendance figures, reflected the strength of the connection to the youth association, adopted by the church or chapel; for instance: a strong Boys Brigade Company saw a strong congregation. Similarly, Scout Group, or Church Lads movement. For well established churches, and chapels, that catered for the full range of young people, the attendances were higher still. As with all institutions, if they are run by a team of dedicated officers over a long period, and if the takeover, after they retire, is sound, church attendance figures stayed consistent... Although church attendances steadily declined, from the early, strict Victorian period, throughout all social classes, society continued to adhere to the churches principles and teachings. From the end of the thirties... into the war years... and beyond, those principles and teachings has been undermined, disregarded, and in some cases, abandoned. Nevertheless, the values, influencing the new culture, were Christian.

The vast majority of children attended State Schools working towards an in-school – set, marked, and invigilated, exam. I do not think that those children at the bottom of their year looked up to those above, nor do I believe that those in the highest streams looked down on those below. As far as I can remember it was a structured conveyor belt of things you had to do… you stepped on at twelve and alighted three years later. Not one of us displayed any fear for the future or suffered from sleep disturb nightmares. The future – leaving school for work, was another step on the path to adulthood. There was an abundance of jobs. What one ended up doing was as much to do with 'father’s job', as to the result of year’s report.

A number of boys quickly and quietly went from Secondary School to Polytechnic, Trade School or Technical College. They had worked out what they wanted to do. Others went to a prearranged apprenticeship. It wasn’t a question of this job, or that line, or this was paid better. It was up to fate, and a little luck. The Labour Party adopted the principle of secondary education for all, irrespective of the income, class, or occupation of their parents; that children maybe transferred at the age of eleven plus, from primary to one or other of the secondary schools, and remain there until fifteen. This principle was a cornerstone in the Hadow Report in 1923, and came into being in 1926. The two types of secondary school were, Secondary Modern Schools and Grammar. The children attending secondary modern schools were to leave at the age of fifteen. The Hadow Report was accepted but the implementation delayed by the poor state of the country’s economy. The majority of children by 1938 were operating within the reorganized secondary modern system. Some fee-paying schools, from the private sector, qualified for ‘direct grants’ for taking on a number of scholarship boys.

My primary school was Longfield. The class sizes in 1938/9 were between twenty-five to thirty children. The first class was The Introduction Class, a further three classes held a years difference between each. Similarly upstairs, the Junior School operated the same class structure – years 8/9, 9/10, 10/11. The school had been built at the same time as the rest of the town displaying the then modern style – brick walls, metal framed windows and a flat roof. All the furniture and equipment was new.
The New Secondary Education system followed the pattern voiced in the thirties – that there should be different schools for different abilities, and the children tested to decide which school system, at the age of eleven.It is impossible to write about England’s class structure without some reference to education. It is what is taught, how it is taught and why, that defines for the recipient where they fit in the social structure. Children are carriers of the parents assumed place in society. When educated they carry also the school’s aims and objectives which includes aspired place for their charges. This overlays their parents opinions, lies in sympathy with it, or, gives them their own place. It is highly likely that these opinions, shaped by heredity, environment, and education, are confused... can be easily changed, depending on circumstance. Class is a subject which will always have to be defined, and the answer will always include: the parents education, the home, the environment, the school, place in year, what university, which course, who taught it, and with what result. As today’s thinking suggests education is a continuous event… social class, for the individual, is beyond defining. 
  
In 1929 William Morris of Oxford was dominating the car production industry. He alone, out of fifty-eight companies, was way out in front, producing a series of models to take British car production ahead of France, to become Europe’s largest car producer. In 1937 Britain provided fifteen per cent of the worlds vehicle exports – a record level of production. By 1938 Morris Motors included MG, Wolseley, and Riley In 1939 Morris Motors produced twenty-seven per cent of the car market - the largest share. By 1924 Britain was producing 146,000 units; thirteen years later the figure was over three times that number. The years at Britain’s lowest production level – in the middle of the depression Britain produced more cars than in any previous year. By the end of our period there were nearly 400,000 employed in motor manufacture. In 1935/6 a popular model could be bought for half the cost of one produced ten years before. The motor vehicle industry was closely linked to aircraft production, motor cycling, push bikes, electrical engineering and kitchen equipment. The whole industry was sixty per cent higher in 1937, than the figures for 1924. From the early thirties rearmament boosted up production in electrical and mechanical engineering – particularly those industries closely linked to military vehicles and aircraft. The chemical industry developed many new materials from oil: Plastic, rayon, synthetic dyes, fertilizers, animal food and gas. The industry employed 100,000 by 1939, catching up fast on engineering. Once again, rearmament served the chemical industry well creating many new materials and uses.

The largest influence to change society forever was the cinema. The life-styles, values, language and music of American film producers exerted pressure, which, through a weekly injection, altered mainly working class morals, behaviour, speech and expectations. Many of Britain’s best actors and comedians followed the trail to America when jobs were hard to find here. To stimulate British films production the Cinematograph Films Act of 1927 was introduced. A wave of lavish productions by Alexander Korda, through London Films, tried to wrestle work away from America. It failed, not having the production cost effective. A spate of cheap ‘quickies’ also failed to satisfy quota requirements. Eventually the Act was modified in 1938, and again later, evened out production schedules and quotas. Another film company in 1928, built upon the Neptune Film Company, became established as the Ideal Film Company, owned by Ludwig Blattner. The Blattner Studio was leased to Joe Rock Productions who bought the company, the whole eventually becoming British National Films Limited. Gainsborough Film Company was also operating at the same time producing comedy films with Will Hay.

Associated British Cinemas, established in 1927, merged a number of Scottish cinema circuits… becoming British International Pictures, later absorbed into Elstree Studio complex – Graham/Wilcox company. This merged with British National Studios. During the 1930s grew to become ABPC. The owner John Maxwell died in 1940 his widow sold out to Warner Brothers. In America Warner Brothers developed the Vitaphone, sound on disc system, producing The Jazz Singer. This was the start to Hollywood musicals. MGM won the first Oscar for the musical Broadway Melody in 1929, following the Wall Street crash. Busby Berkeley reshaped the musical stage with his cleaver editing and unusual camera angles. The first animated musical was Walt Disney’s Snow White and The Seven Dwarfs. Quickly followed by MGMs 'The Wizard of Oz' in 1939. The thirties was a period stage stars turned to the film studio for work including Fred and Adele Astaire, Nelson Eddy and Jeanette MacDonald. It was in the 1930s that a series of British film comedies lifted the British cinemas audiences. The works of Will Hay, Old Mother Riley, George Formby and Max Miller drew in the crowds.

Rank’s venture into film making began when he was a Sunday school teacher. He punctuated his teaching with showing religious films to his own class and to other schools. Eventually he made his own and the distributed them. The Methodist Society complained that about the negative influence American films were having on young people. Rank took up the challenge to make his own ‘family friendly’ films. Within British National Films Company J Arthur Rank created Pinewood Film Studios. He found that after making Turn of the Tide he could not get it screened – the American movie industry denied access. Rank solved the problem by buying a large part of both the distribution and exhibition systems – formed a partnership with C M Woolf to create General Cinema Finance Corporation. He then used that company to buy out General Film Distributors, the UK arm of Universal Pictures. By 1937 Rank consolidated his film making business in both Pinewood and Denham Film Studios, within a new company called the Rank Organisation.By 1939 four million cinema seats gave daily access to the false, romantic, sham and colourful escapism of Hollywood… The first Technicolor film musical was The Wizard of Oz and from 1939 there was a string of fantastic musicals still produced on the stage today. The following year Rank bought the Odeon cinema chain, and Amalgamated Studios in Elstree. The Rank Organisation then bought Gaumont–British Picture Corporation and Lime Grove Studios. The following year negotiated to buy Paramount cinema chain, in 1942.

The country’s citizens were entertained by other popular mediums: the radio, football and boxing. These sops to the daily grind of life, supplied relief replacing religion which never recovered from the tragedy and farce of The First World War. Churchgoers fell from twenty per cent to twelve, between 1910 and 1960 From the start of the thirties consumerism manifested considerable influence: there was more to buy, a more colourful society to copy, more money in the housewife’s pockets and jobs were becoming available. Things were looking up…!

Harrow, as we know it today, was a merger of Harrow-on-the-Hill Urban District, and Wealdstone and Hendon Rural Districts in 1934. The town’s chief claims to fame are its public school, church and hill, upon which both sit. Prior to the 1920s its population gathered around the hill unevenly spreading further out towards London. Every town in the vicinity had its own cinema. Naturally the largest town required the largest cinema which more often than not the smartest. Harrow had its Granada cinema which boasted an organ – the only cinema that had one close at hand. In 1929 there were about four thousand cinemas in Britain. The Granada was, when built, considered to be one of the new super cinemas that could seat upto four thousand patrons.

The Harrow Coliseum, as with all large theatres of the day, was resplendent in gold paint and red velvet cloth. The carpets, thick and lush, and the seats, soft and springy. All covered in red velvet with gold headed nails. It represented ‘High Victorian’ design - mouldings and motifs, statues, niches and plaster cornicing. The Coliseum was opened in 1940 in Station Road, Harrow, by Queen Mary. The auditorium, circle and boxes designed to seat two-thousand patrons in luxury. The theatre was closed fifteen years later, in 1955. The original site was a 1922 cinema, foundered by the owners of Hammer Films – whose doors opened to the public in 1923 to great acclaim.

The Local Authority Greenhouses and Nurseries were situated at West Harrow Park. It is important to explain that Parks, Gardens and Walks were under the authority that maintained and stocked their gardens, verges and beds. To be able to do this there was an organized nursery system large enough to cope with all their needs. It was on a grand scale overseen by the Head Gardener. His position was guaranteed by his previous experience… upheld by the gardeners below him - maintaining a high standard. All the Borough’s flower beds were immaculate, every bit as good as those seen at large holiday resorts on the coast. A competition was held by all the parks as to who’s the best each year. This prize was eagerly sought after and suitable notices and reports made in the local newspapers. The only way a gardener could apply for an advanced position, if he could show how well his gardens performed in competition. West Harrow Park had a paddling pond that provided space for those keen enough to sail their model boats. The park held the local tennis courts and Bowling Green as well as providing a bandstand. The park was for perambulating not for children’s games, running about or cycling. The grass was perfect and the flower beds a riot of perfectly formed colour and floral design. Headstone Manor Park was home to Bessborough Cricket Ground, circled by stately elms. Pinner Park had a fountain, and Streamside Walk meandered beside the River Pinn, bridged over to allow movement along the further bank. All these local parks were perfections of horticultural splendour policed by park keepers who stopped children running, cycling or walking on the grass. They were places for peace and quiet providing seating for contemplation and rejuvenation.

===C initialisation of SDL===


&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;


&lt;/source&gt;




===C++ initialisation of SDL===

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;SDL/SDL.h&gt;

#include &quot;Application.h&quot;

//Extern'd in Application.h; Used as forefront to access everything we create =D
Application* pApp;

int main(int args, char* argv[])
{
    //Create the application on the heap for actual use
    pApp = new Application();

    //Initialize the application. If something fails, return -1 (I like -1 for errors)
    if(pApp-&gt;Init() != true)
    {
        return -1;
    }

    //This should successfully run our application
    //Should go through Input, Logic, and Rendering
    pApp-&gt;Run();

    //This will clean up everything, deallocating dynamically allocated memory
    //Uninitializing SDL, etc.
    pApp-&gt;Quit();

    //Out of habit, I always check to make sure a pointer has a value (other than NULL)
    //Before I deallocate it. I also ALWAYS set it to NULL immediately after.
    //Good habit to get into because it is preventative for memory leaks
    if(pApp)
    {
        delete pApp;
        pApp = NULL;
    }

    //Lastly, end the application, returning 0 to indicate that nothing went wrong
    return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;


&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#ifndef APPLICATION_H_INCLUDED
#define APPLICATION_H_INCLUDED

#include &lt;SDL/SDL.h&gt;

class Application
{
private:
    //We'll keep adding here as we go along

    bool m_bDone;
public:
    Application();
    ~Application();

    bool Init();
    void Run();
    void TakeInput(SDL_Event* pEvent);
    void Update();
    void Render();
    void Quit();
};

//We'll use this global pointer to access things like the window later on
extern Application* pApp;

#endif // APPLICATION_H_INCLUDED

&lt;/source&gt;



&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#include &quot;Application.h&quot;

Application::Application()
{
    //Standard constructor we'll use to initialize variables with default values

    //The program just started, we certainly are not done yet!
    m_bDone = false;
}

Application::~Application()
{
    //Here, we'll deallocate any dynamically allocated memory we may have missed
}

bool Application::Init()
{
    //Initialize SDL and return false if anything goes wrong
    //We'll add more initializations here for anything else we use
    if(SDL_Init(SDL_INIT_EVERYTHING) != 0)
    {
        return false;
    }

    //Lastly return true to indicate that the initialization was successful
    return true;
}

void Application::Run()
{
    //This function implements our loop
    //Any calls that should be made each frame should be put in this loop

    //the m_bDone variable will track whether the program is ready to exit
    while(!m_bDone)
    {
        m_bDone = true;
    }
}

void Application::TakeInput(SDL_Event* pEvent)
{
    //We'll use this function to take input from the user and act upon it
}

void Application::Update()
{
    //This is where all the magic happens!
    //After receiving input, this is where we act on that input
    //and actually make things happen =D
}

void Application::Render()
{
    //Here, we will draw our images to the screen
}

void Application::Quit()
{
    //Uninitialize SDL, we'll also deallocate any memory we dynamically allocate
    SDL_Quit();
}

&lt;/source&gt;




===2D platformer pseudo code===

&lt;pre&gt;
game loop 

while( SDL_PollEvent( &amp;event ) )
      {
        myHero.handle_input();
            //If the user has Xed out the window
            if( event.type == SDL_QUIT )
            {
                //Quit the program
                quit = true;
            }
        }

    
    myHero.move( blahbox );
    
    //Set the camera
    myHero.set_camera();


handle_input()

    if( event.type == SDL_KEYDOWN )
    {
        
            if( SDLK_LEFT ) { xForce -= HERO_WIDTH / 2; }
        
            if( SDLK_RIGHT ){ xForce += HERO_WIDTH / 2; }
        

    }
    else if( event.type == SDL_KEYUP )
    {

            if( SDLK_LEFT ) { xForce = 0; }
            if( SDLK_RIGHT ) { xForce = 0; }
        

    }

move()

void Hero::move(SDL_Rect blahbox)
{
    //Move the dot left or right
    if( xForce != 0 ) { xAcc = xForce / HERO_MASS; }
    if( xForce == 0 ) { xVel = xAcc = 0; }
    xVel = xVel + xAcc;
    box.x = box.x + xVel;


    //If the dot went too far to the left or right or touched a wall
    if( ( box.x &lt; 0 ) || ( box.x + HERO_WIDTH &gt; LEVEL_WIDTH ) || check_collision( box, blahbox) )
    {
        //move back
        box.x = box.x - xVel;
    }

}

what i was going for is force is applied when a key is pressed,  

acceleration = Force / Mass
Velocity = Velocity + Acceleration
etc...
&lt;/pre&gt;

SDL uses event-based input. All SDL apps are handling events by themselves. Therefore, every SDL app starts a busy loop on AROS, using as much of CPU time as possible. It seems also that the SDL software is badly written and most of the code uses event pooling (instead of waiting for events) and small delays, like [http://www.gamedev.net/community/forums/topic.asp?topic_id=360184 here]. It also seems, many programmers do not care at all if a SDL game consumes 100% of cpu time even in idle state. 

&lt;pre&gt;
st=SDL_GetAppState();
if ((st==SDL_APPACTIVE) || (! st) ) SDL_Delay(1000)
else SDL_Delay(0)
PollEvents...
...
&lt;/pre&gt;

Colors in SDL are usually stored in Uint32 variables.  This type (and others) is defined by SDL so that you can be sure that you get exactly 32 bits on every different platform/OS, rather than the ambiguous 'unsigned int'.  On a 32-bit surface, each color component gets 8 bits.  If I write a hexidecimal constant like so: 0x50a600ff, and the pixel format is ARGB, then my components would be alpha = 0x50 (80), red = 0xa6 (166), green = 0x00 (0), and blue = 0xff (255).  There you can see that color components range from 0 to 255 (256 values).  These components can each be stored in Uint8 variables.

SDL uses the standard coordinate axes for computer graphics.  The point (0, 0) is in the upper left-hand corner of the screen.  The x coordinate increases to the right, and the y coordinate increases downward.  This does have a small side-effect that the coordinate system is left-handed (angles are measured clockwise).

It pays to wrap certain things in your own functions.  For example, you can write a function that draws an image to the screen, taking just the surface pointer and coordinates.  Found it very easy to wrap both keyboard and joystick handling into one function, so my game accepts either input method for a particular player and the code to use it is nice and clean.








==openGL==


OLD STYLE OpenGL 1.1    - Immediate mode: glBegin(), glEnd(), glVertex() etc 

NEW STYLE OpenGL2 3 4 - [https://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Aros/Developer/SDL&amp;action=edit Vertex Arrays ] 




=== OpenGL 2, 3 and 4 - Shaders and co ===


glColor() - Even if often used with immediate mode, this is ok for setting a constant color for further vertices to draw.

glNormal(), glTexCoord() - As with glColor(), although it's quite rare to set these to a constant value.

glTranslate(), glLoadMatrix(), glMultMatrix() etc. - These are the way to do transformations.

glMatrixMode() - Used to change which matrix to apply changes to. Don't do glFrustum(), glOrtho(), gluPerspective() or similar each frame (unless its arguments change). In most cases,this belongs to your reshape function.

 NOTE: all of the previous functionality is deprecated, and done quite differently in &quot;modern&quot; OpenGL



glEnableClientState(), glVertexPointer() (and equivalent for normals, texcoords, color), glDrawArrays(), glDrawElements() - While deprecated, the &quot;idea&quot; is generally the same (but used functions different) with modern OpenGL. Give OpenGL a pointer to elements, which it will draw. Of course you want to use VBO (upload the data to graphics ram) when possible. You can do this with few #ifdef's if you want to compile your code also for platforms that already support it.

GL_POINTS, GL_LINES, GL_LINE_STRIP, GL_TRIANGLES, GL_TRIANGLE_STRIP, GL_TRIANGLE_FAN - These are still around in every OpenGL (or OpenGL ES) implementation. Use freely. 

NOTE: all previous functionality (except immediate mode) works with OpenGL ES1. OpenGL ES2 uses shaders extensively, and it's not possible to write code that works both on TinyGL or OpenGL1 and OpenGL ES2 without using lots of #ifdefs or similar, assuming you do something more complex than clear the screen with the specified color.

GL_QUADS, GL_QUAD_STRIP, GL_POLYGON - AVOID. Deprecated, and missing from both OpenGL ES1 and ES2. Use indexed GL_TRIANGLES or GL_TRIANGLE_STRIP instead.

VBOs (Vertx Buffer Objects) with texture atlases (create one big texture with all your textures in it uing [http://www.opengl.org/wiki/Array_Texture Texture Arrays]) - use multiple VBOs, one for each texture atlas - 

shaders 

use the OpenGL state machine more optimally. Switching between shaders and textures are often more expensive than actual draw calls, so one has to design the code in such a way that this switching is minimised, e.g. perform all the draw calls that need a specific shader and texture before switching to another shader and/or texture.

 $fa is the minimum angle for a fragment. The default value is 12 (degrees)

 $fs is the minimum size of a fragment. The default value is 1.

 $fn is the number of fragments. The default value is 0.

When $fa and $fs are used to determine the number of fragments for a circle, then OpenSCAD will never use less than 5 fragments.

 $t

The $t variable is used for animation. If you enable the animation frame with view-&gt;animate and give a value for &quot;FPS&quot; and &quot;Steps&quot;, the &quot;Time&quot; field shows the current value of $t.

* &lt;font size=3&gt;After the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991, the constituent countries, including Russia, returned to their former separate and independent status. Soviet inscribed stamps (“CCCP”) continued to be used without alteration for many years. (See [[International Postage Meter Stamp Catalog/Union Of Soviet Socialist Republics|UNION OF SOVIET SOCIALIST REPUBLICS]] for these issues.) Catalogued in this section are stamps inscribed “RUSSIA”, “РОССИИ”, “РОССИЯ”, “ROSSIJA”, “РФ” (''RF = Russian Federation'') or are without country inscription but have a Russian town mark.

* The stamps are grouped according to appearance:
:: A - Provisional issues without country inscription
:: B - Frank is upright octagon
:: C - Frank is horizontal octagon
:: D - Frank is rectangular
:: E - Frank is irregular shape&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

==&lt;font color=blue&gt;GROUP A: Provisional issues without country inscription==
* &lt;font size=3&gt;All have octagonal franks with inner rectangular box around the value figures.&lt;/font&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{TopNav|cat|next=Relational Databases}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;
The main drive behind a relational database is to increase accuracy by increasing the efficiency with which data is stored.  For example, the names of each of the millions of people who immigrated to the United States through Ellis Island at the turn of the 20th century were recorded by hand on large sheets of paper; people from the city of London had their country of origin entered as England, or Great Britain, or United Kingdom, or U.K., or UK, or Engl., etc.  Multiple ways of recording the same information leads to future confusion when there is a need to simply know how many people came from the country now known as the United Kingdom.

The modern solution to this problem is the database.  A single entry is made for each country, for example, in a reference list that might be called the Country table.  When someone needs to indicate the United Kingdom, he only has one choice available to him from the list: a single entry called &quot;United Kingdom&quot;.  In this example, &quot;United Kingdom&quot; is the unique representation of a country, and any further information about this country can use the same term from the same list to refer to the same country.  For example, a list of telephone country codes and a list of European castles both need to refer to countries; by using the same Country table to provide this identical information to both of the new lists, we've established new relationships among different lists that only have one item in common: country.  A relational database, therefore, is simply a collection of lists that share some common pieces of information.

== Structured Query Language (SQL) ==

'''[[wikipedia:SQL|SQL]]''', which is an abbreviation for '''Structured Query Language''', is a language to request data from a database, to add, update, or remove data within a database, or to manipulate the metadata of the database.

SQL is a declarative language in which the expected result or operation is given without the specific details about how to accomplish the task.  The steps required to execute SQL statements are handled transparently by the SQL database.  Sometimes SQL is characterized as ''non-procedural'' because procedural languages generally require the details of the operations to be specified, such as opening and closing tables, loading and searching indexes, or flushing buffers and writing data to filesystems.  Therefore, SQL is considered to be designed at a higher conceptual level of operation than procedural languages because the lower level logical and physical operations aren't specified and are determined by the SQL engine or server process that executes it.

Instructions are given in the form of statements, consisting of a specific SQL statement and additional parameters and operands that apply to that statement.  SQL statements and their modifiers are based upon official SQL standards and certain extensions to that each database provider implements.  Commonly used statements are grouped into the following categories:

; Data Query Language ([[wikipedia:Data Query Language|DQL]])

* SELECT - Used to retrieve certain records from one or more tables.

; Data Manipulation Language ([[wikipedia:Data Manipulation Language|DML]])

* INSERT - Used to create a record.
* UPDATE - Used to change certain records.
* DELETE - Used to delete certain records.

; Data Definition Language ([[wikipedia:Data Definition Language|DDL]])

* CREATE - Used to create a new table, a view of a table, or other object in database.
* ALTER - Used to modify an existing database object, such as a table.
* DROP - Used to delete an entire table, a view of a table or other object in the database.

; Data Control Language ([[wikipedia:Data Control Language|DCL]])

* GRANT - Used to give a privilege to someone.
* REVOKE - Used to take back privileges granted to someone.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{TopNav|cat|prev=Data Query Language|next=Data Definition Language}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;
Data Manipulation Language is used to modify the records in the database.  It never modifies the schema of the database (table features, relationships, ...).  It describes three statements: INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE.

== INSERT statement ==
The exhaustive syntax of the INSERT statement is as follows:

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
INSERT INTO &lt;table name&gt;[ (&lt;column name&gt;[, &lt;column name&gt;]*)]
{
 VALUES (&lt;value&gt;[, &lt;value&gt;]*)
|
 SELECT [ALL | DISTINCT] &lt;column name&gt; [, [ALL | DISTINCT] &lt;column name&gt;]*
 FROM &lt;table&gt; [[AS | =] &lt;alias&gt; | [[FULL | LEFT | RIGHT] OUTER | INNER] JOIN &lt;table&gt; ON &lt;expression&gt;]
  [, &lt;table&gt; [[AS | =] &lt;alias&gt; | [[FULL | LEFT | RIGHT] OUTER | INNER] JOIN &lt;table&gt; ON &lt;expression&gt;]]*

 [WHERE &lt;predicate&gt; [{AND | OR} &lt;predicate&gt;]*]
 [GROUP BY &lt;column name&gt; [, &lt;column name&gt;]*
  [HAVING &lt;predicate&gt; [{AND | OR} &lt;predicate&gt;]]*]
 ]
 [ORDER BY &lt;column name&gt; [ASC | DESC] [, &lt;column name&gt; [ASC | DESC]]*]
 [LIMIT &lt;count&gt;]
};
&lt;/source&gt;

The INSERT statement is used to add new records (rows) in a table.  For instance, we want to add a new reunion:
* Its primary key is 7,
* Its name is &quot;Job interview&quot;,
* Its description is &quot;Meeting with Mr. SPENCER&quot;,
* Its priority is B,
* Its planned,
* Its date is on October 28, 2009,
* Its hour is 18:30:00,
* Its duration is 30,
* Its office technical id is 23,
* There is no pdf report.

The INTO clause contains the name of the table where the record needs to be inserted.  It can be followed by a list of columns in brackets.  The VALUES clause contains the values to insert in brackets.  If the column names are omitted, the VALUES clause must contains as many values as the number of columns of the table.  The values are inserted in the table columns in the same order that the order in which the columns have been declared in the table.  If the column names are mentioned, there must be as many column names as values.  The values are respectively inserted into the named columns.  If a column in the table is omitted, a NULL value is inserted instead.

The VALUES clause can be replaced by an inner SELECT statement.  In this case, the INSERT statement can insert several rows in the table.  For example, we want to plan twice all the reunion with a B priority level, one year later:

* '''The table before the statement''':
&lt;center&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;

== UPDATE statement ==
The exhaustive syntax of the UPDATE statement is as follows:

&lt;pre&gt;
UPDATE &lt;table name&gt;
SET &lt;column name&gt; = &lt;value&gt;[, &lt;column name&gt; = &lt;value&gt;]*
WHERE &lt;predicate&gt; [{AND | OR} &lt;predicate&gt;]*;
&lt;/pre&gt;

The UPDATE statement is used to modify already existent records in a table.  The UPDATE clause is followed by the table name in which the rows need to be changed.  The SET clause is followed by couples of column name and value.  The values will be inserted in the given columns.  The WHERE clause contains predicates.  If the predicates are true for an existent row, this row will be modified.

For instance, we want to change the date, the hour and the description of the reunion with id 14:


* '''The table before the statement''':
&lt;center&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|----
|colspan=&quot;10&quot;|&lt;center&gt;'''reunion'''&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;

== DELETE statement ==
The exhaustive syntax of the DELETE statement is as follows:

&lt;pre&gt;
DELETE FROM &lt;table name&gt;
[WHERE &lt;predicate&gt; [{AND | OR} &lt;predicate&gt;]*];
&lt;/pre&gt;

The DELETE statement is used to remove specific rows in a table with conditions.  The FROM clause is followed by the table name in which the rows need to be removed.  The WHERE clause contains predicates.  If the predicates are true for an row, this row will be removed.  If the predicates are false for all the rows, the statement do nothing.  A DELETE statement without WHERE clause empties the table.

For example, we want to remove all the reunions that last two hours:


* '''The table before the statement''':
&lt;center&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;

|colspan=&quot;10&quot;|&lt;center&gt;'''reunion'''&lt;/center&gt;

Data Definition Language is used to modify the schema of the database.  It will never impact the user rights for the database.  Otherwise, it can erase records in some tables.  It describes three statements: CREATE, ALTER and DROP.

== CREATE statement ==
The exhaustive syntax of the CREATE statement for the tables is as follows:

&lt;source lang=sql&gt;
CREATE TABLE &lt;table name&gt;
(&lt;column name&gt; &lt;column type&gt;[ NOT NULL][ PRIMARY KEY| DEFAULT &lt;value&gt;][, &lt;column name&gt; &lt;column type&gt;[ NOT NULL][ PRIMARY KEY| DEFAULT &lt;value&gt;]]*
 [,[ CONSTRAINT &lt;constraint name&gt;]
  {
   PRIMARY KEY (&lt;column name&gt;[, &lt;column name&gt;]*)
  |
   UNIQUE ([VALUE|&lt;column name&gt;[, &lt;column name&gt;]*])
  |
   FOREIGN KEY (&lt;column name&gt;[, &lt;column name&gt;]*) REFERENCES &lt;table name&gt; (&lt;column name&gt;[, &lt;column name&gt;]*)[ ON DELETE CASCADE][ ON UPDATE CASCADE]
  |
   CHECK (&lt;predicate&gt;[{ AND| OR} &lt;predicate&gt;]*)
  }
 ]*
);
&lt;/source&gt;

The CREATE statement is used to create a new table with no record.  Let's create the table &lt;code&gt;office&lt;/code&gt;.  The records in the &lt;code&gt;office&lt;/code&gt; table will contain a technical id, the name of the office, a description, the number of available places, the availability and the date for the next office security control:
* '''Query''':
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
CREATE TABLE office
(
   id_office INTEGER PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
   name VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
   description VARCHAR(255),
   place_number INTEGER NOT NULL,
   available SMALLINT NOT NULL DEFAULT 1,
   next_inspection DATE NOT NULL
);
&lt;/source&gt;

* '''The table after the statement''':
&lt;center&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|----
|colspan=&quot;2&quot;|&lt;center&gt;'''office'''&lt;/center&gt;
|----
||&lt;u&gt;id_office&lt;/u&gt;|| INTEGER
|----
||name|| VARCHAR(20)
|----
||description|| VARCHAR(255)
|----
||place_number|| INTEGER
|----
||available|| SMALLINT
|----
||next_inspection|| DATE
|----
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

Now the table &lt;code&gt;office&lt;/code&gt; can be used and filled as the tables &lt;code&gt;reunion&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;employee&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;project&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;members&lt;/code&gt;:

&lt;center&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|----
|colspan=&quot;6&quot;|&lt;center&gt;'''office'''&lt;/center&gt;
|----
!|&lt;u&gt;id_office&lt;/u&gt;|| name || description || place_number || available || next_inspection
|----
||1|| Show room || style=&quot;background-color:#ccc;&quot; | || 100 || 1 || 2011-03-24
|----
||2|| Big room || The biggest room. || 200 || 1 || 2010-06-03
|----
||3|| Open space || The developer open space. || 50 || 1 || 2011-03-15
|----
||4|| Hall || The entrance. || 20 || 1 || 2010-10-28
|----
||5|| Reunion room || style=&quot;background-color:#ccc;&quot; | || 20 || 1 || 2010-05-12
|----
||6|| Actual office || This office is under construction. || 5 || 0 || 2010-06-03
|----
||7|| Temporary office || The office used while the actual is under construction. || 5 || 1 || 2011-03-15
|----
||8|| Coffee machine || The room where you can pause. || 5 || 1 || 2011-02-11
|----
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

The statement starts with CREATE TABLE, to indicate that what we want to create is a table.  It's followed by the name of the table (i.e. &lt;code&gt;office&lt;/code&gt;).  The name of the table is followed by parentheses which describe all the columns of the table.  The descriptions of the columns are separated by a comma.  Each description contains the column name (for instance, id_office), the column type (INTEGER, VARCHAR, CHAR, DATE, etc...), an optional nullability information (nothing to indicate that the column can be null or NOT NULL to indicate that the column can't be null) and the optional keyword DEFAULT followed by a default value or the optional keyword PRIMARY KEY to indicate that the column is a primary key.  If no default value is defined, NULL is the default value.  If NOT NULL is defined, the column can't have NULL as default value.

You can see that the column &lt;code&gt;id_office&lt;/code&gt; has been defined as a primary key, the column &lt;code&gt;description&lt;/code&gt; can be null and the column &lt;code&gt;available&lt;/code&gt; has &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; as default value.

== ALTER statement ==
The exhaustive syntax of the ALTER statement for the tables is as follows:

&lt;source lang=sql&gt;
ALTER TABLE &lt;table name&gt;
{
 ADD[ COLUMN] &lt;column name&gt; &lt;column type&gt;[ NOT NULL][ PRIMARY KEY| DEFAULT &lt;value&gt;]
|
 ALTER[ COLUMN] &lt;column name&gt;[ SET DEFAULT &lt;default option&gt;| DROP DEFAULT]
|
 DROP[ COLUMN] &lt;column name&gt;
|
 ADD[ CONSTRAINT &lt;constraint name&gt;]
 {
  PRIMARY KEY (&lt;column name&gt;[, &lt;column name&gt;]*)
 |
  UNIQUE ([VALUE|&lt;column name&gt;[, &lt;column name&gt;]*])
 |
  FOREIGN KEY (&lt;column name&gt;[, &lt;column name&gt;]*) REFERENCES &lt;table name&gt; (&lt;column name&gt;[, &lt;column name&gt;]*)[ ON DELETE CASCADE][ ON UPDATE CASCADE]
 |
  CHECK (&lt;predicate&gt;[{ AND| OR} &lt;predicate&gt;]*)
 }
|
 DROP CONSTRAINT &lt;constraint name&gt;
};
&lt;/source&gt;

The ALTER statement is used to modify a table.  It can be used on a table with records in it.

=== ADD CONSTRAINT clause ===
This clause allows to add a constraint on the table as it could be done at the table creation time.  Let's add a unicity constraint on both the name and the description of the office:
* '''Query''':
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
ALTER TABLE office ADD CONSTRAINT unique_name_and_description UNIQUE (name, description);
&lt;/source&gt;

Now we can not insert a row with the same name and description of an already existing row and we can not update a row with the same name and description of another row.  However, we can insert a row with only the same name or only the same description.

=== DROP CONSTRAINT clause ===
This clause allows to remove an existing constraint on the table by its name.  Let's remove the preceding unicity constraint on both the name and the description of the office:
* '''Query''':
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
ALTER TABLE office DROP CONSTRAINT unique_name_and_description;
&lt;/source&gt;

Now we can insert a row with the same name and description of an already existing row and we can update a row with the same name and description of another row once again.

=== ADD COLUMN clause ===
Let's add a new column &lt;code&gt;has_video_projector&lt;/code&gt; to indicate if we can project a slideshow:

* '''The table before the statement''':

&lt;center&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|----
|colspan=&quot;6&quot;|&lt;center&gt;'''office'''&lt;/center&gt;
|----
!|&lt;u&gt;id_office&lt;/u&gt;|| name || description || place_number || available || next_inspection

|----
||8|| Coffee machine || The room where you can pause. || 5 || 1 || 2011-02-11
|----
|}
&lt;/center&gt;
* '''Query''':
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;

ALTER TABLE office ADD has_video_projector SMALLINT DEFAULT 0;
&lt;/source&gt;

* '''The table after the statement''':

&lt;center&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|----
|colspan=&quot;7&quot;|&lt;center&gt;'''office'''&lt;/center&gt;
|----
!|&lt;u&gt;id_office&lt;/u&gt;|| name || description || place_number || available || next_inspection || has_video_projector
|----
||1|| Show room || style=&quot;background-color:#ccc;&quot; | || 100 || 1 || 2011-03-24 || 0
|----
||2|| Big room || The biggest room. || 200 || 1 || 2010-06-03 || 0
|----
||3|| Open space || The developer open space. || 50 || 1 || 2011-03-15 || 0
|----
||4|| Hall || The entrance. || 20 || 1 || 2010-10-28 || 0
|----
||5|| Reunion room || style=&quot;background-color:#ccc;&quot; | || 20 || 1 || 2010-05-12 || 0
|----
||6|| Actual office || This office is under construction. || 5 || 0 || 2010-06-03 || 0
|----
||7|| Temporary office || The office used while the actual is under construction. || 5 || 1 || 2011-03-15 || 0
|----
||8|| Coffee machine || The room where you can pause. || 5 || 1 || 2011-02-11 || 0
|----
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

The column &lt;code&gt;has_video_projector&lt;/code&gt; has been added at the end.  The column has been filled with the default value.

=== DROP COLUMN clause ===
Now let's remove the column &lt;code&gt;next_inspection&lt;/code&gt;:

* '''The table before the statement''':

&lt;center&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|----
|colspan=&quot;7&quot;|&lt;center&gt;'''office'''&lt;/center&gt;
|----
!|&lt;u&gt;id_office&lt;/u&gt;|| name || description || place_number || available || next_inspection || has_video_projector
|----
||1|| Show room || style=&quot;background-color:#ccc;&quot; | || 100 || 1 || 2011-03-24 || 0
|----
||2|| Big room || The biggest room. || 200 || 1 || 2010-06-03 || 0
|----
||3|| Open space || The developer open space. || 50 || 1 || 2011-03-15 || 0
|----
||4|| Hall || The entrance. || 20 || 1 || 2010-10-28 || 0
|----
||5|| Reunion room || style=&quot;background-color:#ccc;&quot; | || 20 || 1 || 2010-05-12 || 0
|----
||6|| Actual office || This office is under construction. || 5 || 0 || 2010-06-03 || 0
|----
||7|| Temporary office || The office used while the actual is under construction. || 5 || 1 || 2011-03-15 || 0
|----
||8|| Coffee machine || The room where you can pause. || 5 || 1 || 2011-02-11 || 0
|----
|}
&lt;/center&gt;
* '''Query''':
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;

ALTER TABLE office DROP COLUMN next_inspection;
&lt;/source&gt;

* '''The table after the statement''':

&lt;center&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|----
|colspan=&quot;7&quot;|&lt;center&gt;'''office'''&lt;/center&gt;
|----
!|&lt;u&gt;id_office&lt;/u&gt;|| name || description || place_number || available || has_video_projector
|----
||1|| Show room || style=&quot;background-color:#ccc;&quot; | || 100 || 1 || 0
|----
||2|| Big room || The biggest room. || 200 || 1 || 0
|----
||3|| Open space || The developer open space. || 50 || 1 || 0
|----
||4|| Hall || The entrance. || 20 || 1 || 0
|----
||5|| Reunion room || style=&quot;background-color:#ccc;&quot; | || 20 || 1 || 0
|----
||6|| Actual office || This office is under construction. || 5 || 0 || 0
|----
||7|| Temporary office || The office used while the actual is under construction. || 5 || 1 || 0
|----
||8|| Coffee machine || The room where you can pause. || 5 || 1 || 0
|----
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

The column &lt;code&gt;next_inspection&lt;/code&gt; has been removed.  If you want to remove a column, you need to remove any constraint applied on it (for instance, you could not remove the name or the description column if there is still the unique_name_and_description unicity constraint).

== DROP statement ==
The exhaustive syntax of the DROP statement for the tables is as follows:

&lt;source lang=sql&gt;
DROP TABLE &lt;table name&gt;;
&lt;/source&gt;

The DROP statement is used to remove table.

Now you can use a database for any type of data.

Data Control Language is used to modify the user rights for the database.  It describes two statements: GRANT and REVOKE.

== GRANT statement ==
The exhaustive syntax of the GRANT statement is as follows:

&lt;source lang=sql&gt;
GRANT
{
 ALL PRIVILEGES ON[ TABLE] &lt;table or view name&gt;
|
 {SELECT|DELETE|{INSERT|UPDATE}[ (&lt;column name&gt;[, &lt;column name&gt;]*)]}
 [, {SELECT|DELETE|{INSERT|UPDATE}[ (&lt;column name&gt;[, &lt;column name&gt;]*)]}]* ON[ TABLE] &lt;table or view name&gt;
|
 USAGE ON 
 {DOMAIN &lt;domain name&gt;|COLLATION &lt;collation name&gt;|CHARACTER SET &lt;charset name&gt;|TRANSLATION &lt;translation name&gt;}
|
 REFERENCES &lt;column name&gt;[, &lt;column name&gt;]* ON &lt;table name&gt;
}
[,
 {
  ALL PRIVILEGES ON[ TABLE] &lt;table or view name&gt;
 |
  {SELECT|DELETE|{INSERT|UPDATE}[ (&lt;column name&gt;[, &lt;column name&gt;]*)]}
  [ ,{SELECT|DELETE|{INSERT|UPDATE}[ (&lt;column name&gt;[, &lt;column name&gt;]*)]}]* ON[ TABLE] &lt;table or view name&gt;
 |
  USAGE ON 
  {DOMAIN &lt;domain name&gt;|COLLATION &lt;collation name&gt;|CHARACTER SET &lt;charset name&gt;|TRANSLATION &lt;translation name&gt;}
 |
  REFERENCES &lt;column name&gt;[, &lt;column name&gt;]* ON &lt;table name&gt;
 }
]* TO {PUBLIC|&lt;user name&gt;}[, {PUBLIC|&lt;user name&gt;}]*[ WITH GRANT OPTION];
&lt;/source&gt;

The GRANT statement is used to give a privilege to someone.  Any SQL operations are done using a user name.  The user name are created by the ''database management system''.

&lt;center&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center; width: 100%;&quot;
|-
|[[File:Nuvola apps personal.svg]]&lt;br/&gt;DBA|| [[File:Nuvola apps personal unisex.svg]]&lt;br/&gt;Developer 1 || [[File:Nuvola apps personal unisex.svg]]&lt;br/&gt;Developer 2 || [[File:Nuvola apps personal unisex.svg]]&lt;br/&gt;Developer 3 || [[File:User.svg]]&lt;br/&gt;User 1 || [[File:User.svg]]&lt;br/&gt;User 2
|-
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

The privileges apply on the tables (i.e. &lt;code&gt;employee&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;office&lt;/code&gt;, etc...), the views, their columns, the domain, the collation, the charset and the translation.

The privileges can allow to process SELECT (&quot;s&quot;), INSERT (&quot;i&quot;), UPDATE (&quot;u&quot;) and DELETE (&quot;d&quot;) statements (not CREATE, ALTER or DROP statements).  Let's say that only the DataBase Administrator has the privileges.

For each privilege (&quot;s&quot;, &quot;i&quot;, &quot;u&quot; and &quot;d&quot;), there is also a meta-privilege (&quot;S&quot;, &quot;I&quot;, &quot;U&quot; and &quot;D&quot;) : a user can send a privilege to another user.  Let's say that only the DataBase Administrator has the meta-privileges.

SELECT indicates that we want to sent the SELECT privilege.  The keyword ON followed by &lt;code&gt;employee&lt;/code&gt; indicates that the privilege applies on the table &lt;code&gt;employee&lt;/code&gt;.  The keyword TO followed by &lt;code&gt;DEVELOPER_1&lt;/code&gt; indicates that the privilege has been sent to DEVELOPER_1.

The DBA wants to allow DEVELOPER_2 and DEVELOPER_3 to insert, update and delete rows on the table &lt;code&gt;office&lt;/code&gt;:

Whereas you can send several privileges on a table to several users at once, you can't send privileges on several tables at once.  If you want to send all the privileges (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE), you can replace the list of privileges by the keywords ALL PRIVILEGES.

Now, the DBA wants to allow USER_1 to insert on the table &lt;code&gt;employee&lt;/code&gt; and allow him to send this privilege to other users:
{| style=&quot;border: solid 1px;&quot;

The keyword WITH GRANT OPTION indicates that we want to send privileges with the meta-privileges to the user.  Now, USER_1 can send the SELECT privilege on the table &lt;code&gt;employee&lt;/code&gt; to the other users.  Let's say that USER_1 wants to allow anyone to process SELECT on the table &lt;code&gt;employee&lt;/code&gt;:

&lt;/center&gt;

The operation has been refused because DEVELOPER_3 hasn't enough privileges.

=== Sending privileges on columns ===
You can send privileges on columns only (only for INSERT and UPDATE):
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
GRANT INSERT (name, description) ON TABLE office TO USER_2;
GRANT UPDATE (id_office, name) ON TABLE office TO USER_2;
&lt;/source&gt;

For INSERT, make all the columns that the user can't fill have default values, are automatically generated or are filled by a trigger before the insertion.  Otherwise, the privilege is just useless.

== REVOKE statement ==
The exhaustive syntax of the REVOKE statement is as follows:

&lt;source lang=sql&gt;
REVOKE[ GRANT OPTION FOR] 
{
 ALL PRIVILEGES ON[ TABLE] &lt;table or view name&gt;
|
 {SELECT|DELETE|{INSERT|UPDATE}[ (&lt;column name&gt;[, &lt;column name&gt;]*)]}
 [, {SELECT|DELETE|{INSERT|UPDATE}[ (&lt;column name&gt;[, &lt;column name&gt;]*)]}]* ON[ TABLE] &lt;table or view name&gt;
|
 USAGE ON 
 {DOMAIN &lt;domain name&gt;|COLLATION &lt;collation name&gt;|CHARACTER SET &lt;charset name&gt;|TRANSLATION &lt;translation name&gt;}
|
 REFERENCES &lt;column name&gt;[, &lt;column name&gt;]* ON &lt;table name&gt;
}
[,
 {
  {SELECT|DELETE|{INSERT|UPDATE}[ (&lt;column name&gt;[, &lt;column name&gt;]*)]}
  [, {SELECT|DELETE|{INSERT|UPDATE}[ (&lt;column name&gt;[, &lt;column name&gt;]*)]}]* ON[ TABLE] &lt;table or view name&gt;
 |
  USAGE ON 
  {DOMAIN &lt;domain name&gt;|COLLATION &lt;collation name&gt;|CHARACTER SET &lt;charset name&gt;|TRANSLATION &lt;translation name&gt;}
 |
  REFERENCES &lt;column name&gt;[, &lt;column name&gt;]* ON &lt;table name&gt;
 }
]* FROM {PUBLIC|&lt;user name&gt;}[, {PUBLIC|&lt;user name&gt;}]*[ RESTRICT| CASCADE]
&lt;/source&gt;

The REVOKE statement is used to take back privileges granted to someone.  This revocation may be more complicated than you expect.  To completely remove a privilege to a user, this privilege must be taken back by &lt;u&gt;all&lt;/u&gt; the users that have sent the privilege.

For instance, the DBA wants to remove the INSERT and DELETE privileges on the table &lt;code&gt;employee&lt;/code&gt; to DEVELOPER_2 and DEVELOPER_3:
{| style=&quot;border: solid 1px;&quot;
|-

If you remove a privilege to a user who was also sent the related meta-privilege (for example, SELECT privilege to USER_1), the operation also removes the meta-privilege.  To remove only meta-privileges, add the keywords GRANT OPTION FOR:

== Result set column ==
It is not recommended to use &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; in a SELECT clause, due to performance issues.  You should only return columns you want to use.  As a consequence, you should replace any &lt;code&gt;count(*)&lt;/code&gt; by a count on one column only.

== Avoid the value expressions ==
Whenever it is possible, avoid the use of value expressions in the WHERE clause like this:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;sql&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
SELECT id_reunion
FROM reunion
WHERE duration - 60 &lt;= 0;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

It forces the rDBMS to compute the value for each line, which is very expensive. You should rather compute yourself the values with literals (&lt;code&gt;0 + 60&lt;/code&gt; in this case):

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;sql&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
SELECT id_reunion
FROM reunion
WHERE duration &lt;= 60;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

== Index ==
If you often select records sorting or filtering by a given column, you may add an index on this column.  The database behavior should not change.  The index may make query faster.  However, don't add useless indexes as it makes insertion a little bit slower.

The exhaustive syntax of the CREATE statement for the indexes is as follows:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;sql&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
CREATE[ UNIQUE] INDEX &lt;index name&gt; ON &lt;table name&gt; (&lt;column name&gt;[, &lt;column name&gt;]*);
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The keyword UNIQUE indicates that all the group of values in the columns must be distinct.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;background:#FFFFFF&quot;

|- id=&quot;ACID&quot; 
| ACID || An acronym for the 4 properties ''atomicity'', ''consistency'', ''isolation'' and ''durability''. Any [[#Transaction|transaction]] must conform to them. ''Atomicity'' means that either all or no data modification will take place. ''Consistency'' ensures that transactions transforms the database from one valid state to another valid state. ''Isolation'' requires that transactions will not affect each other, even if they run at the same time. ''Durability'' means that the modifications will keep into the database even if the system crashs immediately after the transaction. q.v.: [[w:en:ACID|ACID]]

|- id=&quot;Attribute&quot;
| Attribute || A set of properties (name, datatype, size, ...) used to characterize the data items of [[#Entity|entities]]. A group of attributes constructs an [[#Entity-type|entity-type]] (or [[#Table|table]]), i.e.: all [[#Value|values]] of a certain [[#Column|column]] must conform to the same attributes. Attributes are optionally complemented by [[#Constraint|constraints]].

|- id=&quot;Block&quot; 
| Block || Aggregation of one or more physical blocks of a mass device. Usually a block contains numerous [[#Row|rows]] of one or more tables. Sometimes one [[#Row|row]] is distributed across several blocks. q.v.: [[#DirtyBlock|dirty block]]

|- id=&quot;Clause&quot; 
| Clause || A certain language element as part of a [[#Statement|statement]]. E.g.: the ''WHERE clause'' defines seach criterias.

|- id=&quot;Column&quot;
| Column|| A set of [[#Value|values]] of a single [[#Table|table]] which resides on the same position within its [[#Row|rows]].

|- id=&quot;Constraint&quot; 
| Constraint || Similar to [[#Attribute|attributes]] constraints define rules at a higher level, data items must conform to. E.g.: nullability, primary and foreign key, uniqueness, default value, user-defined-criterias like &lt;code&gt;STATUS &lt; 10&lt;/code&gt;.

|- id=&quot;Cursor&quot; 
| Cursor || A cursor is a mechanism by which the [[#Row|rows]] of a [[#Table|table]] may be acted on (e.g., returned to a host programming language) one at a time.

|- id=&quot;Database&quot; 
| Database || A set of [[#Table|tables]]. Those tables contain user data and the [[#Data Dictionary|Data Dictionary]].

|- id=&quot;DBMS&quot; 
| Database Management System (DBMS) || A set of computer programs that controls the creation, maintenance and usage of the [[#Database|database]]. q.v.: [[w:en:Database_management_system|DBMS]]

|- id=&quot;Data Dictionary&quot; 
| Data Dictionary (DD) || A set of predefined [[#Table|tables]] where the [[#DBMS|DBMS]] stores information about all user defined objects (tables, views, constraints, ...).

|- id=&quot;DCL&quot; 
| Data Control Language (DCL) || A class of [[#Statement|statements]] which defines the access rights to data, e.g: &lt;code&gt;GRANT ..., REVOKE, ...&lt;/code&gt; . 

|- id=&quot;DDL&quot; 
| Data Definition Language (DDL) || A class of [[#Statement|statements]] which defines logical and physical design of a [[#database|database]], e.g.: &lt;code&gt;CREATE TABLE ...&lt;/code&gt; .

|- id=&quot;DML&quot; 
| Data Manipulation Language (DML) || A class of [[#Statement|statements]] which retrieves and manipulates data, e.g.: &lt;code&gt;SELECT ..., INSERT ..., UPDATE ..., DELETE ..., COMMIT, ROLLBACK&lt;/code&gt;.

|- id=&quot;DirtyBlock&quot; 
| Dirty Block || A [[#Block|block]] whose content has changed in memory, but is still not written to disc.

|- id=&quot;Entity&quot; 
| Entity || An identifiable object like an ''employee'' or a ''department''. An entity is an instance of an [[#Entity-type|entity-type]]. Usually there are many instances of a certain [[#Entity-type|entity-type]]. Every entity is stored in one [[#Row|row]]. Entities of same [[#Entity-type|entity-type]] are stored in [[#Row|rows]] of the same [[#Table|table]]. So entities are a logical construct and [[#Row|rows]] a physical implementation.

|- id=&quot;Entity-type&quot; 
| Entity-type || A group of [[#Attribute|attributes]] describing the structure of [[#entity|entities]]. As [[#entity|entities]] of same entity-type are stored in [[#Row|rows]] of the same [[#Table|table]] it can be said, that an entity-type describes a [[#Table|table]]. (Many people tend to use the term [[#entity|entity]] as a synonym for entity-type.)

|- id=&quot;Expression&quot; 
| Expression || A certain language element as part of a [[#Statement|statement]]. It can produce either scalar [[#Value|values]] or a [[#Table|table]].

|- id=&quot;Foreign key&quot; 
| Foreign key || A [[#Value|value]] used to reference a [[#Primary key|primary key]]. It can point to any primary key in the database, whether in its own [[#Table|table]] (eg: bill of materials) or another table. It can point to its own row.

|- id=&quot;Index&quot; 
| Index || An index is a construct containing copies of original values and backreferences to their original rows. It's purpose is the provision of a fast access to the original data. To achieve this, an index contains some kind of collocation.&lt;br /&gt;
Remark: Indexes are not part of the SQL standard. Nevertheless they are part of nearly every DBMS.

|- id=&quot;Junction table&quot; 
| Junction table || If more than one row of table T1 refers to more than one row of table T2 (many-to-many relationship) you need an intermediate [[#Table|table]] to store this relationship. The [[#Row|rows]] of the intermediate table contains the [[#Primary key|primary keys]] of T1 and T2 as [[#Value|values]]. q.v.: [[w:en:Junction_table|Junction_table]]

|- id=&quot;Normalization&quot; 
| Normalization || [[#Table|Tables]] should conform to special rules - namely ''First-'', ''Second-'' and ''Third-Normal Form''. The process of rearranging columns over tables is called ''normalization''.

|- id=&quot;NULL&quot; 
| NULL || If '''no''' [[#value|value]] is stored in the [[#Column|column]] of a [[#Row|row]], the standard says, that the ''null value'' is stored. As this ''null value'' is a flag and not a real value we use the term ''null marker'' within this wikibook. The ''null marker'' is used to indicate the absence of any data. For example it makes a difference whether a temperature is measured and stored as 0 degrees or whether the temperature is not measured and hence not stored. One consequence of the existence of the ''null marker'' is that SQL must know not only the boolean values TRUE and FALSE but also a third one: UNKNOWN.

|- id=&quot;Predicate&quot; 
| Predicate || A language element which specifies a non arithmetic condition. E.g: [NOT] IN, [NOT] LIKE, IS [NOT] NULL, [NOT] EXISTS, ANY, ... .

|- id=&quot;Primary key&quot; 
| Primary key || A [[#Value|value]] or a set of [[#Value|values]] used to identify a single row uniquely. 

|- id=&quot;Query&quot; 
| Query || An often used [[#Statement|statement]] which retrieves data from the database. It is introduced by the keyword SELECT and usually contains a [[#Predicate|predicate]].

|- id=&quot;Relationship&quot; 
| Relationship || A reference between two different or the same [[#entity|entity]]. References are not implemented as links. They base upon the [[#Value|values]] of the entities.

|- id=&quot;RelationalModel&quot; 
| [[w:en:Relational model|Relational Model]] || A method (and a mathematical theory) to model data as tables (relations), the relationships among each other and all operations on the data.

|- id=&quot;Row&quot; 
| Row || One record in a [[#Table|table]] containing information about one single [[#Entity|entity]]. A row has exactly one [[#Value|value]] for each of its columns - in accordance with ''First Normal Form''. This [[#Value|value]] may be [[#NULL|NULL]].

|- id=&quot;Statement&quot; 
| Statement || A single command which is executed by the [[#DBMS|DBMS]]. There are 3 main classes of statements: [[#DML|DML]], [[#DDL|DDL]] and [[#DCL|DCL]].

|- id=&quot;Table&quot; 
| Table (=Relation)|| A set of [[#Row|rows]] of a certain [[#Entity-type|entity-type]], i.e. all [[#Row|rows]] of a certain table have the same structure.

|- id=&quot;3VL&quot; 
| Three Valued Logic (3VL) || SQL knows three boolean values: TRUE, FALSE and UNKNOWN. See: [[#NULL|NULL]].  q.v.: [[w:Three-valued logic|trivalent, ternary or three-valued logic (3VL)]].

|- id=&quot;Transaction&quot; 
| Transaction || A logical unit of work consisting of one or more modifications to the database. The [[#ACID|ACID criterium]] must be achieved. A transaction is either saved by the &lt;code&gt;COMMIT&lt;/code&gt; statement or completely canceled by the &lt;code&gt;ROLLBACK&lt;/code&gt; statement.

|- id=&quot;Value&quot; 
| Value || Implementation of a single data item within a certain [[#Column|column]] of a certain [[#Row|row]]. (You can think of a cell within a spreadsheet.)

|- id=&quot;View&quot; 
| View || A virtual [[#Table|table]] containing only its definition and no real data. The definition consists of a [[#Query|query]] to one or more real [[#Table|tables]] or views. [[#Query|Queries]] to the view are processed as [[#Query|queries]] to the underlying real [[#Table|tables]].

Before learning SQL, relational databases have several concepts that are important to learn first.  Databases store the data of an information system.  We regroup data by groups of comparable data (all the employees, all the projects, all the offices...).  For each group of comparable data, we create a ''table''.  This table is specially designed to suit this type of data (its attributes).  For instance, a table named &lt;code&gt;employee&lt;/code&gt; which stores all the employees would be designed like this:
&lt;center&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|----
|colspan=&quot;2&quot;|&lt;center&gt;'''employee''' &lt;sup style=&quot;border:solid blue 1px;color:blue;&quot;&gt;the table&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
|----
||&lt;u&gt;id_employee&lt;/u&gt; &lt;sup style=&quot;border:solid blue 1px;color:blue;&quot;&gt;the primary key&lt;/sup&gt;|| an integer
|----
||firstname &lt;sup style=&quot;border:solid blue 1px;color:blue;&quot;&gt;a column&lt;/sup&gt;|| a string of characters &lt;sup style=&quot;border:solid blue 1px;color:blue;&quot;&gt;a column type&lt;/sup&gt;
|----
||lastname|| a string of characters
|----
||phone|| 10 numbers
|----
||mail|| a string of characters
|----
|}
&lt;/center&gt;
And the company employees would be stored like this:
&lt;center&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|----
|colspan=&quot;5&quot;|&lt;center&gt;'''employee'''&lt;/center&gt;
|----
!|&lt;u&gt;id_employee&lt;/u&gt;|| firstname || lastname || phone || mail
|----
||1 &lt;sup style=&quot;border:solid blue 1px;color:blue;&quot;&gt;a column value&lt;/sup&gt;|| Big || BOSS || 936854270 || big.boss@company.com

|}
&lt;/center&gt;

The data stored in a table is called ''entities''.  As a table is usually represented as an array, the data attributes (first name, last name...) are called ''columns'' and the records (the employees) are called ''rows''.  &lt;code&gt;id_employee&lt;/code&gt; is a database specific technical identifier called a ''primary key''.  It is used to link the entities from a table to another.  To do so, it must be unique for each row.  A primary key is usually underlined.  Any unique attribute (for instance, the mail) or group of attributes (for instance, the first name and last name) can be the table primary key but it is recommended to use an additional technical id (id_employee) for primary key.

Let's create a second table called &lt;code&gt;project&lt;/code&gt; which stores the company projects:
{| width=&quot;100%&quot;
|----
||&lt;center&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|----
|colspan=&quot;2&quot;|&lt;center&gt;'''employee'''&lt;/center&gt;
|----
||&lt;u&gt;id_employee&lt;/u&gt;|| an integer
|----
||firstname|| a string of characters
|----
||lastname|| a string of characters
|----
||phone|| 10 numbers
|----
||mail|| a string of characters
|----
|}
&lt;/center&gt;
||
&lt;center&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|----
|colspan=&quot;2&quot;|&lt;center&gt;'''project'''&lt;/center&gt;
|----
||&lt;u&gt;id_project&lt;/u&gt;|| an integer
|----
||name|| a string of characters
|----
||created_on|| a date
|----
||ended_on|| a date
|----
||# manager|| an integer
|----
|}
|----
&lt;/center&gt;
|}
And the company projects would be stored like this:
{| width=&quot;100%&quot;
|----
||&lt;center&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|----
|colspan=&quot;5&quot;|&lt;center&gt;'''employee'''&lt;/center&gt;
|----
!|&lt;u&gt;id_employee&lt;/u&gt;|| firstname || lastname || phone || mail
|----
||1|| Big || BOSS || 936854270 || big.boss@company.com
|----
||2|| John || DOE || 936854271 || john.doe@company.com

||3|| Linus || TORVALDS || 936854272 || linus.torvalds@company.com
|----
||4|| Jimmy || WALES || 936854273 || jimmy.wales@company.com
|----
||5|| Larry || PAGE || 936854274 || larry.page@company.com
|----
|}
&lt;/center&gt;
||
&lt;center&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|----
|colspan=&quot;5&quot;|&lt;center&gt;'''project'''&lt;/center&gt;
|----
!|&lt;u&gt;id_project&lt;/u&gt;|| name || created_on || ended_on || # manager
|----
||1|| Google || 1998-09-08 || style=&quot;background-color:#ccc;&quot; | NULL || 5
|----
||2|| Linux || 1991-01-01 || style=&quot;background-color:#ccc;&quot; | NULL || 3
|----
||3|| Wikipedia || 2001-01-01 || style=&quot;background-color:#ccc;&quot; | NULL || 4
|----
|}
&lt;/center&gt;
|}

&lt;code&gt;id_project&lt;/code&gt; is the primary key of the project table and &lt;code&gt;manager&lt;/code&gt; is a ''foreign key''.  A foreign key is a technical id which is equal to one of the primary keys stored in another table (here, the employee table).  Doing this, the Google project is linked to the employee Larry PAGE.  This link is called a ''relationship''.  A foreign key is usually preceded by a sharp.  Note that several projects can point to a &lt;u&gt;common&lt;/u&gt; manager so an employee can be the manager of &lt;u&gt;several&lt;/u&gt; projects.

Now, we want to create, not a single link, but multiple links.  So we create a ''junction table''.  A junction table is a table that isn't used to store data but links the entities of other tables.  Let's create a table called &lt;code&gt;members&lt;/code&gt; which links employees to project:
{| width=&quot;100%&quot;
|----
||&lt;center&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|----
|colspan=&quot;2&quot;|&lt;center&gt;'''employee'''&lt;/center&gt;
|----
||&lt;u&gt;id_employee&lt;/u&gt;|| an integer
|----
||firstname|| a string of characters
|----
||lastname|| a string of characters
|----
||phone|| 10 numbers
|----
||mail|| a string of characters
|----
|}
&lt;/center&gt;
||&lt;center&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|----
|colspan=&quot;2&quot;|&lt;center&gt;'''members'''&lt;/center&gt;
|----
||&lt;u&gt;# id_employee&lt;/u&gt;|| an integer
|----
||&lt;u&gt;# id_project&lt;/u&gt;|| an integer
|----
|}
&lt;/center&gt;
||&lt;center&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|----
|colspan=&quot;2&quot;|&lt;center&gt;'''project'''&lt;/center&gt;
|----
||&lt;u&gt;id_project&lt;/u&gt;|| an integer
|----
||name|| a string of characters
|----
||created_on|| a date
|----
||ended_on|| a date
|----
||# manager|| an integer
|----
|}
|----
&lt;/center&gt;
|}
And the employees and the projects can be linked like this:
{| width=&quot;100%&quot;
|----
||&lt;center&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|----
|colspan=&quot;5&quot;|&lt;center&gt;'''employee'''&lt;/center&gt;

An employee can be associated to several projects (John DOE with Google and Wikipedia) &lt;u&gt;and&lt;/u&gt; a project can be associated to several employees (Wikipedia with Jimmy, John and Jenny), which is impossible with just a foreign key.  A junction table hasn't its own primary key.  Its primary key is the couple of foreign keys, as this couple is unique.  A junction table can link more than two entity tables by containing more columns.

== Relationships ==
So let's list the different types of relationships:
* One to one,
* One to many (for instance, the manager of a project),
* Many to many (for instance, the members of the projects).

For each type of relationships, there is a way to link the entities :
* One to many relationship: create a foreign key from an entity table to the other,
* Many to many relationship: create a junction table,
* One to one relationship: just merge the two tables.

Now you know how to design a database schema and to put the data of your information system into it.

Data Query Language is used to extract data from the database.  It doesn't modify any data in the database.  It describes only one query: SELECT.

== SQL data types ==

Each column has a type.  Here are the standard SQL data types:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|----
||Data type     || Explanation                                                || Allowed values || Example
|----
||VARCHAR(n)    || A string with a maximum length of n                        || [[Regular Expressions|&lt;code&gt;[0-9a-zA-Z]+{n}&lt;/code&gt;]] || &quot;foo&quot;
|----
||CHAR(n)       || A string with a fixed length of n                          || [[Regular Expressions|&lt;code&gt;[0-9a-zA-Z]{n}&lt;/code&gt;]] || &quot;foo&quot;
|----
||SMALLINT      || A 16 bits signed integer                                   || [[Regular Expressions|&lt;code&gt;\-?[0-9]+&lt;/code&gt;]]      || 584
|----
||INTEGER       || A 32 bits signed integer                                   || [[Regular Expressions|&lt;code&gt;\-?[0-9]+&lt;/code&gt;]]      || -8748
|----
||FLOAT         || A decimal floating point                                   || [[Regular Expressions|&lt;code&gt;\-?[0-9]+[\.[0-9]+]?&lt;/code&gt;]] || 48.96
|----
||NUMBER(n,[d]) || A number with n digits (and d decimal digits if mentioned) || [[Regular Expressions|&lt;code&gt;\-?[0-9]+[\.[0-9]+]?&lt;/code&gt;]] || 484.65
|----
||DATE          || A date (YYYY-MM-DD)                                        || [[Regular Expressions|&lt;code&gt;[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]\-[0-1][0-9]\-[0-3][0-9]&lt;/code&gt;]] || 2009-03-24
|----
||TIME          || A time period of sixty minutes; one twenty-fourth of a day || [[Regular Expressions|&lt;code&gt;[0-2][0-9]\:[0-5][0-9]\:[0-5][0-9]&lt;/code&gt;]] || 11:24:56
|----
||TIMESTAMP     || A date and hour                                            || [[Regular Expressions|&lt;code&gt;[0-9]+&lt;/code&gt;]]         || 18648689595962
|----
||BLOB          || Any binary data                                            || Any                         ||
|----
|}

There is no boolean type.  Integers are used instead.

== SELECT query ==
The exhaustive syntax of the SELECT query is as follows:

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
SELECT[ ALL| DISTINCT] &lt;column name&gt;[[ AS] &lt;alias&gt;][,[ ALL| DISTINCT] &lt;column name&gt;[[ AS] &lt;alias&gt;]]*
FROM &lt;table&gt;[[ AS] &lt;alias&gt;|[[ FULL| LEFT| RIGHT] OUTER| INNER] JOIN &lt;table&gt; ON &lt;expression&gt;]
 [, &lt;table&gt;[[ AS] &lt;alias&gt;|[[ FULL| LEFT| RIGHT] OUTER| INNER] JOIN &lt;table&gt; ON &lt;expression&gt;]]*

[WHERE &lt;predicate&gt;[{ AND| OR} &lt;predicate&gt;]*]
[GROUP BY &lt;column name&gt;[, &lt;column name&gt;]*
 [HAVING &lt;predicate&gt;[{ AND| OR} &lt;predicate&gt;]]*]
]
[ORDER BY &lt;column name&gt;[ ASC| DESC][, &lt;column name&gt;[ ASC| DESC]]*]
[FETCH FIRST &lt;count&gt; ROWS ONLY];
&lt;/source&gt;

=== First query ===
Let's create the table &lt;code&gt;reunion&lt;/code&gt; with many columns:
&lt;center&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|----
|colspan=&quot;2&quot;|&lt;center&gt;'''reunion'''&lt;/center&gt;
|----
||&lt;u&gt;id_reunion&lt;/u&gt;|| INTEGER
|----
||name|| VARCHAR(20)
|----
||description|| VARCHAR(255)
|----
||priority|| CHAR(1)
|----
||planned|| SMALLINT
|----
||date|| DATE
|----
||hour|| TIME
|----
||duration|| INTEGER
|----
||# id_office|| INTEGER
|----
||pdf_report|| BLOB
|----
|}
&lt;/center&gt;
...and let's fill it:
&lt;center&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|----
|colspan=&quot;10&quot;|&lt;center&gt;'''reunion'''&lt;/center&gt;
|----
!|&lt;u&gt;id_reunion&lt;/u&gt;|| name || description || priority || planned || date || hour || duration || # id_office || pdf_report
|----

|}
&lt;/center&gt;

Let's do a simple query.  The following query just returns the content of the reunion table:
* '''Query''':
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
SELECT *
FROM reunion;
&lt;/source&gt;

* '''Result''':
&lt;pre&gt;
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|id_reunion |name         |description                                |priority |planned |date       |hour     |duration |id_office |pdf_report      |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------------------------------|---------|--------|-----------|---------|---------|----------|----------------|
|1          |Planning     |We need to plan the project.               |A        |1       |2008-03-24 |10:30:00 |60       |35        |48644...846348  |
|2          |Progress     |What we have done.                         |C        |1       |2008-05-12 |14:00:00 |30       |13        |9862...15676    |
|3          |Change       |What we need to change in the project.     |B        |1       |2008-06-03 |9:30:00  |90       |41        |34876...4846548 |
|4          |Presentation |Presentation of the project.               |D        |0       |2008-09-11 |15:30:00 |120      |27        |NULL            |
|5          |Reporting    |Explanation to the new beginner.           |B        |1       |2009-03-15 |14:00:00 |60       |7         |19739...37718   |
|6          |Learning     |A new software version has been installed. |B        |1       |2009-09-21 |16:00:00 |120      |11        |785278...37528  |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
&lt;/pre&gt;

The form of the result depends on the client application.  It can be returned as a text output (backend), a HTML page (thin client), a program object (middleware) etc...  The statements, queries, clauses (SELECT, FROM...), instructions and operators are not case sensitive but they are commonly written in uppercase for readability.

The SELECT and FROM clauses are the two required clauses of a SELECT query:
* FROM : list the tables the query uses to return the data,
* SELECT : list the data to return.

=== WHERE clause ===
The WHERE clause doesn't influence the columns the query returns but the rows.  It filters the rows applying ''predicates'' on it.  A ''predicate'' specifies conditions that can be true or false.  SQL can handle conditions whose result is unknown.  For example, the following query returns the reunions which have a B priority level:
* '''Query''':
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
SELECT *
FROM reunion
WHERE reunion.priority = 'B';
&lt;/source&gt;

* '''Result''':
&lt;pre&gt;
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|id_reunion |name         |description                                |priority |planned |date       |hour     |duration |id_office |pdf_report      |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------------------------------|---------|--------|-----------|---------|---------|----------|----------------|
|3          |Change       |What we need to change in the project.     |B        |1       |2008-06-03 |9:30:00  |90       |41        |34876...4846548 |
|5          |Reporting    |Explanation to the new beginner.           |B        |1       |2009-03-15 |14:00:00 |60       |7         |19739...37718   |
|6          |Learning     |A new software version has been installed. |B        |1       |2009-09-21 |16:00:00 |120      |11        |785278...37528  |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
&lt;/pre&gt;
The table name can be omitted if it is not ambiguous.

==== Predicate ====
Compared to the second operand, the first operand can be :
* equal : &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt;
* different : &lt;code&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
* lesser : &lt;code&gt;&lt;&lt;/code&gt;
* lesser or equal : &lt;code&gt;&lt;=&lt;/code&gt;
* greater : &lt;code&gt;&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
* greater or equal : &lt;code&gt;&gt;=&lt;/code&gt;

The following query returns the reunions which have another priority level than B:
* '''Query''':
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
SELECT *
FROM reunion
WHERE priority &lt;&gt; 'B';
&lt;/source&gt;

* '''Result''':
&lt;pre&gt;
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|id_reunion |name         |description                                |priority |planned |date       |hour     |duration |id_office |pdf_report      |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------------------------------|---------|--------|-----------|---------|---------|----------|----------------|
|1          |Planning     |We need to plan the project.               |A        |1       |2008-03-24 |10:30:00 |60       |35        |48644...846348  |
|2          |Progress     |What we have done.                         |C        |1       |2008-05-12 |14:00:00 |30       |13        |9862...15676    |
|4          |Presentation |Presentation of the project.               |D        |0       |2008-09-11 |15:30:00 |120      |27        |NULL            |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
&lt;/pre&gt;

==== Operators ====
The WHERE clause can have several conditions using the operators AND (all the conditions must be true) and OR (only one condition needs to be true).  The operator OR is inclusive (several conditions can be true).  The order of evaluation can be indicated with brackets.  NOT inverts a condition.  The following query returns the reunions which have a B priority level &lt;u&gt;and&lt;/u&gt; last more than an hour &lt;u&gt;or&lt;/u&gt; which take place on 2008/05/12:
* '''Query''':
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
SELECT *
FROM reunion
WHERE (priority = 'B' AND NOT duration &lt;= 60) OR date = '2008-05-12';
&lt;/source&gt;

* '''Result''':
&lt;pre&gt;
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|id_reunion |name         |description                                |priority |planned |date       |hour     |duration |id_office |pdf_report      |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------------------------------|---------|--------|-----------|---------|---------|----------|----------------|
|2          |Progress     |What we have done.                         |C        |1       |2008-05-12 |14:00:00 |30       |13        |9862...15676    |
|3          |Change       |What we need to change in the project.     |B        |1       |2008-06-03 |9:30:00  |90       |41        |34876...4846548 |
|6          |Learning     |A new software version has been installed. |B        |1       |2009-09-21 |16:00:00 |120      |11        |785278...37528  |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
&lt;/pre&gt;

==== LIKE ====
LIKE allows simplified regular expression matching.  It can be applied on the text columns (CHAR, VARCHAR,...).
* ''Alphanumerical characters'' only match identical text,
* &lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt; is a wildcard that matches any text,
* &lt;code&gt;_&lt;/code&gt; is a wildcard that matches any single character,

The following query returns the reunions which end with &quot;ing&quot; and which contain &quot; the &quot; in its description:
* '''Query''':
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
SELECT *
FROM reunion
WHERE name LIKE '%ing' AND description LIKE '% the %';
&lt;/source&gt;

* '''Result''':
&lt;pre&gt;
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|id_reunion |name         |description                                |priority |planned |date       |hour     |duration |id_office |pdf_report      |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------------------------------|---------|--------|-----------|---------|---------|----------|----------------|
|1          |Planning     |We need to plan the project.               |A        |1       |2008-03-24 |10:30:00 |60       |35        |48644...846348  |
|5          |Reporting    |Explanation to the new beginner.           |B        |1       |2009-03-15 |14:00:00 |60       |7         |19739...37718   |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
&lt;/pre&gt;

==== BETWEEN and IN ====
BETWEEN matches a range of values that can be numbers, dates or times.  IN matches a list of allowed values.  The following query returns the reunions which take place between 2008-04-01 and 2009-04-01 and have an A, B or D priority level:
* '''Query''':
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
SELECT *
FROM reunion
WHERE date BETWEEN '2008-04-01' AND '2009-04-01' AND priority IN ('A', 'B', 'D');
&lt;/source&gt;

* '''Result''':
&lt;pre&gt;
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|id_reunion |name         |description                                |priority |planned |date       |hour     |duration |id_office |pdf_report      |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------------------------------|---------|--------|-----------|---------|---------|----------|----------------|
|3          |Change       |What we need to change in the project.     |B        |1       |2008-06-03 |9:30:00  |90       |41        |34876...4846548 |
|4          |Presentation |Presentation of the project.               |D        |0       |2008-09-11 |15:30:00 |120      |27        |NULL            |
|5          |Reporting    |Explanation to the new beginner.           |B        |1       |2009-03-15 |14:00:00 |60       |7         |19739...37718   |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
&lt;/pre&gt;

==== EXISTS ====
EXISTS is usually used with a subselect.  This predicate is true if the list (i.e. the result set of a subselect) is not empty.  This keyword allows to filter the returned rows using data that are not directly associated to the returned rows (i.e. they are not joined, not linked, not related... to the returned rows) so you can not use junction in this case.  For instance, we want to retrieve all the reunions for which there is at least one reunion two times longer:
* '''Query''':
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
SELECT *
FROM reunion r1
WHERE EXISTS (
  SELECT r2.id_reunion
  FROM reunion r2
  WHERE r2.duration = r1.duration * 2
);
&lt;/source&gt;

* '''Result''':
&lt;pre&gt;
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|id_reunion |name         |description                                |priority |planned |date       |hour     |duration |id_office |pdf_report      |

&lt;/pre&gt;

The duration of another reunion is used in this query whereas there is no join, no link and no relationship between the two rows.  This condition can not be done without EXISTS.  Note that the subselect uses the alias r1 whereas this alias is defined in the main query.

EXISTS is also used to match a lack of data.  Let's remember the employee table and the members table:
{| width=&quot;100%&quot;
|----
||&lt;center&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|----
|colspan=&quot;5&quot;|&lt;center&gt;'''employee'''&lt;/center&gt;
|----
!|&lt;u&gt;id_employee&lt;/u&gt;|| firstname || lastname || phone || mail
|----
||1|| Big || BOSS || 936854270 || big.boss@company.com

||7|| Jenny || THE WIKIPEDIAN || 936854276 || jenny.the-wikipedian@company.com
|----
|}
&lt;/center&gt;
||
&lt;center&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|----
|colspan=&quot;5&quot;|&lt;center&gt;'''members'''&lt;/center&gt;
|----
!|&lt;u&gt;# id_employee&lt;/u&gt;|| &lt;u&gt;# id_project&lt;/u&gt;
|----
||3|| 2

|----

|----

|----
|}
&lt;/center&gt;
|}

The following query returns the employees who are not linked to any project (i.e. the ones there is no relationship for them in the members table):
* '''Query''':
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
SELECT *
FROM employees e
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
  SELECT m.id_employee
  FROM members m
  WHERE m.id_employee = e.id_employee
);
&lt;/source&gt;

* '''Result''':
&lt;pre&gt;

|------------------------------------------------------------------|
|id_employee |firstname |lastname |phone     |mail                 |
|------------|----------|---------|----------|---------------------|
|1           |Big       |BOSS     |936854270 |big.boss@company.com |
|------------------------------------------------------------------|
&lt;/pre&gt;

==== IS NULL ====
IS NULL tests if a column is filled.  It is often used for foreign key columns.

=== FROM clause ===
The FROM clause defines the tables that are used for the query but it can also join tables.  A JOIN builds a ''super'' table with the columns of two tables to be used for the query.  To explain what a join is, we consider two archaic tables without primary keys nor foreign keys:
{| width=&quot;100%&quot;
|----
||
&lt;center&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|----
|colspan=&quot;2&quot;|&lt;center&gt;'''table_1'''&lt;/center&gt;
|----
!|common_value|| specific_value_1
|----
||red|| 9999
|----
||grey|| 6666
|----
||white|| 0000
|----
||purple|| 7777
|----
||purple|| 2222
|----
||black|| 8888
|----
|}
&lt;/center&gt;
||&lt;center&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|----
|colspan=&quot;2&quot;|&lt;center&gt;'''table_2'''&lt;/center&gt;
|----
!|common_value|| specific_value_2
|----
||green|| HHHHHH
|----
||yellow|| PPPPPP
|----
||black|| FFFFFF
|----
||red|| OOOOOO
|----
||red|| LLLLLL
|----
||blue|| RRRRRR
|----
|}
&lt;/center&gt;
|}

We want to associate values from columns of different tables matching values on a given column in each table.

==== FULL OUTER JOIN ====
A JOIN is made matching a column on a table to a column on the other table.  After a FULL OUTER JOIN, for a given value (red), for a given row with this value on one table ([ red | 9999 ]), one row is created for each row that matches on the other table ([ red | OOOOOO ] and [ red | LLLLLL ]).  If a value exists in only one table, then a row is created and is completed with NULL columns.
{| width=&quot;100%&quot;
|----
||
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
FROM table_1 FULL OUTER JOIN table_2 ON table_1.common_value = table_2.common_value
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
||&lt;center&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|----
!|common_value|| specific_value_1|| specific_value_2
|----
||red|| 9999 || OOOOOO
|----
||red|| 9999 || LLLLLL
|----
||grey|| 6666 || style=&quot;background-color:#ccc;&quot; | '''NULL'''
|----
||white|| 0000 || style=&quot;background-color:#ccc;&quot; | '''NULL'''
|----
||purple|| 7777 || style=&quot;background-color:#ccc;&quot; | '''NULL'''
|----
||purple|| 2222 || style=&quot;background-color:#ccc;&quot; | '''NULL'''
|----
||black|| 8888 || FFFFFF
|----
||green|| style=&quot;background-color:#ccc;&quot; | '''NULL''' || HHHHHH
|----
||yellow|| style=&quot;background-color:#ccc;&quot; | '''NULL''' || PPPPPP
|----
||blue|| style=&quot;background-color:#ccc;&quot; | '''NULL''' || RRRRRR
|----
|}
&lt;/center&gt;
|}

==== RIGHT OUTER JOIN ====
The RIGHT OUTER JOIN is like the FULL OUTER JOIN but it doesn't create row for values that don't exist on the left table.
{| width=&quot;100%&quot;
|----
||
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
FROM table_1 RIGHT OUTER JOIN table_2 ON table_1.common_value = table_2.common_value
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
||&lt;center&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|----
!|common_value|| specific_value_1|| specific_value_2
|----
||red|| 9999 || OOOOOO
|----
||red|| 9999 || LLLLLL
|----
||black|| 8888 || FFFFFF
|----
||green|| style=&quot;background-color:#ccc;&quot; | '''NULL''' || HHHHHH
|----
||yellow|| style=&quot;background-color:#ccc;&quot; | '''NULL''' || PPPPPP
|----
||blue|| style=&quot;background-color:#ccc;&quot; | '''NULL''' || RRRRRR
|----
|}
&lt;/center&gt;
|}

==== LEFT OUTER JOIN ====
The LEFT OUTER JOIN is like the FULL OUTER JOIN but it doesn't create row for values that don't exist on the right table.
{| width=&quot;100%&quot;
|----
||
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
FROM table_1 LEFT OUTER JOIN table_2 ON table_1.common_value = table_2.common_value
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
||&lt;center&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|----
!|common_value|| specific_value_1|| specific_value_2
|----
||red|| 9999 || OOOOOO
|----
||red|| 9999 || LLLLLL
|----
||grey|| 6666 || style=&quot;background-color:#ccc;&quot; | '''NULL'''
|----
||white|| 0000 || style=&quot;background-color:#ccc;&quot; | '''NULL'''
|----
||purple|| 7777 || style=&quot;background-color:#ccc;&quot; | '''NULL'''
|----
||purple|| 2222 || style=&quot;background-color:#ccc;&quot; | '''NULL'''
|----
||black|| 8888 || FFFFFF
|----
|}
&lt;/center&gt;
|}

==== INNER JOIN ====
The INNER JOIN is like the FULL OUTER JOIN but it creates row only for values that exist on both the left table and the right table.
{| width=&quot;100%&quot;
|----
||
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
FROM table_1 INNER JOIN table_2 ON table_1.common_value = table_2.common_value
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
||&lt;center&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|----
!|common_value|| specific_value_1|| specific_value_2
|----
||red|| 9999 || OOOOOO
|----
||red|| 9999 || LLLLLL
|----
||black|| 8888 || FFFFFF
|----
|}
&lt;/center&gt;
|}

==== Alias ====
The FROM clause can declare several tables, separated by &lt;code&gt;,&lt;/code&gt; and aliases can be defined for table name with the keyword AS, which allows the user to make several joins with the same tables.  The following query is equivalent to the INNER JOIN above:
* '''Query''':
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
SELECT *
FROM table_1 AS t1, table_2 AS t2
WHERE t1.common_value = t2.common_value
&lt;/source&gt;

The keyword AS can be omitted.

=== SELECT clause ===
The SELECT clause doesn't influence the data processed by the query but the data returned to the user.  &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; return all the data processed after joining and filtering.  Otherwise, the SELECT clause lists expressions separated by &lt;code&gt;,&lt;/code&gt;.

The expressions can be a table name, a table name and a column name separated by a dot or simply a column name if it is not ambiguous.  The SELECT clause also allows evaluated expressions like addition, subtraction, concatenation, ...  An expression can be followed by an alias with the keyword AS.  The keyword AS can be omitted.

Here is an example:
* '''Query''':
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
SELECT reunion.id_reunion, concat(name, ' : ', reunion.description) n, priority AS p, planned * 10 AS plan, duration + 10 AS reunion_length
FROM reunion;
&lt;/source&gt;

* '''Result''':
&lt;pre&gt;
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|id_reunion |n                                                     |p |plan |reunion_length |
|-----------|------------------------------------------------------|--|-----|---------------|
|1          |Planning : We need to plan the project.               |A |10   |70             |
|2          |Progress : What we have done.                         |C |10   |40             |
|3          |Change : What we need to change in the project.       |B |10   |100            |
|4          |Presentation : Presentation of the project.           |D |0    |130            |
|5          |Reporting : Explanation to the new beginner.          |B |10   |70             |
|6          |Learning : A new software version has been install... |B |10   |130            |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
&lt;/pre&gt;

The expressions can be also the following aggregation functions:
* &lt;code&gt;count(*)&lt;/code&gt;: the count of rows returned,
* &lt;code&gt;max(&lt;column_name&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;: the greatest value of the column,
* &lt;code&gt;min(&lt;column_name&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;: the lowest value of the column.

Here is a new example:
* '''Query''':
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
SELECT count(*) * 10 AS c, max(date) AS latest_date, min(reunion.date) oldest_date
FROM reunion;
&lt;/source&gt;

* '''Result''':
&lt;pre&gt;
|-----------------------------|
|c  |latest_date |oldest_date |
|---|------------|------------|
|60 |2009-09-21  |2008-03-24  |
|-----------------------------|
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== ORDER BY clause ===
The ORDER BY clause sorts the rows returned by the query by one or several columns.  The sort is done with the first column mentioned.  The second column is used to sort the rows which have the same value in the first column and so on.  The keywords ASC or DESC can be added after each column.  ASC indicates an ascending sort.  DESC indicates a descending sort.  Default is a descending sort.  Let's do two simple requests, the first sorting by only one column and the second sorting by two columns:
* '''Query''':
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
SELECT *
FROM reunion
ORDER BY priority ASC;
&lt;/source&gt;

* '''Result''':
&lt;pre&gt;
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

|5          |Reporting    |Explanation to the new beginner.           |B        |1       |2009-03-15 |14:00:00 |60       |7         |19739...37718   |

|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== GROUP BY clause ===
The GROUP BY clause is used for aggregation operations.  It gathers the rows into groups, for instance, all the rows that have the same value in a given column.  After gathering rows into groups, any aggregation operation is applied on each group instead of a unique big group of rows.  As a consequence, an aggregation operation will return as many result as the number of groups.  Groups can be formed with all the rows that have the same value for a given column or the same combination of values for several given columns.  For instance, we want to know the number of reunions for each type of priority:
* '''Query''':
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
SELECT count(*) as number, priority
FROM reunion
GROUP BY priority;
&lt;/source&gt;

* '''Result''':
&lt;pre&gt;
|-----------------|
|number |priority |
|-------|---------|
|1      |A        |
|3      |B        |
|1      |C        |
|1      |D        |
|-----------------|
&lt;/pre&gt;

Due to the GROUP BY clause, the aggregation function count(*) doesn't return a global count but a count for each priority level (A, B, C and D).
* '''Query''':
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
SELECT count(*) as number, planned, duration
FROM reunion
GROUP BY planned, duration;
&lt;/source&gt;

* '''Result''':
&lt;pre&gt;
|--------------------------|
|number |planned |duration |
|-------|--------|---------|
|1      |0       |120      |
|1      |1       |30       |
|2      |1       |60       |
|1      |1       |90       |
|1      |1       |120      |
|--------------------------|
&lt;/pre&gt;

Note that there are four groups with 1 for the column &lt;code&gt;planned&lt;/code&gt; and there are two groups with 120 for the column &lt;code&gt;duration&lt;/code&gt;.  However, you can see that there is no group with the same combination of values from the two columns.

=== HAVING clause ===
The HAVING clause is used with the GROUP BY clause.  The HAVING clause contains a predicate and removes from the returned rows the groups for which the predicate is false.  For example, we want to retrieve only the priorities for which there are at least two reunions with the same priority level:
* '''Query''':
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
SELECT priority
FROM reunion
GROUP BY priority
HAVING count(*) &gt; 1;
&lt;/source&gt;

* '''Result''':
&lt;pre&gt;
|---------|
|priority |
|---------|
|B        |
|---------|
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== FETCH FIRST clause ===
The FETCH FIRST clause is used to limit the number of returned rows.  Only the first rows are returned.  The number of returned rows is the number indicated in the clause.
* '''Query''':
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
SELECT *
FROM reunion
FETCH FIRST 4 ROWS ONLY;
&lt;/source&gt;

* '''Result''':
&lt;pre&gt;
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|id_reunion |name         |description                                |priority |planned |date       |hour     |duration |id_office |pdf_report      |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------------------------------|---------|--------|-----------|---------|---------|----------|----------------|
|1          |Planning     |We need to plan the project.               |A        |1       |2008-03-24 |10:30:00 |60       |35        |48644...846348  |
|2          |Progress     |What we have done.                         |C        |1       |2008-05-12 |14:00:00 |30       |13        |9862...15676    |
|3          |Change       |What we need to change in the project.     |B        |1       |2008-06-03 |9:30:00  |90       |41        |34876...4846548 |
|4          |Presentation |Presentation of the project.               |D        |0       |2008-09-11 |15:30:00 |120      |27        |NULL            |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
&lt;/pre&gt;

This clause is often used not to return useless rows for test or to improve the performance.

Now you can explore all the data of an already existing database.

==SQL Functions==

* COUNT
* AVG
* MIN
* MAX
* SUM

Eg: &lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;SELECT '''COUNT(*)''' FROM reunion&lt;/source&gt; returns the number of rows in the table '''reunion'''.

The history of aerial bombing operations over Europe consists primarily of three contrasting efforts: those executed by Germany (the Luftwaffe), by Great Britain (the R.A.F. Bomber Command), and by the United States (predominantly the Eighth Air Force).  The year 1940 marked the trial and abandonment, both by the Germans and the British, of long-standing notions about strategic air power.

==German lessons==
[[File:Surreydocks1941.jpg|thumb|right|140px|A German Heinkel He-111 over London dockyard]]The Germans learned serious lessons in target selection and aircraft construction.  The first lesson was that the choice targets of Royal Air Force airfields and the seaport docks and shipping yards were too hastily forsaken for the urban areas of London and Coventry.  Many scholars agree that England was virtually on the brink of strategic collapse due to Luftwaffe bombing attacks on airfields and ports, when German high command concluded that these attacks weren't having enough effect and switched to city bombing.

Concerning the second lesson, the Luftwaffe's medium-sized bombers were not sufficient to inflict the necessary damage that a strategic campaign supposedly required.  This lack of heavy bombers was not the only handicap.  The German bombers were not adequately armed with power-operated turrets.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Uses of Air Power in 1939-1945&quot;, Sir Robert Saundby, [http://books.google.com/books?ei=9--ITOWwEMOBlAe_vK3bDw&amp;ct=result&amp;id=8QTQAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%22the+impact+of+Air+power%22+Eugene+Emme&amp;q=%22Excerpts+from+a+lecture%22#search_anchor excerpts from a lecture] given on March 18, 1948, at London University, as condensed in '''The Aeroplane''', April 16, 1948.  (From Eugene M. Emme, ed., '''The Impact of Air Power''' (Princeton, NJ: D. Van Nostrand Co., 1959), p. 218.)&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, their fighter escorts flew in close support rather than general support,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Strategic Air Power in the European War&quot;, General Carl A. Spaatz, from &quot;Strategic Air Power: [http://books.google.com/books?ei=9--ITOWwEMOBlAe_vK3bDw&amp;ct=result&amp;id=8QTQAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%22the+impact+of+Air+power%22+Eugene+Emme&amp;q=%22Fulfillment+of+a+Concept%22#search_anchor Fulfillment of a Concept]&quot;, '''Foreign Affairs''', April 1946.  (From Eugene M. Emme, ed., '''The Impact of Air Power''' (Princeton, NJ: D. Van Nostrand Co., 1959), p. 228.)&lt;/ref&gt; thus retarding the ability to dogfight against RAF fighters.  Of course the Germans were not alone in committing crucial mistakes.

==The British approach==
Britain's Bomber Command tried in late 1939 to fly daylight precision bombing raids over Germany. Although pre-war theory stressed the invulnerability of bombers flying in close formation with guns blazing, the small-caliber armaments on the Whitley and Wellington bombers were not effective against Luftwaffe Me-109s coming from behind or across the beam.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Higham, '''Air Power: A Concise History''', (New York: St. Martin's Press, 1972), p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt;  The decision was made to switch to bombing specific oil and transportation facilities at night. [[File:Air Chief Marshal Sir Arthur Harris.jpg|thumb|left|160px|The RAF's Air Marshal Arthur Harris]]However, the precision aspect of bombing went out the window. Bombers flying at night were often unable to hit a prescribed city, much less a specific factory or rail yard. With the failure of both daylight and nighttime precision raids, the British settled upon the practice of area bombing--that is, &quot;dehousing and demoralizing&quot; the German populace by placing bombs in a loose pattern on city centers. Aerial photographs were then taken in the summer of 1941. The results, compiled in the Butt Report, were disheartening. It was found that only 20% of the bombers were putting their payload within five miles of the target.&lt;ref&gt;Lee Kennett, '''A History of Strategic Bombing''', (New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1982), p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt;  Nonetheless, the new bombing policy was staunchly adhered to under the guidance of Commander-in-Chief of Bomber Command, Air Chief Marshal Sir Arthur Harris. The underlying fault with Harris' obstinacy was its rejection of traditional grand strategy: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Area attacks ... vitiated forces rather than concentrating them against a decisive point, they were uneconomical of force, and they strengthened the enemy will to resist and innoculated [sic] him against later onslaughts.''&lt;ref&gt;Higham, '''Air Power''', p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

So convinced of the correctness of their method, the British air authorities encouraged American leaders to adopt the area methodology. While Bomber Command went on its nightly raids, the world stood back to analyze, admire, or condemn the fires in the German cities. 

==The American effort==

The entry of the American Eighth Air Force in Europe was slow and staggered. The American force had no desire, at least initially, to join in on the night raids with the British. Instead, minor attacks were carried out against precision targets (usually railways, factories, and submarine pens)&lt;ref&gt;Kennett, '''History''', p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; in France, Belgium, and the Netherlands. With their Norden bombsights American bombardiers wished to flaunt their daylight precision bombing technique, thoroughly practiced on the home front bombing ranges. However, the early needs of Operation TORCH in North Africa siphoned away many American bombers from the western European theater. After the Casablanca conference in January 1943, the Eighth was back in Britain ready to bomb &quot;around-the-clock&quot; with the RAF. The bloody RAF raid on Hamburg&lt;ref&gt;Note: The city of Hamburg was devastated by the air raid. Over one million civilians fled the burning city; yet, 31,000 to 50,000 people unfortunate enough to remain were killed. The deaths were often due to asphyxiation, crushing, or intense burns and heat from the notorious fire storm which ensued.&lt;/ref&gt; was complemented by American daylight raids on July 25-26, 1943. Paying little attention to earlier British trials and errors, the American bomber leaders learned for themselves, quite senselessly, the same lessons their RAF counterparts had learned three years before.
 
The cloudy continental weather and the haze of the industrial Ruhr valley greatly reduced the Norden sight's accuracy. Also its necessity for a long straight approach to guarantee accuracy made the bomber more vulnerable to anti-aircraft fire (flak).&lt;ref&gt;Higham, '''Air Power''', p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; Because fighter escorts with acceptable ranges were not yet available, the lone B-17 and B-24 bombers in their stacked formations learned like the British that on-board defensive armament alone was simply not enough. The lack of insight was quick to show. On August 17, 1943, 315 B-17s made an attack on ball-bearing plants at Schweinfurt in which sixty Flying Fortresses were shot down.&lt;ref&gt;Note: Although 376 B-I7s were dispatched, only 315 made it to the target run. The raid also included an attack on the Messerschmitt factory at Regensburg.&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:B-17F formation over Schweinfurt, Germany, August 17, 1943.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Eighth Air Force raid on Schweinfurt]]A loss rate of 19% was clearly intolerable, but another raid on Schweinfurt was made on October 14. On this raid the bombers were incessantly harassed while out of fighter escort range, and 62 planes out of 228 were destroyed. The ratio was now up over one-in-four, and each Fortress carried ten men. The Eighth Air Force, for the time, had to give up any more raids of this type. 

The invasion of Normandy brought about a new bombing priority: the rail lines of western France were to be cut in order to hinder German reinforcements being sent to the area come D-day. Unfortunately these stretches of track often came very close to urban populations, and the lives of the French citizens were overruled by military necessity. In April 1944, British and American bombs killed &quot;250 people at Juvisy, 200 at Toulon, 500 at Lille, 850 at Rouen, and 650 at Paris.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Kennett, '''History''', p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt;  The raids seemed to produce the desired effect, though, and the OVERLORD landing and COBRA breakout were made much easier. With the army's success on the ground, the Eighth returned to its bombing missions over Germany proper.
 
===Transition from precision to area bombing===
But the return was not quite the same. The nature of American bombing policy definitely changed in a two-step process. The first phase was a result primarily of General Eisenhower's changing position. Eisenhower stated, &quot;While I have always insisted that U.S. Strategic Air Forces be directed against precision targets, I am always prepared to take part in anything that gives real promise to ending the war quickly.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Schaffer, '''Wings of Judgment''', (New York: Oxford University Press, 1985), p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; This opened the door for new methods of bombing to be tested and tried. President Roosevelt himself summarized in August 1944 a common belief among military circles:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''We have got to be tough with Germany, and I mean the German people not just the Nazis. ...It is of the utmost importance that every person in Germany should realize that this time Germany is a defeated nation. ...The German people as a whole must have it driven home to them that the whole nation has been engaged in a lawless conspiracy against the decencies of modern civilization.''&lt;ref&gt;Schaffer, '''Wings of Judgment''', pp. 88-89.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The first aerial consequence of this policy statement was Operation CLARION. This plan was drafted in December 1944 and was intended to break civilian morale by sending a wide series of low-level attacks across Germany. The targets were ostensibly transportation ones, but the real objective was the psychological collapse of the German populace at large. Small towns were hit later in 1945 in a deliberate attempt to bring home to the German citizen the omnipresence of the Allied air forces. CLARION was the call to arms for those military leaders who wished to move from the precise to the indiscriminate in bombing.

[[File:Fotothek df ps 0000010 Blick vom Rathausturm.jpg|thumb|220px|left|Dresden incinerated by Allied bombing]]The second phase of the new American doctrine was evidenced in Operation THUNDERCLAP. It was a plan enacted in January 1945 which made Berlin, Leipzig, and Dresden acceptable, even preferred, targets. There was a two-fold reasoning behind THUNDERCLAP: one, that adding to the &quot;existing pandemonium&quot; would hasten the collapse and surrender of Germany and, two, that the Soviets would see for themselves the destructive power of the Anglo-American bomber forces.&lt;ref&gt;Schaffer, '''Wings of Judgment''', pp. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; Berlin was attacked on February 3 by some 900 B-17s. Some military objectives were hit, but 25,000 civilians may have perished.&lt;ref&gt;Schaffer, '''Wings of Judgment''', pp. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; Ten days later, historic Dresden was walloped by a two-day combined British and American raid which killed at least 30,000 civilians.&lt;ref&gt;Note: The casualties at Dresden were amplified by the large number of refugees seeking shelter from the advancing Red Army. The total death toll has never been undisputably established, and legitimate estimates range from 25,000 to about 100,000.  Lee Kennett has stated (p. 161) that an estimate of 500,000 exists, but most scholars agree that that many bodies could not have been counted, much less disposed of by the authorities there.&lt;/ref&gt; The American bombing policy over Germany had drastically changed and probably would have continued in this direction had the European war not ended. The ruthless attacks that summer on numerous Japanese cities lends credence to this assumption.

==Outcomes of the campaigns== 
After about three years in Europe, American strategic air forces had developed into a gigantic operational group. At its maximum in August 1944, the U.S. Army Air Forces had over 619,000 combat personnel. These men dropped 1,461,864 tons of 
bombs on Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Saundby, &quot;The Uses&quot;, p. 225.&lt;/ref&gt;  Together with RAF Bomber Command's substantial efforts, 3,600,000 German dwelling units (20% of the total) were destroyed or heavily damaged. The homeless totaled between seven and eight million. Estimates suggest that 780,000 were wounded in bombing attacks and that 305,000 civilians were killed.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Air Victory in Europe,&quot; excerpt from the '''Summary Report (European War)''' by the United States Strategic Bombing Survey, September 30, 1945. (From Eugene M. Emme, ed., The Impact of Air Power (Princeton, N J: D. Van Nostrand Co., 1959), p. 269.)
&lt;/ref&gt; These are minimum figures, though.  It has been proposed that more than 600,000 people in Germany were killed by &quot;terror bombing&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Ken Brown, &quot;The Last Just War: How Just Was It?&quot;, '''The Progressive''', August 1982, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; The accompanying graphic, derived from United States Strategic Bombing Survey statistics, helps to illustrate the enormous increase in the American air infrastructure. 

&lt;center&gt;[[File:Kohs_-_Strategic_Bombing_statistics.jpg|550px]]&lt;/center&gt; 
At what cost was this destruction achieved? Throughout the course of the air war against Germany, 9,949 American bomber planes were lost. This figure accounts for a significant fraction of the total number of bombers in action. It should be 
considered that with each lost bomber went not one engine, but usually four, not one man, but perhaps ten. In fact, 79,265 American aviators were lost in action&lt;ref&gt;Saundby, &quot;The Uses&quot;, p. 225.&lt;/ref&gt; (more than 52,000 of them killed)&lt;ref&gt;Michael S. Sherry, '''The Rise of American Air Power''', p. 204&lt;/ref&gt; during bombing sorties. These fliers represented one of the most highly-trained and valuable segments of the military. Was their loss necessary?

:Ugh... not my call to make.  This content was mostly authored in early 1990, and it's not been a &quot;top of mind&quot; area of inquiry for me since then.

== American journals and the strategic bombing of Germany ==

An [http://www.mywikibiz.com/Directory:American_Journals_and_the_Strategic_Bombing_of_Germany honors thesis] about American journals and the their portrayal of the strategic bombing campaign against Germany may be useful additional reading. -- [[User:Thekohser|Thekohser]] ([[User talk:Thekohser|talk]]) 20:31, 10 September 2010 (UTC)

== What do you mean by &quot;non authorative reference (i.e., a self published work)&quot;? ==

QuiteUnusual,

Do you teach or taught at the time in the Department of History of Emory University? Did you exchanged some correspondence with Emory University that corroborates your statement, that you would like to share with the rest of us? What evidence can you present supporting your statement that the reference is &quot;non '''authoritative'''&quot;? You mean to say that a &quot;self published work&quot; is one example or synonymous of non authoritative work? Are you saying that Emory University is not the publisher? Are you familiar with the relations between Emory University, its faculty, staff, and students concerning the publisher and rights to their printed work? Do you know anything about Emory University at all?

Off-topic, personal message: You might consider reviewing you Wikibooks user page, where you list &quot;Books I Wrote or Was a Major Contributor To.&quot; A book is a book. A wikibook is a wikibook. You did fooled me. You might want to try &quot;Wikibooks I Wrote or Was a Major Contributor To.&quot; I'm sure you can walk into someone's office an ask for a second opinion or if this is good advice that you are getting for free. Maybe &quot;It's ''not'' just a user page.&quot;

Warmest regards,

Virgilio A. P. Machado

:Vapmachado,
:Just to let you know I have placed back the OR tag to address the concerns raised by the pages main contributor, [[User:Thekohser|Thekohser]], raised in the reading room.  Honors theses are not usually considered published peer-reviewed  material.  They are graded and accepted (or not) as in terms of a particular students attempt to graduate.  In my short time in academia I have encountered honors theses that ranged from wonderful to atrocious, but were still considered acceptable for the purposes of the student graduating. I would hope people do not generally start using honors theses as scholarly references.  Overall I would generally agree that honors theses as a group should not be called authoritative. [[User:QuiteUnusual|QuiteUnusual]]'s interaction with Emory University is not really relevant.  [[User:Thenub314|Thenub]][[Special:Contributions/Thenub314|314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 03:32, 20 October 2010 (UTC)

::Thenub314
::Thanks for letting me know that you placed back the OR tag that you added there in the first place on Sep. 17 with the summary &quot;from comments by Thekohser in WB:RR/G this may contain OR, tagging so someone more knowledgeable in this area can sort it out at some point.&quot; (a) You seem to be aware that QuiteUnusual removed the reference I added to the page. (b) Your reason for keeping that reference out of the text is that you do not consider that source a scholarly and/or authoritative reference. Since, from your own words, your objection is a suspicion of OR, (c) it's not at all clear to me what you were referring to when you wrote &quot;in this area.&quot; I might be so far off what you meant that I don't even dare to make a guess. Please also forgive my unfamiliarity with (d) your summary &quot;as per authors concerns.&quot; I even did a search on it but got no results. If you could be so kind as to confirm my assumptions (a) and (b), and clarifying (c) and (d), we would have some common solid ground to pursue this exchange. Your cooperation is deeply appreciated.
::Sincerely,
::Virgilio A. P. Machado
::[[User:Vapmachado|Vapmachado]] ([[User talk:Vapmachado|talk]]) 03:41, 21 October 2010 (UTC)

::: a) Yes.

::: b) Yes, as explained in my comment.  &lt;small&gt;Let me comment further that my estimation that this work is not an appropriate reference has nothing to do with the merits of the content of the work. It is merely my opinion about its use at wikibooks based on my understanding of the publication process this particular paper went through.&lt;/small&gt;

::: c) &quot;This area&quot; being the history of World War II.

::: d) &quot;as per authors concerns&quot; was referring to the concerns raised by Thekohser (who I believe is author reference you added and also main contributor to the current page) that this page possibly violated our OR policy (as explained in the first edit summary you quoted). [[User:Thenub314|Thenub]][[Special:Contributions/Thenub314|314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 05:36, 21 October 2010 (UTC)

:My reasons are simple. A reference should be to something considered a [[W:WP:RS|reliable source]]. Using the reference tag for something that doesn't meet that standard will suggest to the reader that the source is authoritative and can be relied on (for example, is from a peer-reviewed journal). In this particular case the source did not appear to meet that standard. You will see if you browse my contribution history that I often make similar changes. I will remove the reference tag from any Wikipedia link for the same reason - WP is not a reliable source. It is fine to direct the reader to go and look at an external source, but not to list it as a reference. So, I personally would have put the thesis link in as &quot;further reading&quot; or as a normal external URL without the reference tag to avoid the implication that this was a reliable source. Hope that's clear. &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 11:47, 21 October 2010 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Renaming datasets ==

=== Cluttered lists ===
After you've been conducting your study for some time, you might find your list with datasets cluttered. Especially with names like &quot;temp&quot; or &quot;temp2&quot;, etc. You can not rename these datasets and when you &quot;delete&quot; them, only the status changes. You may want to delete these sets or rename them.

In general it is a better approach to rename your datasets, because of regulations and because of complexity.

=== Renaming ===
You could add a &quot;z_&quot; as prefix, so all your existing datasets go to the end of your list and new ones will be on top.
If you look at the tables involved you'll see archived_dataset_file, dataset_crf_version_map, dataset_filter_map, dataset_item_status, dataset_study_group_class_map. 

To see a list of all tables: login to your server; sudo as user postgres; start psql; connect to openclinica, describe all tables.

cd /usr/bin

sudo -u postgres ./psql

(in psql)

\c openclinica

\dt

The one you're aiming at is dataset, of course. To see the structure of the table, type &quot;\d dataset&quot;
List your datasets with &quot;select dataset_id, study_id, name from dataset;&quot;

Find in this output the study_id of the study for which you want to rename your datasets, for example study_id=7.
Your update statement will be &quot;update dataset set name='z_'||name where study_id=7;&quot;

=== Deleting===
If you really want to delete the datasets, you would have to issue a series of sql-statements like:
&quot;delete from archived_dataset_file where dataset_id in (select dataset_id from dataset where study_id=7);&quot;
And you would have to do this for all related tables and finally delete the records from table dataset.

And whatever you choose: before you do anything, make a [[OpenClinica_User_Manual/BackupAndRestore|backup]].

'''NOTE''': Shown below are stamps from Deutsche Post's &quot;Internetmarke&quot; online postage system, introduced in June 2008. 

The system offers customers the option of including an image from about 200 pre-selected photo-illustrations. 

Although the stamps show the month of purchase they are valid indefinitely and thus are more like traditional stamps rather than meter stamps.

'''PV1. Autofranc''' (LV-9), 1931. [[File: MeterCat 5 spaces.jpg|10px]][$350]
: Octagon design which closely resembles bulk mail machine stamps of the period. (See NOTE below Type PV2.) 
:Type PV1 has single line date instead of the dual-line date/hour as found on the bulk mail machine stamps.
: TM: SC with single star at bottom. 
: One machine used at “BERLIN W9” till 1937. 
: Values: [[File: MeterCat 5 spaces.jpg|10px]] 5 to 45 (in steps of 5)




[[File:Germany stamp type PV2.jpg|left|330px]]

'''PV2. Autofranc ''' (FV-1), 1933. 
: Very similar to Type PV1. 
: One machine used in multiple locations with two different town marks.
::::::::::::::::: '''A'''. “BERLIN-CHARLOTTENBURG 5. [[File: MeterCat 5 spaces.jpg|10px]][$500]

: Value: [[File: MeterCat 5 spaces.jpg|10px]]6





[[File:Germany stamp type PV2 NOTE.jpg|right|140px]]
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
'''NOTE''': Common bulk mail machine stamps of the period are easily misidentified as the very rare Types PV1 and PV2.
They can be distinguished most easily by the town mark which has a time range in hours below the date on the bulk mail stamps.
The much rarer Types PV1 and PV2 have date only without time of day. Pictured at right is a typical bulk mail stamp town mark.







[[File:Germany stamp type PV3.jpg|left|346px]]
&lt;br&gt;
'''PV3. Autofranc''' (FV-1), 1938. [[File: MeterCat 5 spaces.jpg|10px]][Extremely rare, value unknown]
: This stamp is from the same machine that produced Type PV2.
: One machine used in a youth hostel in Berlin during parts of 1938 and 1938.
: The stamp is nearly identical to bulk mail machine stamps of the period and can be identified by
: “(HAUS DER JUGEND)” at bottom of the town mark and by the date which has no hour figure.
: TM: DC
:::::::::::::::: Value: [[File: MeterCat 5 spaces.jpg|10px]] 6

'''NOTE''': See the NOTE below PV2. The same situation occurs with PV3 except the bulk mail machine stamps have the hour figure right of the date, as: [[File: MeterCat 5 spaces.jpg|10px]] 00.00 00. –00

'''PV5. ABAS automatic franking systems''' (digital), 1995. 
: From December 1995 to mid-1997 four configurations of self-service digital franking systems were tested at various locations. 
: The four systems were manufactured by Siemens-Nixdorf, Olivetti, Nagler. and IBM. 
: The stamps are very similar in appearance and can be distinguished most easily by the town name. The fonts are different for each manufacturer. 
: Loose stamps were not vended.
: The basic stamp is a horizontal rectangle with simple outer frame line and two panels printed in black. 
: The smaller top panel contains a post horn and the value figures, and the bottom panel contains the town mark and “Deutsche Post AG”. 
: The stamps are often accompanied by a service indicator at left usually printed in red and black (registered, express) but also black alone (economy, airmail).

'''PV6. Samkyung “Briefstation” ''' (digital), 2005. 
: In August 2005 Deutsche Post began testing self-service mailing kiosks in three locations in Cologne. 
: The machines produced both ATM-style automat stamps and meter stamps. 
: The meter is a Francotyp-Postalia model and produces a stamp that closely resembles Group S stamps but has “BRIEF-/STATION” in place of “FRANKIT”. 
: The test ended in the Spring of 2008.

Government is an inherently evil and repressive institution. Whether large and totalitarian, as in Russian Communism, or small and regulatory as in American Capitalism, the philosophy of the Ruling class has been cynical and Machiavellian; that the common people do not know what is good for them, and thus must be kept in line by a higher power. In the United state, two parties clash over the size of government. In the Middle East, oppressive regimes wield the power of government to enforce irrational and made-up nonsense. In China, government prevents citizens from having access to vital information and executes dissidents at will. The list goes on. Look at all the grievances that government causes us. Here's a revolutionary idea for you; how about no government at all?

Corporations are no better.Unlike a government, a corporation does not even pretend to look out for the welfare of the populace. Without government, we would be subject to profit-hungry monster with no laws holding them back. Can the corporation be permanently eliminated?

It is my belief that humans are, for the most part, inherently good. I would like to think that do not need government to be good citizens, we are capable, as good and moral human beings, of following natural law and maintaining order to the extent that we may be able to build a civilized society in the absence of government. The issue is that we have been taught that we need a great surveillance camera to watch us, a great policeman to punish us, and a great legislator to decide for us what is right and wrong.. Some will point to incidents like the 1955 Montreal Police strike, when the city erupted into chaos, or the present-day nation of Somalia, where with no government warlords are free to ruthlessly battle for power. These cases are not anarchism as I imagine it; they are example of what happens when a government collapses and leaves a dangerous power vacuum. The docile Canadians and civilized Somalians were taught that should something go wrong, law enforcement would correct it. Denizens of an Anarchist America will be taught from an early age that they are responsible for their actions and their impact on society. It boils down to the Golden Rule; treat others as you would like to be treated. Stealing, for example, would work for me as a lone selfish individual, but I should not wish that everybody take up stealing. Obviously, I do not want my shit stolen. Anarchism is about leaving such decisions up to the individual. Perhaps the biggest change in an Anarchist Revolution would be how we educate our children; rather than giving them and artificial reward/punishment system, we must teach youth to have integrity. Because there are no laws to break, it will be up to the individual citizen to decide if, say, shoplifting, is justifiable in a particular case. If Anarchism is ever about to become a viable political force in the United States, it would be necessary for a charismatic leader to emerge; perhaps as a presidential candidate, to institute a system of &quot;re-education&quot; in order to ween the American public off of the necessity of government institutions such as law enforcement and public school. You would be surprised how many social programs can be eliminated in favor of private, non-profit ones. The educated can school neighborhood kids in their homes. Lawyers could appeal to local vigilantes on behalf of the accused. Doctors could heal their sick neighbors for barter. WE DON'T NEED GOVERNMENT.

On an economic level, there is no reason that we need currency. What with the abolition of the Gold Standard and all, a dollar is just a fuckin' piece of paper anyhow. Citizens can use a combination of  tangible assets for bartering and personal checking for trade. The Notary Public will be a valuable asset to the community, as people use self-written contracts and IOU's increasingly in the absence of paper currency. In an Anarchist America we would undoubtedly see an immense urban sprawl as people need more land with which to produce a greater percentage of their own food, now that major food distributors are a thing of the past. Through a system of IOU's, bartering, and subsistence farming, Anarchism could be viable not only as an ideology, but as an economic system as well.

Anarchy is not the vandalism by loading arms or explosives as in the chaotic nature of 1790s France but it is a simplicity philosophy of far east that sourced of Lao-Tze or Taoism. But still on the contrary to the others, anarchy is not a style of constructing general agreement(choosing the one of the sames)

Wars are very unlikely to occur within an anarchist system, which may sound like zealous wishful thinking because it appears to imply that there will be no conflict between people because of an absence of authority (many would consider this paradoxical in itself). The reason wars are unlikely to happen is because to start and continue a war an individual must have a personal interest in it, kings, presidents, popes, lords and generals (autocrats and oligarchs) all have such an interest in practicing warfare for various reasons. Insurrectionists will also have an interest in continuing a war but will only have the objective of ending it, autocrats and oligarchs will usually wish to continue the war for as long as possible. The more important distinction between the two is that an insurrectionist is likely to be in personal danger of being killed during the war whilst the autocrat or oligarch have the possibility of assassination but are otherwise not in danger. To illustrate the distinction of an anarchist society, suppose there was an anarchist city with two neighborhoods, for whatever reason they do not share what they have with each other, so neighborhood A decides that they want to take what they like from neighborhood B and to do so they will go to war with neighborhood B (incidentally this is capitalist/fascist rather than anarchist reasoning not but it will have to suffice for this example). Everyone in neighborhood A that wants to go to war will have to be involved, to play the part of the insurrectionist, to kill and probably die for what they want. This is a very different scenario to the one the autocrat/oligarch find themselves in where they are not personally willing to die for what they want but are willing to sacrifice others for it. So it can be seen that in an anarchist system someone would have to be willing to die for their desire to start a war in order for one to begin at all.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">====Chapter IV: Lead-up to War====  

In 1922 the British Broadcasting Company advertised for a General Manager... The Company was a collection of six manufacturers   - the four biggest being: British Thomson-Houston, General Electric, Marconi and Metropolitan-Vickers. The Company had been running six transmitters since conception now they wished to expand. The capital, provided by these six main producers was sufficient for their original setting up plans and for an enlargement of the enterprise. The BBC was the only source of broadcasting having gone on the air as 2LO on the 14th November 1922. Reith was asked to manage all the company’s copyright and performing rights, the technical patents for wireless transmissions, create associations with artists, authors, playwrights, composers, music publishers, theatre managers and wireless manufacturers. It was a daunting prospect but one he felt he could manage. In 1926 Reith believed that during the General Strike the company should invite all sides to give their side of the dispute. He attempted to arrange a broadcast by the leader of the opposition but was vetoed by the government. He again tried to mediate by inviting The Archbishop of Canterbury. It was not allowed to happen.  The BBC became a corporation in 1927. Reith’s policy was to consider all views and if possible to broadcast those views so that the citizens of Britain could debate the issues. He insisted on high broadcasting standards, honesty and debate of all common interests. Reith resigned his post in 1938 after putting into place a first class broadcasting organization, in time for the country's wartime plans. It was to prove to be an invaluable tool in the nations defence - directing government edicts on ways of production, conditions of work, instilling a national spirit and promoting good home economics to mothers with children and the elderly. Helping the nation in its shopping habits, by suggesting diets, a good food guide, and healthy living, by The Radio Doctor and Farming Today. 

The shops in Harrow, North Harrow and Pinner represented most of the popular trading outlets of the time. Harrow had the largest department store in Sopers which was very similar to today’s super stores, and Burtons, the fifty shilling Tailors. North Harrow had Home and Colonial and Liptons, both grocers, which sold most provisions other than fruit and vegetables. There was United Dairies selling milk products and cakes, as did Express Diaries. Lists and Garners the bakeries. Coopers, the hardware store. Maynard’s, making and selling sweets from tall jars. Woolworths, the 3d and 6d stores The Cooperative Stores, with their pneumatic checking system, part of a large chain that operated a half yearly dividend [divi’] payout system, and W H Smiths, the stationers, awash with diaries and calendars. Pinner had Sainsbury’s which always suggested quality. Many of the items at the grocers were sold lose… that had to be weighed and bagged. Other popular brands were displayed prominently using brand colours and designs. These were most fashionable and the stores major sales items. At the cheese counter the blocks of cheese were cut up and weighed as was bacon and ham. The backs of the counters – against the rear wall, lined with shelves and cupboards - displaying their wares. The counter displayer with: marble slab, knife block, weighing machine, coffee grinder, wrapping paper and string. All these shops were most particular to have the very best shop fitters to furnish their counters and façades. Their house styles always the same, in whichever town they resided. Nothing was ever poorly made or shoddily equipped. They relied upon good service and politeness to ensure customers returned.

Mothers had no fear about leaving their prams outside. In fact the pavements would be littered with prams dotted about as their owners went from shop to shop. Each main thoroughfare had a red public telephone box where for tuppence a call could be made to any location. The telephone had a direct line to the operator who took each call placing the asked for number by her dial-up system. Each main road had a convenient blue police box that had a direct line into the police station. Normally the policemen on his beat would call into the station to make regular reports. There was a special telephone at the side for the public to make emergency calls to the station operator. Policemen could be seen at any time of the day or night on his beat checking all the doors and windows, the padlocks on the gates, standing in the shadows of a shop doorway ever vigilant being aware that the sergeant would be cycling past checking up on his whereabouts. The nearest Police Station was at Pinner – at the top of Pinner Road opposite the cinema. The transport section had taken over the old Board School premises in School Lane

Generally two mornings during the week were set aside for shopping – Tuesdays and Fridays, Wednesdays the shops were closed for half day opening. The Friday shop had to carry the housewife over the weekend. Very few husbands shopped for groceries, children’s underwear and toiletries. They condescended to look after providing for the children’s top clothes – in the main, school uniforms, purchased in Harrow. The women provided themselves with either a basket of shopping bag – perhaps two for there was a lot to get in if the family was large. Many are the times my mother came in from the shopping trip with her hands showing the signs of a heavy bag and freezing cold – to be warmed in front of the fire. Those mothers with a family with small children had the convenience of a pram which would double up to be used as a shopping trolley – in some instances it would be used to fetch bagged coal or wood from the ironmongers.

Towards the end of the 1920s the Government started to introduce new measures to support the country’s agriculture and farmer’s income. Guarantee prices bolstered up the production of sugar beet and wheat. Meat production was treated in the same manner. The Agricultural Marketing Act of 1928 promoted the standardisation of different grades of produce and its packaging. The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food introduced the ‘National Mark’ a trade-mark to label British produced food - indicating a defined quality in egg production, beef, apples and pears. The Agricultural Marketing Acts of 1931 and 1933 advised farmers to form co-operatives out of which came Marketing Boards for hops, potatoes, milk, bacon and pigs. The Import Duties Act 1932 placed an import charge on most foreign produced food stuffs. In 1936, the rent tithe charge for farmers was abolished. The following year saw a scheme introduced to subsidise the spreading of lime on agricultural land to replace some of the minerals lost through planting, wash off and erosion. Later the Ministry was given powers to regulate and open up dormant land – to regulate the cultivation and management of land, end tenancies, take possession of badly cultivated land and order the use of previously difficult land to plough and water meadows. This call for more land intensified when convoys were attacked by submarines in the first years of the war.

The nation's diet was fairly standard throughout the country... most families having a set plan for the whole week’s meals which makes for simple economic shopping. The Sunday roast would be eaten as a cold cut on Monday, minced with bread and onion on Tuesdays. Braised steak on Wednesdays, Liver and Bacon Thursdays and Fish on a Friday, Saturdays would be rabbit, lamb chops or mutton stew. Chicken was very rarely eaten even for those who kept them as we did. They were too valuable for laying. Puddings had the same routine treatment: Sunday’s apple pie, Monday apple turnover, Tuesday Apple sharlot, Wednesday Rhubarb tart, Thursday Rice pudding, perhaps with rhubarb, Friday bread and butter pudding, Saturday maybe blancmange and fruit. There is little doubt that the level of nutritional content to the average British diet was not high. The home produced vegetables were good produced with little or no chemical fertilizers. The locally grown fruit was also grown without an abundance of pesticides. The problem was in the cooking, the amount of highly processed sugar, and the amount of salt, mainly as a preservative. The amount of cigarette and pipe smoking was high and about to go even higher. Drinking sweet tea, sweetened bottled coffee and sweetened fruit juices complimented the smoking. The level of sweets eaten was also high, particularly for children. It was normal fare to consume very sweet puddings rather than eat fruit or yogurts. In most homes meals and times followed a pattern.

During the week breakfast was bread and butter and jam, perhaps a boiled egg, with tea. Coffee was never drunk, marmalade not eaten, and toast never served. At the weekends a fried breakfast of egg, bread, mushroom and bacon, maybe on the menu for Sunday. Saturday would be the same as weekdays - most men worked at least the morning shift. Dinner was an evening meal during the week, and midday at the weekends. In general this was a cooked meal consisting of a roast meat and two veg. variety, with a pudding, usually with a pastry base, with custard or milk. Bread would always be available cut as needed from the board. Tea was only served after the washing up completed. In the country puddings were sometimes served first to take away the pangs of hunger. Tea, at the weekends, was the most formal meal, with sandwiches, cakes and tea. The bread and cakes would be stood on a doily and the jam covered by a bead fringed net, the butter in its dish. The tea would be served during the meal the cups being passed around the table. Supper was at nine, and laid on the table… maybe a cheese sandwich with tea. 

Monday’s, according to the rhyme, and indeed, in most homes was washing day, if not raining. Tuesday the washing was dried off, Wednesday it was ironed, Thursday aired and Saturday out away for Sunday – a day of leisure! The family’s washing was done in a round zinc tub on the gas stove – to be boiled. From there it was transplanted to the sink to be rinsed and from there to the garden to be mangled and hung on the line. Some of my father shirts, cuffs and collars, would be starched. On occasions a blue bag used to whiten the whites. This routine was carried out including dusting and sweeping, vacuuming and polishing. The majority of homes had this or a somewhat similar list to be carried out. It not only got things done but allowed friends and neighbours to call at an appropriate hour – to drop in for a cup of tea and a chat, at a reasonable hour when it was normal to have an hour to spare in the afternoon, before the children came in from school – about four.

Girls were seen to be future wives and mothers… This is not a cliché but a matter of fact. It is what they talked about, dreamt of doing, and fantasised about. That is not to say that they didn’t have a job after leaving school or that a number did not go onto higher education. If society viewed women as mothers and wives, in general, that was their goal. Girls, particularly the lower classes, did the things their mother’s had done before – it was a normal course of action. When married with a family… this controlled their freedom to alter their status… There was neither home care, kindergartens or part-time work. It was normal for a lone parent to reside with the married daughter when the children left home.

As society changed, as much to do with world wars as evolution, so did women’s relationship to their children. Those women, who wanted a different lifestyle, at least in their formative years… gradually, had the opportunity of doing so. What changed was their view of themselves… gradually they reached out to take on a range of jobs that would allow them to have independence, a chance to select for themselves their own life style - when they were to have children, when to have sexual relationships, either casual or long lasting. This came about in the fifties. There was greater regimentation. People tended to observe accepted modes of behaviour adopted from the previous generation. Household routines were commonly observed.

The lives of the inhabitants had a pattern dictated by convention and habit. Mothers pushed their babies in coach-built prams that had the ends hinged for the child to sit up… sun-shades an essential requirement. No woman ever wore trousers or shorts. Men always wore a hat or cap… these were lifted in greeting, removed when entering a building. Men and boys without headgear raised their hand to their forehead.  Everyone stood to attention to sing the National Anthem - we children had to stand to attention indoors, when the anthem was played on the radio. If a funeral cortège passed in the street everyone stood still and again hats were raised. Similarly, on November 11th everything stopped for the two minute silence – when the gun went off… once again, hats removed.

No one ever kissed in public or held hands. Men walked on the kerbside when escorting women, opened all doors, offered their seat, proceeded women upstairs, and lead them down… Etiquette, manners, politeness, and respectful behaviour – were the hall marks of a well raised child. Children were only to speak when spoken to… if an answer required, then it had to be brief and to the point. The elderly were given preference when queuing, mothers and babies came second, men followed on… Table manners were taught and rigidly observed. Plates were offered around the table, tea cups passed about. Cutlery never crossed when the table laid. There was no talking whilst eating and mouths were kept shut whilst chewing. Elbows off the table, only wrists rested beside the plate. Soup eaten passing the spoon through the soup away from the body. Children sat up straight and were told not to slump… 

Sundays were a day or rest. No shops, cinemas, or theatres opened. My father did not allow us to play cards or play outside in the street. My brother and I had to attend church in our ‘Sunday best’ clothes. Shoes had to be polished, including the insteps, whilst not worn, and long-socks, kept up with an elastic garter. To make the leather soles last longer metal ‘blakies’ or studs hammered in. Ties were an essential part of dress as were caps. Pockets were for your handkerchief and small change, not for warming or resting the hands.

No-one thought of walking under ladders. Any spilt salt needed a pinch thrown over the left shoulder to stop having bad luck. Number thirteen was never used and number three would bring success. Crossed cutlery would bring disaster, whilst having a black cat pass before one – good luck would follow. Ancient sayings, and even older natural cures, proliferated. Having a father born in London in 1889 - into a large Victorian family; a mother, who’s beginnings resided in a village in Somerset… meant we boys, were inundated with the mores and manners of two diverse social groups. This quite firm social behaviour only continued until late into the war, when they, and many other conventions, started to crumble. Society changed - in the hardship and emergency of wartime conditions, never to return to such ridged patterns. Unfortunately, the more relaxed, casual behaviour of the sixties completely undermined the more charming conventions and manners of previous generations – the observance of ‘social etiquette’, toward: the aged, women, children, handicapped, under-privileged, and very poor… disappeared. The future lay with Government inspired Social Welfare… which meant, relying on the state… the ‘nanny state’ took hold…!

The Committee for Imperial Defence agreed that a subcommittee should be instigated to look into the organization for a war: of civil and home defence, censorship, and war emergency legislation. This group was called the Air Raid Precautions subcommittee, eventually to be run by General Ismay. In 1933, local authorities were chosen as the agency to be responsible of local organization. The ARP was organized as a department of the Home Office under the control of Wing Commander E J Hodsall in 1935. The same year Germany re-established her air force. It was this action which drove the ARP to start issuing instructions to the local authorities, merchant shipping lines and fire services.

In September 1935 local authorities were invited to make plans for the building of shelters. These were made out of brick and roofed with reinforced concrete. We had one built at the bottom of the road only being used for the first few air raid warning gradually neglected and left damp, dark and very uninviting! Gradually, the possibility of war increased to the extent that in 1937 the ARP issued an appeal for volunteers. A year later the ARP Act came into force, compelling all local authorities to set up schemes to enrol: wardens, first aid and ambulance services, gas precautions: The Auxiliary Fire Services, including rescue, repair and demolition: there would be first aid posts, gas decontamination and casualty clearing stations. That year, in 1938, the service was put on standby and trenches dug in all London parks and sand bags filled to protect doorways.

The duties of the police were increased, unable to carry out all the tasks a band of Police Reserves took over some of their jobs. Later, in 1938, the Women’s Voluntary Services was formed to help the ARP. They did most of the tasks asked of the men including being responsible for children, providing food and medical support. Sir John Anderson started to distributed one and a half million shelters made out of six curved steel plates – as a roof, sealed at either end by further steel plates. It measured 6’ 6” by 4’ 6” – meant to accommodate six people. The shelters were supposed to be half buried. In the even they became filled with water or at best extremely damp. These shelters were free to the poor or cost seven pounds to the well paid. Morrison shelters were issued three years later and represented a heavy steel table with wired sides, to sleep two adults.

Our ARP man cycled around on his bike in his normal clothes with a black and white ARP armband. He was a part-time volunteer. When the ‘blackout’ restrictions came into being the Auxiliary Fire Service was too… it was the start to all the other emergency arrangements put into place. The early air raid warning siren droned its message - warning of an approaching enemy aircraft. The wardens were trained in all aspects of rescue work, first aid, bomb protection and supervised the use of road shelters. The Civil Defence services did not get their uniforms until 1941.

After Neville Chamberlain became prime minister in May 1937 the topic of the country’s newspaper’s was politics, international rather than home. The main point of discussion was about stopping Italy and Germany from expanding their economies by armament production and, seeking to enlarge their territories by force. The new prime minister elected to do this by giving in to their demands in a spirit of cooperation and reasonableness – to win them over by friendliness. Chamberlain acted desperately to stop the progression towards this aggressive behaviour. This period of ‘appeasement’ lasted over a year. Towards the end the inevitability of war became apparent and national defence took the place of the previous concessions. It was the Foreign Secretary Edward Halifax who realised the extent of German ambitions when Hitler occupied the final part of Czechoslovakia in March 1939. He did an about face pushing Chamberlain to offer a guarantee to the Polish Nation - that Britain would support them if threatened by an outside force. The Prime Minister lost all creditability when Norway fell to a German invasion… supported Halifax to succeed him as leader. Halifax realised that he did not have the full support of the Conservative Party. Churchill was asked by the King to form a coalition with Labour and Liberal participation.

War was declared on the 3rd September 1939. The following day The Committee for Imperial defence started England’s war machine. The defence team included: Major Leslie Hollis, Wing Commander William Elliot, Major Ian Jacob, and Lieutenant Lord Coleridge. This was late combined into a single War Cabinet Secretariat under Sir Edward Bridges and the military side under General Ismay. It was Ismay who took the Cabinets ideas to Churchill explaining the suggestions and decisions made. Britain entered the war supplying only forty per cent of the country’s needs. The Ministry of Food was formed on the 8th September under William Morrison as its head. In July 1940 the Local Defence Volunteers had their name changed to the Home Guard. This force stayed in existence until December 1944. During their operational service they manned guard posts, observation posts and coastline defences, whilst acting to combat parachutists and spies… some were trained to act as guerrilla units behind enemy lines.  The air-raid sirens were sounded for the first time to alert people to their sound. The local Air Raid Protection Officer cycled round on his bile blowing his whistle shouting out that when we heard the sirens we should ‘take cover’.

In London the evacuations started. Queues formed outside main line stations for children to be lead off to their appointed trains. Sand bags were being hurriedly filled and placed at door entrances and directions posted telling people where their nearest air raid shelter sited. Volunteers were asked for to fill the vacancies for jobs on the Home Front – as Air Raid Wardens, ambulances and fire service.  Women too were not excluded manning fire fighting posts, enrolled as bus conductors and ambulance drivers. My parents did not consider it necessary for us boys to be evacuated. Whether or not they would have joined the scheme if we had lived closer into the heart of London I do not know. It was never mentioned even after the largest raids during The Blitz. We stayed up late to observe London during the fires that blazed in the East End and Docklands.
 
The Government’s slogan ‘Dig for Victory’ emblazoned posters and hoardings. The charismatic Minister of Food Lord Woolton instigated this call to the nation which became a great success. He promoted various schemes to improve plant growth printing books and leaflets detailing the importance of compost heaps and plant care. This was done using cartoon pictures of two characters Doctor Carrot and Potato Pete. Carrots were considered necessary ‘to help see in the dark’, promoted by a fighter pilot describing how he managed to shoot down a German plane in the dark. On the radio there was much talk about happening ‘on the home-front’ keeping the population alive to the need for self help. Woolton’s slogans and posters were first used in September 1939, extolling everyone to consider every plot of ground - to grow fruit and vegetables - to be self sufficient. The majority of our neighbours did so in various degrees. My father dug out some plots in the lawn built a large chicken run stocked with laying boxes and kept a rabbit. Some neighbours produced their own vegetables, others kept chickens and ducks, and some chose to keep both. There was a scheme to breed more pigs. A special pig food collection scheme was put into place for shopkeepers and the general public to contribute to. Local parks and recreation grounds were ploughed up for wheat production as was spare railway land, and roadside verges. Britain was to be made self sufficient.

All these schemes were put into place - certainly at the start of the war, with Government leaflets and booklets giving instructions on all aspects of planting, one was entitled Allotments and Garden Guide published in 1943. The production of kitchen gardens and allotments was so successful that natural fertilizers and manure ran out. A National Growmore fertilizer, made out of balanced chemicals was made available by George Monro &amp; Sons. Gradually, these petered out, as the war progressed - as it became obvious that the war was being won. Eighty per cent of all allotments were to be found in urban areas. The Ministry of Agriculture promoted a scheme for the unemployed in conjunction with the Society of Friends, the National Allotments Committees, and a number of Benevolent Societies. Dig for Victory was a huge success begun without any idea that it would have such a long lasting effect upon the community. Imports of food dropped by fifty per cent, and the acreage of land ploughed increased by eighty per cent. Once the habit was formed and the people caught on to its worthwhileness it became something to be proud of - became a talking point with ones neighbours.

The effort to become less reliant on imports ran with the national effort to ‘Make do and Mend’. This was to stop people wastefully buying new things, many of them being imports. Schools and local social groups collected scrap metal and ran jumble sales to collect money to help buy an aeroplane. Other groups knitted socks or gloves for the military. Merchant ships were commissioned to transport war materials, troops, and the few items that the country was incapable of producing for itself. Before the war Britain imported fifty-five million tons of food mostly from America and Canada.

As children we carefully collected bottles to take back to the shop for the payment of a halfpenny. Newspapers and magazines carefully hoarded, and old iron, aluminium pots and pans ended up on the scrap heap. The rag and bone man circled the streets with his horse and cart as did the scrap metal collector. Iron railings were offered up and the pig cart arrived to take away kitchen scraps for the council pigs. Household baths could only be filled to four inches, rags sewn together to make rugs. Wool wound on sticks then cut to size - knotted on hessian - to make wool rugs. Bricks placed at the back of the fire to save room for the scarce coal… and mothers always knitting for the family or for the army. Jig saws entertained the family on long winter night, whilst listening to ITMA and Tommy Handley, or ‘Have a Go’ with Wilfred Pickles.

All men wore a jacket, and during their working day a suit – which included a waistcoat… The suits were either black with pin-striped trousers, or dark blue. Shoes were always black Oxfords – with a toe cap. It was considered undignified to wear brown shoes or brogues - suede, positively frowned on. Socks were dark held up by suspenders. Shirts white- or white with a faint stripe. Detached collars, just being ousted by attached collars, although cuffs were double length using a sleeve band. A striped tie - usually with a military or club connection completed his formal wear… all the above, set off by a furled umbrella, leather gloves and brief-case. A bowler hat was essential for senior staff, a trilby more popular, and a cap for manual workers. On a fine day a Macintosh – perhaps a trench coat might be carried instead of an umbrella. Although my father carried a silver knobbed walking stick - a rarity most sported a round handled stick or just used an umbrella. 

For casual wear, tweed jacket and grey trousers, an approved combination. No jumpers were worn but cardigans either worn over a waist coat or on their own. Short sleeved shirts, shorts, sandals, beach shoes and an open necked shirt, rarely seen. Women, who worked in London, during the thirties, were mainly office workers – generally secretaries or filing clerks. Banks, libraries, shops and nursing staff, made up a large quota… factory workers lived closer into London. As with men there was a set dress code which consisted of a long dress – to within fourteen inches of the floor, which was of floral, striped or poker dot design, with a belt, choker or silk scarf around the neck, plus patent leather bag and umbrella… court shoes, the universally accepted style favoured by most women. Stockings, suspender belt, and corset, continued to be worn for the next twenty years. A raincoat, with broad pointed collar, and turned-up cuffs, in a pastel colour, favoured by most.

A poster, showing a parrot on a perch, in bright yellow and red feathers, declared ‘Careless Talk Costs Lives’. This poster was displayed in all areas where numbers of people gathered – bus stations, train platforms, Doctor’s surgeries and buses. The object was to remind people to be aware that spies used everyday conversations to build up a picture of the nation’s spirit – will to withstand pain and hardship. They could also pick up where bodies of troops were - what detachments made up the troop concentrations. Lord Woolton considered it essential that the community was reminded why they were being asked to submit to hardships – that every person should back up the nations will to survive - keep steady behind the government. 

It did not take the Government long before food had to be rationed. Clothing, coal, and petrol soon added to the list. Game birds, rabbits, hares, horse meat and chickens were not rationed. Ration Book was issued in September 1939 in readiness for the start date of January, the following year. Nearly fifty per cent of the population were in the age band fifteen to forty-five. The rationing ‘points’ system was put into place to regularise distribution. Pregnant women, young children, and those on a diet had their special needs met. There were no objections to rationing as everyone thought it equitable. As for any ‘black market’, it was talked about but we were never involved and I am sure my mum would not have known where to go to get it! Householders had to declare where they were going to shop when they filled in the ration book.

Healthy eating was not mentioned at home, it wasn’t thought about, or planned for. We ate exactly what we had always eaten– the diet we were used to – that did not require great changes to be made or thinking about to plan for. Any deficiencies like the lack of sugar was made up by saccharine, lack of fresh milk – by adopting powdered, the same as eggs and potatoes. The dried eggs were tried but only used in cooking. The dried potatoes were simply awful and never eaten. Mum was a wonder at ‘making do’ making meals look appetising even if they were lacking in quality. Rabbit and fish were eaten more times than before the war; mince was liberally bulked out with bread, onion and carrot. Spam was fried or made into toad-in-the-hole. Milk puddings, apple pie, blackberries from the country hedge, rhubarb, bread and butter puddings, suet puddings and dried fruit with junket. Only very occasionally mum borrowed sugar from next door.

When we heard our Prime Minister declaring war we believed the guns would start firing straight away and bombs soon dropped... This wasn’t to be. Despite the country’s guarantee to Poland the government had no plans in place to conduct a war. This was known as The Phoney War and lasted for nine months. It is just as well for we were ill prepared and nine months would give us some chance to catch up and show our metal. My father was The Kensington Regiments longest serving non commissioned officer and its Regimental Sergeant Major. He was immediately commissioned - promoted to the rank of major in the 17th London Division, detailed off to start planning for the defence of north London to combat the supposed German invasion. 

London County Council organised a Meals Service which started in September 1940 and from this evolved into the British Restaurants, designed for emergency eating, especially for those ‘bombed out’. By mid 1941, there were two hundred working, one of them built at the bottom of the road, on Station Road. It was that September, 1940, that Germany began fifty-eight consecutive nights of bombing – this was The Blitz… the first time that we saw, felt and appreciated the seriousness of the situation. Schooldays were enlivened by having lessons in the shelters, watching the front line in the desert waver backwards and forwards, watching dog-fights, hearing the sirens go, and collecting shrapnel.

Biscotti more correctly known as biscotti di Prato (English: biscuits of Prato), also known as cantuccini (English: corners), are a twice-baked cake originating in the Italian city of Prato. The cakes are large almond biscuits, made dry and crunchy through cutting the loaf of dough while still hot and fresh from baking in the oven.

==Ingredients==

Makes approximately 42 biscuits

* 1/2 cup butter or margarine, softened
* 1 1/4 cups sugar
* 3 eggs
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 2 cups all-purpose flour
* 2 teaspoons baking powder
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1/2 cup chopped almonds
* 2 teaspoons milk

==Procedure==

#In a mixing bowl, cream butter and 1 cup sugar.
#Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition.
#Stir in vanilla.
#Combine dry ingredients; add to creamed mixture.
#Stir in almonds.
#Line a baking sheet with foil and grease foil.
#Divide dough in half; spread into two 12-in. x 3-in. rectangles on foil.
#Brush with milk and sprinkle with remaining sugar.
#Bake at 375 degrees F for 15-20 minutes or until golden brown and firm to the touch.
#Remove from oven and reduce heat to 300 degrees F.
#Lift rectangles with foil onto wire rack; cool for 15 minutes. 
#Place on a cutting board; slice diagonally 1/2 in. thick. Place slices with cut side down on 
ungreased baking sheet.
#Bake for 10 minutes. Turn cookies over; bake 10 minutes more. Turn oven 
off, leaving cookies in oven with door ajar to cool.
#Store in airtight container.

'''Need a textbook like introduction here.'''

Chemistry can be a daunting subject for even the best students, and let's face it, statistically, most of us are not the best students. Fortunately for us, there is hope! Chemistry does not have to be a giant confusing pit of pain and despair if we take just a few minutes to break down and understand what the Chemist's mumbo-jumbo ACTUALLY means. &quot;Chemistry for Idiots, Humans and Rebels&quot; is here to provide a resource that explains Chemistry plainly, nicely, and with application.


Here are the topics that have to be included (not an exhaustive list!):

(Please note that the pages on the following topics have been copied from wikipedia. See the talk page for more details!)

* [[/AMU and Mass Number|AMU and Mass Number]]
* [[/The Mole|The Mole]]
* [[/Molarity|Molarity]]
* [[/Molality|Molality]]

== Themes and Outline ==
=== Atomic Mass Unit ===
'''Outline''' : -
* What is mass? What is atomic mass? (Preferably with a &quot;duh&quot; style) ('''for idiots''')
* Mass Number and atomic mass, the subtle difference. Introduce weighted average. Need a sample problem.
** An &quot;investigatory&quot; text - asking the students to look at a table and figure out why Carbon does not have exact 12 as its atomic mass number, but C12 HAS! Introduce C14!
** A good reference here can be to carbon 14 - how it matters in carbon dating. Plus more on isotopes and add &quot;see also&quot; links.
* Definition of the AMU
* Make the reader &quot;feel&quot; the difference between amu and grams!
* Sample problems making clear the following facts :
** relation between amu and C12 isotope
** Mass Number and atomic mass
** ...
=== Molecular Mass ===
* Molecular mass = mass of the molecule! (Duh statement again!)
** Maybe a nice way to introduce this would be to question the reader!
* What about stuff that is not molecule? Formula mass!
* Sample problems on molecular mass.
** Need to have a good decription, with an analogy to packages and possibly pop references.
** For example a combo meal, or a gadget combo, anything. This is for:
*** Keeping the students awake!
*** Making them think about the introduced topics rather than just serve it to them on a platter!
**Note : If anyone someday starts collaborating on this project, we will have to figuure out a way for streamlining inputs on text boxes, main text, sample problems, illustrations etc.
==== Justification ====
A lot of people might not agree with what I have said. A lot of them might counter argue by saying that this is too much, that formula mass/molecular mass is pretty straightforward! Yes it is and yet there is a problem. People fail to imagine it properly. People fail to realiza that it is nothing but elementary calculation that they have already been doing since ages, only difference being that the things in the word problem have different names now!

:This in itself might be a good text box!
==== Sample Problems ====
Molecular masses of water, liquid bromine, sugar, salt and other such relevant and &quot;exotic compounds!

Note : Someone actually needs to start typing these problem sets! That might be me, that might be someone else who comes in at a later stage in the preparation of this book!

=== The Mole ===
* Definition of the mole
* Tell bluntly, this is all that they need to know about mole. Rest all, is up to them to think! Problems with thinking, we will solve below!
* Ask questions to the reader, that force him to think about the simple terms in the definition.&lt;font color=red&gt;
** question 1
** question 2
** question 3
&lt;/font&gt;
* Add a few introductory questions to exercise their brains, avoiding TMI/''Too Much Information''!
* Difference between number of atoms and moles of atoms.
* Avagadro's number and dozen, scores, tens, hundreds, lacs. Possibly a good place for a cartoon.
&lt;cont color = red&gt;**Cartoon!&lt;/font&gt;

==== Introductory Questions ====
* How big Avagadro's number is!
* How small atoms are!
* Conversions!

===Concentration and amount===
* Expand on the case of hot chocolate. More chocolatey and more chocolate powder needed. Good way to introduce concentration and relate it with molalities. ('''for idiots''')
** Keep this a recurring theme throughout the intro text and in a few problems.
*** More acid (can react with more base) and more acidic is a good example. 
*** More base and more basic.
*** More colour required vs. more strongly coloured solution
* Need some sample problems! ('''for humans''')
* A box text can be to introduce and relate to density, specific gravity, cost and extrapolating to intrinsic and extrinsic properties. ('''for rebels''')
* '''Molarity Vs. Molality''' : The whole deal about thermal expansion. ('''for humans''') and their implications in thermodynamics and a few interesting examples ('''for rebels''')

==Molarity==
Here are a few sentences from Wikipedia that should be the outline around which the text is based!

:In chemistry, molar concentration (also called molarity, amount concentration or substance concentration) is a measure of the concentration of a solute in a solution, or of any molecular, ionic, or atomic species in a given volume.

:Definition - Molar concentration or molarity is most commonly in units of moles of solute per liter of solution. For use in broader applications, it is defined as amount of solute per unit volume of solution, or per unit volume available to the species, represented by lowercase c.

===Units===
The SI Units of measurement for molar concentration are [[Mole (unit)|mol]]/[[Metre|m]]&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. However, most chemical literature traditionally uses [[Mole (unit)|mol]]/[[Decimetre|dm]]&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, or [[Mole (unit)|mol]] [[Decimetre|dm]]&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt;, which is the same as [[Mole (unit)|mol]]/[[Litre|L]]. These traditional units are often denoted by a capital letter M (pronounced &quot;molar&quot;), sometimes preceded by an [[SI prefix]], as in:

: [[Mole (unit)|mol]]/[[Metre|m]]&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 10&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt; [[Mole (unit)|mol]]/[[Decimetre|dm]]&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 10&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt; [[Mole (unit)|mol]]/[[Litre|L]] = 10&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt; M = 1 mM .

The words &quot;millimolar&quot; and &quot;micromolar&quot; refer to mM and μM (10&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt; [[Mole (unit)|mol]]/[[Litre|L]] and 10&lt;sup&gt;-6&lt;/sup&gt; [[Mole (unit)|mol]]/[[Litre|L]]), respectively.

|10&lt;sup&gt;-24&lt;/sup&gt; molar&lt;br /&gt;(1 molecule per 1.6 [[liter]]s)
|}
===Examples===
Most proteins are present in the [[bacteria]] such as ''[[E. coli]]'' at 60 copies or fewer. The volume of a bacterium is 10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;15&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;[[liter|L]], which gives us ''c''&amp;nbsp;= ''N''/{{nowrap|(''N''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;thinsp;''V'')}}&amp;nbsp;= 10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;7&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;M&amp;nbsp;= 100&amp;nbsp;nM. (Here, nM is &quot;nanomolar&quot;, ''i.e.'' 10&lt;sup&gt;-9&lt;/sup&gt; moles per liter).

Consider the preparation of 100&amp;nbsp;ml of a 2&amp;nbsp;M solution of [[NaCl]] in water. Since the molar mass of [[NaCl]] is 58&amp;nbsp;g/mol, the total mass needed is 2*(58&amp;nbsp;g)*(100&amp;nbsp;ml)/(1000&amp;nbsp;ml)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;11.6&amp;nbsp;g. Dissolve this in ~80&amp;nbsp;ml of water, and add water until the total volume reaches 100&amp;nbsp;ml.

By contrast, consider 11.6&amp;nbsp;g of [[NaCl]] dissolved in 100&amp;nbsp;ml of water. The density of water is about 1&amp;nbsp;g/ml, meaning that the final concentration of [[NaCl]] by mass will be (11.6&amp;nbsp;g)/(11.6&amp;nbsp;g&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;100&amp;nbsp;g)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;10.4&amp;nbsp;%. The density of such a solution is 1.07&amp;nbsp;g/ml, and its volume will be (11.6&amp;nbsp;g + 100&amp;nbsp;g)/(1.07&amp;nbsp;g/ml)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;104.3 ml. The molar concentration of [[NaCl]] in the solution will therefore be (11.6&amp;nbsp;g)/(58&amp;nbsp;g/mol)/(104.3&amp;nbsp;ml)*1000&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1.92&amp;nbsp;M.

[[Water]] approximates 1 [[kilogram]] (1000 grams) per [[liter]] under usual circumstances with a molecular mass of 18.0153.  So the concentration of water in pure water is 55.5 molar.  Likewise the concentration of hydrogen in [[solid hydrogen]] is 88 grams per liter / molecular weight 2.016 = 43.7 molar, and the concentration of osmium tetroxide in [[osmium tetroxide]] is 5.1 kilograms per liter / molecular weight 254.23 = 20.1 molar.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Making sense of copying from wikipedia ==
Wikipedia is free and If I were to write a new text, there's no point denying I'd be referring to it. However, wikipedia treats each topic independently, '''it is NOT a textbook'''!.

The following points come to my mind:
* Copying the essentials from wikipedia is necessary for initial development.
* But what is the development supposed to be? What do we want this text to become?
* How will we go about doing it?

'''There are no contributors''' to this page right now, but I will call in for them once the themes and outlines are sufficiently developed! This question is for them to answer, to the community '''as wells as to themselves''' so that others and they may figure out '''how''' '''''exactly'''' '''will the book evolve?'''

Here is an article available from the Journal of Science Education and Technology:

* [http://www.jstor.org/stable/40188606 Reasoning Strategies Used by Students to Solve Stoichiometry Problems and Its Relationship to Alternative Conceptions, Prior Knowledge, and Cognitive Variables]

** This document provides a lot of insights into the thoughts of the students while solving mole concept problems. This insight can be used to address the issue properly. If we don't know what is wrong, how will we fix it?

* http://www.scribd.com/doc/13244561/Notes-on-Mole-Concept
** These seem to be notes by an amateur! I couldn't attriute it to anyone. However, if at all you are facing a writer's block you can refer to these notes for a start!

* http://www.scribd.com/doc/37108181/Mole-Concept
** A set of really good questions. Features only 22 questions though!  However, this will be a good source to borrow questions from!

      <text xml:space="preserve">This book will explore existing and proposed dispute resolution process and practices on wikis, with special attention paid to the wikis in the Wikimedia Foundation family.

It will provide guidance to those puzzled about how to handle disputes over content, user behavior, or policy.

It will describe traditional dispute resolution in other organizations and look at how this applies or might apply to wikis.

It will also consider the unique problems of wikis as distinct from organizations which meet face-to-face.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==What this book will not be==
*This book will not be a place to address or seek redress for grievances on the various wikis.
*This book will not expose individual users to recrimination or blame. It will be about principles, not personalities.
*This book will not blame the problems of wikis on a specific class of users, it will assume that all users -- with very few exceptions -- seek to improve the project; they merely disagree on how to do this and what constitutes &quot;improvement.&quot; --[[User:Abd|Abd]] ([[User talk:Abd|talk]]) 16:16, 10 September 2010 (UTC)
*:However this book might need to be moved to Wikiversity, if it intends to do any original research. I wonder if there is any existing peer-reviewed research on the topic of wiki dispute resolutions that could be cited and used as referenced to ensure verifiability. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 16:43, 10 September 2010 (UTC)
::*Well, I'm unclear about this, but I concluded that &quot;verifiability&quot; includes anything that can be directly verified. I don't see that Wikibooks has the requirement for, say, peer-reviewed secondary sources that exists at, say, Wikipedia, and plenty is written with no references. Doing Recent Changes Patrol here, I see reams of material that is basically made-up, ad-hoc, without being derived from a peer reviewed secondary or tertiary source. The fundamental policy is actually neutrality, that applies to all WMF wikis.

::*Here is what I have in mind for this book. First of all, it's a book, not a &quot;class&quot; or &quot;resource.&quot; It could be printed and published as such. I'm not quite sure why Wikibooks adopted the OR policy, because a huge amount of what is published in the real book world is thereby excluded. Rather, the focus seems to be on ''textbooks,'' a special class of book, and textbooks are expected to follow what is widely known. They can present controversies, as controversies, they shouldn't take sides. I do have in mind a book that is like a textbook; it would refer to plenty of published material, but much of this material isn't &quot;peer-reviewed.&quot; For example, how are disputes resolved in other peer organizations? What is the decision-making structure? Describing it can be neutral, but often there is no independent secondary source on it, the descriptions are from publications of the organizations themselves, or published accounts from individuals. The OR policy reads:

:::*Original research refers to unproven facts and to theories that have not been subject to peer review and has not been published elsewhere. It also refers to peer reviewed material where Wikibooks is used as the hosting site for the location of original publication. In principle, original research is not encouraged at Wikibooks. In practice, however, Wikibooks takes a permissive stance by allowing specific types of contributions that, strictly speaking, could be considered original research. This practice allows for the fact that Wikibooks might be the first place that certain knowledge is put into print. Moreover, authors may add content based on repeatable information from their personal experiences or from common knowledge  they have &quot;off the top of their heads.&quot; When adding unsourced information to Wikibooks, though, remember to avoid content that isn't well supported in subject literature, or that other contributors might disagree with. '''In the event a dispute about unsourced claims does arise, the questioned claims must be cited or removed.'''

::*This is the problem, Darklama. This book is about facts and situations, that can be verified. &quot;Well supported in subject literature&quot; is subject, itself, to interpretation. Suppose some conclusion is obvious to anyone familiar with the &quot;subject literature,&quot; but is not ''specifically documented or stated'' in that literature. I have only one problem with the policy as stated, and it's a serious one, that, if that policy isn't changed, I will not work on any book of this nature here: I've bolded it.

::*That requirement essentially gives veto power over content to anyone who finds it inconvenient. The standard should be consensus, not a rigid requirement of removal. Wikipedia is schizophrenic about this, and the unclarity causes great disruption, as people may write material based on one interpretation, and then it's removed by others based on a different interpretation, which, even if that process doesn't lead to major dispute, has still wasted what could be many hours of editor labor. We should, where possible, be able to know, reasonably well, in advance, whether or not work is acceptable.

::*The problem really reduces to dispute resolution. I.e., the subject of the book. This is the safety net: content is determined by consensus, in the end, with escalation from small group to larger group if needed. There is a great deal of knowledge that exists among wiki users that is not documented anywhere. Those who know the wikis know the facts about them. Those facts are subject to various interpetations, and experienced wiki users have written a great deal about the issues. If the book presents only a narrow slice of opinion, it will be a failure. The goal of the book is to educate interested people about wiki dispute resolution: the theory of it, the implementation of it (policies and guidelines and actual practice), and how to follow it successfully, with success being measured by consensus and acceptance of some desired change -- or preservation of the status quo under those conditions.

::*This can be controversial, but, to borrow some language of a friend in the voting systems world, we will eat our own dog food.

::*I'm perfectly happy to move this to Wikiversity. The book will involve what Wikipedia calls &quot;original research,&quot; but nothing will be in the book without consensus. That means that any &quot;original research&quot; in it would have to be attributed, probably. Attributed opinions can be verified. Because the above quoted paragraph about OR seems to say one thing and then contradicts it in the last line, I'm now concerned about the idea of leaving it here.

::*I suspect that last line. So the bulk of the paragraph encourages someone to put together and obtain consensus on what might better be called &quot;synthesis,&quot; and then it's automatically removed if anyone objects, if a specific source showing the explicit &quot;theory&quot; reported must be found? I'm not going to do that work under those conditions! I can do it on Wikiversity, no question. But I had in mind a more neutral work than what is required at Wikiversity, truly more like a textbook.

::*Here is something else, from the bottom of the OR page:
:::*Information that has not been published in an external academic media, but which is still independently verifiable is acceptable here on Wikibooks. This can include new uses for a particular product, new methods for performing a common task, or exposition of hidden (undocumented) features in existing products. Frequently, this information is already common knowledge.
::*There we go. I'm already getting ideas for another book, [[Election methods]], a huge field where there is a great deal of common knowledge, easily verifiable, that hasn't been published in the peer-reviewed literature, but which is well-known among experts and students of the field, and which is independently verifiable. It's been a huge problem on Wikipedia, with Wikipedia bleeding articles written in the early days, by experts, as they are discovered by people who Don't Like a Voting Method or Voting System Criterion, and who then successfully AfD it, even though everything in the article is verifiable. The basic problem is that Wikipedia relies upon secondary sources to determine Notability. If it doesn't enjoy sufficient secondary sourcing, typically more than one, it's considered Not Notable, even if it is something that ''every expert'' knows. I don't think Wikibooks has that problem at all. And thus a book on voting systems, neutral and verifiable, can be written here, and published here, just as it could be by any publisher. I'd draw the line at presenting new &quot;invented&quot; voting systems, not known to others, not discussed outside. Those could be covered at a parallel (and linked!) resource on Wikiversity. --[[User:Abd|Abd]] ([[User talk:Abd|talk]]) 19:25, 10 September 2010 (UTC)

::*: I think concluding that verifiability includes anything that can be directly verified is a reasonably good conclusion. I believe your quoting [[Wikibooks:Original research]] which is only a proposed policy and lately it has felt like there might of been a shift towards the proposal lacking consensus either way, which leaves only [[WB:NOR]]. I mostly favor [[Wikibooks:Original research]] myself, but I try to respect whatever consensus happens to be at any given time. Wikibooks does not require citations be references in the same way as Wikipedia does. Often works used as references for writing a book are collected together on a single page/module within a book using a bibliography style.
::*: To clarify, my concern is this book could become a primary source of information, which people seem to consider problematic. A few books have been deleted due to a consensus at requests for deletion because a Google test showed that there were very few results or that Wikibooks was the primary and only source that other websites referred to. I am also concerned that this book could involve presenting new ideas or might use multiple secondary sources to make new conclusions that push or promote a particular POV.
::*: I believe Wikibooks' rules are probably not as strict as Wikipedia's and I believe at times there is room for works that might be called original research at Wikipedia to be included at Wikibooks. Please don't take this the wrong way, my input is intended to be a cautionary warning, there may be some ways for this to work at Wikibooks, just if your not mindful of Wikibooks' requirements and careful this work might eventually need to be moved to Wikiversity to survive. Right now though you have time on your side because this is a new work which are expected to be given time to grow and mature. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 21:38, 10 September 2010 (UTC)
:::*Thanks, Darklama. I think that the dislike of Wikibooks being an &quot;original publisher,&quot; i.e., a primary source for some theory, as an example, is related to trying to keep it from being a coatrack for every fringe theory out there. However, if something turns out to be marginal here, there isn't any harm at all if it's moved to Wikiversity. I'd hope that the book is of sufficient quality that it's supported here, though. It's also possible, as I mentioned, that there might be a book here that is more solid in terms of sourcing and a very high level of consensus, plus a resource on Wikiversity that covers all kinds of wild stuff. (And a note here: for all kinds of new ideas, look at [[Wikiversity:, etc. The two can work together, I'd think.)

So a basic text here, let's call it a &quot;wiki dispute resolution cookbook.&quot; There are plenty of known techniques that people can try, and, guess what? If you toss the ingredients in the pot, cook it as described, and be sure to stir carefully, take your time, and ''it works.'' That's the ultimate verification, isn't it?

:::*Obviously, we wouldn't want the Wikibooks version to contain half-baked ideas that don't work, that just waste everyone's time! We'd want something that has solid experience behind it. Now, imagine, Darklama, that we might solicit participation from experienced users on the various wikis. What actually worked for you? We might collect -- this might be done on Wikiversity -- personal stories. I can provide some from my own experience where using simple techniques actually resolved disputes, and editors who were behaving like they really wanted me to disappear, and who thought I was out to wreck the place, ended up being friends and supporters. I'd say there is a crying need for this book! There is a lot of literature on dispute resolution process, and there is a recent book on wikis that includes a lot of guidance on this. --[[User:Abd|Abd]] ([[User talk:Abd|talk]]) 00:04, 11 September 2010 (UTC)</text>

      <comment>/* Controversy in this field */ details</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Conflict of interest for author==
I have a conflict of interest in this field, as I have started a business designing, testing, and selling materials and kits to be used for replication of certain recently reported experiments, published in peer-reviewed literature, in this field. I think this makes me a great possible author, but that conflict of interest should be known and considered. --[[User:Abd|Abd]] ([[User talk:Abd|talk]]) 19:54, 10 September 2010 (UTC)

==Controversy in this field==
This field is still considered &quot;fringe&quot; by many; however, since about 2004 negative reports in the peer-reviewed literature have almost entirely stopped appearing, and positive reports, articles which consider low energy reactions as a reality and not any more controversial as fact, have multiplied, and research is expanding.

The early objections to low-energy nuclear reactions have been answered in a practical sense. There still is, according to Storms (2007), no satisfactory theory to explain what is actually happening on a nanoscale in these experiments, and nobody has been able to produce devices practical for energy production, though hundreds of millions of dollars have been invested, so far, in the search. It's possible that practical exploitation of this will never be achieved, that the fragility of the effect, which led to early replication failures, is simply too great. But I have not found anyone, who actually knows and considers the full body of evidence, who still believes that there are no nuclear reactions taking place. It remains somewhat controversial as to whether or not the reaction is &quot;fusion,&quot; but a forthcoming article in ''Naturwissenschaften,'' I helped edit it before it was accepted, will review the most fundamental evidence, evidence that was first reported around 1993, and that was noticed by Huizenga, the very skeptical author of ''Cold fusion, scientific fiasco of the century'' (1994). He wrote that if that work was confirmed, &quot;one of the major mysteries of cold fusion would have been solved.&quot;

He was referring to the apparent absence of &quot;nuclear ash.&quot; The ash expected from fusion would be tritium or helium-3, with the emission of copious neutron radiation, and they should be easy to detect. Tritium was detected in the experiments -- that was itself a notable anomaly -- but the levels of tritium were many orders of magnitude below that which would be expected from ordinary fusion. What Miles reported in about 1993 was that helium was being measured in amounts that correlated with measured excess heat. One of the huge problems with early cold fusion work was that the only clear sign of a reaction was unexplained heat, and many simply doubted that heat was being measured accurately. However, what Miles reported was that in experiments involving many cells, helium wasn't found in the cells (about one-third) that produced no excess heat, and was found in other cells in amounts correlated with the excess heat at roughly the ratio expected for the reaction d+d -&gt; He-4 + 24 MeV. That reaction is a rare branch in hot fusion. (Storms reports on a series of 34 experiments, 12 with no excess heat, with all 12 showing no helium as well, and of the &quot;excess heat&quot; cells, 19 showed correlated helium, 3 did not. Various explanations have been advanced to explain the 3 negative results, but from a purely statistical approach, this is extremely strong correlation.)

The finding was confirmed. Storms lists many independent labs that have published. Storms estimates, from many reports, a heat/helium value of 25 +/- 5 MeV. There are piles of secondary sources on this, but ... I was topic-banned on Wikipedia a year ago for writing stuff like I just wrote here. (I started out as a skeptic at the beginning of 2009, but, for the article, I started reading the sources. I only became COI after I was, later, topic-banned. Complicated story, really has little to do with cold fusion.)

The Wikibooks structure will allow detailed examination of each issue and subtopic, that's impossible on Wikipedia with its flat, single-page structure. There is a resource on Wikiversity, which is not nearly as restricted as this book will be.

I am assuming that there will be participation here by those who remain skeptical. As to the rest of you, without knowledge in the field, please help us out if disputes arise! --[[User:Abd|Abd]] ([[User talk:Abd|talk]]) 19:54, 10 September 2010 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">====Chapter I: The Class Society====

All animals have a home, not just any old place, but a particular spot, which is familiar and well known, where the animal feels safe and can have its young…  The nest or den is a refuge from attack – somewhere to lie up, and rest. Humans are equally drawn to such a place which they defend cherish and consider their own. This place is called home; it is cared for, protected and maintained. As with all human behaviour some people are particularly drawn to their home - their space, and busy themselves cleaning it, working in it; feeling most happy and relaxed when at home…, safe from the maddening world outside. In twentieth century, British society, prior to the First World War, ‘a women’s place was in the home’. This was expected and applied to all females, whatever their age, whether married or unmarried… This also applied to the handicapped, the old and infirm. Those women who could find domestic labour – as a servant - in another person’s home, did so. This was done to relieve the financial burden of the parents. The ‘home’ was not just associated with, ‘where one laid one’s head’; or keeping safe or lowering the drawbridge - to keep out the enemy, but with raising a family, feeding it and nurturing the young. The birth-rate in 1876 was 36 per thousand. This figure declined in the next fifty years to 15. The death-rate in the thirties was just eleven per thousand per year. It was very noticeable between the wars that these figures were very different from the turn of the century. 

''All estimates, rounded up figures, comparisons, actual quotes and trends, have been made, using the Gateway to UK National statistic guidance figures. I am grateful for their work and particular form of display. John Stevenson's: British Society 1914 - 45, and Arthur Marwick's: British Society since 1945, both my continual reference points, thankfully are kept close by...''  

Just before the Second World War nearly half of the population was aged between fifteen and forty-five. There was a worry then, as now - seventy years later, that there is a shortage of workers to support the elderly – as the death-rate declines. The relevance of marriage is being challenged by the consumer society and women’s liberation. Men have lost their power and gained a competitive partner… now we will see ‘who’s worth it!’ The population in 1900 was around thirty-eight million when around five million women worked. A century later the population was nearly sixty million of who thirteen million were working women. In Edwardian times, single men and women were introduced to each other - for them to become acquaintances. For this friendship to be carried further, it was normal behaviour for them to be introduced to each other’s parents… The most important consideration for the parents - if the friendship was a serious attempt by the suitor - to advance his desire, was for the parents to be assured he could maintain their daughter – at least at the same social level. This courting etiquette continued up to WW1. Thereafter, working class young people took it upon themselves to decide for themselves. The middle and upper classes continued the previous courting behaviour. By the 1920s when land, farms, estates, and large houses were split up and sold off. This form of social courtship gradually died out, even for the aristocracy. 

There have been over the years changes in the vows the couple make to each other when getting married. However, all religious and secular ceremonies uphold certain declarations. The main one being that they both promise to love each other forever… a Christian view would be that Christ died to save us all which is the greatest form of love. I am equally sure that all religions and civil authorities would be based on a similar promise. From a social point of view this creates stability… instills discipline, helps maintain cultural moral standards.

Life expectancy at the time of The Great Exhibition was just over forty years of age… this had increased by ten years by 1900… a further fifty years saw the increase to eighty. The average number of children in any one family in the second half of the twentieth century was two. The most significant factor for this reduction is the age of the mother, which has risen to twenty-nine… Until 1857 divorce was allowed only by private Act of Parliament. By 1872, is recorded there were about two hundred divorces granted annually. Nearly one hundred and fifty years later the trend has been upwards, to about 180,000 per annum… about 70% were first marriages affecting couples aged about forty years… granted to women for unreasonable behaviour, to the man, two years separation with consent. The reasons given for this continuing trend include: marrying at a young age, having pre-marital sex, and previous divorce. These depressing figures are pretty general - throughout the western world and English speaking countries. The British society is solidly behind a heterosexual monogamous marriage, accepting sex before marriage.  Living with one’s partner is a growing trend, previously called ‘a trial marriage’ now increasingly referred to as ‘cohabitation’. Sexual behaviour, procreation and family life now part of the school’s curriculum, and within the syllabus, a reference to homosexuality.

During the latter part of the nineteenth century, just a shade before our period, 1910-2010, the relationship between parents and their children was one of intolerance. The ‘man of the household’, after his wife’s child bearing period, had numerous children – fifteen not being uncommon. The brake on even larger families was the early death of many babies and young children. The father was frequently held in awe; what he said was believed and what he ordered obeyed. Wives addressed their husbands not by using their Christian first names but by their title of Mr.

The houses of the many were small and the families large. The only way life could be made bearable was by discipline… this being the main difference between the decades, during this hundred year period. Ridged rules and laws - social, religious and household, were laid down for every facet of life… This was not to inhibit thought, which it did, but linked to behaviour – keeping one’s place, this being a method of suppression…; social behaviour was channeled and funneled, down a narrow path, which all social classes proudly maintained. Each social class, sect and division knew what to: eat, wear, play, perform, and worship.
It was possible to move within this structure, both up and down, and within each layer. This was generally brought about by a change affecting the family’s income. As soon as this change occurred the standard of living followed suit. An increase in income could be achieved by: entrepreneurship, education or inherited wealth. One or either of these projected the family upwards. Some of the causes why there was a fall of income: a split-up of the family’s estate, decline in the estates value, a poor marriage, resulting in a divorce, reduction in stock market values, bad investments, government taxes, gamboling, drinking, poor health, war and loss of job. This directed the person downwards – to a lower social level.

At the end of the nineteenth century opportunities became open for women working in cloth making factories, as secretaries, and as shop assistants. The liberalization of education enlarged the teaching profession. It was a slow business gaining political and social emancipation. The first country to offer women the vote was New Zealand in 1893 and the last, France, Italy and Japan in 1945. By 1903 women’s suffrage became a force to be reckoned with… By direct action demonstrations were arranged and campaigns held; the result: arrests were made and fines imposed. Gradually by keeping the campaign alive – in the news, the matter became a topic of conversation. In Britain women had to leave the teaching profession and civil service when they became married. This gave women the choice of career or raising a family. In 1912 nurse Margaret Sanger began raising the issue of many adverse health effects caused by too frequent childbirths, abortions and miscarriages.

After WWI Marie Stopes, 1880 – 1958, published ‘Married Love’ in 1918 and three years later, ‘Wise Parenthood’. The campaign for women’s rights and ‘Family Planning’ was an enormous success eventually gathering momentum till Lady Sear’s draft, sex anti-discrimination bill in 1973 which itself lead to the 1975 British Sex Discrimination Act, ‘Equal Pay for Equal Work’.  However, the First World War did more for the liberation of women that any other factor. It was their work during the war – which made their contribution indispensable, which gained the support of the country. There was no chance of the breach being plugged. Women became independent and liked it. No longer did they have to put up with dominance and derision. As their wages supported their husbands so the increase became indispensable. Standards began to raise expectations climbed and horizons broadened. Large families became a thing of the past and certain sectors of society became women’s preserves.

As the First World War got into its stride automation, and the conveyor belt system of mass production, became the norm. Every part of the armed services needed more materials and fighting machines. New trucks, tanks, guns, merchant ships and aero planes were invented and built. Women were an essential part of their production. After the war transportation – the movement of freight became an indispensable part of an industrial society. The production lines that had turned out war materials were now converted to turning out the latest gadgets and household goods. There was more to buy and more money circulated by the increased working population. To cope with the new machines, peacetime activities and the manufacture of consumer goods further and higher education had to keep pace - businesses had to engage new skills and handle new equipment. Colleges and Polytechnics devised courses for the new burgeoning technology. New materials had to be discovered and invented to build the latest machines. As mechanization developed cheaper products became available, as all aspects of society advanced so did the cause of women’s liberation.

As the men returned from the war they naturally wanted their old jobs back. The unions assisted this to take place forcing women out of the factories and workshops. Heavy industry and factory workings now became preserves of the men. Building and construction work employed no women. It was in white collar office jobs that women ousted men. Personal assistants, stenographers, secretaries, shorthand typists – typists of all descriptions, roneo-copyists, filing clerks and office juniors gave women employment, even in hard times. Hospitals claimed another vast section of female workers as did shops and department stores. It was these women’s wages that boosted their husband’s earnings. It was this additional money which gave many families extra cash to invest in housing. Gradually, where at onetime, families rented these new-build houses a different group of owner occupiers took possession. New housing estates were developed. All these new homes needed furnishing and household goods.

Women not at work had to deal with childrearing and running the home. Shopping and cooking, both required forward planning… tasks that were slotted in-between cleaning the home, washing the clothes, and ironing. Young children were taken to school and picked up; this started and finished every schooldays. Organizing children’s play, extra curricular experiences, and out of school experiences had to be arranged, and paid for. Having a property of one’s own made household chores more bearable giving a sense of positive feedback - doing something for oneself. But it never fully compensated for being paid, an action that demonstrated worthwhileness, and being wanted - having a purpose. 
  
House building enjoyed a great boom at the turn of the century. Owner occupation was a complete change from the expectations of previous generations. Building Societies blossomed extending the loan period to twenty years. The housing boom just after the construction of the railway network in the late eighteen hundreds was now extended. New garden suburbs linked towns together filling in the spaces between the railway stations. Mass owner occupations quickly change the previous renting market. Smaller families allowed greater savings. The ten percent deposit on house purchase was now achievable - for the many.

Working women peaked at three and a half million – a third of the figure for men. Women were a quarter of the workforce and rising, as more became trained. The employment of women in full and part-time work did not alter the preconceived role of women – having their place within the home looking after the children. The numbers of men ‘domesticated’ were few and far between – men expected to be waited on - their meals ‘ready’ on time. Once again it took another war, and the even greater necessity for women to go out to work, to administer and provide for ‘all out war’. This finally gave them a chance to say, ‘I can choose my own lifestyle’ something they could not do beforehand! A husband and wife began to share household chores. It was still a long way off before they could both focus on their careers. The fifties families turned their backs on the old social order; they wanted a freer more libertarian world where women had the same opportunity as men - with equal pay and conditions. 

Men, who helped in the home, stayed close to the home and were happy maintaining the fabric of the home, were considered domesticated. Those men who preferred to stay away from the home: to find work, take part in a hobby or sport, join associations and institutions, occupations that drew them away from the home, were considered, undomesticated. Men who found joy in raising children, teaching home economics, attending those who were ill, remained close during confinement and birth, were considered ‘civilly domesticated’. To be domesticated is more to do with a feeling, rather than employment. It is also concerned with all those things which go on inside a house or dwelling – about the furnishings and contents – decoration and layout. In many respects it’s to do with man’s evolution, aestheticism and level of taste. For a man to be domesticated removes him from those that hunt, go to war or seek adventure. It can be said that society is becoming more domesticated as an evolutionary trend – becoming more civilized: the sexes, sharing responsibility, helping raise the children in a safe environment whilst engaging in ‘household activity!’

According to National Statistics there were obvious changes in the number of births from the 1950s to 80s. This was attributed to the changes in the ages of mothers at childbirth. Women born in the 1940s had the lowest - they were those who contributed to the 60s baby boom. The graph shows that it was these women who had more children than those born in the 50s climbing back to 1920s levels. The decline of family size averages in this century is due as much too many women not having children as to smaller sized families. Since 1963 there has been a decline in the number of children born, although since 2003 there has been a slight increase. What has happened is that there are more births to older women – aged 40 and over. The average age of women giving birth is just over 29.

The Kinsey Report, [Dr Alfred Kinsey 1894-1956, Sexual Behaviour, Revised 1998], was controversial, eventually became an accepted record of human behaviour; treating the taboo subject with the correct statistical procedures. Dr Spock, [Dr Benjamin Spock, 1903-1998, Children and Child Care, Revised 1992] wrote these two best sellers which have not been bettered, elucidate on all aspects of Marriage and Children. Both these books are essential reading for all couples. Little has changed over the last few years to make his original thoughts irrelevant or out of date.  All couples should be aware of the Kinsey Report and its finding’s - particularly those of frequency - of intercourse. They point the finger at normal/average behaviour. It was not only a ground breaking statistical report but highly necessary - to form a basis in understanding. The figures may shock, excite, or fill you with fear, but whatever feeling they do generate, they are statistically proven. The fertility rate for couples in 2008 was 1.97 a rise over the last seven years from 1.63. The last time it registered two was in 1973. The average age for women having a first child remains at 29.3. It can be expected that the fertility rate, long-term, suggest that it will continue to drop, including those of immigrant couples.

It might be considered rather mechanical and unromantic to agree to a written statement of intent before marriage. A list of expectations and goals to question each other on understandings and considerations. This seems to me to be a satisfactory way of covering all aspects of life together making sure there are no misconceptions and expectations, for we can all live in a romantic haze, but bills and children have to be considered. This list of topics covered makes sure that each person knows what the other wants and needs and can highlight areas that need explanation and dissecting which may reveal hidden hopes and fears. All answers show a train of thought - indicate an individuals state of mind. It is then up to those who are involved to question themselves, to explore and expose differences. To find areas of agreement - to become more compatible - give a firmer footing for future decisions. The sooner these things are talked through the easier it is. Being open and frank is not being silly but sensible and saves embarrassment later when issues become almost too big to enter into discussion about. Being ‘set in one’s ways’ is after all to be avoided - it limits advancement and discovery.
 
I do understand that some individuals, even if they are disappointed by their intended partner’s answers, will continue with the marriage as an act of defiance. That does not predicate that the answered questionnaire is not valid, it remains a joint effort - made at a particular time and place in the relationship. If one or other changes their opinion - wishes to alter their answer, a revised agreement should be discussed and agreed upon. This ensures the altered position has been aired and it is then up to the couple to find an agreed compromise. There are those who may believe they can alter their partner’s opinions, hopes and desires over a period of time – by stealth, continually pressing the point or raising the issue. This may be achieved if the issue is relatively unimportant, but in the case of sexual matters and children this should never be done – will cause resentment and unhappiness. This may all sound rather cold and clinical taking little regard for continuity and momentary desire. But that is the point, on the spot decisions are rarely good, or long lasting. There is a positive side to ‘talking things through’ and setting them down – to form an agreement.

====Case Study====

‘Janet and John met at university – they were on the same course, reading Sociology. After living in hall for their first year they set up camp together – in a shared flat. Their relationship blossomed… spending their vacation’s together - including Christmas’, in each other’s family home. Both sets of parents viewed the situation as ‘the new way’, recognizing that their child was in a stable relationship, which was proving beneficial - each young adult knuckling down to work - supporting each other. Both graduates were expected to obtain a good pass mark and go on to find suitable employment. In their final year they decided to get married, putting off the day until they had each found a secure job and obtain an acceptable employment contract... They explained all this to their parents. They were not alarmed, expecting this to happen, happy that their child was treating the matter seriously. The parents were sufficiently interested to contact each other introducing each other over the phone. They learned that the other’s child had explained the matter, wishing to plan the big occasion, with their parent’s approval. Wanting their child to do as well as possible and not be diverted both sets of parents said that they would help to make a down payment on a car if they succeeded in obtaining a good mark, knowing that being mobile helps when job hunting. 

The parents decided to speak to their child separately to offer help where they could with the arrangements, and to set out some of the details all couples are faced with when contemplating marriage. Fortunately the parents were happy with their child's choice of partners and keen to ensure their child got off to a good start in married life. Both sets of parents owned their own home, through mortgage repayments – loan and interest. Knowing how hard it was financially, when they first started - keeping up the Direct Debit payments, they were sufficiently concerned to explain how important it was to provide as large a deposit as possible.  The parents explained that running a car and saving for a deposit was going to be very difficult… that there would be times when cut backs might have to be made… putting some of their more elaborate plans on the back burner. The parents explained that some jobs are not as secure as others - make mortgage repayments difficult to guarantee. They painted a gruesome picture of the Debt Collector’s or Bailiff’s man calling, removing furniture to the tune of the sum owned. They went on to say that having a good name at the bank by keeping up regular savings, is important for future security… seeking deferred payments requires a good past record. In the future when time needs to be taken off work to have a child or to get over some illness having a sympathetic Bank Manager is a relief. The parents emphasized, that they should become ‘credit worthy’ by keeping their bank accounts free from becoming overdrawn.

They went on to explain that it is not always possible to be a member of a health club, golf club or have an overseas holiday, as well as provide extras for a family. Eating out and giving parties might stretch the bank account too far. Their overdrawn accounts cause stress making you short tempered and snappy towards your children - who do not understand. After all, Janet and John hope to be dedicated parents and work hard - there must be some enjoyment… and life after all cannot be perfect all the time! Not all couples want to have children or a large family. The state of marriage is a commitment which is there to provide security for children. If you believe that private education is necessary for your child the fees are a big drain on the family’s account. Not all children are blessed with good health and the possibility of having a child disfigured or disabled should be considered. Perhaps life insurance is a good thing after all? Many consider children necessary for a good marriage although having more than the average number may force you to move house to provide each with a bedroom. Both Janet and John are adamant that they would not allow their children to eat meals in front of the television but to sit up properly at the dining room table, insisting too that mobile phones and recorders are switched off. They believe that children should have their tasks to do and to help with the clearing away and washing up. Before bed each child is questioned about their day making sure there are no unhappy incidents spoiling a happy environment. They both consider it important to listen to their children and to show affection and praise whenever possible.

====Questionnaire====

Do you believe it is better to own your own home or to rent? Is it important for you to have children? Do you believe children make a marriage or would it be a disappointment if you only had children of one sex? Is sexual satisfaction important to you? How soon would you like children? Do you believe that it is right to spank your child if they perform badly, misbehave or do not stop shouting? Would you allow swearing in your house? Is your partner’s happiness more important than possessions? If you prefer house purchase rather than renting should the property be in your name, your partners, or jointly owned… will you make that commitment in a will. Would you live in an old farmhouse or modern villa, built in the country or in a town? If you insist on natural food cultivation without chemicals would you be prepared to grow your own? If children are sought are you prepared to relocate to a larger home, close to a school, or near a baby minder? Would you extend into the attic? Do you believe in selection for grammar schools or are comprehensive schools good for all. Perhaps you believe secondary modern schools are only fitting for a certain group in society. If your child requires special medical treatment, needing its own room, would you be prepared to move? Would you rather furnish the home before starting a family? If you can only afford to furnish the kitchen and bedroom how long would you wait to do the remainder - before starting a family? Would you have your parent live with you rather than rely upon the state to provide a home. If the house needs redecoration are you going to do it or would you call in someone else. How good are you at replacing a fuse? What style of furniture and décor do you prefer? Are your partner’s tastes similar to your own? Would you say you and your partner are in the same social class? Do you and your partner enjoy similar music and film subjects or have a hobby, or sport preference. Which television programmers do you enjoy and are they compatible with your partners. It is said that having ‘A Belief’ leads to a more fulfilled life. Do you agree? Is it important to you to be married in church? If you lose a game does that make you keen to improve your skill or do you tend to give up. The … Monarchy increases tourism Are you happy to provide the taxes to maintain the status quo? Do you believe a pet gives the home a comfortable feel? Do you think of the world’s sustainability when you fill you car with petrol or diesel, or when you put out the rubbish? Do you know about the Kingsley Report, or have read Dr Spock on Child Care. Do you pay your bills promptly or do you wait until the last moment. What do you think is more important, ‘to keep to your word or give in to doubts’?

Now we have explored each others thoughts - hopes and fears,  discovering hidden feelings, concerns, and attitudes, we are in a better position to openly discuss many other issues. There are some who believe they know their own minds - are sure in their opinions and feelings. Some are not so sure. There are those who believe they know what they want but cannot give voice to them – perhaps they are shy or retiring; and there are others who can never make a decision – because they can see so many conflicting issues – each problem a stumbling block to be overcome. How infinitely more difficult it is to ask people about their sexual needs, and how those needs are going to be satisfied, especially considering such matters as physical, emotional and social variations in an changing environment. It’s a wonder that any marriage remains constant. It is an answer to all these variables, that make having some sort of contract or statement, of prime purpose.

Welcome to the '''IB Environmental Systems and Societies''' wikibook. Feel free to contribute to this book, or ask questions on the [[Talk:IB Environmental Systems and Societies|discussion page]]. This book intends to act as an overview of the IB Environmental Systems and Societies Topics from the Syllabus.

==Core==
===[[/Topic 1: Systems and models/]]===
Assessment Statement: These are what the IB has designated as objectives for the unit. 
 
1.1.1 Outline the concept and characteristic of systems.                                                                                                     
* The emphasis will be on ecosystems but some mention should be made of economic, social and value systems.

1.1.2 Apply the systems concepts on a range of scales
* The range must include a small-scale local ecosystem, a large ecosystem such as a biome, and Gaia as an example of a global ecosystem.

1.1.3 Define the terms closed system, open system, isolated system 
		These terms should be applied when characterizing real systems.
 An open system exchanges matter and energy with its surroundings (for example, an ecosystem).
 A closed system exchanges energy but not matter; the “Biosphere II” experiment was an attempt to model this. Strictly, closed systems do not occur naturally on Earth, but all the global cycles of matter, for example,the water and nitrogen cycles, approximate to closed systems.
 An isolated system exchanges neither matter nor energy. No such systems exist (with the possible exception of the entire cosmos).

1.1.4 Describe how the first and second laws of thermodynamics are relevant to environmental systems
The first law concerns the conservation of energy. The second law explains the dissipation of energy that is then not available to do work, bringing about disorder. The second law is most simply stated as: “In any isolated system entropy tends to increase spontaneously.” This means that energy and materials go from a concentrated into a dispersed form (the availability of energy to do work diminishes) and the system becomes increasingly disordered.
Both laws should be examined in relation to the energy transformations and maintenance of
order in living systems.

1.1.5 Explain the nature of equilibria
A steady-state equilibrium should be understood as the common property of most open systems in nature. A static equilibrium, in which there is no change, should be appreciated as a condition to which natural systems can be compared.
(Since there is disagreement in the literature regarding the definition of dynamic equilibrium,
this term should be avoided.) Students should appreciate, however, that some systems may
undergo long-term changes to their equilibrium while retaining an integrity to the system (for
example, succession). The relative stability of an equilibrium—the tendency of the system
to return to that original equilibrium following disturbance, rather than adopting a new one—
should also be understood.


1.1.6 Define and explain the principles of positive feedback and negative feedback
The self-regulation of natural systems is achieved by the attainment of equilibrium through feedback systems.
 Negative feedback is a self-regulating method of control leading to the
maintenance of a steady-state equilibrium—it counteracts deviation, for
example, predator–prey relationships.
 Positive feedback leads to increasing change in a system—it accelerates
deviation, for example, the exponential phase of population growth.
Feedback links involve time lags.


1.1.7 Describe transfer and transformation processes
Transfers normally flow through a system and involve a change in location. Transformations lead to an interaction within a system in the formation of a new end product, or involve a change of state. Using water as an example, run-off is a transfer process and
evaporation is a transformation process. Dead organic matter entering a lake is an example of a transfer process; decomposition of this material is a transformation process.


	

1.1.8 Distinguish between flows (inputs and outputs) storages (stock) in relation to systems
		Identify flows through systems and describe their direction and magnitude.


1.1.9 Construct and analyze quantitative models involving flows and storages in a system.
Storages, yields and outputs should be included in the form of clearly constructed diagrammatic and graphical models.

1.1.10 Evaluate the strengths and limitations of models
A model is a simplified description designed to show the structure or workings of an object, system or concept. In practice, some models require approximation techniques to be used. For example, predictive models of climate change
may give very different results. In contrast, an aquarium may be a relatively simple ecosystem but demonstrates many ecological concepts.

      <comment>about chemistry vs. physics.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Physics and Chemistry==
I added Chemistry to the cats.

Right here is much of the core of the controversy over cold fusion. The chemists who discovered (or rediscovered -- long story) it saw something and they said, '''&quot;This isn't chemistry,&quot;''' it must be nuclear physics. And they were expert chemists, electrochemists, actually, one of them may have been the world's foremost expert in that field. The physicists, somewhat outraged that they first heard about this at a press conference, tried to quickly replicate the experiment, without having details, and, guess what happened? Electrochemists who later did replicate the work have written that this was the most difficult work of their career. There are many, many things to do wrong. Even expert electrochemists frequently failed, the first times they tried. The physicists, in general, said, &quot;Well, '''this isn't physics,''' it must be chemistry.&quot; I.e., there must be some chemical anomaly, the chemists must be making some mistake, because everything we know about nuclear physics tells us this is impossible.&quot;

It is really a beautiful example of a kind of turf war between chemists and physicists. In fact, as someone might rather easily guess, both the chemists and physicists were wrong, in some way or other. Each was making assumptions that we now know were incorrect. I.e., the physicists assumed that if there was a nuclear reaction, it must be one of the commonly-known ones, and those were impossible under the conditions of cold fusion experiments. The biggest error of the physicists was probably that they assumed they could apply the approximations of two-body quantum mechanics to the conditions in condensed matter, and rule out a whole universe of possible ''unconsidered reactions,'' as impossible.

On their side, when the chemists said that it must be nuclear physics, they frequently assumed that it was simple deuterium fusion, the same reaction as found in hot fusion, but somehow shifted in some way to cause the different &quot;symptoms,&quot; i.e., no radiation to speak of. And there were very good reasons to think that this was, indeed, impossible.

It is still true, apparently, that if a correct theory of cold fusion has been advanced, it hasn't been proven. Because there are now some interesting theories out there, that do partially predict what's known about these reactions, (such as being a surface effect, producing helium and very little radiation, and other things), maybe someone does know what's going on. But they haven't proven it yet! Nevertheless, there are one or more theoretical approaches now, using classical quantum mechanics applied in the multibody problem -- which is called quantum field theory or quantum electrodynamics -- that ''predict'' fusion of deuterium to helium, but not the normal two-deuteron fusion that everyone was thinking of. One of these theories predicts it with a minimum of four deuterons; if these four deuterons find themselves in a tetrahedral configuration -- spatially -- and with very low relative movement (i.e., very low local &quot;temperature&quot;), they will collapse into a Bose-Einstein condensate and then fuse within a femtosecond. And that theory has been published under peer review, and is mentioned in secondary sources, for the &quot;No OR&quot; people around! But we don't yet know that the physical configuration will actually occur with enough frequency to explain cold fusion results. Turns, out, big surprise! -- there is a lot we don't know, and it can be very, very difficult to find out. Until someone figures out how. If it's possible. Investigating an extremely rare reaction that only occurs within a solid can be awfully difficult! --[[User:Abd|Abd]] ([[User talk:Abd|talk]]) 00:30, 11 September 2010 (UTC)</text>

In this chapter, we shall discuss how to simply greet people and to discuss simple affairs.
Read the following dialogue, and then see the translations of phrases below.

|}

== মানে - Meaning ==

This passage contains the basics of greeting other people.

If the person being spoken to is a Muslim, আসসালামু আলাইকুম and আল্লাহ্‌ হাফেজ should be used. If the person is a Hindu (or something else, or you don't know), it is polite to use নমস্কার and খোদা হাফেজ.

Notice that sentences end in a । (called a দন্ড), as opposed to a period. All other punctuation is the same as in English.

==ব্যাকরন - Grammar==

The sentence in Bengali is like any other [[w:SOV language|SOV language]]. This is in contrast to regular English, where a clause is formed like this:
:I opened the box.
Bengali forms sentences with the object interchanged with the verb, like this:
:আমি বাক্স খুলেছি।
:ami baksho khulechhi.
Notice how বাক্স translates to ''box'' and খুলেছি is the present perfect of খোলা, ''to open''.

Speaking of pronouns, it would be wise to learn them now, as they will become useful in a short while:

{| border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5 width=100%
! person
! singular
! plural
|-
|| 1st || আমি (ami) I || আমরা (amra) we
|-
|| 2nd || আপনি (apni) you (formal) &lt;br/&gt; তুমি (tumi) thou (common) &lt;br/&gt; তুই (tui) thou (informal) || আপনারা (apnara) ye (formal) &lt;br/&gt; তোমরা (tomra) you (common) &lt;br/&gt; তোরা (tora) you (informal)
|-
|| 3rd || এ (e) this here (common) &lt;br/&gt; ও (o) that there (common) &lt;br/&gt; সে (she) that somewhere (common) &lt;br/&gt; ইনি (ini) this here (formal) &lt;br/&gt; উনি (uni) that there (formal) &lt;br/&gt; তিনি (tini) that somewhere (formal) || এরা (era) these here (common) &lt;br/&gt; ওরা (ora) those there (common) &lt;br/&gt; তারা (tara) those somewhere (common) &lt;br/&gt; এঁরা (êra) these here (formal) &lt;br/&gt; ওঁরা (ôra) those there (formal) &lt;br/&gt; তাঁরা (târa) those somewhere (formal)
|}

As in quite a few other languages, including the Romance family and Japanese, there exists formality levels in most of the pronouns. Consider the 2nd person pronouns: the first is used towards strangers, elders, and parents (akin to [[wikt:usted|usted]] in Spanish), the second is used towards people of a similar class, age, or familiarity to the speaker (akin to [[wikt:tú#Spanish|tú]]), and the third is used to those considered inferior to the speaker, such as children and objects.

The third person pronouns are a much different story. Just as in Korean, they are used relative to the speaker. The first is used where the person being referred to is closer to the speaker, the second where the person is closer to the listener, and the third where the person is closer to neither the speaker nor the listener. The fourth, fifth, and sixth pronouns are formal equivalents to the first, second, and third respectively. One is likely to hear এনারা and ওনারা in place of এঁরা and ওঁরা in daily conversation.

Notice how the plurals end in -রা (ra). This construct can be used with any noun.

===হওয়া - to be===

The form of a verb given with the English equivalent is technically a verbal noun, but that doesn't matter at the moment. What matters is that Bengali is a [[w:Zero copula|zero copula]] language: one does not use 'to be' in the simple present tense.
:আমি সালমান। আমি সিলেট থেকে। ওটা খুবি বড়। পারিস ফ্রান্সের মধ্যে।
:I am Salman. I am from Sylhet. That is very large. Paris is in France.
There is of course a conjugation scheme for the verb 'to be', but we defer to the [[wikt:হওয়া|Wiktionary page]] for this.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You want to use XQuery with your DOJO JavaScript library which uses a variation of JSON syntax.

== Method ==
DOJO is a framework for developing rich client side applets in javascript: from the ''nice to have'' to the ''core webapp''. Some day you may want to deliver your data in a way, that you or other people can easily use from DOJO.

DOJO specifies its own idiosyncratic way of wrapping data in JSON formatted objects, so it can be consumed by lots of its widgets: trees, grids, comboboxes, input fields etc. Below example (note the use of single quotes, which makes this invalid JSON) is taken from its web supplied documentation:

&lt;pre&gt;
{ identifier: 'abbr',
  label: 'name',
  items: [
    { abbr:'ec', name:'Ecuador',           capital:'Quito' },
    { abbr:'eg', name:'Egypt',             capital:'Cairo' }
]}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Now, if eg. you want to feed an incremental user input widget from a server side search, xquery (in eXist at least) makes this a piece of cake. Please read below script as an introduction to the concept, very likely it can be optimized. The search itself uses a lucene fulltext index, which returns very quickly.

&lt;pre&gt;
xquery version &quot;1.0&quot;;
import module namespace json=&quot;http://www.json.org&quot;;
declare namespace request=&quot;http://exist-db.org/xquery/request&quot;;
declare option exist:serialize &quot;method=html media-type=text/javascript&quot;;

(: where the data lives:)
let $coll := &quot;/db/apps/myapp/data&quot;

(: what we are looking for, sanitize remote input :)
let $tmp := xs:string(request:get-parameter(&quot;q&quot;, &quot;&quot;))
let $querystring := replace($tmp, &quot;[^0-9a-zA-Z\-,. ]&quot;, &quot;&quot;)
let $query :=
	&lt;query&gt;
		&lt;near slop=&quot;10&quot; ordered=&quot;no&quot;&gt;{$querystring}&lt;/near&gt;
	&lt;/query&gt;
return

(: fetch results, dont forget to create an index in collection.xconf :)
let $hits := collection($coll)//article[ft:query(., $query)]
let $count := count($hits)

let $result :=
&lt;result&gt;
   &lt;identifier&gt;id&lt;/identifier&gt;
   &lt;label&gt;title&lt;/label&gt;
   &lt;count&gt;{$count}&lt;/count&gt;
   {
      for $item in $hits
      return
         &lt;items&gt;
            &lt;id&gt;{string($item/@id)}&lt;/id&gt;
            {$item/title}
         &lt;/items&gt;
   }
&lt;/result&gt;
return

json:xml-to-json($result)
&lt;/pre&gt;

The xquery extension '''json:xml-to-json($node as node())''' does all the magic. In the result variable the data structure is created in the way DOJO wants it (per default), as shown above. Another thing to note: DOJO expects the identifier to be unique. It is up to you to design your data to satisfy this. Another note: as of today (eXist trunk of early september 2010) numbers in the output are quoted, it is up to you to convert them on the client for optimal processing.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You want to dynamically modify your tabs while the form is executing.
== Method ==
Rather than statically loading all your tabs in the form body it is also possible to store your tabs in the XForms model and then display each of them by using a repeat.

== Full Example ==
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
declare namespace h = &quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot;;

let $content-type := &quot;text/xml&quot;
let $mode := xdmp:set-response-content-type($content-type)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Twilight is a young-adult vampire-romance novel by author Stephenie Meyer. Twilight was initially rejected by 14 agents, but became an instant bestseller when published originally in hardback in 2005, debuting at #5 on the New York Times Best Seller list within a month of its release and later peaking at #1. That same year, Twilight was named one of Publishers Weekly's Best Children's Books of 2005. The novel was also the biggest selling book of 2008 and, to date, has sold 17 million copies worldwide, spent over 91 weeks on the New York Times Best Seller list, and been translated into 37 different languages.

It is the first book of the Twilight series, and introduces seventeen-year-old Isabella &quot;Bella&quot; Swan, who moves from Phoenix, Arizona to Forks, Washington and finds her life in danger when she falls in love with a vampire, Edward Cullen. The novel is followed by New Moon, Eclipse, and Breaking Dawn. A film adaptation of Twilight was released in 2008. It was a commercial success, grossing more than $382 million worldwide and an additional $157 million from North American DVD sales, as of July 2009.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Descriptive geometry is a branch of mathematics used to transform three-dimensional objects into two-dimensional representations that can then be presented on paper, computer screens, or some similar medium. Its principles are valuable for determining true shapes of planes, angles between lines, and locating intersection between line and planes. Problems are solved graphically by projecting points onto selected adjacent projection planes in an imaginary projection system. The techniques explained in this text are applicable to various architecture, art, design, and engineering activities, such as perspective drawing and drafting.

'''Picture Plane''':

Planes are the most fundamental and most common found in the field of descriptive geometry. A plane is defined as a flat surface that could be represented by three points that are not in a straight line, a straight line and a point not of the line, two intersecting lines, and two parallel lines. The picture plane, or plane of projection, is the surface on which an object is projected, and any plane parallel to either the top or front plane can be used as the picture plane, but for simplicity of construction, the top or front planes will be used as the picture planes. 

Other categorization of planes include inclined plane and oblique planes, which may appear as any shape, but one can find the true shape of a plane through a series of plane projections. An inclined plane is defined as a plane that appears as a line in at least one of the standard views of projection (top, front), and foreshortened in the other views. The true shape of the inclined plane can be found in a first auxiliary view. When a plane does not appear as a line (edge) in any of the standard views, it is considered an oblique plane, and the true shape of the plane can be found only in a secondary auxiliary view.

'''Views''':

A view is a 2D infinite surface, called the picture plane, upon which 3D objects are projected onto. Projections, achieved with projection lines that lie perpendicular to the picture plane, map each point on an object to the corresponding point on the image of that object.  Because the lines are always perpendicular we call such projections orthographic projections. Views are the stepping block to learning descriptive geometry – with the use of projection lines in views, we are able to complete plan views and elevation views of any geometric figure, and are able to construct the shades and shadows cast by objects. Projections have two important properties: uniqueness and between-ness.

•	Uniqueness is best described with two non-parallel lines, say a and b, one of which contains a point, say C; and a family of parallel lines. The property says that there will be a line that’s part of the family of parallel lines that goes through point C on line a, and will project point C’ where it crosses line b. C is the figure, and C’ is the image.

•	Between-ness means that distances stay the same throughout projections. Say we have a straight line a and a curved line b. Even though b is technically longer in length, the endpoints of both lines will line up, with perpendicular lines joining them. The same is true for any point in between the endpoints.
Parallel projections apply lot only to points and lines, but also planes and figures. They are constructed with the same projection lines and also share properties of uniqueness and between-ness. It is important to note, however, that distances will be preserved only when the lines, or planes, on which the objects lie are in fact parallel. Where one view ends and another begins is the line called folding line. Folding lines help us indicate transfer distances.

'''Transfer Distance''': [[File:Transferring Distance.jpg|thumb|Transferring Distance]]

In Descriptive Geometry, transfer distances are crucial elements that help create the different views of an object. The process of transferring various points on the object into a different view is called projection. Projection helps in the understanding of the object as a three dimensional form. Generally, for orthogonal or angular shapes the points that are transferred are the intersections and corners of the object. On curved shapes, the transfer points lie on the curve equidistant from one another. 
The first step in projecting an object into a different view is to extend lines from the chosen points on the object in the second view. These lines must be perpendicular to the folding line. In the first view, measure the distance from each chosen point to that folding line. These measurements are the transfer distances that will create the projection in the third view. Extend the perpendicular line of the chosen points to the length of the transfer distances. Once all the points are projected into the third view, connect the points to get the object in that view.

'''Plans/Elevations''':

Plans and elevation some of the primary reasons descriptive geometry comes into play with architecture. Plan and elevation views can also be defined as projections on the horizontal and vertical planes respectively. To construct a building plan, you just create a picture plane in the top view that slices the building just below the roof. Similarly, elevation is a architecture drawing taken in the front view. Other views like section cuts can be also obtained by using a front view that cuts through the building. 

Plan, elevation, and section views are categorized as orthographic views, which means they do not contain any foreshortening due to perspective. However non-orthographic lines such as slant or diagonal walls will be foreshortened. These views can also be utilized in construction, and alternate elevations can also be obtained through auxiliary views. Constructions will be discussed in later chapters.


'''Auxiliary Views''':
[[File:D11111111.png|thumb|point]]
Auxiliary views are specific kind of views that allow us to see plans or elevations more clearly, receive additional information of the sides of objects, and get the true lengths and shapes of objects. These views are drawn as picture planes that are perpendicular to the primary views, plans or elevations. We are allowed to take as many auxiliary views as we wish, granted they are all perpendicular to one another or the primary views. Note that the secondary views could be on an incline yet still be perpendicular to a plan view or an elevation view.

'''Terms''':

[[File:D22222.png|thumb|line_]] [[File:D3333.png|thumb|Plane]]

''Point''- determined by a coordinate in the horizontal x-axis, the vertical y-axis, and depth z-axis. A point has no dimension because it does not have length, area or volume. 

''Line''- an infinite number of points that connect two given points. A line is one-dimensional because it has no width or depth.

[[File:D4444.png|thumb|Solid]]
''Plane''- a two-dimensional surface with all its points and lines on either the x, y or z axis
 
''Solid''-a three-dimensional object that includes length, area and volume.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Descriptive geometry's primary function is to translate an object in three dimensions into a two dimensional representation of that object. Each such representation is called a '''view'''.

== From Two Dimensions to One ==

Rather than begin with views of three dimensional objects, we shall first examine the process of taking one-dimensional views of a two-dimensional figure. Suppose that we have a square, rotated at an angle relative to the angle of the two views we will be taking of it.

== Point View ==

Point view of a line shows a view of a line in which its endpoints coincide. To find point view of a line you must first find it in true length if you have not already done so (the construction for finding true length of a line is described in the following section, '''True Length'''). Then you must take a view perpendicular to the true length line, and that will give you the line in point view.

[[File:Point View.jpg|thumb|Point View]]

[[File:Point View Answer.jpg|thumb|Point View Answer]]

== True Length ==

[[File:Problem 02 Distances True View.jpg|thumb|Example Problem on Distances and True Length]]

Finding the true length is a fundamental process in descriptive geometry that advances the problem-solving to the next steps to reach the solution. To find the true length of a line you must take a view parallel to the line; in other words, if a line is a parallel to the folding line in one view, it is shown in true length in the adjacent view. If a line is parallel to the folding line in both adjacent views, as for example in both the top and front views, then it is shown in true length in both of those views, and in such cases no additional work must be done if the only goal is to find the true length of the line.

[[File:True Length Answer.jpg|thumb|True Length Answer]]

== Edge View ==

Edge view is a view looking at one side of a plane. Planes in edge view are shown as lines that are the distances of the edges of the shape. To get edge view, take a view parallel to a side of a plane. Then take another view perpendicular to the new line. Alternatively, if you already have front and top views of the plane, to get an edge view you may draw -  in either view - a line from one side of the plane to the other that is parallel to the folding line, transfer this line to the other view, and then take a view perpendicular to the line from that second view. Use transfer distances from the first view to get the endpoints of the plane and complete the edge view of a plane.

[[File:Edgeview1problem.jpg|thumb|edgeview]]
[[File:Edgeview2.jpg|thumb|edgeview]]
[[File:Edgeview2problem.jpg|thumb|edgeview]]


== True Shape ==

To get your plane into true shape, find the edge view, then draw a folding line parallel to edge view and use transfer distances to transfer all of the points of the plane to this final view. This will get you the true shape of the plane.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Internal Energy and the meaning of Temperature ==
The Internal Energy &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; of a system is the sum of the energy of all it components and of all it interactions. Our components can be atoms or molecules. So, we know that the total energy of a system is composed by it Kinetic Energy &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; (the energy of it components) and the Potential Energy &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; (the energy of the interactions), so
:&lt;math&gt;U=\sum_{i=1}^NK_i+\sum_{i&gt;j}V_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is the amount of atoms or molecules of the system.
We can have a system formed by molecules that rotate. The rotational energy must be included in the calculation of &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;. In this composite systems we may need skills to compute the value of &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; for an arbitrary molecular systems, but it isn't the goal of Thermodynamics, but Statistical Mechanics.
Here we can reveal the true nature of Temperature: we can say that is a measure of the Kinetic Energy of the system.
=== Ideal Gas ===
An Ideal Gas is a gas where there's no interaction between the molecules, so &lt;math&gt;U=K&lt;/math&gt;
=== Cooling the system ===
We know that &lt;math&gt;K&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; always, so &lt;math&gt;T&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; always. This sentence is meaningless said this way, but it means that the system can't be cooled infinitely because there will be a moment where there's no Kinetic Energy to be lowered. We can set therefore a zero of the Temperature at &lt;math&gt;K=0&lt;/math&gt;. So, Temperature it's an absolute magnitude.

== Heat and Work ==
=== Heat ===
The action on the system that make it raise the Internal Energy of the molecules without acting a force on them (that would be an interaction) is called '''Heat''' (&lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;). It doesn't matter if later the molecules act forces between them.
=== Work ===
The action on the system that make it raise the Internal Energy of the molecules only acting a force on them is called '''Work''' (&lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt;). Work is of the type of the force enacted (it can be mechanical work, electromagnetic, etc. ...)

== First Law of Thermodynamics ==
Now we will set a equilibrium for the Internal Energy. The raise of &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is by Heat or Work, by definition, so
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta U= W+Q \,&lt;/math&gt;
Here there are many things to say.
First, we have to say that &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is a quantity of the system that depends only of the time when it is measured; observables of this type will be called '''State Functions'''. &lt;math&gt;\Delta U&lt;/math&gt; is the difference of the Internal Energy of a system at the end of a process and at the beginning of it.
Heat and Work, instead, are not state functions. This means that they depends on the process itself.
So Energy doesn't depend of the process? Yes it does, but multiple processes that change Internal Energy in the same amount can have totally different Heats and Works.

Another thing to be said is that in the formula used below, &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; are acted on the system, not by it. When are acted by the system, are acted on the exterior of it, so is energy that the system lose, not gain; then we have to put the sign - on these terms when are acted by the system.

Now we have to understand how this apply to our surroundings, but that's another story.

      <text xml:space="preserve">====Chapter II: The State of Marriage====

Prior to Christianity, marriage was a social controlling act to produce children, as much for the group, as the couple... most were either arranged, whilst others expected. It was not until much later that all weddings were performed ‘at the church door’, and then later still, the priest attended the ceremony… it took a further hundred years before the priest actually conducted the service. Marriage in the Middle Ages was mostly a practical affair with economic overtones. It took the French Revolution to introduce the compulsory civil marriage… leading towards a magistrate or civil official making the ceremony valid. If couples wanted a religious weddings this came after the civil ceremony. Parents lost their influence over the marital choice by the middle of the nineteenth century. Marriage now is a legal contract – as a governmental institution and changes the personal and social status of the participants. In 1950, a quarter of all future married couples met at the local dance hall. A further quarter met at some social event and fifteen per cent met at work. The vast majority admitted that they had been in love at the time of their marriage the remainder said they had not... many walk down the aisle full of doubt whether in love or not. A quarter of men and over half of all women were virgins… a quarter married the person they had first had sexual relations with. Marriage continued to be sustained as the most popular state for at least the next thirty years. Thereafter cohabitation began to erode the figures.

Marriage is a very natural act. To be married shows: conformity, optimism, and faith… Society believes the act provides stability and a safe environment for children… which should be a shared desire - as well as a universal longing for happiness and contentment. The marriage ceremony, church or civil, is a declaration of intent, before each other, each other’s family, and wider society. This social act is prevalent throughout all societies… although the timing, preparedness and courting behavior differs… the union is entered into as a serious lifetime commitment. The majority of couples – taking part in the act of courting or forming a partnership, still hope to get married eventually… believing that the state of marriage to be a culmination of all their hopes and desires. Marriage is therefore an end to casualness and frivolity - a start to greater responsibility, home building and possible parenthood… perpetuating the belief that marriage is the key to social stability. Nursery rhymes, children’s books, television programs, romantic novels, motion pictures, newspapers and magazines all speak of the marriage state: as a rite, a religious ceremony, an act of love, and a perspicuous act - to produce a new generation. 

Taken from the Office for National Statistics for marriages the figures show there has been a quite rapid fall in the number of couples getting married. The plotted curve for all marriages, and first marriages, are almost identical. Of those marriages 67 per cent were civil marriages… showing a steady increase? Remarriages remain fairly consistent at just over a hundred thousand per annum. The graph shows a trend, that within ten years the curve for first marriages and remarriages will join… Even though these are depressing statistics individuals still believe the positive act something to strive for – perhaps as a romantic goal rather than an institutional necessity. In England and Wales, in 2007, it was recorded the lowest number of marriages since 1895. The long term picture of marriage is one of decline.

The reason why marriage declines is the emancipation of women - freedom from moral, intellectual and legal restraints. Equal rights, equal opportunities, equal pay, have all contributed to women seeking equal power in the workplace, freedom from mundane work, and greater rewards. Women have a choice when to start a family and how long they wish to be away from the: workplace, increase in salary scale, responsible position, and pension increase.The choice for women to engage a baby-minder, play school, and kindergarten - to allow them to return to work early, is relatively new. The long-term results from this are yet to be fully evaluated. 

To help achieve a greater understanding about each other’s hopes and fears prospective couples are encouraged to discuss their fill in a simple statement, in the form of a questionnaire. This joint statement [[Main page]] is not a legal undertaking but to serve as a prompt to help. To that end I have set out some questions that prospective partners can consider which might make the task that much easier… the completed questionnaire can be kept as a reminder, and updated when necessary. I accept that some couples may not want, or are unable to have, children. Fostering, caring or adopting can be a rewarding occupation - but equally demanding, making our questionnaire still relevant and worthwhile. No one could possibly imagine individuals not altering their wants and needs over time – there are so many choices; unforeseen natural events, unsolicited outside influences, and unmasked personal fears. These variables mean that everyone has to be flexible and adapt… It is to what degree we hope to unearth, and to help catch those changes as they occur.

2009 was not only a year of an election but a statistic downward curve in children’s stable home life. There are ample statistics and research projects which tell us of the dire consequences of divorce on children. There are so many options for parents, particularly for mothers, to seek personal fulfillment. Having latchkey children is bad enough but parking them out in the first critical years is a disaster. Although a few are parented at home by the father it is the mother who is mentally, naturally and socially more fitting to take on this close parenting role. Divorce interrupts, interferes and upsets children’s equilibrium; children drop out of school, become stressed, show distress symptoms, confront the law, and dabble with smoking and drugs. Their lives are not happy ones. 

Without knowing intimately each and every case it is impossible to speculate what the damaged child would have been like had the parents not been divorced. There are as many types of parents as there are types of child. Within those numbers there are bound to be parents who are totally unfitting and those who have not bonded with their offspring. It is no good blaming individuals for the ills of society. The more individuals understand about relationships and parenting the better off they and society will be. The most intelligent person, the lucky billionaire and the professor’s son can all be equally bad parents. Its about due regard - which is about compassion, patience – having a low irritation rate, displaying care, being concerned, and responsible, giving off positive vibrations by being in control.

This is a relatively modern approach to test out a relationship. It is considered a reasonable pre-marriage trial period. In reality cohabiting couples rarely stay together longer than a couple of years. It is seen as a stress free way to sleep with a partner without the binding act of promises before witnesses. It is clear that if couples had to suffer a very painful initiation ceremony before marriage, and later, a stringent financial penalty after - to end it, there would be fewer marriages. Research figures show a trend towards cohabitation… the act of marriage to come later… present marriage statistics show a trend towards delayed parenting. Couples splitting up results in lone parenting, adding to the high numbers of young girls raising a child alone; and those losing custody, usually the male, living alone. The average age for couples getting married is rising… maintaining the partnership figures. The figures for cohabitating couples are rising too, as are the numbers for dependant children. Cohabitation figures are expected to double by 2021.

The trend is for cohabitation couples to take two years to decide whether or not to get married… eventually 60 per cent of them do, the remainders split up, within ten years… those, now single, engage once again in cohabitation, which lasts a further five years. Statistics show that conventional marriage rates are falling and the birth rate dropping. Cohabitation, and lone parenting figures, are rising, and that all these figures, both rising and falling, are acting together – in unison… that one in six children will soon be experiencing life in a stepfamily. Slowly the figures for marriage are dropping…
 
These depressing figures make one wonder: ‘if couples are any more committed to the state of marriage than previous ages,’ even though there is ample evidence that the impact of divorce on children is of great concern. You might think that the rising age rate for first marriages would produce less family break up – that older couples would be more stable, committed and reliable. The overwhelming belief is still, [the older the person the more they believe this to be so] that marriage is the most fitting place for having and raising children… Therefore, society is still capable of relying on the act of marriage to: ‘offer all that it has ever done’. However, that the reality is not confirmed by the statistics does not change people’s opinions. It follows therefore, that society’s moral behaviour is weaker than its desires. Reviewing these statistics it would seem that there must be a method whereby couples can embark upon marriage with a greater degree of sureness – that what they are doing is right and lasting - that their partner is the right one for them. As the divorce figures are almost seventy per cent, and steadily rising… they ought to take more care - in their choice of partner. It is how this can be done that I write this account and offer a suggestion…

The aim of couples seeking to plan their family:
 
#	Choosing an appropriate time when the female can have time off work.
#	Plan when there is sufficient capital saved - to afford a reduction of income.
#	Choose a suitable period when the mother is fit and healthy.
#	Limit family size to accommodate the plans for child care.
#	Help overcome hereditary problems – give the new baby a better chance in life.
#	Improve environmental conditions – spacing out births.
#	Provide the correct, clothing, equipment, and furniture.

All responsible couples give the above matters considerable thought. One or more of the list may not be accomplished - believing that by the time the child is born they will be in place. However hard up for cash or however well heeled they can choose the time and place. The latest contraception methods ensure this to be so and at the same time take care of proper reproductive health-care systems to support the mother. If the parents believe they should not copulate unless they are ready for a hoped for pregnancy that is their choice, they will have talked this through before marriage. It is of course imperative that all these questions and others are thoroughly discussed by the couple before embarking on marriage. That takes us back to my original premise that all couple should have a preconceived idea of each others hopes and fears in marriage.

Women want all the information they can possibly get about keeping control over what is happening to them, and to share in making decisions about having children with their partner. It is so important that she understands everything that is happening to her – to feel positive about the decisions made. Whether to have the baby at home and will all the necessary preparations are made on time. It is a stressful time. After the birth the mother watches every movement of the baby. Listening to each intake of breath, every twitch and turn, whimper and cry… this is a special psychological process that should not be interfered with… the mother and child’s flow of communication… theory both need nurturing together and separately. Loving support from your partner or someone close is all important. The importance of ‘bonding’ is enormous. A warm, comfortable, loving environment is essential to make the mother feel secure – able to express her own emotions. Mothering grows with the realization of the enormity of the event ‘the act of birth’. Bonding is not just from the spiritual joy but from the pain of birth too. It is having the responsibility, commitment and maternal love to be you - to have given life… thereafter, continuing the bonding by breast feeding - to give strength and energy… an act which resonates throughout the mother’s whole body. 

Statistics show that cohabiting couples who have children do not stay together longer because they are tied to ‘the family’, but the reverse – it drives them apart. It seems that the results of a pregnancy, in all its forms, weaken the sexual desires of both partners and diverts their energies. The long term vision – starting to form a family, doesn’t draw the couple together to complete their desires for: the woman temporally loses her sexual vulnerability and looks, and the man no longer becomes necessary to impregnate her. The pressure of withholding sexual advances and the thought of losing wealth, and employment opportunities - of his partner, creates emotional problems… and can promote his physical punishment of his female partner.

Statistics record that cohabiting couples experience greater strains on their relationship than married couples, and that children from cohabiting couples suffer from emotional problems as a result of insecurity. Households with stepparents are considered unsafe for young children of both sexes. In times of stress and unhappiness both couples can resort to physical punishment of the child. In a cohabitating household the woman frequently comes off worse. The male quickly loses his emotional tie with the increasing strain associated with parenting and the household budget. Women with young children not only have less money to keep the household going but lose position in their previous employment pay structure. In many cases it comes down to exploitation as the male disappears out the door leaving the mother to provide care until the child is old enough the look after itself.

Children from single parent homes suffer from the problems of the parent – the parents: concerns, loneliness, anxiety, strains, depression, anger and sadness. These negativities are passed on to the child in many different guises… the child suffers from doubts – feels annoyed at the lack of support – loses confidence and sometimes cannot account why they feel so alone. Natural growth becomes stunted and misshapen. It may take many years before the guilt, resentments and hatreds subside sufficiently to enable the child to make a commitment towards another person. As for the children of that child, they too take on some of the anger of the parent. In many cases the child cannot explain why the parent is angry or recount the details surrounding the original case. Over the years some minor upset is magnified out of all proportion, to become an enormous mountain…, in the past, a vendetta.
 
Time does take away or mask the original cause allowing some repair to be made, allowing the formation of a proper relationship… but underneath the fire still smolders ready to break out at a moments notice. It takes a great deal of personal happiness to make the person forgive completely – for their positive thoughts to come to the fore. Unfortunately by that time others have become affected. Grudges are harbored and hardships remembered… errors and slip-ups put down to the parent’s single status. In later life there is an urge to seek out the missing parent to either confront them, explain the pain they caused, or ease the pain of separation. Both the single parent and the child share the lack of the absent parent and whenever life becomes hard the absent parent gets the blame. This becomes a standard let out for all moments of stress and even if the absent parent did not cause the split-up in the first place they are made to feel, and shoulder, the blame.

The conventional married couple is a unit bound by vows of duty and honour – a union created - to secure a fit home for children. It takes regard for most eventualities including absence, illness or death of one of the partners. In some single parent homes, where a decision is made purposely to omit one parent  the possibility of total collapse, disruption or mental bruising, of the child or children, is considerable. These results in one or more helpers, friends or relatives, being permanently affected. The children from such homes carry around an inbuilt insecurity.

Pregnancy occurs two weeks after the prospective mother’s period begins. The sperm travels along the fallopian tube uniting with the released mother’s egg to fertilize – becoming a one-celled zygote. This zygote has number of chromosomes – half from the father and half from the mother determine sex and colour etc., still travels down the tube to the uterus, growing as it does so. This growth is now the multi-celled blast cyst having inner and outer cells. The inner the embryo and the outer the membrane sack which nourishes and protects the embryo. When the blast cyst reaches the uterus it burrows into the sidewall – the uterine wall, to obtain nourishment. The placenta – the membrane sack, also begins to grow.

We now reach the beginning of the embryonic period when the brain, and other organs, begins to form. The embryo has three layers: The top the ectoderm, the middle the mesoderm, and outer the peripheral. The brain develops along with the other systems. From the fifth week the brain makes links to the main organs and makes connections - that relate to learning, knowledge and awareness. The mother’s diet, peace of mind, and settled state, is associated with her child’s cognitive and neurological development - is part of the child’s normal shaping of neurological connections in the early development of cognitive functioning. Neurological development of the child is firmly linked to a mother’s healthy life style. A mother’s depression, alcohol and nicotine intake, low education level, and negative lifestyle – including outside the home work levels, are significant factors of impaired cerebral development in the child.

The mother’s happiness and well socialized state is transmitted to the unborn child. This is thought to start at the tenth week of pregnancy, or seventh week conception period. A calm voice, unhurried work level, and harmonious relationships with those around the mother are the beginning of the child’s social skills. This continues through the pregnancy and birth, responding to others, engaging in discovering those things around him all the while the mother’s bond to her child is reinforced… touching, cuddling, holding and stoking are all part of the process. 

Continuing these positive features the child will enjoy playing whilst interacting with others. At first he will be possessive but in a short space of time will share and empathize with others, making friends.
You will become aware how fixed his attentions are and how direct his actions develop. His neurological understanding advances through visual perception, desires, beliefs, to making up imaginary situations – these stages are the basis of ‘The theory of mind development’. The pregnant women’s diet is all important in the first two months. Put away all those pet hatreds for cabbage, curly kale, sprouts and spinach. This is just what you should have for they are rich in folic acid. Whole grain bread, become accustomed to muesli, and do eat an apple a day. Try and eat natural unprocessed meals.

      <text xml:space="preserve">====Chapter III: The early years of parenthood====

Good parenting stimulates and develops the child’s natural growth… the child will absorb, to an extent, the parents: social preferences and communication skills. It is clear that the higher the form, in matters of: aesthetic taste, appreciation of nature, levels of knowledge, controlled dexterity and social interaction, the better off the child is likely to be… This may not show itself in early life - but emerge later on. Children need to be happy and be at one with their environment – able to cope with their normal day to day life - socialized by feeling free, safe and accepted. This gives them confidence to accept different environments, unusual tasks, new relationships and greater challenges. Moments of stress - more to do with the parent being out of routine than that promoted by the child, should be avoided.

Children are born with brains that are structured [the organism’s genes]. These direct innate [evolutionary], personal characteristics which have some effect on development and interpersonal relationships. This model is challenged by genes needing an external/internal stimulus, or signal, [prenatal-birth period] in order to influence bodily functions. There is still much work needed on the human genome before interventions are developed. However, the environment does affect behaviour &gt; and changing behaviour patterns can change habits and traits. A child’s behaviour is also in part determined by its bodily make-up – hereditary factors. A mother's healthy pregnancy reduces the development of many illnesses in the child's later life. 

A child in a stressful situation naturally looks to its mother for safety. This attachment, first developed by factors: prenatal- primitive instincts &gt; breast feeding &gt; good environment, creates a bonding which should be a natural response. If this bonding is not present it creates tension - affecting intellectual development. If this continues psychosomatic disorders may surface, and later still depression. The child’s innate development, in normal circumstances, moves to forming relationships, and to deal with emotions.

It is argued that the level of social class determines acceptance or non-acceptance of education practices and the environment the child has to cope with. The working class pursues a natural growth rate, whilst the upper class questions limiting factors, seeks a higher growth rate. The former is non-stressful and unconfrontational – the child grows at its own pace… The latter stressful and demanding – pushing forward – the child is urged to do more. As with everything else its a matter of degree.

The range of complexities of individual differences in parenting is many and varied. Parents should agree to the direction they wish their child to take [[The class society]] regarding good behaviour… to ensure social inclusion, in the wider sense – neighborhood, school, and out of school societies. All individuals require both features for balance it is a question of when to apply which method - natural evolutionary growth or forced application. The latter is dissatisfied with the way things are – voices its displeasure… rather than the former who takes it on the chin –puts up with mediocrity, and kōtoẃs to bullying.

A happy child does not lose its temper or throw tantrums. It is eager to learn and experience new things and will delight in building and shaping natural objects. They will soon show the parent how they can master a problem and show pleasure when a problem has been solved. Creating a happy atmosphere is the parent’s chief goal knowing that more learning will be achieved by its formation.

Successful parenting requires some understanding of how their child is being affected by every day events, making sure the happy joyous things are repeated, to reinforce positive accomplishments. Your caring, patient attitude, will achieve far more than giving into moments of frustration and abruptness. The act of doing things together is more important than tasks acted on alone, even if it is only for a limited period. Children like to show what they can do… your praise ensures a repeat performance not in a boastful way but proof of success.

Every task you perform, together with your child, teaches sharing, and those lighter moments in-between – playtimes, teach self-reliance. All teaching, training, playing need structure - to get the most out of them. Structure has a beginning – the introduction, a middle – the main task, and an end – completion. Each part has a form – the steps necessary to build a completed act, and each act becomes a guide to satisfaction. Job satisfaction leads to happiness, and a will to improve… steps that leads to self-reliance, self-control and motivation. One of the most important tasks for the parent is to ensure their child has confidence – promoting a good image of self… a concept which includes identity and self esteem. 

Try to only involve your child in ‘achievable tasks’ that will result, with patience and persistence, in successful completion – ensuring a job well done warranting praise – which is your reward. Try not to allow tasks to be too complicated or too large so that they remain unfinished or shoddily done. There is no benefit in congratulations for poor, unfinished, work… so try to make sure it doesn’t happen. – be respectful of your child’s self-opinion. Be consistent and fair making sure your partner holds the same opinions as yourself regarding what is allowed and what is not.

If a parent questions whether they are doing right thing or not, their solution should be compared to the subjects highest form - what is morally, physically and mentally best? There has to be a certain amount of risk taking - that offers the child a value of self preservation. Problem solving has to include an element of reaching out – to find a conclusion. Social interaction needs a degree of imagination – placing oneself into somebody else’s position – to make the best appreciation possible.

Young children’s development can be improved by structured stimulation – increasing levels of difficulty. This can be judged by the amount of physical activity and degree of concentration shown by the child. Learning language begins before the spoken word. Speech acquisition is promoted by activity from the parents, particularly the mother, and this must be continually stimulated. Introducing play individually and in a group involves the socialization through relationships. Try and give your child a varied set of experiences inside and outside the home. The child must be encouraged to become self-reliant, confident and independent – allowed to be left to its own resources and take the initiative. Exploring new territory, using different shaped items, allowed to be noisy, all teach early responsibility and therefore continually encouraged. Children should be stimulated to be active and not lazy – find pleasure in completing a task by the reward it is given, even if it is just a slap on the back and told they’ve done well. Children progress differently – even within the age range. A child born prematurely - a few days before expected, usually is more active than a child born late. This is not just because the premature child is lighter or that the late arrival is fatter it is a matter of reflexes – the activity of the early arrival. Other than sight the child’s primitive reflexes are begun inside the mother’s womb.

Teaching the child inferior tasks, teaching poor language skills and giving harmful experiences will not give the child a good start to its life. If you are going to take the trouble to have a child, have the expense, and engage in physical pain give your child a good start. Make sure you engage your partner by talking through this lifelong task you are taking on. If you take the right first steps and give it your best shot you will be recompensed many times over. Only the best is good enough. You need to take control of yourself as much as controlling your child. No-one said bringing up a child is easy.

Pursuing tasks to be completed that are beyond the child’s capabilities creates stress. If the child continually fails to live up to the parents expectations, if badgering and nagging is used to browbeat, show up and oppress psychological disturbance will be the result. Children should be given tasks that can be achieved by a limited amount of perseverance and dedication, only so far as to eventually achieve success… all completed tasks immediately praised, an extra effort rewarded by a daily treat. The highest goal in all matters is to seek enlightenment – wisdom, to pursue what is beautiful and good… Sometimes, to pursue a higher level, it requires a different path – it is good because it develops an open mind. There are many different paths; the fact that you are seeking another way shows flexibility, and perseverance; that you are stopping or hesitating, to allow a chance to re-evaluate – to reform, approach the subject from another direction. It is a proven fact that too much television or playing too long at computer games harms normal vision, physical fitness, mental capacity, question solving and structured learning; revert to solving the problem, or amusing yourself, by engaging in imaginative play.

Children are born with an accumulation of innate structures – programmed genes. These structures are developed through experiences. These experiences can be increased by stimuli – learning new tasks and changing the child’s environment. The mother is the most important factor in the child’s early life. It is through her that the baby learns attachment when feeding – bonding. Those children deprived of this natural bonding become detached – their development is slowed down – become aggressive, eventually depressed. Controlled behaviour is essential for good social integration and the pursuit of excellence… it is also a means whereby mental and physical space is given to a problem, to allow a rational assessment of each and every action, rather than to plunge in and create waves.  In a child’s early years, their store of experience, understanding, rationalization and knowledge has not been built up or shaped, they are but putty in the hands of the parent and educators. Putty unfortunately, if left too long, loses its plasticity - goes hard, eventually it will never be softened again but break up into little pieces. Human beings are the same. Parents should take advantage of the early stages to shape their child in the best way they can. 

To remove their child away from all those things which are harmful in mind and body? If they do that promoting good behaviour, tolerance, knowledge and a healthy body they are doing the best they can. No parent can say they do not know the difference or hide behind social indifference and the lowest common denominator, which is popular demand. If you are trying your best to teach good behaviour and direct your child towards structured learning you would be setting back you achievements by allowing your child to play with a badly behaved neighbour’s child or a neighbouring child who is playing outside all the time. You cannot allow yourself to be sidetracked or to take the easy path. Children need to be directed by a delicately controlling hand all the time; that is why the close period – birth-to-three, [or four], is essential time - to set the foundation for the future.

Most parents are keen to enroll their child in the local kindergarten or play school. There, the careers, or teachers, point the child in certain directions and introduce the start of structured learning, which builds up on the child’s previous experiences. The educators understand that not all children have similar capabilities… that damage can be done if the pressure on slow learners is forced… that is why it is so important to have sympathetic and patient teachers. For those children underachieving special learning situations should be planned with longer one-to-one tuition times, slotted in. This does not mean that the slow learner will not catch up, for that is far from the truth, what it does mean however is that greater care has to be taken. It can be deduced that to create a good environment for a childs early development can take up a considerable amount of time and dedication. It is in this training/learning environment that good habits introduced and reinforced that will stand the child in good stead and be a good basis for future educators to build. Most parents understand that it is this interaction – between child and tutor, based upon good positive experiences lasts forever if gently guided and nurtured. One of the true indicators to good learning is activity. Children who are advanced in sitting and standing, constructive play and movement are generally advanced in speaking - repeating and answering. These should not be forced responses but gently coaxed and rewarded by your pleasure.
 
The concept of reasonableness is not a shared one, nor is the concept static, for what is reasonable one moment is not at another. Knowing a bit more about your partner is a good thing, and talking through these variables does help – listening to each other’s points of view is always beneficial, especially if the view alters a perspective. The idea of a questionnaire seems like a good one. With that in mind I have set out some everyday problems [[The class society ]] to think about – to be taken as mental preparation, before filling-in the questionnaire. Neither the prompts nor the questionnaire have been devised as anything other than a helpful guide, and to offer a set of suggestions.

If the family is the Nation’s bedrock the extended family must be its core… this is the same in all societies? The family can be defined as a parent[s], guardian or responsible adult, plus a child. This is a social group. This nuclear group can be extended by a grandparent[s], relatives or friend, living in close proximity, or bound by frequent occasion – this is The Extended Family.  Parenting involves care, concern, security and guidance… these acts of love are bonding features begun when the child is first born and continue… go towards confidence building, and close association. All, in turn, provide a good foundation for education, to play its part - towards making a rounded, intelligent, individual child.

To ensure a good start in life the parent should involve/include the child with everyday events and issues of the day and home… in a happy, responsive way… keeping the child close at all times – this is ‘The Happy Partnership’. These early ‘close period’ days that should last for a period of at least four to five years. Babies respond to even tempered voices – particularly the mother’s - lullabies, nursery rhymes, songs, and softly played music. Children thrive on being cuddled, stroked and held close. The mother is the closest, dearest and most longed for companion –mother’s face, smell, and touch.

Increasingly parents return to work within shorter periods after the birth… they, and particularly the mother, are giving this most important period over to someone else… a time when the mother should be at home watching their child grow up. It does not take a psychologists or social worker to spell out the importance of this period. If you doubt their wisdom read any autobiography and you will appreciate how the role of the mother dominates the wellbeing of the child. Of course not all mothers are good and kind and some appreciate that their frustrations and weaknesses might interfere with their child’s growth. You might say that in such a case the woman should not have had a child in the first place, but that would be unrealistic. People are not saints… children of such parents should be in the hands of someone who is prepared to spend time looking after them. Such mothers are rare, most understand that this early period, in a child’s life, is more important than any other - it is an introduction into the child’s immediate surroundings and wider world. 

Socialization with siblings and members of the extended family are to be introduced gently - to build upon the close period… the parent keeping in attendance - to ensure safety. These are the child’s first steps towards sharing – adapting and compensating for the actions of others – to enable the child ‘to fit in’ and become part of humanity. The act of socialization is not just about the nuclear or extended family. It is about the child’s connection to all other people. This is extremely important in life… it makes the individual able to communicate and relate to others not in a forced unnatural way but by being at ease, friendly and companionable. Naturally the first person to be related to is the child’s mother, surrounding family, first friends – neighbours and playmates.

It is with these close companions that your child will grow up with. He will take on their language, culture, habits and social skills. It is for you to make sure your child is surrounded by children and adults whom you know he is safe with: that have good habits, kind thoughts and gentle spirits. Do not believe that by introducing your child to loud, rough, aggressive and unkind children your child will learn to stand up for himself.  Shouting, screaming and pushing youngsters are upsetting and this is the last thing you want your child to copy. Do not allow your child to smother, clasp and pull other children to get their attention. It is by being ‘a good playmate’ those others will want to play and be friends with your child. It is also not by force, having your own way, demanding and seeking attention or by claiming the best and most popular toy.

It is the natural way of mother child touching, cooing, smiling that stimulates the child to kick out in pleasure. He will pucker up his face, shake his head and make faces trying to emulate your gestures… gurgling and crying out to copy your words and sounds. You must be on hand to keep him safe removing dangerous objects guiding his play by emphasizing the importance of controlled movement; keeping him interested – giving him new challenges and experiences.

Keep up the daily routine: breast feeding &gt; resting &gt; playing &gt; sleeping &gt; and changing his nappy... and eventual: self feeding and potty training. You will be grateful that you stuck to the daily round that has evolved from his first few weeks. They will change quite naturally as each skill is extended taking just a little longer to perfect whilst you both relate to his changing world. You too will garner satisfaction from stroking his head as he feeds, washing him in his bath, patting him dry and cuddling him with a warm towel. Then you can sit together and watch the clouds pass by, the leaves fall from the tree and listen to the wood pigeons on the slatted roof.

Taking the child to a communeral playground, and recreation ground, presents the larger society – outside the home. Swimming classes are a way to involve other children in a group activity that teaches a beneficial skill. This involves fun and games in a controlled setting. Both are an introduction to formal classes at school. Within these first five years the child is introduced into its society, coming safely into contact with others in a secure environment.

These are the most important years to instill self-worth so that the child is confident in its own abilities, not in a manner to better anyone, or to put someone down, but to become sufficiently confident they can cope with other children’s behaviour – their peer’s difficulties, successes, aggressiveness and pride. Teaching a child to accept these behavioural patterns in others is what socialization is all about and can only be done by the child being confident in its own abilities first, which is why the close period is so important. The unsocial behaviour in others needs careful explanation not to make the child feel superior but caring and concerned with another’s plight, suffering and problems. Showing a caring attitude towards others is the mark of good behavior appreciated by all, exhibited by concern not nosiness - breaching another’s privacy. 

However, this is easier said than done. The parent needs to be open-minded/knowledgeable/caring to recognize another’s anti-social mannerisms, vices, language and intent – to steer their child in such a way that they can appreciate there is another path - to make life enjoyable, successful and productive. This should not be done in a self satisfied way nut with humility and concern. If these guidelines are followed a successful start to a child’s early life would be assured. However, a successful outcome relies upon the parent, to make each step fun, without any stress; this requires a great deal of forward planning and effort.

It is a relatively new understanding that fathers play a significant role in a child’s early life. The authorities figure appears to reduce early sexual activity by both sexes, increases the age of first childbirth, improves standards of living, reduces family stress and increases school qualifications. In cases where the father is removed, there are a number of negative outcomes - the opposite of the list above. Socialization has been defined as getting to grips with: the attitudes, values, and behaviour patterns of those nearest - so that an individual can fit into the society, group, or workplace. Occupational identity affects young people greatly; they have to come to terms with so much in a short space of time. 
 
There is a gradual work up to the young person’s introduction to work, which starts in the home, school, and media. The young person hears from his parents about their work. With any luck he may try a part-time job, or be fitted into a work experience scheme. There he will observe others and hear their problems and worries. One of the greatest forces that motivate, direct, and acts as a sounding board, are his friends. Their values, aspirations, and experiences are important.

The young person’s motivation maybe influenced by the wage he will get. Perhaps the jobs prestige amongst his friends, its advancement opportunities, and even security. His parents may have longer-term thoughts about the jobs pension, useful skills training and sick care arrangements. What will have the longer-term influence will be the family's opinion, its repeated values drummed in over a number of years. The importance of the jobs future worthwhileness - durability, the necessesity to work hard and to obtain skills that can be passed on to other working arrangements. There are two main forces that affect motivation: the intrinsic, which is concerned with creativity… one’s interests, whether art or science based, self-directing and responsible. And the extrisic ability, based on whether practical and hands on.    

Children copy adults, your behavior in action, word, and deed, has to be as perfect as possible. Your language should be quietly firm, unchallenging and fair, enunciating clearly and concisely, using a neural intonation, applying good English, free from slang and sloppy phrasing. How could you possibly expect your child to talk well if you do not? Being able to spell the word enables a proper enunciation to be applied. This is important for the mother tongue and even more so if studying a foreign language.One of the most upsetting events in anyone’s life is not being liked - being ostracised and unwanted… This deprivation maybe caused by bad early socialization: the child refusing to share – not allowing another has to join in - being unfriendly, threatening, shouting, or too familiar. We all want our child to be liked, respected, valued, and wanted. 

Whoever said parenting was easy. It requires time and effort, patience and fortitude. Knowing what is good parenting does help even though it is not always followed. Before starting a family discuss with your partner what you are going to do to ensure your child has a good start. Read about what psychologists know about human behaviour and follow their advice. You wanted your child so pass that feeling on, and make him feel wanted, loved, secure and valued… he did not ask to be brought into this world. Don't discover your deficiencies too late, a child is forever!

: T = LC

===Circuit Natural Response===
At equilibrium the total voltage of the circuit is zero

:&lt;math&gt;L \frac{dI}{dt} + \frac{1}{C}\int I dt = 0&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;I  = A Sin \omega t &lt;/math&gt;

''At equilibrium or The natural response of the LC series is the Sinusoidal Wave Oscillation ''

===Resonance===
Resonance occurs when the frequency components cancel each other out . Therefore, at resonance
:&lt;math&gt;Z_L = Z_C&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\omega L = \frac{1}{\omega C}&lt;/math&gt;

''At resonance the response of the LC series is the Standing Wave Oscillation ''

* &lt;math&gt;\alpha^2 = \beta^2&lt;/math&gt; . 
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{R}{2L}&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{LC}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;R = \sqrt{\frac{L}{C}}&lt;/math&gt;

The equation has only one real root 
:s = -α = &lt;math&gt;\frac{R}{2L}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;I = A e^(-\frac{R}{2L}) t&lt;/math&gt;


* &lt;math&gt;\alpha^2 &gt; \beta^2&lt;/math&gt; , 
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{R}{2L}&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{LC}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;R &gt; \sqrt{\frac{L}{C}}&lt;/math&gt;

The equation has two real roots
:&lt;math&gt;s = -\alpha \pm \lambda &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;I(t) = e^(-\alpha \pm \lambda)t&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;I(t) = e^(-\alpha t)(e^ \lambda t + e^ -\lambda t)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;I(t) = \frac{e^(-\alpha t)}{2} Cos \lambda t&lt;/math&gt;


* &lt;math&gt;\alpha^2 = \beta^2&lt;/math&gt; . 
:&lt;math&gt;R &lt; \sqrt{\frac{L}{C}}&lt;/math&gt;

The equation has two complex roots
: &lt;math&gt;s = -\alpha&lt;/math&gt; + &lt;math&gt;j \lambda &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;I(t) = e^(-\alpha t)(e^ j\lambda t + e^ -j\lambda t)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;I(t) = \frac{e^(-\alpha t)}{2j} Sin \lambda t&lt;/math&gt;

==Resonance==
Resonance occurs when the frequencies components cancels out . Therefore, at resonance
: &lt;math&gt;Z = Z_R + Z_C + Z_L = Z_R + 0 = R&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;I = \frac{V}{R}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;Z_L = Z_C &lt;/math&gt; . &lt;math&gt; \omega L = \frac{1}{\omega C}&lt;/math&gt; . &lt;math&gt;\omega = \sqrt{\frac{1}{LC}}&lt;/math&gt;

* At &lt;math&gt;\omega = 0 I = 0&lt;/math&gt;
* At &lt;math&gt;\omega = \sqrt{\frac{1}{LC}}&lt;/math&gt; . &lt;math&gt;I = \frac{V}{R}&lt;/math&gt;
* At &lt;math&gt;\omega = 00 I = 0&lt;/math&gt;

==Impedance==
: &lt;math&gt;Z =Z_R + Z_L + Z_C&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;Z = R + j\omega L + \frac{1}{j\omega C}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;Z = \frac{1}{j\omega C} (j\omega^2 + \alpha j \omega + \beta) &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\alpha = \frac{R}{L} &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\beta = \frac{1}{Lc} &lt;/math&gt;

==Summary==
* The resonance response is in the type of Tuned Resonance Band Pass Filter
* The natural response is a wave of decreasing magnitude
:: &lt;math&gt;R = \sqrt{\frac{L}{C}}&lt;/math&gt; . One real root . &lt;math&gt;I(t) = e^(-\frac{R}{2L}) t&lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt;R = \sqrt{\frac{L}{C}}&lt;/math&gt; . Two real roots . &lt;math&gt;I(t) = e^(-\frac{R}{2L}) t [e^(\lambda t) + e^(-\lambda t)] &lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt;R = \sqrt{\frac{L}{C}}&lt;/math&gt; . Two complex roots . &lt;math&gt;I(t) = e^(-\frac{R}{2L}) t [e^(j\lambda t) + e^(-j\lambda t)] &lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">In this book ''''(ICT-)Security Stuff'''' I present a general overview of the ICT-security area.

Also I will add specific detail-information in the several chapters as soon as I have it ready.

As you know there is an information-overflow about this stuff but I'll try to (re-)structure it.

Starting fom a general overview (derived from ISO 2700x-series and several international companies) and merging my own detail notes I will setup a unique document, 
I guess.

Also I'll try to 'lift a tip of the veil' of ''future trends on cyber-security''.

I'm curious of what others think of this.

      <text xml:space="preserve">====Chapter IV: The responsibilities of parenting====

Past civilizations believed that men had every right to be head of the household or family: chief of the clan, tribal leader, king of state, and High King of the civilization or race. The law of hereditary – property, and land rights, were written in his name as a legal right. This is not always the case in some societies. Gradually this has changed. Muscular strength, leadership in battle, maker of laws and the divine rights of kings was changed by Acts of Law and Equal Rights. The power of Education has complemented these changes in Law. Men have had their power stripped from them mainly by: the change in property rights, the laws of divorce and Women's changed status. Inheritance Tax has played a part too. As his powers have withered away – been taken, and given up, men’s control - power, and position, have grown weaker. In many respects, the power of the sexes is equal, although concerning young children; women still maintain public regard for the ‘mothering role’, something that may change - even though being‘the carrier’ and ‘life giver!’ The modern woman has to some degree passed over some mothering roles to her husband, and various outside carers.

Previously men had greater social responsibility as the wage earner. He appended his signature to legal documents, could own property, was better educated and voted at elections. The eldest carried the name forward became ‘head of the family’. His name appeared on the property title. What the father did and said was accepted as ‘the way’. There were neither female apprentices nor trainees. Commerce and industry only employed men in positions of responsibility. When women were employed for menial tasks - as servants, maids, some labouring jobs, lesser office work and factory employment, their wage-rate was half that of men in similar positions. Fathers dictated moral standards and declared the family’s social position… they were the backbone of that society’s hierarchy, and tribal power.

Men’s superior social position started to change with the industrial revolution – about the middle of the nineteenth century. A little later, the education of the masses ensured girls would receive some sort of education that would eventually prepare them for jobs that are more responsible. The Crimea War and the two Boar Wars exposed the population’s poor health. Various considerations were made to correct this – better education and school meals. By the time these educational and welfare changes had raised the populations expectations and The First World War over [a period of ten years] women had shown they were capable of many jobs one time reserved for men. Although the mass unemployment of the twenties set back the advance of women, they quickly resumed their onetime position twenty years later – especially during the time of ‘total war’. By the 1950s, it was expected that girls were to become employed. When starting a family they stopped full-time employment, many for good. A further twenty years it was expected that mothers resumed their work when their child reached the age of five - starting full-time education. This change in social structure only took fifty years – a generation, to alter what had been an accepted state of affairs since recorded time.

The role of men in the twenty-first century is now the weakest it has ever been. Paternal rights, familial ties, and the kingdom’s hierarchy, once supreme, was now questioned, reduced, and stripped away. Much of this power was to do with wealth – the control of money, to support the many by the few. Largely men have given up their powers by society’s call for reasonableness, fairness, equality, and just rights. You might think that the power between men and women is now equal but that would not be so. Nevertheless, it is far closer than it has ever been and depends, on the circumstance. In business, it is still natural to address official documents to the male of the household. When a decision is required concerning children then the mother’s opinion is paramount, especially concerning custody and maintaining the child’s home. This too is changing as women give up some of their mothering role. As women become more powful, through equal pay many fathers will either be: house-fathers, work from home, taking on some of the mothering role, or share time outside the home with their wife.

Fathers play an important part in child development. It is little wonder that the good relationship of the father to the mother contributes to the pre-birth attachment of the child to its parents. This positive caring attitude, continues after birth by the father bathing, feeding and cradling, all of which contributes to ‘close attachment’, a period necessary to a good father-child association. Father’s should communicate through story telling, nursery play and conversation, to demonstrate care, understanding, and tolerance. It is about showing interest – that the child counts - is important to those around him. It is necessary to let the child know that it is wanted and needed. This generates, in the child, respect for the father, and stimulates the wish to please, which in turn reinforces stability and security. The father should never compare one child against the next. All these factors give lifelong support and contribute towards ‘good growth’- giving disciplined, direction, and instruction. It is an interesting discussion point: ‘In the event the father devotes unlimited child caring time from birth, would the child’s natural insticts towards the mother be subverted?’ 

British society during the early nineteenth century considered girls to be future mothers. Mrs Beeton, 1837-1865, wrote books on household management, sanitary, medical and legal matters, to do with the home – was an authority on the role of women. The Forster Act of 1870, dealt with Education in Britain, which was the start to Britain’s Educational needs. Girls well into the twentieth century were considered fitting only for a limited education to pass on information and learning to their children. It was thought by society that the habits and routines of the home – motherhood, was a natural, god given, evolutionary event, making expensive education, and training unnecessary, even, wasteful. What was needed was for the mother, close female relatives, midwives, and wet nurses, to pass on how to run a home and cater for children. For the better educated, there was Mrs Beeton.  Society, even in these liberated times, consider girls as future mothers, who else indeed! This suggests that women have as their chief interest the home, and all those things that go on in it. If this cannot be a statement for all a women’s life then it certainly should be for that period before, during, and after the birth - for the first three to four years.
 
It was consider unnecessary - a waste of money, to educate girls who would not be able to use that extra knowledge. Either daughters were expected to marry or to stay at home and look after the elderly parents… it was not considered sensible or rational to pass on the property title or the bulk of the estate out of the family. The eldest son was expected to look after unmarried women and the married daughters were the property of their husbands relieving the estate of that drain upon its wealth. This state of affairs continued until the mid nineteenth century and even then hardly changes until well into the twentieth.

Women, particularly young mothers, were considered ‘the gentle sex’. The act of pregnancy, carrying the child, breast feeding and nurturing thought natural, unselfish, pure; blessed by church and state. Society, under the old system, welcomed this state of affairs as unthreatening, subservient, and convenient. Therefore, they protected the image, defending the future generation. Many habits, routines, rules of law and social etiquette attached itself to this image of women. In many ways, it suited women to perpetuate this, when making a living required hard manual work. However, as soon as more jobs became available that did not require strength but dexterity and orderliness women could see here was a chance to extend their horizons. This they have been doing ever since and it could be argued that society has benefited. It must be pointed out that there are many jobs which not only require high training/learning, dexterity and orderliness but strength and athleticism too. 

Women were considered homebuilders, bearers of the coming generation, and child rearers. If babies and young children required looking after it was natural for the state to look to women to do it. Custody of the young followed divorce laws and settlements, handing over the job to the separated mothers - who naturally needed paying. The state has now elevated women to the role of child protectors – particularly of babies, pre-school children, and children in the ‘close period’ – under five, or birth to three. This custody can extend to children going to secondary schools – under fifteen. State education does not separate girls from boys but declares all children must be educated to the same level throughout school life – till eighteen, and beyond, if felt fitting.

All childcare authorities consider the women’s role indispensable in nurturing which requires patience, time, and dedication. Nurturing is mainly accomplish through breast feeding, comforting, rocking and gently talking or singing achieved without fuss and bother with time and shared comfort. This mothering role is natural, considerate, and compassionate. It is an emotional and basic requirement of child development and helps shape future responses and wellbeing. This ‘close period’ lasts until the child starts school which is a loose period between  the years three to five, depending on the individual. The point maybe decided by the local school authority, the number of school places available and, to a degree, parental choice – the ability to pay the school fee. It is recommended that the child in an introductory class should have a shorter school day, with frequent breaks and a middle rest period… for the first year, at least.

It is perfectly clear that women in the workplace are essential. Society required it during moments of national crisis, since that time women have created for themselves a position of power. It was ever clear that this would cause distress not only soaking up the number of work places that men and boys had previously filled but their absence from the home would disrupt the even tenor of life there.  There seems to be little point explaining why this is so or the effects this has on society. It is, as they say, ‘a done deal’. Society cannot have it both ways. Women have forever compared their life with those of their husband’s and children. They have seen the immediate rewards working for a living have given – the leisure activities, the personal possessions, and the freedom. They are not going to give them up. They would rather have their children later, not have so many, and pass their children’s care onto somebody else - even when it is demonstrated that this is detrimental. The power that women have will change society yet again, governments will pander to their needs by forcing businesses to provide better kindergarten facilities, days off for sick child-leave, flexi-working hours, paid for home help, home place working, workplace facilities to look after their sick children, job sharing, and their days off work paid in full. If this continues, they will force businesses to limit the number of work positions available for women.

Equal opportunities works on the shop floor and in offices. Sex is no longer the limiting factor it once was. All vacancies must be open to all if the education and previous training fits the job description. Mothers are given the opportunity to return to work within a certain period – the job is kept open and payment made during time off. The close period for the child – considered by psychologists to be that time before full-time education, is now farmed out to childcare agencies and kindergarten. This reduces the child/mother bonding period, home socialization, and the first stages of language, intimacy, and closeness.

The part parents play in this century is one of sharing, so that each can focus on their own work and interests. Young children are organized to fit in. There is a general feeling that this variety and flexibility is helpful to the child, giving a more rounded view of life. Common sense tells use that this is not so. Children need security, a sense of belonging and routine… and the longer this can be offered the better. Learning experiences are improved/internalized by self-discovery… repetition/rote thereafter cements the event or occasion. 

In the past, it was thought that because women had a strong attachment to children - through maternal instincts, boys who had too much female involvement/contact would develop homosexual instincts. This is not so, a person’s sexuality is driven by desire – ‘a mental process’, and, where the person develops that desire – ‘their environment’.  As it is unclear exactly what makes one person male and the other female. Genitalia are the simplest form of identification; however, it is hormone levels, and gene regulation, which are the true factors… Environment allows opportunity, encouragement, and acceptance. Parents are conditioned when we are told before, or just after birth, the gender of our child. They then clothe, refer, educate and socialize, the child, to that belief… never once giving a moment’s thought that this might not be true… The child, youth, or adult, goes along with that idea not knowing any different. At some stage the individual will question that assumption, some imagining, or liking to think they are  being ‘with it’… then becoming depressed and oppressed by developing thoughts until accepting the tendency. It is up to the individual to do what they are most happy with doing as long as they are not hurting anyone else or endangering their own mental or physical wellbeing. Gradually, by personal acceptance of their libido, the person becomes more comfortable. Whether straight or gay we all have to do that.   

Do not expect others to take over your job and put right your deficiencies. Thankfully, we have the means to find out about most things easily and simply. Never compare your child detrimentally to another. Never say they are not wanted, and certainly, not ever wanted. Do not be violent, shout, or deny them food… but give them space, a kindly word, and the company of others. If you are firm, right from birth - maintaining simple social rules and correct behaviour patterns, it will set the correct tone for a sound and happier later life.  The first set of rules are laid down as early as possible in the baby’s life - in the close period; they are to do with times for: waking, feeding, burping, cuddling, nappy changing, bathing, settling down, being in the fresh air, enjoying the motion of the pram, sleeping etc.… these quite structured rules - to do with everyday habits, will transfer – to more social rules involving: singing, reciting, playing music, reading, language, play-sharing, etc., these social skills follow on through the rest of the child’s life – to adulthood – to form a regimen for life… to ensure: correct: bodily function, social behaviour,  and mental exercise.

It’s a lot easier maintaining your rules from the start rather than effect change later on. Try to make your home a haven of calm; you do not have to shout to be heard. The most important action you can show your child is that you care about everything they do. By this positive action, the child will have a regard for you and show you respect. Try to be a paragon of virtue and your child will love you for it. Make your language and facial expressions positive – praising, congratulating, smiling, clapping, and raising a cheer. If your child misbehaves, it is generally because they have seen someone else do it, distract the child from errors, and seek to extract from the child the correct behaviour, at every occasion, by outlining preferred options and why.

Schools for babies and toddlers are a feature of today’s society… sometimes used as a ‘baby minder’ for the working mother. Parents believe that such institutions provide socialization and learning – teach the child how to relate with its peers; give a head start in learning the 3Rs, and provide an arena for simple inculcating everyday skills. There is absolutely no doubt that such places can advance scholastic and instructional skills. Children are competitive; they can be aggressive and frequently unkind. However closely guarded, superintended, and controlled, these human characteristics are exhibited daily… and do affect others. It is not always evident that these characteristics are exhibited or have adverse effects. That they do is well known… and not obvious to the parent until much later… usually when it is too late. It is essential for the parents to take a lively interest in how the school is being run and what happens in times of stress.

A mother’s maternal function in pregnancy is an important director of early fetal brain development. This is an important period of brain development of the offspring. The adage ‘you are what you eat’ is a significant factor in healthy living; it might be added, 'you are how you were mothered/nurtured.' This is even more important when pregnant. A good healthy mixed diet is essential if a fetus is to have the best start in life. There are a number of studies that have shown that a mother’s thyroid function during early gestation is connected to impaired fetal brain development. Make sure your baby gets the best treatment from you.

====A child’s growth pattern====

#	 What a caring parent wants is a child born physically and mentally well – appearing and functioning normally at birth, according to prescribed norms – this includes suckling, movement and crying.
#	Within days, parents look carefully for movement in all limbs, and soon after, sensory responses. Once again the search is for natural responses something all mothers are attuned with.
#	Crying - turns to other sounds, attempts at recognisable sounds, language… attention seeking.
#	From birth, socialization is carried forward by the mother – responding, talking, touching, recognition, smell and sound.
#	Sitting up, crawling, bottom-shuffling… drinking from a beaker, self-feeding… assisted standing… then unassisted… finally climbing and walking. Scribbling, recognizing colours, filling in shapes, building structures.
#	Recognisable sounds turn into copying the mother - repetition of familiar single syllable words – singing nursery tunes/lullabies, numbers… repeating the alphabet as a song… handing and fetching, pointing, identifying nominated/named items. Gradually words are joined and talking begins. Playing games that require counting, sharing out items, allotting familiar toys.
#	Starting to wash and dress. Repeating common sentences about eating, the weather, going for a walk, the countryside, going to bed. Asking questions, eliciting answers. Engaging in conversation.
#	First attempts at reading – pointing… following the formed words, breaking down words into sounds, shaping the mouth – making the sound.
#	Unassisted reading and copy-writing.
#	Adding, subtraction, dividing and multiplication.

Women now work full-time, except for brief periods – final weeks of child bearing, giving birth, weaning, and the close period – up to kindergarten or Introductory Class, until retirement. The additional wealth has altered their position in society, changed the pattern of home life, and altered social class structures and realigned women’s role and status in society.

If a couple, or single person, decides to have a baby and cannot afford to look after it they are being irresponsible. Welfare payments should not be offered to any person who declares they want, desire, need or deserve a child. Society should only allot facilities to those parents who have demonstrated they are settled, are mature, have, or will have, the necessary finances to maintain a child...Any person who gives birth to a child who cannot be maintained should have their parents fined, or a charge placed on their property - sufficient to pay for maintenance.

The passing of the Legal Aid Act in 1949 allowed the possibility of divorce. By the middle fifties there were about 25,000 divorces a year. Of those divorced three quarters remarried. Of the women married over seven hundred in every thousand went up the aisle. The average number of children per family was 2.3. The extended family group which persisted longest was mainly in the country, not the industrial towns. It was the professional family which split to form the nuclear family unit. The consumer society was born even though women remained in the home. Women were having fewer babies and some went out to work. Sharing the household chores began to take hold, particularly on the new nuclear families. 

At the time of the Festival of Great Britain there were nearly eleven hundred thousand single men and women in the UK. Ten years later that figure hardly changed. The following ten years saw figures showing far more men – twelve hundred thousand to just over eleven for women. The statistics show that between the ages of twenty to twenty-four there were over twice as many women of that age group getting married. It was an age of early marriages. Further statistics show that divorce reached a peak a couple of years after I was first married. Looking back I was not aware of the figures or change in the law and practice. Even though these figures were available conversations at work did not follow the advent of legal aid in 1949, to make comment.

However, it is true that Americanism was rife. What was happening there - seen through the news-reel camera, and drama on the cinema screen, was copied here. In both countries divorce was rampant… fifty per cent of all marriages were ending in divorce, and single parenthood was increasing. A Royal Commission was set up, the same year as The Festival of Great Britain. It was charged with the task of suggesting a change in the law, from that, contained in the Matrimonial Act nearly a quarter of a century before, which permitted divorce only on the grounds of fault – evidence of adultery, cruelty, and desertion, of three or more years. It was thought that perhaps divorce should be possible when a marriage was irretrievably broken, after a period of time? 

The Royal Commission identified some changes in society – that  people’s lives were changing relative to the structure, proclaiming   that it wasn’t popular disbelief or disseverance of moral codes. In the end the commission was thought of as weak and ineffectual. Later, newspapers asserted that family life was doomed. It was put down to: better education, higher standards of living and women’s liberation… All these three were bound up in the emancipation of women and seen as a social problem and indeed a modern crisis. The general view was that the marriage vows were not being taken seriously – that there was no social slur attached to the act of divorce. It was summed up, describing it as an age that ‘lacked stability’. Presumably, the newspapers were as much looking at the industrial scene as the social one. Once convention had been undermined it was not likely to be propped up. In the 1960s Judges and Registrars were allowing liberal interpretations.

The Divorce Reform Act 1969 allowed ‘irretrievable breakdown’ as grounds for divorce but it was still evidenced to one of the three causes – adultery, desertion and cruelty - known as the ‘behaviour ground’. It was in fact a lessoning of control – agreeing to permissive legislation, to allow a more satisfactory state of family affairs by replacing an unsuccessful union. In this 1980s view of marriage, and subsequent divorce, the children were declared by Social Workers and Family Liaison Officers as ‘of chief concern’. This was not wholly true; they were in fact, ‘bit’ players. The Legal Administrators saw the parent’s happiness as ‘of paramount importance’, and this was mainly to do with the parent’s financial wellbeing.

The mother almost always claimed and received the children’s custody… this happened whether they were fitting or not… the woman received Society’s blessing, because she ‘carried the child and nurtured it’ - was better able - and  more suited by nature, to look after her own children. Men were advised not to bother to seek custody because they were thought, ‘highly unlikely to receive it’ – even though they might well be more able. In most cases of divorce the guilty or injured male had to leave the family home to bring about some sort of stability and good will. It was rare for the wife to agree to sell the family home to share the proceeds so that both could start again. In many cases after the sale there might be very little left… the value depended on how long the marriage had lasted - for time to build up the collateral. 

This had long term detrimental effects on the husband’s financial state. The house, his main source of collateral - likely to form financial stability in old age and provide a pension, was given away for a percentage [usually twenty-per cent]. This never compensated for all the intervening years of struggle nor did it take into account the furniture, furnishings white goods and fittings. It was highly unlikely that his financial stability would ever be recouped… even over time…

Young children of separating couples were asked if they understood what was happening. Any child over sixteen was considered an adult – could leave the family home if they so desired. The eldest child under sixteen was the main arbiter… asked, ‘who do you wish to stay with your father or mother?’ In the event the child refused to answer, for whatever reason, the mother was given preference. Unless there was a positive unambiguous preference towards the father - by the majority of the younger children, the mother kept custody. At no time was the family drawn into a discussion to arrive at a sensible and fair conclusion giving all the family a chance to make their opinions known. For the nation to support first wives, who had no work, became very costly. Women with children not only did not remarry but if they did divorce soon followed.

When deciding on custody Social Workers were generally biased in favour of the mother. Mothers used: unpleasant rows, unreasonable and threatening behaviour, or impending assault, as reasons why they should be given protection, custody, and a safe home. Any form of mediation was looked on with hostility because the sample of opinion was too small. The Social Workers did not consult wide enough to form a true opinion and started off biased by the then accepted rules. This was as much a fault of lack of resource as experience. Family neighbours, friends, relations and work colleagues needed to be consulted to form a complete picture. But above all the social worker had to have an open mind and be receptive and flexible, of opinion as well as decision… this was lacking; searching for and issuing fault frowned on, considered an anathema.

      <comment>/* MIP branch-and-cut output */ corrected gap formula, entire denominator was previously absoluted</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">By default, the GLPK library regularly prints to console to indicate '''progress towards a solution'''.
The exact form of output depends on whether the underlying problem is LP or MIP and, in some cases, which solver method was invoked.

The same terminal output arises from both the GLPSOL utility and from the direct use of the GLPK API. The information on this page should therefore be of equal relevance to modelers using MathProg and to programmers using the GLPK callable library.

__FORCETOC__

== Controlling terminal output ==

GLPK provides modelers and programmers with added control over terminal output.

The terminal output of GLPSOL may be duplicated to a text file with command-line parameter &lt;tt&gt;--log&lt;/tt&gt;. For example:

&lt;pre&gt;
glpsol --model examples/tsp.mod --log tsp.log
&lt;/pre&gt;

Programmers using the GLPK API can enable and disable terminal output by calling &lt;tt&gt;glp_term_out&lt;/tt&gt;. The hook function &lt;tt&gt;glp_term_hook&lt;/tt&gt; can be used to intercept terminal output. Finer grain output control is also provided but is not covered here &amp;mdash; consult the GLPK API manual instead.

== Scaling output ==

Scaling is the process of applying linear transformations to the problem constraint
matrix in order to improve its numerical properties.  See the GLPK [[GLPK/Scaling|scaling]]
page for technical details.

GLPK may scale a problem before attempting a solution, unless the modeler has explicitly disabled scaling.
Conversely, the modeler may direct that scaling must occur and can optionally specify which method or methods to apply.
Unfortunately the output to terminal syntax for scaling is not covered in the official documentation.

For instance, calling &lt;tt&gt;glp_scale_prob&lt;/tt&gt; without an explicit method flag on a small MIP problem
gave the following terminal output:

&lt;pre&gt;
Scaling...
 A: min|aij| =  1.000e+00  max|aij| =  8.000e+05  ratio =  8.000e+05
GM: min|aij| =  5.494e-01  max|aij| =  1.820e+00  ratio =  3.312e+00
EQ: min|aij| =  3.096e-01  max|aij| =  1.000e+00  ratio =  3.230e+00
&lt;/pre&gt;

where, in general:
* A indicates the condition of the original constraint matrix, A = (a&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;ij&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;)
* GM indicates that geometric mean scaling occurred
* EQ indicates that equilibration scaling occurred
* 2N indicates that round scale factors to nearest power of two occurred

Note that the problem is first &quot;unscaled&quot; &amp;mdash; meaning that any previous scaling is removed &amp;mdash;  
and then metrics for the original constraint matrix are reported.
This is followed by the results of any scaling methods applied in the order of application. 

If scaling is not required, you should get the message:

&lt;pre&gt;
Scaling...
Problem data seem to be well scaled
&lt;/pre&gt;

In the first example, &lt;tt&gt;GM&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;EQ&lt;/tt&gt; scaling have been applied.
The &lt;tt&gt;min|aij|&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;max|aij|&lt;/tt&gt; indicate the minimum and maximum absolute values of the non-zero elements of A and their &lt;tt&gt;ratio&lt;/tt&gt; is given by simple division.

Scaling is on by default under GLPSOL, but can be explicitly disabled with the &lt;tt&gt;--noscale&lt;/tt&gt; command-line option.

== Simplex output ==

The simplex method output syntax is fully explained in the &quot;Terminal output&quot; subsection of the &lt;tt&gt;glp_simplex&lt;/tt&gt; call documentation in &lt;tt&gt;doc/glpk.pdf&lt;/tt&gt; (for GLPK&amp;nbsp;4.44 this is section&amp;nbsp;2.7.1).

For example, the line:

&lt;pre&gt;
* 1200: obj = 7.860174791e-03 infeas = 2.810e-29 (1)
&lt;/pre&gt;

indicates that due to the asterisk (*) the solver is currently searching for an optimal solution using
the primal simplex, 1200 iterations have been completed, the current objective value is 0.00786, the current sum
of primal or dual infeasibilities is 2.81&amp;times;10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;29&lt;/sup&gt; (near zero), and the current number of fixed basic
variables is 1. 

The asterisk (*) could also be a blank (&amp;nbsp;) meaning that the solver is searching for a primal feasible solution using
the primal simplex or for a dual feasible solution using the dual simplex. Or a pipe (|) meaning that the solver is
searching for an optimal solution using the dual simplex.

== Interior-point output ==

The interior-point output syntax is fully explained in the &quot;Terminal output&quot; subsection of the &lt;tt&gt;glp_interior&lt;/tt&gt; call documentation in &lt;tt&gt;doc/glpk.pdf&lt;/tt&gt; (for GLPK&amp;nbsp;4.44 this is section&amp;nbsp;2.8.1).

For example, the line:

&lt;pre&gt;
19: obj = 5.522746942e+03; rpi = 2.2e-06; rdi = 4.0e-08; gap = 6.7e-03
&lt;/pre&gt;

indicates that 19 iterations have been completed, the current objective value is approximately 5523 (in the case of maximization, the sign is wrong), 
the current relative primal infeasibility is 0.0000022, the current relative dual infeasibility is 0.00000004, and the current primal-dual gap is 0.0067.   

== MIP branch-and-cut output ==

The MIP branch-and-cut output syntax is explained in the &quot;Terminal output&quot; subsection of the &lt;tt&gt;glp_intopt&lt;/tt&gt; call documentation in &lt;tt&gt;doc/glpk.pdf&lt;/tt&gt; (for GLPK&amp;nbsp;4.44 this is section&amp;nbsp;2.9.5).

For example, the line:

&lt;pre&gt;
+ 73068: mip = -5.000000000e-001 &lt;= -2.500000000e-001  50.0% (107; 10024)
&lt;/pre&gt;

indicates that 10024 nodes in the branch-and-bound tree have been rejected
and 107 unexplored nodes remain that could lead to an
improved MIP solution. The best solution to date is &amp;minus;0.50. There can
be no better solution (the LP relaxation) than &amp;minus;0.25, which results
in a gap of 50% (not printed for large values). The routine
&lt;tt&gt;ios_relative_gap&lt;/tt&gt; computes the relative mip gap as

&lt;math&gt;gap = \frac{ \left| best\_mip - best\_bound \right| }{ \left| best\_mip \right| + \epsilon }&lt;/math&gt;

The number of simplex iterations thus far is 73068.
The plus (+) currently has no meaning.

Additional lines of information can occur for the same simplex iteration.  This information is currently undocumented.

== Numerical instability warnings ==

If the basic solution is not primal/dual feasible to within tolerance, one of these warning messages will be displayed:

&lt;pre&gt;
Warning: numerical instability (primal simplex, phase I)
Warning: numerical instability (primal simplex, phase II)
Warning: numerical instability (dual simplex, phase I)
Warning: numerical instability (dual simplex, phase II)
&lt;/pre&gt;

The tolerances are passed to the simplex solver by the structure &lt;tt&gt;glp_smcp&lt;/tt&gt; as fields &lt;tt&gt;tol_bnd&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;tol_dj&lt;/tt&gt;, both of which default to 1.0e-07.  Users are able to modify these tolerances, but should do so only if they fully understand the implications.

These warning are not fatal &amp;mdash; rather they indicate that the solver is about to change its solution strategy and can, in may cases, return a satisfactory solution.
Further technical details are given in the material on [[GLPK/Troubleshooting#Numerical_instability|troubleshooting]].

Such instabilities may be caused by a poorly [[GLPK/Scaling|scaled]] model, for instance, when utilizing an excessive value for M under the big M approach.  Or when round-off errors during automatic model generation produce [[GLPK/Modeling_tips#Close-to-zero_values|close-to-zero]] coefficients.  It is ''strongly recommended'' that the underlying cause of poor scaling is tracked down and fixed.

== Memory management ==
The stand-alone solver GLPSOL checks if all memory blocks are released before deleting the environment. If unreleased memory blocks remain, the following error message is issued:

&lt;pre&gt;
Error: x memory block(s) were lost
&lt;/pre&gt;

This can be an indication of an error from within the GLPK library.  Or it may be caused by a client program calling the non-API function &lt;tt&gt;glp_main&lt;/tt&gt; &amp;mdash; the use of which is strictly discouraged.

== Probable COI editing at [[Rosacea]] pages ==

[[Special:Contributions/99.9.224.63|99.9.224.63]]. There is quite a history here, I suspect. There is a deletion process going for the Websites and Organizations subpage.[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Requests_for_deletion#Rosacea.2FWebsites_and_Organisations], and links like these might be part of the problem. I suspect that this is a very patient user, who will be back.

I am of no strong opinion regarding the inclusion of Dr. Nase's material, but this is a very controversial figure in the field. He uses the title &quot;Dr.&quot; but that's based on a PhD, it seems. He's not a medical doctor, and there are whole web sites dedicated to &quot;exposing&quot; this guy. If the material is going to be included, we need to also include and reference the controversy. This is a medical topic and neutrality is crucial.

In the past, it appears that Dr. Nase or someone has removed material mentioning the controversy. See [[Special:Contributions/Wikimod]]. This was also removed by the IP.

I moved possibly controversial links from the Organization page to the attached Talk page. This IP didn't engage there but effectively reverted me. From [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:Requests_for_deletion&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=1924185], this is Dr. Nase himself. --[[User:Abd|Abd]] ([[User talk:Abd|talk]]) 00:39, 13 September 2010 (UTC)

Something like this should have the full URL displayed.... What we really need are some people involved with or expert in Rosacea that aren't selling something! My position is that COI editors should be strictly kept from any controversial editing of pages required to be neutral, but that they should, if they behave themselves, be protected in contributing to Talk.

== About links here containing terminal / ==

[http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Puzzles/Logic_puzzles/Sudoku/9_by_9&amp;curid=239888&amp;diff=1933590&amp;oldid=1933579&amp;rcid=1895301]. Please 'splain this thing to me. Why are the terminal slashes needed? --[[User:Abd|Abd]] ([[User talk:Abd|talk]]) 02:50, 16 September 2010 (UTC)

:It is a shorthand for subpage links of the current page.  Creating a link with only the subpage portion with beginning and trailing slashes shortens links.  If you wish to give the link a different title than what the subpage title is, you can use regular links as normal (but there's no need to have the / in the link title).  If you wish to point to another subpage of the ''parent'' rather than the ''current'' page, you can use &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[../Subpage name/]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; and if you wish to point to the parent you can use &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[../|Optional link title]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;.  For instance, on this page, I could say &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[User&amp;nbsp;talk:Adrignola/2010|2010]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; ([[User talk:Adrignola/2010|2010]]) or I could simply say &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[/2010/]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; ([[/2010/]]).  In addition to being shorter and easier to read, this syntax provides much of the convenience seen in Wikipedia's linking while still permitting us at Wikibooks to make use of subpages.  If you choose to use the relative links I described above rather than absolute links, it also means a book can be renamed entirely and the internal links within the book will still work as expected with no changes needed. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 12:13, 16 September 2010 (UTC)
::Yeah, I understand about relative links. However, I'm talking about the ''terminal'' slash. It seems to be unnecessary. Would you explain more clearly for me when the terminal slash is needed and when it is not? --[[User:Abd|Abd]] ([[User talk:Abd|talk]]) 18:47, 16 September 2010 (UTC)

::: If I may chime in, without the trailing slash the leading slash will appear in the link, with the trailing slash just the subpage name appears.

== Can I create  a userpage, please? ==

Out of curiosity, I looked at my global contributions across Wikimedia projects. I was surprised to find that I had an edit credited to me on Wikibooks and then discovered it was because an article I had once edited on wikipedia was later moved here.

Having &quot;dewikified&quot; that page I'd like to set up a userpage here but it seems that I can't because the page was deleted before. help, please.[[User:Simon Peter Hughes|Simon Peter Hughes]] ([[User talk:Simon Peter Hughes|talk]]) 16:31, 25 September 2010 (UTC)

== Bookcat Categorization changes ==

Hi there. I notice that every time I create a page, you come along and add a category - when I look at the Diff, it has Bookcat in double braces. Should I just do that and save you the effort? - Is there a template that just has the stuff I'm supposed to put in a page (but am leaving out)? Thx --[[User:Scifipete|Scifipete]] ([[User talk:Scifipete|talk]]) 16:28, 27 September 2010 (UTC)

:Yes, please add that (anywhere on the page) when you make a new page.  It will create a nicely alphabetized index of pages (you can click the link at the bottom to view it).  That's really the only thing that has to be added to all new pages.  Optionally, you may wish to consider using navigation templates in your book (see [[Wikibooks:Templates/Navigation]]) to assist your readers in following the flow of the book. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 16:31, 27 September 2010 (UTC)

== Nothing important but... ==

After reading that RfP thread and the meta thread, I can't help but chuckle. I've always thought that WB is safe from vandalism because of your activity. :) [[User:Kayau|Kayau]] ([[User talk:Kayau|talk]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Emailuser/Kayau|email]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Contributions/Kayau|contribs]]) 09:33, 28 September 2010 (UTC)

:Well, I think about the big picture.  It's not a safe situation if the prevention of vandalism is heavily reliant on one person.  This also motivated the implementation of the edit filter, to at least eliminate some of it without human intervention. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 12:36, 28 September 2010 (UTC)
== dont delete todo-categorys ==

Todo-categorys have also empty a sense. That means, all tasks are done. But it would be possible that in the future further tasks follow. Please ponder in the future when you delete a project-category. Greeting from Germany --[[User:Mjchael|Mjchael]] ([[User talk:Mjchael|talk]]) 09:40, 24 September 2010 (UTC)

:In the same way the lack of a to-do category can indicate tasks are done. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 12:11, 24 September 2010 (UTC)

::Sorry, you don't understand the usage and meaning of a todo-list. Deleting this category will only make sense if the book is completely finished, or the user explicitly asks for a deletion. Once all the acute tasks are done, is far from saying that the author cant adding new ones. The category contains usually elements  that don't want to be allays create new.

:::You needn't yell about an issue that can be discussed civilly.  What about all the books that aren't complete and don't have this category present?  Hence my previous statement, else it'd be a lot of work to create categories for something that can simply be implicit.  My issue is that a lot of them are not active and no longer have users that would request deletion of the category, once empty, that ''you created''.  Hence I took the initiative on just a couple I noticed when doing maintenance and browsing [[Special:UnusedCategories]].  I see that one was in a book that you predominantly edit and so I should have asked you about that one. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 16:21, 30 September 2010 (UTC)</text>

I believe this user(s) has come to the wrong place. The userpage appears to be a place for private conversations between two or more people.

:[[File:Symbol comment vote.svg|15px]] '''Comment''' The reason for the RfD isn't covered by our deletion policy (and the content also doesn't provide a reason for a deletion).
:Users are not required to conform to the non-enforcible conventions we practices on their user-space (IIRC all guidelines deal with actions in the community namespace).
:In any case I don't see any value in opposing this request, it is up for the user to contest the RfD. To me the RfD permits a discussion, even if in a more general forum that would be required if Kayau was an admin (as it would take place in the user's talkpage). My position is that the practice, would within a discussion, be changed as to conform with the conventional use of that page. But any argument by the user would suffice to for validate the present situation, since the edits can't be said to be abusing the system, in any case I would see a need for any admin acting on the deletion if not opposed, to go a step further as to move the content and merge the edit history to the user's talkpage.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 05:43, 5 August 2010 (UTC)

Amendment: No! That's not true - scripts ''will'' be cached. IIS will launch Perl and load the FCGI module on demand. The module goes into a loop to serve requests. As each request comes in, it calls the appropriate (probably cached) script to handle the request, and then goes idle until the next request arrives}}</text>

How does x/30 &lt; 1/2 lead to x &lt; 2?
x/30 &lt; 1/2 =&gt; x &lt; 30/2 =&gt; x &lt; 15, so maybe this should be something like x/30 &lt; 60? Or am I missing something?

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Chapter VI: The split-up and its consequences===

The application for divorce startes a process that begins with gathering factual information to place before the solicitor. This leads to consultations, and a period of time, [cooling off period] to give space for reflection. Any form of meeting - get-together, or mediation, is useful to help form cooperation, opinions, and hopefully some part, or full agreement … to include discussions about children’s education and financial provision – holiday cover, the resumption of work and pension provision. Another period of time was allowed to pass for further reflection. This initial case appraisal and consultation period may take three months. Marriage Guidance considered, Social services involved and interviews conducted. To obtain a Decree Nici may take a year. 

The divorce trend rises - and has done so since 1910, and the marriage trend declines… Lone parenting and cohabitation have both been on the rise… The national shortage of foster parents worries local authorities. It is a worrying state of affairs. At least fifty percent of all children are from divorced couples and women are more likely to have a number of divorces rather than men – 90% retaining custody of their children. Divorce is expensive, immediately there is less money available… This supports the fear that it is this group – lone parents, suffers most from poverty; the reality is that a high percentage of divorced women receive no child support.

By 1980, operating the Matrimonial Causes Acy of 1973, it was considered fitting, after legal separation [decree nici followed by decree absolute finally legal separation], had been reached – usuall two years, that ‘a clean break’ could be ordered. At any time during the proceedings an application can be made to resolve financial matters. It is only after Decree Nici that a final conclusion can be made, to take effect after Decree Absolute. The Decree Nici is an acceptance by the court that there are grounds for divorce.  This court ruling was based upon the feasibility of the mother carrying on in the family home with financial assistance by the father – to pay the mortage and services, until the youngest child left school at eighteen;  the mother, supplementing his contribution, by paid work. The home eventually to be sold and the expartner paid a percentage – usually twenty percent. There are other permutations but they all achieve a similar ending. A clean break was considered a method whereby both parents were happily provided for. In reality it had to be unfair on one, or other, or both, of the parties. It needed a great deal of financial planning to survive without becoming financially crippling. The absentee father had to be well paid, the mortgage repayments had to be low and the mother’s supplement reasonably high. In many cases the agreement collapsed, resulting from: redundancy, layoffs, strikes, further financial commitments, absenteeism, illness, death. After a Decree Nici has been accepted, and that can only happen when the financial arrangements have been thrashed out, Ancillary Relief is applied for. This in effect is the financial agreement.

The numbers of divorcing couples lead to a social change – a cultural shift; mothers of young children went to work, new relationships were tried, which threatened family security and well-being. Young mothers, ‘put themselves about’, child carers were engaged to take their place, and kindergartens took over pre-school care. In all this child welfare suffered, television watching and video games playing, took the place of family get togethers, and family eating patterns changed. Parenthood took the place of mother or fatherhood. Young mothers lost the art of nurturing and close parenting became a thing of the past. 

The now separated fathers searched to find another partner. They found being on their own lonely and disquieting. Visiting their old home to take out the child brought back too many unhappy memories. The blame culture took on a new meaning for now they felt unwanted and cast aside… seeing a lack of moral duty, permissiveness and behavioral laxity, which historically the father demanded and controlled – as master of the home.

It has been recognized: women adjust quicker to the experience of divorce and register less long-term stress symptoms; are less shy about asking and receiving support; move on to new relationships in a shorter space of time than men; and that working women, whether married or lone parenting, who place their child in kindergartens, during the close period, experience a greater feeling of guilt then men.

Men, react badly to the upset of divorce. They feel lost without the intimacy of women that is close. Suffer immediately: losing income, independence, power, confidence, pride and libido… trying to recount their lost wives giving in to past disagreements. If they fail they quickly become sexually involved again, trying to regain something that has been lost. Those who give support - accepting the situation whilst taking over some of the wife’s responsibilities, devote themselves losing a degree of self esteem and sexual confidence.

The effects of divorce on children are mixed. It depends on the age of the child: where in the birth hierarchy they are situated - which relates to the length and quality of their relationship to each of their parents; the build up to the separation of the parents, and eventual divorce; the effects separation and divorce has on the parents - that dictates the amount of quality time they can spend on each child; the sex of the child. Young boys become vindictive, angry and hurt, losing concentration, motivation and energy. Young girls not only lose concentration become depressed, unfocused, and lack confidence… lose their appetite, have disturbed sleep patterns and suffer from headaches. The children over sixteen are not consulted as to which partner they will go with – they are considered old enough to make their own choice. Those who are under ten are considered too young to make a reasoned choice. It is the oldest child under seventeen [School age] that is asked to make a decision as to which parent they, or the younger children, should go with. The pressure on that child is not only unbearable but ever lasting.   

By far the greatest problem for family counsellors’ is ‘trying to describe to the parents how their actions are going to affects their children’s lives forever!’ It is all very well having the parents accept their errors, many years down the line - the damage by that time has been done. It is the Childs initial shaping by ‘good parenting’, which will stand both the child and its parents in good stead. At the core of that good parenting does discipline – by the child knowing ‘what is right and wrong’ behaviour? Society should exhibit and channel good behaviour in its workings, which unfortunately it conspicuously fails to do. So that in the end the parent has to be, even more, insistent upon good ethical behaviour prescribed in religious texts.       

 It was considered sensible to accept the application of divorce as enough proof that a marriage was irretrievably broken down, and that any question of why it had broken down and when was immaterial. If the application and acceptance of the divorce produced satisfaction and happiness for all parties, including any children, then that was a reasonable assumption. Unfortunately that was far from the truth. There must be very few divorces that occur when all the parties are happy especially where children are concerned.
 
Fixing the blame might require a lot of detective work. But if blame can be laid at the door of one or other, or indeed both, it makes a simple conclusion so much easier to arrive at. Responsibility and culpability does focus the mind. The object is to make people stop and think – that if they continue they will be the loser, which is only fair and just. It is not a case of preventing bad marriages or making a farce, less of a joke – or being reasonable and true. It is to allow both parties to move on. Glossing over irresponsibility, lack of commitment and blameworthiness is unreasonable and does lead to non-closure and injustice. It is also true that it is sometimes impossible to point the finger at one or other, both being at fault, each accepting they had both made mistakes. However, there are cases of human behaviour which do lead to a marriage breakdown – where the fault is obvious. 

Allotting blame directs society towards acceptable behaviour… Discovering the truth gives credence to a higher code. Society should fix moral stand points; irresponsible behaviour should be exposed for both set standards. Married couples should stand solidly behind vows made… for lifetime commitments support responsible and resolute behaviour. Fathers can then get on and provide security searching out the job market to give longer lasting work opportunities. Mothers can provide proper nurturing of young children and be at home, when the children return from school. The children will benefit from a more stable home life, safe in the knowledge that their parents are behind their every thought, word and deed… so the family can go forward and plan years ahead.

A set of ‘marriage statements’, [[ The class society ]] mutually listed and agreed upon, can save many disagreements later on. The subjects can be complicated and far reaching; the object being to cover as many hopes and fears each partner holds. There is no reason why a statement cannot be updated as and when further subjects are pin pointed. If society upholds a set of rules by giving rewards – a tax allowance, then it should legislate to punish deviant behaviour by the guilty party. If these rules are clear couples will be far more questioning and want to know how strongly each is prepared to be committed to their vows. In the event of a marriage breaking down the statement can be produced to give the court guidance.

Divorce harms everyone especially the non guilty party and the children. It does so in every way, both before and after the event. To think otherwise is not facing the truth. That is why it is so essential that before marriage every scenario in life is covered. [[ The class society ]] Now that we are committed to giving a reason why the marriage has failed and naming who is not abiding by their vows and promises we can seek a way forward. The family needs to be housed, the equal ‘division of assets’ legally drawn up and enforced - to give each partner a dwelling - with their own front door. Either party then can decide whether to sell separately, at some future date. Here are four methods:
 
1. The house split, to form a maisonette: build a new permanent set of external steps, by, breaking through the external wall - at an upper level; create a new entrance – to form an upstairs flat. A new top floor kitchen designed, creating a self contained dwelling space. 

2. By retaining the exiting front door, create a lobby - by studding. Cut out two entrances, one to the existing stairs, and the other to the existing ground floor rooms. Build a new ground-floor, bathroom extension. 

3. Retain the existing front door to service a new ground floor flat. Open up a second front door in the outer wall to access the exiting staircase, create a new studded partition - to isolate the stairs. Build on a new ground-floor bathroom extension.

4. Build a new front porch, to act as an entrance lobby - to access a ground floor, and upper floor, flat. Cut out a new front door next to the existing. Partition off the inside to form two entrances, build a new kitchen to the top floor flat and a new bathroom extension to the lower – ground floor flat.

This arrangement allows the children to be accommodated by either parent when convenient. This form of parental stewardship allows shared parenting across households, giving the children a chance to thrive whilst giving both partners the chance to live a private life. There should be a lifting of various planning restrictions and planning approval – to allow such divisions, giving each flat its own main services. Any such division agreed by legally splitting the deeds, the lifting of restrictive covenants, and the preparation of new titles. The splitting up of parents and the home causes an immediate drop in income. Keeping both homes places a great burden on both parents this naturally affects the less important financial considerations – extra curricular activities, meals out, frequent hair dressing, holidays, pocket money and hobbies. If the mother is not working very quickly this becomes essential to maintain the standard of living.

The children’s involvement with its departed parent strains the relationship with both parents. However well intentioned at some point there is a comparison of life styles and income. The children try to be non confrontational and fit into the new arrangement but unexpected happenings – colds, injuries, school activities and diary obligations tend to get in the way. If one or either parents take on stepchildren there is always a degree of comparison – the parent gives extra consideration and treats to strike up a friendly atmosphere. Giving everyone the space to become adjusted to the new arrangement is essential. This does not necessarily mean each child has their own room, although that is to be preferred, but it does mean, more consideration has to be made. Children are alive to playing one parent off against another to procure extra pocket money or treats. Emotional blackmail is even more undermining and upsetting especially as the child gets older. Gradually the relationship falls apart and each party tucks their resentments further back in their consciousness until such times when it raises its head again – in times of stress.

There is absolutely no doubt that parents are only too well aware that what they are doing is wrong. That they are acting out their own weaknesses and faults. The children’s well being is the most important consideration and nothing should come before it. However, we are dealing with human being who cannot rise above their own selfishness and feel they must come first in all things. There is a certain amount of wanting the status quo to continue to give everyone a chance to review this new situation which might evolve to suggest a better way out - where all will be satisfied. That is an almost impossible hope. As soon as the innocent party is confronted with their partners changed desires the marriage is all but over. From that moment on any attempt to recover lost ground is tripped up by the slightest reversal – telephone call, mail card, child’s ill-considered remark and neighbour’s nosiness. Later on in life the guilty party finally accepts they were at fault which unfortunately might make them feel better but the hurt lives on with their children.

All human beings are resentful. It is a simple statement to make, but true. It maybe that you, as the eldest, are expected to look after your siblings, or you may be the second son and see all the effort being directed towards your elder brother or that you are being compared to that little horror in the next road. The list is endless… in normal circumstances these comparisons and gripes are easily absorbed and masked by everyday events. 

There has been much written on letting such feelings go, to look on the positive side, whatever that is, or that you should not feel guilty. Such thoughts really do not cast aside, cover over or correct the hurt. Time too doesn’t always prove to be the healer. What is needed is a more lighthearted view of the instance which has caused the bad memory. It is amazing how even the most applauded; endowed and blessed person can hold grudges, usually based on perceived lack of attention and support in their early stages of life. Some individuals are loath to grant concessions for another’s humanity – weaknesses and tardy behaviour… as if they are perfect or not capable of a similar weakness.  
Age grants knowledge and experience. No-one is perfect and we all suffer from ill chosen words false promises and forgotten dates. Having children guarantees that you are going to be in the firing line and that at moments of stress and anger you are going to get it in the neck. Although this is of little comfort in time everyone comes to the conclusion that ones parents were not so bad after all. Hopefully that realization comes about sooner rather than later and that you are still alive to see the day when it does!

Like all parents you want the best for your child and at first you have the confidence, strength and fortitude to make that dream come true. Unfortunately you are only human and wake up to reality. The world is not a simple place paving the way for you and yours but caters for many others all clamoring for a slice of the action! Many parents consider that they should introduce their child to the sports field to keep them fit and healthy able to cope with success and failure; integrated with fellow team members achieving a similar goal all pulling together eventually becoming friends for life.

Children need a common goal that has at the end a reward. Achieving that prize accords attention and respect. Sports whether on the field, track or field requires coordination, quick reactions and strength. We know that practice makes perfection and practice needs dedication. Both of these goals stand us all in good stead. Physical fitness makes a person confident, makes people alert and aware of all about them; reduces illnesses and prevents depression. However, like all human endeavors care must be taken to see that too much emphasis is not laid on having to win, for not everyone can stand on the rostrum, there has always to be a loser and if you keep on losing you could give up and admit failure.

So the wise parent keeps a wary eye on their child’s chances of success, channeling their offspring to a particular skill where they can succeed and become fulfilled. There is much to commend teaching craft skills that teach survival; constructing toys and games that need knowledge of operating hand tools and everyday materials. Having knowledge of the local fauna and flora – being able to recognize wild flowers and being able to identify a particular beetle. Joining a local rambling club or natural history or geographical group is a good way to advance knowledge of the local wild life and terrain. Climbing, walking, exploring and map reading are all good outdoor pastimes.

You do not have to be the toughest nor the most aggressive to have a fine circle of friends. But you do have to be interesting, knowledgeable and alert. Being the most popular child on the block because you are thoughtful, kind and considerate is a fine goal and you will most certainly have a far more fulfilled life. To be fit and healthy in mind and body is the aim… that you are able to become complete - as a happy individual, is the prize.

Increasingly parents are of mixed nationalities. In the event of the family being split-up - through separation or divorce, one or more children may wish to live with either one of the parents - who live aboard. In the normal course of events, it is frowned on for families to be split, if it is possible to keep them together; in this instance, it maybe more sensible to allow the children to live apart. In most custody arrangements, particularly in the past, it was though more in keeping for the younger children to live with their mother. Fortunately, it is becoming recognized that past practices were often at fault – that fathers were, in many cases, far better custodians. Now it is believe that young children many be better served by living with their custodian abroad – in the parent’s home country. As with many family disputes - involving children, the sensible course of action is not always the one chosen. But as a rule, it is far better to keep all options open and not allow either parent to believe one arrangement is for life. Situations change, opinions differ, and people forget. Keeping up a line of communication must be the right course of action...

Social Engineering refers to ‘the active manipulation of individuals, by national and local government agencies, to improve their education and training; this generally focuses on the poor, underprivileged and handicapped – to raise their expectations and social class level. All education and training establishments set out to accomplish this goal. Social engineering’s prime aim is to change society: to improve the chances of women, to actively recruit more comprehensive students into Oxbridge, to achieve at least five good ‘O’ levels for each child, to raise the quality of life for the majority. The government now includes: helping the unemployed to move to areas where there is work… giving tax incentives to businesses to move to areas of high unemployment.

Life expectancy is greater for the rich. This statement is not necessarily obvious because if compared to a family living ‘the good life’ the rich may overindulge. Nevertheless, the rich may include those blessed with greater common sense to work out for themselves what is likely to improve their life chances. The increase of people living longer is attributable ‘to that person’s life style’ – fitness, diet, food nutrition, choices, environment, abstentions, mental stimulation and education; above all maybe the will to live longer. If the state believes rising expectations is good then it will concentrate on, ‘the improvement in all young children’s education’. If they further believe in the worthwhileness of social engineering they will plough even more money into infant schools. As a first step the necessary teachers need to be selected and trained, class sized reduced, and infant school facilities improved.

The cost of the government’s decision will be born by the present rich, and they are no different from those of past ages. Those who have more wished to keep it and to add to it. It is not in the personal interests of the rich to spread largess – they will lose power, influence, prestige and position – the poor will demand more, will not work, consider themselves easily satisfied. To meet the desired aim: ‘to help more of the lower class into a higher class’ the sought for improved education must include ‘personal responsibility’ as a highly desirable prerequisite to social advancement. 
 
When researching this work - reading the experiences of others - their separations and final divorce, it remains difficult to suggest better solutions for an age old problem. The difficulties arise, as in all marriages; along way after reasonable discourse is possible. Positions are rigidly held, resentments harbored and fostered, and opinions shouted from the rooftops. Any sensible mediation is impossible until each party genuinely apologizes to the other for mistakes made [1996 Family Law Act [7] Informal meetings]. If a third party is involved who is part of the reason why the marriage has broken down the remaining partner is facing separation and loneliness whilst coping with shattered dreams and  destroyed plans… it is not always the case that the guilty party walks away, they maybe in daily contact, rubbing salt in the open wounds. The mental stress having to pick up the pieces and start again when energy levels and perhaps health not so good compounds the situation.

What is good for the children is used as an excuse to try and find a quick solution. This is obviously the wrong approach. One or other of the parents is still likely to be involved with their children’s care. If unhappy, stressed and momentarily mentally incapable, nothing is going to be done, of a satisfactorily long term nature, until that problem is resolved. Children are far more likely to come through the trauma of divorce if their parents are properly housed and comforted - capable of giving them shelter, even though it maybe only for a  short-term arrangement. Many unsatisfactory marriages start when the couples see each other walk down the aisle. They question themselves what their motives are and if the right ones. Some divorce courts are right to seek who was at fault, especially when there are children involved – and the more children involved the larger the fault. The same applies if the marriage has lasted a long time. In both these cases a lot of history is involved which makes such decisions difficult to resolve.

It seems that the majority of families have problems bringing up their children… It is their children’s teenage years that are the worst. Though they are traumatic, the six years are fortunately soon over… Those problematic events are profoundly disturbing, and tend to escalate – forming a pattern over many years – until eventually the child becomes an adult… Then the pressures of daily living and forming relationships overshadow adolescent difficulties. For others within this group the problems are ‘of a self destructive nature’ and carry on into and beyond adulthood. Both these two groups, once the problem faced and surmounted, can resurface in times of stress, when they can lash out at friends and family… then, once again, the pressures of daily living pushes the problem to the rear. 
 
Families come in all shapes and sizes and their life is a dynamic process all contained in a structure that can be in turmoil or ordered calm. But whatever, they are intimate and individual…, and even though they are so personal they are based on life lived by thousands throughout the ages – they are not alone and isolated parents but suffering as many others have done before. What can be said is that most problems start when children are young – in early childhood, when the family is going through a period of stress. The unhappiness maybe caused by the parent’s problems and pressures at work, or, other trauma within the extended family. This does not mean that automatically the parents have withdrawn their support, they maybe distracted – have less time, patience, and concern for daily acts of affection… 

The most penetrating of all troubles for the family is separation, absence of a parent, divorce, remarriage, change of school, serious illness, and finally, death. Children and young adult are hugely affected by change of routine – of instability. The greater the estrangement the greater the effect… especially in early teenage years. Mothers, not being near to their child during the ‘close period’ [birth to three] may result in their child becoming demanding in later life… even if fathers take on that role the trend for assertiveness has still been noted.  Fathers not close to the family during early teenage years stimulate - in their child - particularly boys, a protective stance towards their mothers. Girls remember not having the security afforded by close father relationship exhibit distrustfulness towards authority. 
The object of good parenthood is to provide perfect training for life, and that requires a full-time commitment, security and love. When this has been accomplished the child is free from deep seated fears; displays confidence and assuredness, which allows them to feel happy, inquisitive, and relaxed - in the world around them.

Unfortunately, when a marriage breaks down the cause didn’t just happen the day before. In most cases marriages stagger on for months, years and even tens of years. The delay in coming to terms with the disaster cancels out any hope for there might be for reconciliation. A soon as the innocent party hears they are no longer loved – and perhaps the identity of somebody else, the die is cast for a divorce. There is much written about how both parents should consider the feelings of the children. I am afraid that when the first realization strikes home every party considers how they are affected, if they can survive, and will their life ever return to normal. Depending on when the guilty party’s first transgression began, and how soon it was discovered lies how dedicated the innocent party plans their divorce. 

Although all: religions, political parties, and the country’s premier institutions, declare marriage as, ‘the bulwark of social life’ the divorce rate suggests the public’s moral fiber is weak. What do they believe marriage brings to the society other than discordance? Government policy is directed to support marriage [the procreation of children] yet its lawyers assist marriages to end. My belief is that if society feels marriage is an important institution it should make the marriage state harder to enter and one way of doing that is to ensure couples fully understand, support and abide by their jointly held beliefs – a declared [amended at regular intervals] written agreement of intent, based on their own desires. Either party who breaks the agreement is at fault - jeopardizes custody and property rights. The Government should support this by statute and tax concessions.  The object is to assist couples to understand each others needs. The guilty party’s needs are the last thing the innocent party is concerned about. When one or other of the parents elects to leave the family home by dint of self preservation -  instances where the person creating the problem stays, causing unrest, unhappiness and disruption…, an effort should be made to separate the two adults, allowing the children to fluctuate between the two - retaining frequent contact. Courts should enforce a division of the estate to bring this about.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Paleo diet is based on assumptions at a fixed point in time (1975) regarding a hunter-gatherer diet. Notably, it seems to assume a high animal-protein intake. Given the current understanding of the prehistoric human diet, does that still ring true? Personally, I think the more natural diet for the human animal is plant-based, and that early mankind occasionally supplemented its diet with meat or eggs as the opportunity arose.

It also might be worth differentiating between climates: e.g. subtropical, with high availability of vegetable-based foods but rapid decomposition, versus ice-age man &quot;hefting spears at woolly mammoths&quot; and possibly being able to keep the meat fresh for some period provided they could defend it from scavengers. In cold climates, humans need a much higher energy intake, and animal fat is a convenient way to get it, but that doesn't make it healthy in the long term. Mankind may have been pushed into consuming animals under duress.

Poverty brings with it the necessity for ridged economies. That is as true today, when we are in another period of depression, as in the previous, in the late twenties. Such historical events have a  prolonged effect on the unemployed. In the main this occures in an industrial societies where the production line is to be found and services industries are gathered. Queues for food and the dole served people mainly in the north. In the south, particularly satilite towns around chief cities, unemployment was less of a problem. House building, building materials, internal decorations, furniture, kitchen equipment and gadgetry kept local workers busy. These suburban hearths and homes were warmed and kept dry for such workers, and their families. This is a tale about a town, house, and family life, on the outskirts of London, close to the Metropolitan railway line. It begins during the mid thirties when the national government was engaged in expansion, after a period of stagnation... there was now a general feeling of optimism. It is late summer...  

As you drive about Britain, you come across public buildings and houses that all have similar architecture. 
The majority of houses were built by a local builder in the then fashionable style of the arts and crafts movement. That they were for workers rather than owners of businesses that kept elaborate brick and plasterwork to a minimum. But they still boasted stained glass, dado lines and panelled doors. The nineteen-thirties building style was recognisable by the use of brick and tile, gabled roofs, roughcast walls, tile hung bays, suspended floors and symmetrical metal windows. The front gardens were small, bordered by a privet hedge and divided by a narrow side entrance - leading to a back garden. There are similar houses all around England built to a particular standard of design and quality, all about the same time.

There was nothing wrong with it… for once the trees and gardens planted the formality was rather charming… There was almost a set style of garden which was prevalent at that time: well trimmed privet hedge, mixed flower borders, and a standard rose, ringed by grass. There were no cars, so there was no need for a garage, and certainly not, a concreted drive. Telegraph poles were just about to be raised; lines strung, and ordered telephones installed. This was no depressed environment but a well designed, new, and ordered, living space…

This dormitory town, for that is what it was - having no factories or large offices, relied on the railways and buses to ferry the working population to the nearest main town and beyond… London being only twenty minutes away. The town’s wide pavements – fronting the shops, provided a feeling of light and space, whilst the classically styled, imitation marble-walled Embassy cinema, one of the Associated British Cinema [ABC] chain… reserved for itself the role of premier landmark. The banks on each corner of the cross-roads gave   citizens a feeling of stability, permanence, and trust.

In Britain, the years between 1935 and 1939 were considered ‘the calm before the storm’. Travellers, holidaymakers and businessmen, who went to Europe, came back with tales - describing Germany as being prepared for expansion both militarily and industrially, with a population indoctrinated to consider others, not Germanic, as inferior. The British government did not discuss or predict their feelings, of ‘troubles to come’… nor was it forcefully spoken of, or written about - by the media… at least, not sufficient to raise the alarm or disturb the peace.

The political and social atmosphere was one of dignified calm – of people trying to get on with life. No new building work was going on - for the land had already been totally developed, except the local farmland still there today - that provided local dairy produce. Neither the leading citizens nor local government agencies gave any indication what was imminent… peace reigned in a vacuum… Cricket was being played at Lords, where Middlesex harboured great expectations. No aircraft could be heard overhead and London’s airport never mentioned. Northolt still had biplanes taking off and landing and Brooklands still held motor racing. Fathers’ walked with furled umbrella, or walking stick, wearing a jacket and tie. Mothers’ pushed coach built prams with sunshades, children wore school uniform, including caps, policeman patrolled on foot, and errand boys delivered goods - on bikes. Children skipped and collected cigarette cards…, and football became the national sport - relegating cricket to second place. Lord Reith, the Managing Director of British Radio, demanded absolute decorum; parks, recreation grounds, bowling greens, and council gardens competed with each other to see who could cultivate the neatest lawns and plant the most colourful flowerbeds.

This sleeper town was no different from many other Boroughs throughout Britain. Office workers, tradesmen, skilled workers and hospital staff were expected to work to a high standard and most were proud of the quality of their work. Every trade skill was taught through an apprenticeship system, which had not long been reduced from seven years to five. Journeymen were justifiably proud when finishing their training and stoutly defended any erosion of their place in their trade or wider society. Girls were not apprenticed, taught industrial skills, worked on building sites, or drove cars. Mothers did not work full or part-time, but stayed at home; at least until the youngest child went to junior school, then they worked in shops, went back into nursing and teaching, or took a cleaning job. 
 
The town’s citizens, although living in up-to-date houses, observed turn of the century attitudes. Boy Scouts and Cubs, Girl Guides and Brownies were the centrepiece of many children’s lives. Some older boys joined one of the cadet corps. Shops were shut on Sundays and Wednesday afternoons, attendance at church was normal for about fifty per-cent of the population, attending at least one service during Sunday. Most young children went to Sunday school. Shops opened at eight and closed at five - during the weekdays… on Thursdays and Saturdays stayed open an hour later. There was no poverty; all the children were well dressed, keeping aside special clothes for Sundays. I do not remember any rowdiness or drunken brawls. Teashops were popular and cakes and sandwiches formed the basis of afternoon teas. There was no Hire Purchase and personal saving the only way to pay the bills. Jumble Sales a regular feature and Tea Dances a popular afternoon event.

Much was made of The British Empire. The newsreel camera showed the Royal Family maintaining a ridged schedule of familiar appointments. The National Anthem was played at every performance at the cinema, theatre and concert, and at most public meetings – everyone stood, and those in uniform saluted. The National Flag was hoisted at every big occasion. Each of the Armed Services was seen as saviours and protectors of every country of the Empire. Explorers, Generals, Colonists and Missionaries were written about and applauded. Newspapers, books, and magazines promoted The Empire’s people, produce, and position. Churches collected for The Empire’s poor, and prayed for the continuance of the Monarchy, The Colonial system, and the government. The country’s laws, institutions, businesses, and educational system were organized to continue its growth and wealth… The Empire was a very important part of the country’s way of life… you were always made aware of it by all forms of indoctrination. This was not by official propaganda but part of a proud culture.

The Metropolitan railway, laid down the previous century, had new houses built surrounding the line  starting where the old Edwardian style had left off - at Edgware Road and Willesden. New housing sprung up in the twenties and thirties. Previously it had been farmland… now transformed into The Greater London sprawl. It linked up all the little villages and hamlets along the line… it just needed more schools and other institutions, to convert each area into new town status. By the time the plan completed, between 1928 and 1933, the European situation directed the government to reallocate the country’s resources towards rearmament and shipbuilding. Serious house building had to wait twenty-five years until it started again in Chesham. By 1960, there was another enormous shortage of first time buyer’s homes.

Germanic military expansion was threatening, sufficient to galvanise the government into building-up the depleted armed forces, and place orders for military equipment. Even after this awakening, Britain was still poorly defended – it’s Military woefully inadequate and badly trained… tactics and procedure based on lessons learned during the first part of the First World War. The Indian Army and Overseas Detachments were in being to show force – military strength - to help the civilian authorities hold the peace. The military establishment was rigidly structured based on the class system not on merit.

Unemployment in, 1935-50, and for the following twenty years, was not an issue. ‘The German Attitude’… created a series of incidences which lead to Chamberlain’s 11.15 a.m. radio announcement - on Sunday the 3rd September 1939 -, which took the country into war. Chamberlain voice, a rather high, brittle voice, with clipped intonation…, created a rather theatrical performance – as though, expecting a cheer!France announced they were to be at war with Germany that afternoon, as did the Australian and New Zealand governments. South Africa announced their intentions three days later and Canada followed within the week. As all this was going on, the inhabitants, continued their lives as if nothing untoward was happening.

On the continent, British troops advanced through France to Lille - near the Belgium frontier. They dug defences, then advanced - leaving their prepared positions… then fell back…, never to fully recover. The army was unfit for war, inadequately equipped, carrying outdated weapons, and adopting inept tactics, in a doomed campaign. By the end of the following May the British Army was in full retreat… to the coast, and Dunkirk - to re-embark and be shipped back home… It was thought by the populace, an act of providence – like the river Jordan parting. In fact, it demonstrated an almost total ineptitude brought on by thoughtlessness and ignorance, exhibited by most of the political and military elite. It took almost four years to recover… then the outcome was inevitable… however, by that time, Britain was in debt to America, never to regain its premier position.
 
That autumn, the town was a  place with pride…, that grew out of the thirties hardships, linking the old towns with the new. Its design showed off town planning at its very best with accommodation for all pockets and services to match. Many of the roads had pavements fringed by a grass verge… A crab apple or almond tree was planted outside each house, gave a pink haze - to the tree’s canopy, in spring. The whole described poetically by John Betjeman as Metroland, a term applauding suburban planning. Householders competed with each other to see who could produce the best verge and neatest front garden.

The scene - presented to the interested onlooker, was one of orderliness, neatness, and tranquillity… essential requirements for lower middle-class life. Because newly built, the pavements, roads and buildings were clean and undamaged - in pristine order – no cracked paving slabs, discarded litter, or graffiti. The town was exactly as designed with no extensions, garages, conservatories, replaced windows, or doors. Its citizens assumed the conventions of studied politeness – hats were raised to friends and neighbours and audiences stood for the National Anthem.

There was no frenzied traffic passing, no pollution, or noise. Many bikes were ridden, the horse and cart a means of delivery… prams abounded, and children held hands. Compared to today’s picture those times were quite charming… the likes, never to be seen again. It was quiet, with few people about – those that are are hurrying home. It was the lack of road traffic, the emptiness of the pavements and the quietness that dictates the difference from today’s… it was almost a rural atmosphere.

The railway bridge, of riveted steel, spans the main road , casting a shadow on the local hotel. The railway station had two entrances each with a bank of telephone kiosks. The ticket office displayed the tickets in racked, serried ranks, drawn upon the counter ready to be punched. Access to the platforms was made through the barrier, up the stairs, out onto the raised platform - next to the waiting rooms. Bright advertising posters, hand drawn and printed by the lithographic process, heralded Brighton and Seaton as being everyone’s dream location for a holiday. The London underground map flanked by the ‘up and down line’ timetables framed on the platform and waiting room walls.

The town’s banks - railings and porticoes, faced in Portland stone, stationed impressively on the crossroads. Their solid respectability made a good impression on visitors and townspeople alike. Many of the shops had countrywide names: Express Dairy, United Dairies, Dewhurst’s, Home &amp; Colonial, Maynard’s, Cullen’s, Mac Fisheries, Boots, W. H. Smith, Woolworths, Cooper’s, and the Watford Co-op. The local dance studio operated from the large room over the Co-operative Department Store. The dance teacher taught ballroom, Latin American, and old time dancing. Previously this large room had been a snooker hall and in common with many became obsolete - giving way to more profitable pastimes. 

The car showroom, laid out under the distinctive clock tower. The large plate glass, sliding doors, separated off the public from the lucky few who could buy the latest models. Cars, what few there were, serviced at the rear - next to the petrol pumps, their fuel pipes attached to swinging arms that carried the contents to the roadside. In 1939, there were nearly two million cars on the road, one for every twenty-five members of the population. The cheapest car could be bought for just over a hundred pounds.

The nearest local National School was built in 1841 at the bottom of the High Street – on the corner behind the signpost opposite the photographers. This was a development of The Church of England’s interest in promoting education for religious purposes. This took the form of The National Society for Promoting the Education of the poor in the Principles of the Established Church in 1811 to grant sufficient money to open up the Pinner Sunday School five years later. In 1833 the government enquiry into education for the poor lead to a series of grants to regularize religious involvement. This was the first nationally organized involvement, which lead to The National School being granted land by the lord of the manor, maintained by the school fee of a penny and voluntary contribution. Ten years later, at the time of The Great Exhibition, the school catered for 190 pupils. A much larger school was built in 1867 with five rooms in School Lane, becoming a  National School. [In 1950, this school building became the overspill for the local Secondary School. The Education Act of 1880 made school attendance compulsory. In October 1891 lessons at the infant school was free, though the upper schoolchildren were charged 1d per pupil. The National School continued servicing the local children’s education for a further forty years when the influx of children from the new estates demanded more accommodation. 

The local Primary and Junior School, housed in one building, was built a the same time as the surrounding houses in typical thirties style, of brick, with a flat roof, concrete cills, and metal framed windows. It educated about a hundred and fifty primary children and about the same for juniors; staffed by ten teachers, a headmistress, secretary, and caretaker. The playground asphalted and marked out for netball, relieved by a shrubbery on two sides. The headmistress banned the sports field for breaks - except for the annual sports day, because children became far too dirty - even in summer…, a chain-link fence circled the school’s boundary separating the school from its surroundings. Children seldom played truant, although there was always the odd boy who did - and got away with it. The School Board’s Inspector peddled round the roads on his bike to catch out those unwary children - trying to evade being caught.

As in most towns there was provision for the aspiring parent and rich citizen for private education. These facilities distanced their children from the rest of society – the parents in effect chose social exclusion… The school fees: bought better academic and sports facilities, discipline, compulsory homework engendered higher social expectations. The parents believed that it was worth the financial sacrifice to buy privilege, reinforcing the schools curriculum by ensuring that their child mixed with children of similar minded folk.

During the day, the shops and pavements were the preserve of women – mothers - pushing prams, shopping and meeting neighbours. It came to life when children came out of school, and again, later, when the trains delivered men from work. There were no nearby factories, and the frequent question, ‘where are all the men’ received the time honoured reply, “Gone up to town - it was mainly a white collar community commuting to London.

To buy school clothes and up-market wear the citizens had to travel to the nearest large town or visit London. This applied to all household linen; items arranged in countless drawers behind glass-topped counters with recessed brass measures screwed to the working surface. The cashier sat in an enclosed glazed box taking the money then sending the bill and money to the back of the shop using a brass tally chain or pneumatic tube. Change and a receipt came back the same way. Shoes were the only item bought locally - being needed at frequent intervals. When new, the soles were covered in steel studs or blakies, which made a crunching noise – like a soldier marching – that sent, sparks flying, when sliding on the pavement… Shops stayed open late on Saturdays and Thursdays, with half days open on Wednesdays. The town was built as a dwelling place for commuters using public transport.

    <title>XQuery/Using Triggers to assign identifiers</title>
    <ns>0</ns>

      </contributor>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You want to automagically assign unique identifiers to all new incoming documents or XML nodes:
no matter if they are created from a controller that you scripted,
if they are resulting from an HTTP PUT operation in a REST call,
if they are the product of a webdav COPY operation,
or uploaded from the java admin RPC client.

== Method ==
We will create a trigger that will fire on all document store operations.
The trigger will modify the document to be stored in the database.
Our identifier will be taken from the output of the util:uuid() function.
A simple assignment will do due diligence. No special authority, such as an incremental counter, will be necessary.

== System Configuration ==

This example assumes that the documents that you want to tag with identifiers live below '''/db/my-collection'''.
eXist triggers are declared in a configuration file that is placed in the /db/system/config area with the above path added to it.
Such a file with the relevant lines will look like this:

&lt;code&gt;/db/system/config/db/my-collection/collection.xconf&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;collection xmlns=&quot;http://exist-db.org/collection-config/1.0&quot;&gt;
  &lt;triggers&gt;
    &lt;trigger event=&quot;store&quot; class=&quot;org.exist.collections.triggers.XQueryTrigger&quot;&gt;
       &lt;parameter name=&quot;url&quot; value=&quot;xmldb:exist://localhost/db/triggers/assign-id.xq&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/trigger&gt;
  &lt;/triggers&gt;
&lt;/collection&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

Now every time a store or update event happens to this collection the XQuery script '''/db/triggers/assign-id.xq''' gets run.

Beware! You cannot, due to limitations of current (&lt;=1.5dev) design, attach more than one xquery script to the same trigger event. Only the trigger declared last for an event will be used.

== XQuery Script ==

The script will add the ''uuid'' as an attribute to the ''root'' element of the incoming document,
overwriting any uuid attribute that is already there.

&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;NOTE: These examples do not work reliably: As soon as your xquery causes exceptions in the thread that it runs in, then there is a great chance, that it will hang indefinitely, eg. if you store a binary resource below the path it works on. Further operations on the processed resource then will NOT trigger the script until a restart of the whole database.&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
xquery version &quot;1.0&quot;;

(:
  An XQueryTrigger that
  adds a uuid to all documents
  when they are stored in the database.
:)

declare namespace util=&quot;http://exist-db.org/xquery/util&quot;;

declare variable $local:triggerEvent external;
declare variable $local:eventType external;
declare variable $local:collectionName external;
declare variable $local:documentName external;
declare variable $local:document external;

declare variable $local:coll := &quot;/db/my-collection&quot;;
declare variable $local:uuid := string($local:document/@uuid);
declare variable $local:match := collection($local:coll)/*[@uuid = $local:uuid];

(:
  This is still the xquery prolog:
  from my experiments, an xquery trigger MUST NOT hava an xquery body.
  A severe limit: no conditionals allowed, just straight procedural action.
:)

util:log('debug', '### assign-id.xq trigger fired ###'),

update insert attribute {'uuid'} {util:uuid()} into doc($local:documentName)/*,

util:log('debug', '### assign-id.xq trigger done ###')

&lt;/source&gt;

Hi, I am especially active on my home wiki, the Dutch Wikipedia. I edit sporadicly articles on the English, Afrikaans and French Wikipedia. Sometimes you can find me on global projects like Meta and Commons.

I live in the southern part of the Netherlands, near the Dutch city of [[m:w:en:Heerlen|Heerlen]]. I am interested in languages, sports, computers, the Internet and several other things. In real life I am a copywriter, a student and a supporter of the [[m:w:en:Eredivisie|Eredivisie]] club [[m:w:en:Roda JC|Roda JC Kerkrade]]. 

If you want to contact me, you can leave a message on this wiki. For &quot;emergencies&quot;, it probably works faster to leave a message on my [[m:w:nl:User talk:Velocitas|Dutch talk page]]. Thanks in advance!</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">This tutorial will guide you through basics of [http://www.sourceafis.org/blog/ SourceAFIS]. It doesn't provide full source code listing - look into sample application bundled in the distribution for complete compilable sources. Focus here is on SourceAFIS-specific topics. General information about fingerprint matching is available from external sources linked from this tutorial.

== Fingerprint Capture ==
To work with [[w:Fingerprint|fingerprint images]], one needs to obtain them somehow. SourceAFIS has no built-in methods to capture fingerprints. Capture is generally done with specialized livescan  [[w:Fingerprint#Fingerprint capture and detection|fingerprint readers]]. Fingerprint reader is accessed through image acquisition [[w:Software development kit|SDK]] that can be obtained from device manufacturer. Make sure your fingerprint reader allows you to retrieve fingerprint ''image'', not some vendor-specific ''template''. Other capture methods are possible, for example scanning ink fingerprints or taking [[w:Fingerprint#Latent prints|latent prints]] from crime scene. Whatever the method, you end up with a fingerprint image in some standard format (e.g. BMP, JPEG) or with raw grayscale image. All common image formats can be used in SourceAFIS.

== SourceAFIS Setup ==
Before using SourceAFIS functionality, you have to do a few simple setup steps. First, download latest SourceAFIS release from [http://sourceforge.net/projects/sourceafis/files/ SourceForge download area] and install it. Open your application in your preferred development environment (Visual Studio or MonoDevelop) and add ''SourceAFIS.dll'' to [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/wkze6zky%28VS.80%29.aspx references] for your application. Open source file where you want to call SourceAFIS methods and add [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/sf0df423%28v=VS.80%29.aspx using directive] for [http://www.sourceafis.org/documentation/html/N_SourceAFIS_Simple.htm SourceAFIS.Simple] namespace:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
using SourceAFIS.Simple;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Create new [http://www.sourceafis.org/documentation/html/T_SourceAFIS_Simple_AfisEngine.htm AfisEngine] object and store it somewhere so that it can be accessed by all code in your application. It is OK to create multiple ''AfisEngine'' objects, but for the sake of simplicity and some extra performance, it is recommended to keep only one ''AfisEngine'' in a static variable like this:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
static AfisEngine Afis = new AfisEngine();
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

== Template Extraction ==
Once you have working setup of SourceAFIS and some captured fingerprints, it is time to import them into SourceAFIS. The following example creates three [http://www.sourceafis.org/documentation/html/T_SourceAFIS_Simple_Fingerprint.htm Fingerprint] objects using properties [http://www.sourceafis.org/documentation/html/P_SourceAFIS_Simple_Fingerprint_AsBitmapSource.htm AsBitmapSource], [http://www.sourceafis.org/documentation/html/P_SourceAFIS_Simple_Fingerprint_AsBitmap.htm AsBitmap], and [http://www.sourceafis.org/documentation/html/P_SourceAFIS_Simple_Fingerprint_Image.htm Image] to handle different image formats:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
// using .NET 3.0 (WPF) bitmap
Fingerprint fp1 = new Fingerprint();
fp1.AsBitmapSource = new BitmapImage(new Uri(pathToImage, UriKind.RelativeOrAbsolute));

// using .NET 2.0 (WinForms) bitmap
Fingerprint fp2 = new Fingerprint();
fp2.AsBitmap = new Bitmap(Bitmap.FromFile(pathToImage));

// using raw grayscale image (see API docs for format description)
Fingerprint fp3 = new Fingerprint();
fp3.Image = myRawImage;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

SourceAFIS supports multiple fingerprints per person. If you need only one fingerprint for now, just wrap it in [http://www.sourceafis.org/documentation/html/T_SourceAFIS_Simple_Person.htm Person] object like this:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
Person person = new Person();
person.Fingerprints.Add(fp);
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

SourceAFIS doesn't match fingerprint images directly. It [[w:Feature extraction|extracts]] [[w:Minutiae|minutiae]] from the fingerprint image and stores them in [http://www.technovelgy.com/ct/Technology-Article.asp?ArtNum=90 fingerprint template] that is much smaller and much faster to match than the original image. Here's how to execute the extraction process:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
Afis.Extract(person);
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The extracted template is left in [http://www.sourceafis.org/documentation/html/P_SourceAFIS_Simple_Fingerprint_Template.htm Template] property of the ''Fingerprint'' object. Template extraction is quite time-consuming, taking about 150 milliseconds per fingerprint. It is therefore wise to perform it only once after fingerprint capture and save the template or the whole ''Fingerprint''/''Person'' object in database along with fingerprint image.

== Verification ==
By now, you have captured fingerprint image, extracted fingerprint template, and created [http://www.sourceafis.org/documentation/html/T_SourceAFIS_Simple_Person.htm Person] object with single [http://www.sourceafis.org/documentation/html/T_SourceAFIS_Simple_Fingerprint.htm Fingerprint] in it. This process is repeated for all incoming fingerprints. Now that we have all the templates, how do we match them? Easy, just pass two ''Person'' objects to [http://www.sourceafis.org/documentation/html/M_SourceAFIS_Simple_AfisEngine_Verify_2_ad42c381.htm AfisEngine.Verify] like this:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
float score = Afis.Verify(person1, person2);
bool match = (score &gt; 0);
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

This method performs [http://www.technovelgy.com/ct/Technology-Article.asp?ArtNum=85 one-to-one] (or 1:1 or just verification) [[w:Syntactic pattern recognition|matching]] and returns [http://www.technovelgy.com/ct/Technology-Article.asp?ArtNum=82 similarity score] between the two fingerprints. If the returned similarity score is zero, the fingerprints are distinct. If the score is above zero, the two fingerprints [http://www.technovelgy.com/ct/Technology-Article.asp?ArtNum=82 match] and similarity score reflects accuracy of the match.

== Accuracy ==
Just like any other [[w:Binary classification|classification]] system, SourceAFIS makes [[w:Type I and type II errors|classification errors]] that reduce its [[w:Sensitivity and specificity|accuracy]]. Accuracy is further subdivided into:

* '''FAR''' (false accept rate), also called FMR (false match rate) or [[w:Type I and type II errors#False positive rate|false positive rate]], that measures frequency of [[w:Type I and type II errors#Type I error|false accepts]].
* '''FRR''' (false reject rate), also called FNMR (false non-match rate) or [[w:Type I and type II errors#False negative rate|false negative rate]], that measures frequency of [[w:Type I and type II errors#Type II error|false rejects]].

SourceAFIS allows you to choose application-specific compromise between FAR and FRR by setting [http://www.sourceafis.org/documentation/html/P_SourceAFIS_Simple_AfisEngine_Threshold.htm AfisEngine.Threshold] to appropriate [http://www.technovelgy.com/ct/Technology-Article.asp?ArtNum=98 matching threshold]. This instructs [http://www.sourceafis.org/documentation/html/M_SourceAFIS_Simple_AfisEngine_Verify_2_ad42c381.htm AfisEngine.Verify] to return zero whenever similarity score drops below [http://www.sourceafis.org/documentation/html/P_SourceAFIS_Simple_AfisEngine_Threshold.htm AfisEngine.Threshold]. Higher threshold keeps FAR low. Lower threshold keeps FRR low.

At certain balance threshold, FAR and FRR are equal and they constitute EER (equal error rate). The easiest way to approximate EER is to perform some tests with pairs of matching and non-matching fingerprints, observe typical matching and typical non-matching score, and set threshold somewhere in the middle. You can then proceed to shift the threshold higher or lower depending on preference for FAR or FRR.

Note that SourceAFIS cannot provide standard threshold, because EER occurs at different thresholds depending on fingerprint characteristics like fingerprint reader type, population sampled, and enrollment policy used. More generally speaking, [[w:Receiver operating characteristic|ROC curve]] (plot of FAR and FRR as a function of threshold) is different for every test database used to benchmark SourceAFIS. Nevertheless SourceAFIS does have default value for [http://www.sourceafis.org/documentation/html/P_SourceAFIS_Simple_AfisEngine_Threshold.htm AfisEngine.Threshold] that should work for prototypes and for initial testing of your application.

== Identification ==
Now that you have done some simple [http://www.technovelgy.com/ct/Technology-Article.asp?ArtNum=85 one-to-one verification], it is time to try [http://www.technovelgy.com/ct/Technology-Article.asp?ArtNum=84 one-to-many] (1:N) identification. In order to search whole database of fingerprints, put all [http://www.sourceafis.org/documentation/html/T_SourceAFIS_Simple_Person.htm Person] objects (candidates) into an [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/9eekhta0.aspx enumerable] collection and pass this collection to [http://www.sourceafis.org/documentation/html/M_SourceAFIS_Simple_AfisEngine_Identify_2_8250a68f.htm AfisEngine.Identify] along with probe ''Person'' to look up:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
Person matchingCandidate = Afis.Identify(probePerson, allCandidates).FirstOrDefault();
bool match = (matchingCandidate != null);
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

This is functionally equivalent to the following LINQ query, except that ''AfisEngine.Identify'' is much faster:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
Person matchingCandidate = (from candidate in allCandidates
                            let score = Afis.Verify(probePerson, candidate)
                            where score &gt;= Afis.Threshold
                            orderby score descending
                            select candidate).FirstOrDefault();
bool match = (matchingCandidate != null);
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

''AfisEngine.Identify'' returns candidate from the array that matches the probe. If all candidates are below [http://www.sourceafis.org/documentation/html/P_SourceAFIS_Simple_AfisEngine_Threshold.htm AfisEngine.Threshold], ''AfisEngine.Identify'' returns null. If there are multiple candidates matching above threshold, ''AfisEngine.Identify'' returns the one with highest similarity score.

== Distribution ==
In order to deploy application that uses SourceAFIS, you need to distribute only one file: ''SourceAFIS.dll''. Install ''SourceAFIS.dll'' in the same folder where you install your application's executable. SourceAFIS has no dependencies short of .NET Framework. SourceAFIS doesn't use any system functionality nor unsafe code. It should therefore work in secure environments like ASP.NET or Silverlight.

== Extras ==
Although we have used single fingerprint per person in this tutorial, SourceAFIS supports multi-finger matching for better accuracy. Just add more [http://www.sourceafis.org/documentation/html/T_SourceAFIS_Simple_Fingerprint.htm Fingerprint] objects into every [http://www.sourceafis.org/documentation/html/T_SourceAFIS_Simple_Person.htm Person] object and pass such ''Person'' objects to [http://www.sourceafis.org/documentation/html/M_SourceAFIS_Simple_AfisEngine_Verify_2_ad42c381.htm Verify] or [http://www.sourceafis.org/documentation/html/M_SourceAFIS_Simple_AfisEngine_Identify_2_8250a68f.htm Identify]. You can use [http://www.sourceafis.org/documentation/html/P_SourceAFIS_Simple_Fingerprint_Finger.htm Fingerprint.Finger] property to restrict matching to compatible fingerprint pairs. You can also set [http://www.sourceafis.org/documentation/html/P_SourceAFIS_Simple_AfisEngine_MinMatches.htm AfisEngine.MinMatches] to control the process of combining scores from individual fingerprints.

SourceAFIS lets you work with sensors of varying DPI by setting [http://www.sourceafis.org/documentation/html/P_SourceAFIS_Simple_AfisEngine_Dpi.htm AfisEngine.Dpi].

[http://www.sourceafis.org/documentation/html/T_SourceAFIS_Simple_Person.htm Person] and [http://www.sourceafis.org/documentation/html/T_SourceAFIS_Simple_Fingerprint.htm Fingerprint] classes support serialization in binary streams and in XML. You can also serialize individual templates by accessing properties [http://www.sourceafis.org/documentation/html/P_SourceAFIS_Simple_Fingerprint_Template.htm Fingerprint.Template] and [http://www.sourceafis.org/documentation/html/P_SourceAFIS_Simple_Fingerprint_AsXmlTemplate.htm Fingerprint.AsXmlTemplate] for binary and XML encoding respectively. Both classes support inheritance, so that you can add (and serialize) your own fields/properties. SourceAFIS supports export/import of ISO/IEC 19794-2:2005 templates using [http://www.sourceafis.org/documentation/html/P_SourceAFIS_Simple_Fingerprint_AsIsoTemplate.htm Fingerprint.AsIsoTemplate] property.

== Next Steps ==
See the sample bundled in SourceAFIS distribution for runnable application that uses SourceAFIS. Consult [http://www.sourceafis.org/blog/datasheet/ datasheet] and [http://www.sourceafis.org/documentation/html/N_SourceAFIS_Simple.htm API reference] for details on SourceAFIS features. If you still have questions, post them in SourceAFIS [http://sourceforge.net/projects/sourceafis/forums/forum/1051112 forums].

Cross platform application development is a challenging task. Many script languages are designed to run on interpreters that are available for many operating systems. The harbour-project has a different approach. It is capable of compiling native applications for many operating systems like MS-DOS, Windows (32 &amp; 64), Windows CE, Pocket PC, OS/2, GNU/Linux and Mac OS X and you only write one source code. The Harbour Project is a Free Open Source Software effort to build a multiplatform Clipper language compiler.

If you know nothing about harbour, you will get step-by-step instructions and many working code samples that help you get started so you can feel the power

== Note to editors ==   
Right now, this is just a rough draft. Feel free to add as much to this book as you like. If you feel that you do not know enough to contribute, don't worry! Most pages are blank. Just fill them with what you know. It will evolve into something bigger.

Don't be afraid to make mistakes! We will clean up after you. So if your English is not perfect. No problem. Most of the users and developers are not native English-speakers. Just type it in. Others who know better English will edit. 

=== Style of writing ===
Many people who read this book may not be perfect in English. So using simple words is better than complicated words. Short sentences are better than long ones.

Hello Adrignola,

thanks for welcoming me here. I noticed, you already fixed my category and did the settings, I was trying to do. Thank you for helping me. I read on your profile, that you should be watching this page, so you should read this message.

As you can see, I still have a lot to learn and so will the other people from the harbour-project, who will hopefully join me in this ambitious project.

==Copy &amp; Paste from Wikipedia==

Hello, please don't copy and paste content from other Wikimedia projects. Instead request an [[Wikibooks:Requests for import|import]] so the history can be maintained. I have imported [[w:Harbour (software)]] and merged the history this time. Thanks. &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 21:21, 20 September 2010 (UTC)

Thanks for explaining and merging. I did not know that. It is a cool feature. Of course, the text will be edited a lot to fit the scope of wikibooks. [[User:Raumi75|Raumi75]] ([[User talk:Raumi75|talk]]) 06:16, 21 September 2010 (UTC)</text>

== I-20 → Operation BSOD ==

{{renameuser2|1=I-20|2=Operation BSOD}}
* Reason: ''please state a reason''
* '''Wikibooks and MediaWiki.org-specific rename'''
* Reason: I looked in the global account log at Meta and think this will be a cool name :) '''—[[User:I-20|&lt;span style=&quot;color:black&quot;&gt;I-20&lt;/span&gt;]][[User talk:I-20|&lt;span style=&quot;vertical-align:super;&quot;&gt;the highway&lt;/span&gt;]]''' 02:53, 24 July 2010 (UTC)

:This rename will detach your account here from your global account that is present on [http://toolserver.org/~vvv/sulutil.php?user=I-20 all these wikis] and will cause you to not match your account at your home wiki, Wikipedia.

== SUL → Citron ==

{{renameuser2|1=Citron

}}
*目標使用者名稱：{{user|Citron}} 
* Reason：Hello. I'd like to merge this local account with no contributions since it's been registered. I've just merged my fr.wiki account and here's [[:fr:Discussion_utilisateur:Citron#en.wiki_usurp_request|the request on my local wiki]].

:Do I understand correctly that you wish to rename Citron to 目標使用者名稱 and usurp the existing account, or is it the other way around?  The link you gave above goes to a user page for a nonexistent user and I can't see anything in that wiki's rename log to indicate what if anything that user was renamed to. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 22:18, 22 July 2010 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">With PIL you can easily access and change the data stored in the pixels of an image. To get the pixel map, call &lt;tt&gt;load()&lt;/tt&gt; on an image. The pixel data can then be retrieved by indexing the pixel map as an array.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
pixelMap = img.load() #create the pixel map
pixel = pixelMap[0,0] #get the first pixel's value
&lt;/source&gt;

When you change the pixel data, it is changed in the image it came from (since the pixel map is just a reference to the data rather than a copy).

===Example===
[[File:PIL Tutorial - Pixel editing - example.png|thumb|Resultant image]]
The following snippet shows how to change the pixel values in an image based on the index of the pixel:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
import Image

img = Image.new( 'RGB', (255,255), &quot;black&quot;) # create a new black image
pixels = img.load() # create the pixel map

for i in range(img.size[0]):    # for every pixel:
    for j in range(img.size[1]):
        pixels[i,j] = (i, j, 100) # set the colour accordingly

img.show()
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Dear Adrignola,

Re: Suburban hearth and home.

This page describes life in a northwest London home during the period just before and during WWII... a follow on to Suburban Garden Town. It introduces the town, its layout, the street life, but most of all - the goings on inside of the home of a working class family... in the run up period to the war; watching the blitz, the country's eventual victory... and eventual work experience as an artist.--[[User:Terence Kearey|Terence Kearey]] ([[User talk:Terence Kearey|talk]]) 22:22, 15 September 2010 (UTC)</text>

== What is Harbour? ==
Harbour is a modern, high-level, cross-platform computer programming language compiler.

It is a compiler with support for all major platforms. It runs on and creates binaries for DOS, Microsoft Windows, Linux (32 and 64 bit), Unix (32 and 64 bit), BSD, Mac OS X, Windows CE, Pocket PC, Symbian, iOS (iPhone), Android OS, QNX, VxWorks, Ecomstation and Haiku / BeOS using the same source-code and databases.

Harbour is based on Clipper, a compiler for the dBase language, popular in the 1980s and 90s. Although a powerful general-purpose programming language, it was primarily used to create database/business programs. Harbour shares the dBase ancestry with CA-Visual Objects and FoxPro. Harbour is actively maintained. Many features and paradigms have been introduced.

Databases are traditionally stored in dbf-files, Clipper already introduced a plug-in-system for supporting other ways of database-storage and access. Harbour now supports many major relational-database-management-systems.

The Clipper user interface is traditionally text based. Today, Harbour supports gui-frameworks like Qt and or native MS-Windows controls.  

Unlike FoxPro or CA-Visual Objects, Harbour is still backward-compatibility with Clipper.

That means, you can take 20 year old code and compile it to make it run on a modern operating system or to develop it into a modern Gui-Application or to add support for RDMS-Systems. Harbour's strength is not only to keep legacy-projects alive. It is also a good choice for new cross-platform applications, because it is an easy to learn, yet very powerful language.

Amateurs and beginners have an easy start because of the Basic-like language. Professionals enjoy a huge set of functions and programming philosophies. 

The open source Harbour license&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.harbour-project.org/license.html Harbour license]&lt;/ref&gt; is similar to the GNU General Public License, with an exception supporting commercial applications, so commercial applications can be produced with Harbour and distributed.

== History ==
dBase was a database application released in the early 1980s by Ashton Tate. At the time it was very advanced software. One of the major drawbacks was that it was an interpreted language and therefore rather slow. In winter 1985, former Ashton Tate employees founded Nantucket and released Clipper, a dBase compatible compiler that turned dBase-Code into DOS-binaries (.exe) that were much faster and could be distributed to users that did not own dBase. 

Clipper was a DOS application that lost much of its significance, when MS Windows gained popularity in die mid 1990s. Computer Associates bought Nantucket but later abandoned Clipper for CA-Visual Objects. Alaska Software developed XBase++, a Windows 32-bit program and Mulitsoft released FlagShip, a compiler that was capable of compiling Clipper-programms on Windows, Linux and Unix. Those projects extended the Clipper functionality.

The idea of a free open source software Clipper compiler has been floating around for a long time and the subject has often cropped up in discussion on the usenet group comp.lang.clipper. Antonio Linares founded the Harbour project and the implementation was started. Since 1999 harbour is the free implementation of Clipper. In 2001 a fork named xHarbour was created as a commercial distribution.

A Clipper is a type of ship. Sailing the Clipper ship to a Harbour port. Harbour is a synonym to port (where ship docks) Harbour is the port to the Clipper language.

On 2009 Harbour had a huge make over on its design promoted mainly by Viktor Szakáts and Przemyslaw Czerpak.

      <text xml:space="preserve">For some people, developing a personal method of solving Sudoku is much of the pleasure, so consider whether or not to read this.

There are many techniques for solving 9x9 Sudoku. Some use pencils and erase a lot, some use colored pencils, some write tiny numbers in the cells while working the puzzle.

The approach given here will assume that the solver only has an ink pen and cannot erase. For this reason, with very difficult Sudoku, where it becomes necessary to test a possibility that has not been logically proven, it is possible that the puzzle will become a mess. However, most Sudoku, except for a few very difficult puzzles in some books -- and some books don't have these very difficult puzzles -- can be solved with this technique, with no guessing at all. It still takes keen observation and painstaking care, because one mistake can lead to quite a mess, and it might not be discovered that one has created a contradiction until much later.

A relatively fine-point pen is preferred, and gel pens work well even on relatively flimsy paper. Instead of writing numbers in the cells, the solver will use dots. Imagine each square is divided into nine sections, like a little image of the 9 x 9 grid of the Sudoku itself. A dot in the upper left corner of the square will represent a possible &quot;1&quot; there, in the upper right corner a &quot;3&quot;, in the lower left corner a &quot;7&quot;, and in the lower right corner a &quot;9&quot;, with the other numbers in the obvious intermediate positions.

One might look at the numbers in any sequence, the numbers in a Sudoku have no particular significance as to their importance. Some will look at the numbers first that occur most frequently, because these will most commonly lead to obvious answers for some cells. We will assume that the solver, however, goes through the numbers from 1 to 9, in sequence, at first.

For terminology, a cell will hold one number in the end, and there are nine boxes of cells, each containing nine cells.

So for each number, look at each box where the number isn't found and see what cells within the box could contain that number. If it is only one, write that number in the cell, write it large so that it can be very clearly seen. If it is two, mark two dots, one in each cell, for a possible &quot;1&quot;, this would be the upper left corner of the cell. If it is more than two, ignore it for the moment.

At some place outside the box, possibly lined up with the 9 cells, but at some distance, so that, later, numbers can be written next to the boxes, and if one has found all the occurrences of a particular number, write an X to show that this number, aligned with the first column for one, the second column for two, etc., has all been marked. If one has marked a dot for this number for all the cells, write the number, showing that no more dotting is needed for this number, though it remains to be completely solved.

Proceed through all the numbers this way. Watch for situations where two cells in a box contain the same pair of dotted positions, and no other cells contain those represented numbers. Mark a diagonal line across a corner of these cells, which will signify that, though the exact number has not yet been found for each cell, no other number can occupy this pair of cells. Then, in considering other numbers in a box, these cells can be excluded.

The reason for only starting with two dots per box per number is because it makes it much easier to see this. If there are lots of dots, it can be much harder to see. The more you can solve in a simple way, the easier it will be to see the more difficult steps before the solution comes unravelled and it all gets extremely easy.

Notice that if only two cells or three cells in a column or row contain two or three optional numbers, and all cells have been dotted for that set of numbers, and they are all in one column or row, the combination functions to exclude that number from other cells aligned with the column or row, even if they might otherwise have been dotted as possible. So those extra dots can be crossed off.

Pass through all the numbers until one does a pass where no more particular cell solutions have been found, and no more pairs of dots can be placed.

In continuing, for each pass, one need only consider the numbers which are blank in the list of numbers one has made on the side or above or below the puzzle.

Then pass again through the numbers and do two things: for each number, if there are only three positions which could hold a number, make the appropriate dots in those three cells. If more than three positions can contain the number, write that number next to the cell. Leave room for all the possible numbers you might need to write! For the center box, either write the numbers, small, next to existing printed numbers, or use numbers or dots in a small box drawn outside the cell. The point is to quickly see what numbers remain to be placed in the cell. If there is any box for which such a remaining number has been written, draw an underscore in the position in the list you've been maintaining outside the puzzle. When a box has been fully dotted or solved, write a small check next to the box or, for the center, in it or in the little box you drew outside.

What this does is to show what work remains to be done in the first stage. Some simple Sudoku may already be solved by the time this is done.

When you finish dotting a number where you wrote an underscore, write the number in the list, and if you finish solving all cells for that number, cross it off.

As you eliminated dotted cells for a number, draw a small X over the dot.

Suppose you only have 1 number remaining to be placed in a box, and only one cell with no dots. The number must go in that position, but check it! Maybe you have made a mistake! Suppose there are two numbers remaining, and two cells. You can place the dots for those numbers in those two cells, and cross off the number you wrote on the side, because it's now dotted.

The same is true for rows and columns, but you must remember to be sure that all the cells in the row or column have been dotted for the numbers being considered. You can quickly see this if you have completed writing the numbers outside the cells as described.

Keep looking for any combination of two numbers or three numbers (or, rarely, four) that only occur in 2, 3, or 4 cells, repsectively, in a box, row, or column.

Notice that if, with any two columns in a group of three (a &quot;box column&quot;), or the same with box rows, a number is, in two of the three boxes, only in those two columns, the number must be in the third column in the remaining cell in the box column, so you can so dot it or place it as appropriate.

This technique can easily solve Sudoku up through intermedate difficulty, it simply requires being painstaking and not making mistakes.

For more difficult Sudoku, approaches will be found at [[Puzzles/Logic puzzles/Sudoku/9 by 9/Advanced solution techniques|Advanced solution techniques]]. The technique here will prepare the puzzle for those techniques to be applied

Hi.  When adding material to [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book]], please try to keep the answers generally applicable to anyone who might reference them.  It is usually a bad idea to write material in the first person (using I, me, mine, etc) as this implies that the answer being given does not apply to anyone else.  It makes it read more like someone's personal answers to the requirements rather than as an instructor's guide to teaching the honor.  I have rolled back your changes, but you are welcome to make further contributions following these guidelines.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{TOC right}}
Globalization is the process of accelerated growth, interaction, and integration of economic, cultural, and political activities across different nations. Although globalization has touched most populations, it has spread unevenly. Regionalization is the integration process that builds concrete patterns and networks within a regional space and creates a transition into the global market. It emerges as a response to globalization and can be mutually reinforcing &lt;ref name=Oman&gt;{{cite journal|last=Oman |first=Charles |year=1996 |journal= OECD Development Centre Policy Briefs |title= The Policy Challenges of Globalisation and Regionalisation |urlhttp://ideas.repec.org/p/oec/devaab/11-en.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;. Regions throughout the world are known to be as diverse as the inhabitants that occupy them. Technological advancement has helped integrate regionalization by creating the ability to transport and alter goods with lower costs to different regions. This is especially true with information goods &lt;ref name=Thayer&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thayer |first=Alexander| |year=2004 |journal=European Management Journal|title= Regional follows global: strategy mixes in the world automotive industry }}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

One of the main components that arise from globalization and regionalization is price discrimination. Price discrimination is when a provider sells identical goods or services to different buyers for varying prices, which exists because of the assumption that people are willing to pay varying prices for the same product. By use of price discrimination, companies can increase their profit potential while maximizing their share in their market. International price discrimination involves the process of the sellers pricing products differently depending on country or region.

By having varying regions it is tremendously important for companies to specialize their products for each different region. This process is better known as localization. Relating localization to information goods is one of the most pertinent aspects to consider when expanding products to different regions across the world. There are many aspects to consider when localizing a product, including legal, cultural differences, graphics, language, and overall themes. Costs of localization can differ based on how much time and work is put into the process &lt;ref name=Esselink&gt;{{cite journal|last=Esselink |first=Bert| |year=2000 |title= A Practical Guide to Localization}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This leads to price discrimination when the company is able to identify the different groups who desire the product, and then permits different prices for varying regions based on the consumer’s willingness to pay. localizing products additionally helps to avoid arbitrage, which happens frequently when suppliers price discriminate.

====Positives aspects of Globalization:====
* As more money is spilled in to developing countries, people living in those countries are stated to have a greater chance to succeed economically, and have a greater standard of living.
* Globalization increases competition, which helps maintain low prices in theory.

====Negative aspects of Globalization:====
* While outsourcing creates jobs for one population and lower costs, it eliminates jobs from another country, often leaving people unemployed and without opportunities in certain specializations.

====Localization====

Localization is a very important component of globalization. It is the process in which a business adapts their product or service for use in the specific market being targeted. Sometimes referred to as “L10N”, localization follows internationalization as the second phase in the globalization. Although there is no concrete definition of Internationalization, it is viewed by many as increasing the participation of businesses in international markets&lt;ref name=Susman&gt;{{cite journal|last=Susman |first=Gerald| |year=2007 |journal= Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises and the Global Economy  | }}&lt;/ref&gt;. As globalization reaches new places, the idea of localizing goods specifically for that region based on language, culture, and overall desired look are equally important. Localization of technology goods, such as video games or software, has become an area of specialization in development industries to the point where it is an essential activity of production&lt;ref name=Thayer&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thayer |first=Alexander| |year=2004 |journal=Technical Communication |title= Localization of digital games: the process of blending for the global games market|urlhttp://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-126157548.html=November 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=====Brief History=====
The following explains a brief history of localization and how it became a multi-billion dollar professional industry &lt;ref name=Esselink&gt;{{cite journal|last=Esselink |first=Bert| |year=2000 |title= A Practical Guide to Localization}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Before localization started companies did not have the time to create the same products for different regions. In the mid-1980’s, the first multi-language vendors were formed. INK, which is now Lionbridge, focused in the management and translation aspects of the software industry. Extended outsourcing began in the early 1990’s which enabled companies to tests multiple language versions of their products to see if they worked. This created a positive aspect to localization which made the idea of localizing products to specific regions very attractive. In 1990, the Localization Industry Standards Association (LISA) was founded. It brought together IT industry and localization service providers &lt;ref name=Esselink&gt;{{cite journal|last=Esselink |first=Bert| |year=2000 |title= A Practical Guide to Localization}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=====Costs=====
In the localization process the developer not only needs to consider the common requests from specific regions, but also the costs of localizing its good or service to ensure that it is worthwhile. The costs of localization for a company can be reduced or dramatically increased depending on the time taken to localize a product. Developing a product in a means that guarantees a streamlined localization process will reduce a company’s cost. Costs for the localization of a product are primarily dependent on two constraints: desired turnaround time, and the desired quality of the completed localized product. The cost drivers of this localization process are translation, publishing, engineering, and project management. Engineering costs, being the costs incurred during software changes, can be compounded depending on the amount of languages or areas the company plans to target. Engineering can also help the long term costs if a company externalizes all components of a software application to ensure they can be translatable. 

Translation and publishing costs include translation, editing, and proofreading the source text into the targeted language, in which the costs are incurred on a per-word or per-page basis. An example of this is ensuring that accented characters are displayed correctly if producing a text enabled game or software. If accents are on the wrong characters it creates extra costs as well as time to go back and correct. The translation process requires a lot of time to review the translations and improve their quality. A problem with showing text on a product is text truncation. This occurs when sentences are written in English, which is the original language for many games, DVDs and more, are on average 30 percent longer in another language. If a company judges the characters wrong and during testing realizes the sentences are too long and do not fit, it will increase costs for the resizing of the text. This is why project management costs might be the most important. An experienced management system can be expensive, sometimes 10-15% of the total localization costs, but can successfully guide the localization to be more efficient and minimize additional costs for later changes &lt;ref name=Soloduk&gt;{{cite journal|last=Soloduk |first=Judith| |year=2007 |journal=Language Technology Center |title= A General Discussion of the Translation and Localization Cost Drivers| urlhttp://www.translate.com/Language_Tech_Center/Articles/Translation_and_Localization_Cost_Drivers.aspx=September 5, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Overall, simple sentence structures are easiest to translate and reduce costs, while project management can successfully guide the localization process to be more efficient and minimize additional costs. &lt;ref name=Esselink&gt;{{cite journal|last=Esselink |first=Bert| |year=2000 |title= A Practical Guide to Localization}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=====Regional Lockout=====
This is the programming practice, code, or physical barrier used to prevent the playing of media designed for a device from the country where it is marketed on the same version of the device marketed in a different country. The video game industry, more specifically Nintendo, was the originator of regional lockout. For instance, an American Nintendo unit would not be able to play a Japanese game because the games are shaped differently, depending on the region it originated in &lt;ref name=Kent&gt;{{cite book|last=Kent |first=Steven |title= The Ultimate History of Video Games: The Story Behind the Craze that Touched our Lives and Changed the World |publisher= Prima Publishing |year=2001 |urlhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Nintendo_Entertainment_System}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It has spread to different industries as technology increases, such as the film industry with DVDs.  The region code for DVDs is a method that allows movie studios to control many aspects of the release of a movie.  For instance, a studio is allowed to control when they release certain movies to different regions and the price that movie is able to sell at in a specific region. Some argue this is not good for certain regions of the world where movies may not even be shown in there area. An example of this is Australia. In Australia, movie studios tend to charge a higher price because the consumers are willing to pay those prices there &lt;ref name=Hu&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hu |first=Brian| |year=2006 |title= Closed Borders and Open Secrets: Regional Lockout, the
Film Industry, and Code-Free DVD Players |urlhttp://beta.tft.ucla.edu/mediascape/Spring06_ClosedBordersAndOpenSecrets.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This may also lead to piracy as consumers may discover alternatives to prices they are willing to pay.

=====Examples of localization=====
Examples of localization can be seen in many different information goods. Video games, movies, magazines, websites and the fast food industry, are all considered information goods that can be localized in order to appeal to a specific market. Changing the language of the good is the most obvious way to appeal to multiple areas, but other adaptations are also very important when it comes to customizing a good for a certain region. Cultural differences, legal differences, packaging, and graphics are all things that can be modified, as well as language in order to make the product seem more localized.

Localization may seem easy for some information goods, but it can be costly if it is not localized properly. Creating a product to meet the global demand would be a sound strategy for submitting your product into the globalization strategy, however sometimes localizing the good or service is the more profit-maximizing choice for firms. Listed below are a few examples of successes and failures of localization.

''Microsoft Windows'' - Microsoft adapted its versions of Windows operating system specifically for certain countries and emerging markets. There are 25 fully localized versions and over 33 multilingual user interfaces.  The localized versions are language specific and create new opportunities for others to use Microsoft’s service.  The Multilingual User interface is made up of files that are language specific which can be downloaded to create a more adaptive English version of Windows &lt;ref name= Schäler &gt;{{cite book |last= Schäler |first= Reinhard | |year=2003 |title= Making a Business Case for Localisation |url http://www.mt-archive.info/Aslib-2003-Schaler.pdf =November 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

''World of Music'' - Certain artists localize their product while other artists globalize them. The United States and Europe tends to have more globalized music which is what other artists follow if they want a larger audience. In Spain the artists localize their music to particular areas or where they are from instead of globalizing their music to the Western standards. Latin America on the other hand, tends to create a more global product. Shakira and Juanes are from Columbia and they tend to have a more westernized sound. Even though these artists localize a few songs to their country, many of them use beats and styles as music that are normally globalized &lt;ref name=Spyridakis&gt;{{cite journal|last=Spyridakis |first=Irini| |year=2009 |journal=International Professional Communication Conference|title= Multimedia and culture: Globalization vs. localization of world music videos in the internet age|urlhttp://www.computer.org/portal/web/csdl/doi/10.1109/IPCC.2009.5208682 =July 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

''Video Game Localization''
It would be ideal for the developers of a video game to keep a similar feel when distributing their product to other locales. However in order to make it more appealing to the customer and maximize satisfaction, many firms alter each international version to make it more appealing and pertinent to the consumer’s culture. The first two aspects to change when localizing a video game are translating the language and possibly altering cultural references if possible. Linguistics for a video game includes packaging, the manual, subtitles, dubbed scripts and other types of texts in format only similar to utility software such as a word processor or an Internet browser. The culture differences between the eastern and western worlds are quite drastic. When games are driven more by story than action, adjusting the cultural aspects of the game can be challenging because of all the premises the designers are taking for granted in the expansion of the plot. Another interesting trend that has presented itself to videogame producers is that Asian gamers seem to prefer more child-like characters, while Western countries seem to enjoy more realistic adult features on their characters. A clear-cut example of this is the popularity of anime culture in Japan.  Cartoon-like video games have had success in the United States to some degree, however the influence is nowhere near the impact it has on the Japanese. In the United States games such as Call of Duty and Halo have proved to be extremely popular, gathering somewhat of a cult following.

''Fast Food Industry'' 
The fast food industry is very adept to customizing their advertisements, marketing strategies, menus and restaurants to fit into certain cultures. McDonalds and Pizza Hut are great fast food examples that are prone to localization. McDonalds for instance in Malaysia has a billboard advertising a beef “Prosperity Burger” sold during Chinese New Year.  The burger is made to please local tastes with spicy black pepper sauce and sliced onions on top.  As with all major fast food chains in Malaysia, the beef and chicken is Halal to ensure that all customers, including those of Islamic faith, can dine there. In the United States, fast food chains provide quick, inexpensive meals. Eating there is no special occasion for the average customer and often merits little marketing strategy suggesting that it is a place to spend time with family.  However, dining at an establishment like McDonald’s or Pizza Hut is a special occasion in Malaysia, as it is in many other countries around the world.  The menu is more expensive offering different items than most local options and these venues usually have waiters and nicer interiors to entice local customers into eating a meal for a Western dining experience.

== Specific regional concerns ==

====Background on Asian Censorship====
Information censorship in Asia, especially in China, has been a growing concern for the countries, foreign governments and for human rights organizations. As Asian economies become increasingly more important and influential in international trade, many are viewing media and Internet censorship in these countries as a potential problem and barrier to free trade. The Council for Foreign Relations argues that China and many of the other Asian countries who participate in strict censorship are simply using information censorship as a means to maintain power. As China’s economy and the economies of many other Asian countries, such as India, grow larger, it is apparent that there is pressure on their governments to loosen the barriers they place on media and other information outlets.

China’s obvious influence over the region and their emergence as a leader in the global economy makes it a particularly interesting and important country to focus on. Certainly most of the work that has been done on censorship in the region has focused on China; more specifically, its restrictions and regulations on the Internet. Their strict regulations and policies, coupled with their increasing proportion of real global output - as well as China’s influence over other governments in the region - merit observing China as an example.

Many sources have cited China as having some of the “most rigorous” Internet censorship in the world. Jongpil Chung writes in an article for Asian Survey: 

“… [China] employs strong, sophisticated control over what its people read, see, and hear. The Chinese government has been obsessed with ensuring that its people have access to “correct” information that supports the state’s propaganda.”

An example of the scale in which China censors information involves several American companies. Toward the end of the technology boom &quot;Amnesty International&quot; (a human rights organization involved greatly in researching this particular subject) cited many companies as participating in knowingly providing China technology which they knew would be used to restrict information. This accusation was made in a report published in November 2002. Although many companies denied that they actually “knew” about how the technology would be used, the accusation sparked further investigations into the level of censorship in China and how exactly they were acquiring and using technology to restrict information.

China repeatedly denies that it censors information to the degree others claim, and denies Amnesty International’s claim that it imprisons violators of media or Internet censorship laws; although Amnesty International refutes this. There is strong evidence, however, to suggest that China has used tools to censor information and media. One example of this is the Golden Shield Project, nicknamed “The Great Firewall of China.” China openly admits the ongoing existence of this project, which happens to block IP addresses at Internet gateways, making it impossible for one to access the site. The project is also claimed to survey information on the Internet to ensure it is suitable for viewing by citizens.

Most of China’s censorship laws can be attributed to the political structure of China and the ongoing debate between the countries two leading political parties. The opposing parties frequently discuss the role of the internet, as one party sees it as a threat to central power within China, and the other sees it as a required tool for modernization and economic development. This important debate will impact China in the future economically, and the future of censorship, particularly internet censorship, within the country. The result of this debate thus far is the loosening of some laws and a better flow of non-censored information in the country. However, given the remainder of the world’s adherence to the relative freedom of information, how much China adheres to its basic principles of government; even though many have been quick to point out the potential that lies with opening up channels of information. If any more progress is made beyond this point in opening up China’s tight restrictions, it will be due to the growth of China’s economy and their gradual openness to free trade policies.

Although China provides the most prevalent example of Censorship in Asia, and certainly a model for how many other Asian nations censor information, it is still important to consider other countries. As different countries have various background and economic systems, only appropriate strategies will help improve the development of globalization.

====Strategies for Successful Business Involvement in Asia====
Current trends in international trade have certainly made it increasingly important for individuals, especially those involved in business, to be well educated on how to conduct themselves in the global environment. The globalization of many American industries and businesses has increased the demand for individuals who can optimize results in interacting with other nations in ethical ways. This section will use the information presented in the previous section to recommend how exactly American businessmen and women can maximize their respective company’s potential in dealings with Asian countries with regards to their laws and customs on censorship. This will not, however, be a comprehensive guide by any means. Many other factors have to be taken into account above how to comply and work around Asian censorship laws in order to maximize success in dealings in Asian countries and business environments. 

Companies who manage to find success in Asia’s political and business environments are typically well aware of their censorship laws and work under the assumption that they need to change their business practices in order to incorporate them into the Asian system. Whether the company is looking to outsource jobs to Asia, or plans on selling a product in there, or even plans on setting up a portion of their business in Asia, respect for their censorship laws is a contributing factor to the success of that company.

Groups of &quot;internet giants&quot; like Google, Yahoo, and Microsoft are coming together with organizations such as the Center for Democracy (CDT) and Business for Social Responsibility in order to answer some of the questions involving international business with countries that censor their web content. Firms operating in countries such as China, India, and many other Southeast Asian countries may question such as how far they are permitted to go in challenging local laws and orders. In order to answer these questions, the organization looks to produce a set of principles guiding company when it comes to dealing with a country that faces laws, regulations, and policies that threaten human rights. {{cite web |url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China_Business/IB13Cb01.html |title=

Technological innovation arises from companies trying to gain a competitive advantage either by reducing costs, or introducing a new technology.  When a new product is introduced to the market, consumers are left with inferior products, and must decide whether or not it is worth it for them to buy into the new technology.  This can create what are called '''switching costs'''.

=Demand-driven dynamic competition=
==Switching costs==
'''Switching costs''' are the costs incurred by switching to a different company, format, platform etc. Though switching costs usually refer to upgrading to a newer and better technology, this is not always entirely the case and instances of changing to an entirely different system can occur.  For example, the switching costs related to replacing an existing library of DVD movies to Blu-Rays would include the costs of buying a Blu-Ray player, the Blu-Ray discs themselves, and getting a High-Definition television.  Included in the switching costs would also be the time and effort it takes to make the switch (driving to the store, waiting in line at the checkout, etc). &lt;/br&gt;
Note: Although the word &quot;costs&quot; is used, switching costs are not purely monetary, as shown in the example above.

Uncertainty can play a big role in switching as well. Blu-Ray originally had to compete with another standard known as HD-DVD in the high definition video disk market. In the beginning, it was uncertain which format would become the prominent standard. This uncertainty can affect switching costs, because consumers can see it as a risk to switch to a certain format, because they cannot possibly be sure if the format they chose will be the format that &quot;wins&quot;. For those consumers that chose HD-DVD, they eventually have to decide whether to pay even more (now that Blu-Ray won) for High-Definition video discs, or stay within their limited options. This uncertainty plays an important role in determining switching costs.

==Lock-In==

If the switching costs are higher than the potential benefits of switching, '''lock-in''' occurs. Lock-in implies that the consumer decided to stay with their current network/product/standard instead of switching to a product that might be better. For the consumer, switching is not worth the effort, due to the high switching costs. The lock-in that stems from these switching costs proves to be a huge competitive advantage for the firms, causing a dispute over &quot;fair&quot; and &quot;unfair&quot; competition tactics. Some firms are viewed as monopolistic because they are the sole supplier of certain locked-in users with a specific product. However, companies that are often not regarded as monopolistic can create lock-in by carrying high switching costs. This is often seen with contracts, a form of lock-in. 

Information products working together in systems cause a switch from any single product to be very expensive on the consumer. This can mainly occur through products that have many compliments, such as the Apple iPad. The iPad's function is to run applications for the benefit of the user. While there are free applications, some apps cost the consumer in order to use. Often times, buying an app does not mean that it can be universally used. If an iPad user becomes tired of the iPad and prefers an Android tablet, they will have to incur the costs of the new tablet, and the cost of buying the apps again. Due to the incompatibility between products and the number of complements that information products can have, switching can become expensive, and may not be worthwhile. 

Another example of information products having lock-in is a user switching from the Microsoft Windows platform to the Apple OS X platform. Along with monetary costs, time becomes a large portion of the cost as well. Learning to use a Microsoft operated PC and switching to a Macintosh can prove to be often confusing and aggravating, and vice versa. This can also be said about products like Microsoft Word or Microsoft Excel, these systems are often taught in schools and are the main product for Office type programs. It would be very tough for a competitor to be able to derail Microsoft from their top spot of Office programs because learning to use a different Word processor or spreadsheet processor would take lots of time, practice, and patience, which many people might find more of a detriment or hassle rather than beneficial. However, switching costs also allow firms to maintain long relationships and loyalty to their products and build a network of consumer support through the longevity of the products life. This acts as a guarantee to the firm that customers will stick around with a company because the threat of switching costs is too high.

== Individual lock-In ==
'''Individual lock-in''' is a situation that is realized when the consumer's individual switching costs are high enough to discourage an individual from changing product or service provider. That is, when it is significantly costly for a consumer to change vendors, that consumer is 'locked-in' to his or her original choice of consumption.

'''note:''' Switching costs do not have to be great to lead a Lock-in situation. Rather they need only be significant enough to prevent consumers from migrating to another vendor.

Consumers in information economies are especially vulnerable to lock-in. This is due to the nature of information goods and services. Information goods typically have high switching costs because of two factors:

# '''Time investment:''' Many information goods, such as Microsoft Excel, or Adobe PhotoShop require a significant investment of a consumer's time to learn to use effectively. This non-monetary investment in learning represents a large switching cost to consumers and tends to naturally lock consumers in. Furthermore, even information goods without high learning curves can require a significant time investment for the consumer to receive optimal utility.  
#'''Limited resale value:''' This stems from the unrecoverable time investment involved with adopting many information goods. That is, a consumer often cannot recoup his or her investment through any means. Furthermore, many information goods are provided at no monetary cost to the consumer. Downloaded MP3 files cannot be resold to other consumers, and the time invested into learning to use a certain system or network cannot be recovered by resale. 

Even goods that would have had a resale potential in the past are becoming increasingly precluded from resale. As more and more content moves away from tangible tape/cartridge/CD/DVD distribution, information goods lose resale potential. Take, for instance, a video game purchased and downloaded through the on-line gaming network, STEAM. This consumer good cannot be resold to recoup value. It cannot be traded for another game. The cost to switch to another game is the cost to buy a new game.

While lock-in is harmful to the consumer, it is greatly beneficial for vendors. Lock-in ensures continued revenue and discourages consumers from patronizing competitors. So while lock-in is the natural result of significantly high consumer switching costs, savvy vendors tend to cultivate lock-in situations by artificially increasing switching costs for their consumers.

'''Common ways that vendors raise switching costs to create artificial lock-in:'''

*'''Contracts:''' Contracts are direct, formal, legal means for creating switching costs. They impose monetary penalties for changing vendors. Contracts are the most clear and straightforward method of lock-in. Nearly all consumers in the United States are contractually locked in with a vendor. Contractual Lock-in include mortgages, auto leases, mobile phone plans, internet agreements and cable/satellite television plans.

*'''Two-part tariff pricing:''' Two-part tariffs set a base cost for consumers then provide the good or service at a per unit price. It is the base cost of the product that raises the consumer's switching cost. Examples of this include &quot;membership discount retailers&quot; such as shopping clubs that charge an annual fee for admission to the point of sale and also charge for your purchases, amusement parks where there are admission fees and also per-ride fees, cover charges for bars combined with per drink fees, and personal seat licenses in professional sports, in which fans of a team pay an up-front lump sum fee for the right to purchase tickets at face value. 

*'''Brand loyalty programs:''' Examples include family-plan mobile phone discounts and Southwest Airlines' Rapid Rewards Program effectively decrease the value of switching vendors. This adds to switching costs and thus increases the potential for lock-in.

*'''Gift cards:''' These create lock-in by allowing the consumer to spend their money only on the vendor's goods. The switching cost involved with gift cards is the money that is forfeited by not using the gift card.  For example, if a consumer is given a gift card, but has no intention of ever spending the money at the store to which the money is meant for, then the consumer ultimately is throwing away their cash.  Gift cards lock the consumer in to spending money at a certain store.

*'''Search costs:''' search costs create lock-in by making it inconvenient of finding another suitable vendor. If a consumer is unhappy with a product or service, but finding a replacement takes too much time or effort (or even money), customers may stick with their current product or service. 

===Additional information regarding lock-in===
====Overcoming competitors' lock-in:====
When competitors in a market seem to be increasing market share through competitive lock-in, it is important to understand the power and use of compatibility in a product.  This makes it easier for consumers to switch back and forth between companies supplying products and allowing the customer to get maximum use out of the product.  This can be made easier with product standardization and product complements.

====Anticipated lock-in:====
Anticipated Lock-in can also occur. This type of lock-in is associated with an individual's knowledge of the lock-in before they are actually taking part in the lock-in. An example of an anticipated lock-in would be a potential customer buying a cell phone when they have never previously purchased one. They will see that they are locked-in to a set contract by the service provider, and they can anticipate the lock-in. The response to an anticipated lock-in can often be a lower demand, since consumers generally do not like the idea of being &quot;tied down&quot; to a particular firm. Individuals tend to like choice, and they will often choose a firm that will give them the least amount of anticipated lock-in as possible. The most general example of anticipated lock-in is contracts (of cell phone/internet providers, etc).

====Lock-in as a negative for sellers====
Lock-in can also have a negative impact for sellers. If consumers know about an anticipated lock-in, they might not even try the product at all. They will bypass it completely, having a negative result for the seller (because they do not get the product sold). As a result, sellers often have promotional deals in order to entice consumers. An example of this is when dealerships offer to pay off the remainder of your lease or trade-in if you buy one of their cars. Sellers can also offer a brief no lock-in period, such as a 90 day money back guarantee. 

===Examples of individual lock-in===

====Cell phone contracts====
John Consumer currently has a 2-year mobile phone contract with T-Mobile. John is dissatisfied with his current phone service. His text message plan results in increased monthly charges, and he frequently encounters limited signal dead-zones. John would like to change to a more reliable and text message friendly mobile carrier, like Verizon. Unfortunately, it would cost him $150 to terminate his current contract with T-mobile. The cost to break his contract is John's switching cost. Because this high switching cost is not worth improved service to John, he faces what is called Individual lock-in.

====Software use==== 
Companies often chose software based on the needs of a company. When an initial decision is made on what software to use, it usually become the software that they continually use for years if not permanently, as the cost of switching would be expensive and potentially not worth the company's time. For example, if they are using the software service ADP for payroll and other human resource needs, the company will continue using ADP instead of switching to SAP (another software) because they already have purchased and know how to use ADP. The company could potentially &quot;stuck&quot; with ADP indefinitely until a situation arises where they would switch (i.e. corporate buyout, retiring personnel who use the old software, etc).

==Systemic (collective) lock-in==
'''Systemic lock-in''' tends to arise naturally in markets, like individual lock-in. Unlike individual lock-in however, systemic lock-in is not the result of effectively high consumer switching costs. Rather, systemic lock-in is the market situation in which it is unprofitable for one consumer or firm to switch products unless all(or most) other firms or consumers also adopt the same product. Even though switching would benefit all firms, the benefit depends on all firms switching. Thus, systemic lock-in is the result of consumers' collective inability to coordinate switching vendors. This is the a huge factor in firms generating critical mass; which helps build, define, and expand their market share. If a firm can obtain critical mass in their selective market, then they have a proportionately large share of the market and will cause disincentives for customers to switch firms.

Systematic lock-in can be easily found today in online social networking sites, like Facebook and Google+, and does not always have to result from monetary effects. While Google+ has millions of users (62 million as of Dec. 2011 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://techcrunch.com/2011/12/27/google-user-count/ |title= For Google+, User Count Is a Journey, Not a Race |author= Constine, Josh |date= 27 December 2011 |accessdate= 23 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;), it barely has 10% of the numbers of Facebook, which was reported to have surpassed 750 million users in the middle of 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ssdigitalmedia.com/2011/06/27/facebook-user-count-reaches-an-astounding-750-million/ |title= Facebook user count reaches an astounding 750 million |author= unknown |date= 27 June 2011 |accessdate= 23 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Google+ may be better than Facebook in some aspects of social networking, its late entry into the market has proven a difficult climb for Google to conquer. Most of the people on Facebook are content with using just Facebook, and the large drawback to adopting Google+ is the idea that you have to build your social network repertoire all over again on a website with less users. Facebook users may not want the hassle of learning a new social networking site, and they may not want to use it because friends and family are not on the site, which devalues Google+ for them. As a result, Google+ is suffering non-monetary effects of systemic lock-in.  

Systemic lock-in often comes from a coordination game, most notably the Stag Hunt Coordination Game. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gametheory.net/Dictionary/Games/StagHunt.html |title= Stag Hunt |author= Shor, Mike |date= 2006 |accessdate = 23 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;Both parties would be better off hunting a stag, but opt to hunt for the hare because they cannot be sure that the partner will also hunt for a stag (thus, possibly sticking with an inferior decision) (See [[Strategy_for_Information_Markets/Background/Nash_equilibrium#Risky_coordination|risky coordination]]). Systemic lock-in can been seen as being in one Nash (or consumer demand) Equilibrium, and the &quot;players&quot; are having a hard time collectively switching to a different equilibrium. 

Although individual lock-in may be more prevalent and often purposeful than systemic lock-in, systemic lock-in is perhaps a more common aspect of modern information economies which mostly exist online. The usefulness of an online site or network to an individual consumer is based largely on the number of other consumers that utilize the network. 

===Examples in an information economy:===

====Phone plans:====

There are two friends who currently keep in contact via text messages. They each currently pay $10 per month for their text messaging plan. Player 1 wants to switch to a new text service that will let him send messages for free to any other phone with the same service. Player 2 also wants to switch. However, they know each other well enough to know that they are each unlikely to do what they say they are going to do. The cost to switch to the new service is $10.

&lt;u&gt;Possibilities:&lt;/u&gt;

The Game Matrix (below) helps visualize the potential payoffs that each friend has when deciding ultimately to switch or stay with the same text messaging plan. 

{{bimatrix|align=right|title=Switch Messaging Plans?|s1=Switch|s2=Stay|u11= 10, 10 |u12= -10, 0 |u21= 0, -10 |u22= 0, 0 }}

# If they both switch to the new text-phone service, they will obviously both enjoy the benefit of free messages to each other. In the long run the free messages will save each of them $10 per month.
# If only Player 1 switches, but Player 2 does not, Player will have simply spent $10, and will realize no savings (and therefore, a worse payoff for having spent the $10 to switch) &lt;/br&gt;
# Vice versa, if Player 2 Switches, but Player 1 does not, then Player 2 will have simply spent $10, and will realize no savings (and again, a worse payoff for having spent the $10) &lt;/br&gt;
# Both player opt not to switch. Neither friend incurs the $10 switch fee, but doesn't getting the full benefit of the cheaper plan. &lt;/br&gt;

In this example, each friend gets a greater payoff if they both decide to switch, and get a worse payoff if one of them switches (albiet one friend gets an even worse payoff). Since they cannot count on each other to follow through with their plans, each friend is likely to simply lose $10 should they switch to the text plan individually. Therefore, both friends are systemically locked in  to their current phone plans by the uncertainty of what the  other will do. &lt;/br&gt;

====The Qwerty keyboard:====

A potential example of lock-in is the QWERTY keyboard. Studies have shown that the QWERTY keyboard may not be the most efficient keyboard in the market. But the QWERTY keyboard has become the standard in the computing world. But, there is another little known type of keyboard available, known as the Dvorak keyboard. Some have claimed that the Dvorak keyboard is easier to type on. However, there are a potential number of switching costs associated with moving from QWERTY to Dvorak including the following: the price of purchasing the new Dvorak keyboard, retraining oneself to learn how to type on such a keyboard, the scarcity of the keyboard itself and finally being able to type on both the Dvorak keyboard and the standard QWERTY keyboards on a regular basis.

&lt;u&gt;A brief history of the Dvorak keyboard:&lt;/u&gt;

Originally, the Qwerty keyboard was designed to place the most common two-letter combinations on opposite sides of the keyboard in order to prevent jams in typewriters. Now that typewriters are obsolete, and the original purpose for the QWERTY keyboard is no longer necessary. The Dvoark keyboard was invented by Dr. William Dealey and Dr. August Dvoark to increase typing efficiency and accuracy. The Dvorak keyboard received a U.S. patent in 1932.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |url=http://www.mit.edu/~jcb/Dvorak/ |title= The Dvorak Keyboard |author= Bigler, Jeff |date= 7 March 2003 |accessdate= 2 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
&lt;u&gt;Locked in to QWERTY:&lt;/u&gt;

Because the QWERTY keyboard is such a standard and the numerous switching costs that come along with the DVORAK keyboard, consumers are essentially locked into the QWERTY version. While the Dvorak keyboard may be more efficient, its just not a realistic possibility of consumers. So this is the main reason why the Dvorak keyboard has yet to really catch on in the information technology world. In addition, there has been conflicting support on the efficiency of the Dvoark keyboard in comparison to QWERTY. One advantage that the Dvorak keyboard does have over its QWERTY counterpart is comfort level. According to users it is more comfortable to type on the Dvorak keyboard. Despite this claim, consumers are still essentiall locked into QWERTY becasue computers come stanard with this version today.

====Social networking sites:====

Social networking cites provide for the largest example of systemic lock-in in an information economy. For example, it often takes new Facebook users months to build a substantial network of on-line friends. This time investment discourages consumers from switching to competing social networks like Google+ or Myspace.

Companies often chose software based on the needs of a company. When an initial decision is made on what software to use, it usually become the software that they continually use for years if not permanently, as the cost of switching would be expensive and potentially not worth the company's time. For example, if they are using the software service ADP for payroll and other human resource needs, the company will continue using ADP instead of switching to SAP (another software) because they already have purchased and know how to use ADP. The company could potentially &quot;stuck&quot; with ADP indefinitely until a situation arises where they would switch (i.e. corporate buyout, retiring personnel who use the old software, etc). 
&lt;/br&gt;

==Path dependence==

'''Path dependence''' is the process that how things happen can often determine what happens. Path dependence often occurs in markets with strong network externalities where there are multiple stable equilibria. We don't have a prediction from the model what equilibrium will eventually be reached (compared to a single stable equilibrium market - often identified with a simply supply-demand curve). So what happens over time can determine what occurs and which equilibrium is reached. Path dependence is also similar to a &quot;Bandwagon Effect&quot;, where the larger network is more appealing to consumers after many have joined it and thus creating a snowball effect of expansion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eh.net/encyclopedia/article/puffert.path.dependence |title= Path Dependence in Economic History |author= Puffert, Douglas |publisher= Economic History Association |date= 2009 |accessdate = 24 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Path dependence is used in analysis of a standards battle. In the beginning of a standards battle, both standards may seem similar, and people buy into each of them. Eventually, one standard is adopted due to the large network externalities associated with having a particular standard. The other standard not universally adopted is then eventually rejected. 

Path dependency was originally developed to explain the technology adoption process and industry evolution. Since the decision one faces for any specific instance is limited by past decisions; the nature of any achieved state depends heavily on the process of getting there.  It can be considered the road map or process of evolution for a market, detailing the history of technological advances a firm has made to reach optimum market share.

===Examples of path dependence===

Path dependence is also well demonstrated in the fight between Blu-Ray  and HD-DVD to dominate the high-definition DVD market. Both products were very similar with their capabilities and advantages and neither of them offered much of variety from the other. However, once movie studios, such as Disney and Paramount, moved to using Blu-Ray technology as their main movie standard, the market shifted in Blu-Ray's favor, giving it the advantage over HD-DVD. This decision by these major movie studios created a path dependence throughout the market by making the HD-DVD technology less sought after and inferior to Blu-Rays, regardless of the fact that it started on par with Blu-Ray. Now that these movie studios are producing their movies on the higher standard Blu-ray, the only advantage of purchasing a HD-DVD player over a Blu-ray player would be the slightly less cost, and this is the outcome of the path dependence that has been created. Eventually, this path dependence is what lead to the fall of HD-DVD.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/BUSINESS/02/19/toshiba.hdd/index.html |title=Toshiba quits HD DVD 'format war' |author=unknown |date= 21 February 2008 |accessdate= 3 May 2012}} &lt;/ref&gt;

Another example of how path dependence can work highly in a businesses favor is by encouraging a market to move in a particular direction. In highly competitive markets like the example shown above, large market share holders in one market can greatly affect the overall outcome and consequently the success or failure of other affiliated markets. This is one reason that path dependency can such a strong economic affect. Large market share holders have something of a closed network when introducing new technologies that do not offer any standardization along with improved advantages. Once again, referring to the example above, it can be seen that without the cooperation of the large movie studios, such as Disney and Paramount, Blu-ray and HD-DVD would not have been able to enter the DVD market at all on any real level.

=Supply-driven dynamic competition=

==First-mover advantage==

Throughout the business world, many subjects use the term first-mover advantage. It is important to recognize which one is being referenced. Often times, a first-mover advantage can actually refer to a &quot;last-mover disadvantage&quot;, which implies different strategies.

In information economics, first-mover advantage explains the idea that a supplier is rewarded for bringing a new good or service to the market. There are many advantages that come from being a first-mover in a market:&lt;ref name=LiebermanMontgomery1998&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Lieberman |first1= M. |last2=Montgomery |first2= D. |year= 1998 |title= First-mover advantages |journal= Strategic Management Journal |volume= 9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* First-movers can often establish brand recognition, making it a long lasting household name. Examples include &quot;You owe me a coke.&quot; &quot;Take an Aspirin.&quot; &quot;Hand me some Kleenex.&quot; &quot;Let's jump in the Jacuzzi.&quot; and others. 
* First-movers often help establish the market, and generally are not easily swayed into exiting the market. This is the result of heavy sunk costs that they company incurs, often forcing the company to be economically committed to staying in the market. This is an advantage because it can often deter other firms from entering the market at all. If the new firm is successful, it is still unlikely that they can remove the first-mover from the market. Even a small revenue by the first-mover will be better than simply accepting its sunk costs as loss and exiting the market. This is similar to the military strategy Hernando Cortes[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hernan_Cortez]]employed, scuttling his fleet after he landed in Vera Cruz. There is no going back. The only options are victory or death (failure).
* First movers gain the advantage of being further along the learning curve in the manufacturing and development of the product. They can learn from their mistakes, and easily find areas to improve efficiency and ultimately reducing costs. 
* First-movers can often gain significant market share that competitors have a hard time reducing. The strongest example in today's world is Apple's iPad. Apple developed the first tablet computer that people actually wanted, giving Apple significant market share that other companies have tried (and some failed) to reduce. Market share can often help achieve 

===First-mover advantage with information===
In an information market, the first-mover advantage is much often larger than in it would be in a conventional market. This is because network effects can make such markets '''tippy''', meaning that whichever firm has an early advantage is likely to beat out all competitors (again, think of Apple's iPad). Conversely, in information markets, the first-mover advantage can be more treacherous. Due to the nature of information goods, suppliers have very high fixed costs and minimal variable production costs. If a second-mover is able to forgo the high sunk costs of entering the market by emulating the first-mover, then the second firm is left with only minimal variable production costs--a significant advantage. In situations like this, &quot;the second mouse gets the cheese.&quot;

In addition, IP laws can often help with first mover advantage. If a company is the first to file a patent, no other company can copy what the first mover is doing until the patent expires. So while competitors may have a lower investment, they cannot copy exactly what the firm does without violating laws. By the time the patent runs out, the R&amp;D used to develop the patent could be considered a sunk cost, and the investment could actually be considered &quot;lower&quot; than the competing firms &quot;lower&quot; investment. This is one way to protect valuable R&amp;D information that a company might have and still retain first mover advantage. Another could actually be trade secrets. &lt;ref name=LiebermanMontgomery1998/&gt; The reason Coca-Cola has never filed a patent on its recipe is they do not want competitors to know it. They keep it a secret, giving them an advantage over other firms.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |url=http://theipstone.com/2012/01/12/protecting-trade-secrets-eight-questions-businesses-need-to-ask-and-answer/ |title= Protecting Trade Secrets |author= Judge, Walter |publisher= Downs Rachlin Martin PLLC |date= 12 January 2012 |accessdate= 3 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disadvantage of being a first-mover===

There is one distinct disadvantage from being the first to enter the market. Research and Development (R&amp;D) is usually costly in order to create a new market for a product, and all that R&amp;D won't guarantee success of the product. If the first mover fails to capitalize off of the first-mover advantage, then the competitors that follow can learn from the first-mover's mistakes and avoid some of the pitfalls and sunk costs of entering the market earlier, perhaps beating out the first mover. This is widely known as the '''bleeding edge'''.

===Example of the advantages and disadvantages of being a first mover===

Let's say small bandages have yet to be introduced to the consumer market. If your company wants to create a new product that people can use to cover their minor wounds. Since this product has yet to invented, you have the opportunity to choose the name. If this product is successful, people may start referring to your product by your name rather than the what it actually is. Your company is Band-Aid.  The bandage that you introduce to consumers takes off. Now other companies begin introducing a similar product. Since you were the first mover in the market though, the know all bandages as Band-Aid. Your company has and advantage here. On the other hand, there are some disadvantages to being a first mover in a particular market. This can include, but is not limited to, advances in technology. In the case of this particular example, competing bandage companies can build on the product that you introduced first. They can then make the product better and sell it at a cheaper price.

      <comment>/* Python */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The algorithm '''bogosort''' (also '''random sort''', '''shotgun sort''' or '''monkey sort''') is a particularly ineffective sorting algorithm.  Its only use is for educational purposes, to contrast it with other more realistic algorithms. If bogosort were used to sort a deck of cards, it would consist of checking if the deck were in order, and if it were not, one would throw the deck into the air, pick the cards up at random, and repeat the process until the deck is sorted. Its name comes from the word ''bogus''.

==Description of the algorithm==

Following is a description of the algorithm in pseudocode.

 '''while''' '''not''' inOrder(deck) '''do'''
     shuffle(deck);

==Implementations in different programming languages==
=== Python ===
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
from random import shuffle

# Bogo-sort deck in place
while not all(x &lt;= y for x, y in zip(deck, deck[1:])):
    shuffle(deck)
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Ruby ===
&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
class Array
  def bogosort!
    shuffle! until sorted?
  end

  def sorted?
    each_cons(2).all? { |a,b| a &lt;= b }
  end
end
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Perl 5 ===
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
use List::Util qw{shuffle};
sub inorder (&amp;@) {
  my $sub = shift;
  while (scalar(@_) &gt; 1) {
        return unless ( $sub-&gt;(shift, $_[0]) )
  }
  return 1;
}
my @list = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6);
@list = do { shuffle @list } until inorder { $_[0] &lt;= $_[1] } @list;
&lt;/source&gt;

Or, for a deck of cards:

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
use List::Util qw{shuffle};
sub inorder (&amp;@) {
  my $sub = shift;
  while (scalar(@_) &gt; 1) {
        return unless ( $sub-&gt;(shift, $_[0]) )
  }
  return 1;
}
my @list = qw{2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A J K Q};
@list = do { shuffle @list } until inorder { $_[0] le $_[1] } @list;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Perl 6 ===
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
my @list = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6;
@list .= pick(*) until [&lt;=] @list;
&lt;/source&gt;

Or, for a deck of cards:

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
my @deck = &lt;2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A J K Q&gt;;
@deck .= pick(*) until [le] @deck;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Java ===
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
    import java.util.*;

    public void bogoSort(List&lt;Integer&gt; deck) {
        while(!isInOrder(deck)) {
            Collections.shuffle(deck);
        }
    }
     
    public boolean isInOrder(List&lt;Integer&gt; deck) {
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; deck.size() - 1; i++) {
            if (deck.get(i) &gt; deck.get(i+1)) return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Lua ===
&lt;source lang=&quot;lua&quot;&gt;
function is_sorted(t)
    local last_v = t[1]
    local current_v
    for i = 2, #t do
        current_v = t[i]
        if last_v &gt; current_v then
            return false
        end
        last_v = current_v
    end
    return true -- if the length of the table is 1, it will return as if it is sorted
end

function bogosort(t)
    while not is_sorted(t) do
        local nt = {t[1]}
        for i = 2, #t do
            table.insert(nt, math.random(1, #nt), t[i])
        end
        t = nt
    end
    return t
end
&lt;/source&gt;

===  Scheme ===
&lt;source lang=&quot;scheme&quot;&gt;

(define (bogosort to-sort)
  (cond
    ((list? to-sort) (vector-&gt;list (bogosort (list-&gt;vector to-sort))))
    ((sorted? to-sort) to-sort)
    (else (bogosort (shuffle to-sort)))))

(define (sorted? to-sort)
  (define (check-index-and-next n)
    (or (&gt;= n (- (vector-length to-sort) 1))
        (and (&lt;= (vector-ref to-sort n) (vector-ref to-sort (+ 1 n)))
             (check-index-and-next (+ n 1)))))
  (check-index-and-next 0))

(define (shuffle deck)
  (define (set-index-to-random n)
    (if (&lt; n 1)
      deck
      (begin 
        (let ((rand (random (+ 1 n)))
              (val-at-n (vector-ref deck n)))
          (vector-set! deck n (vector-ref deck rand))
          (vector-set! deck rand val-at-n))
        (set-index-to-random (- n 1)))))
  (set-index-to-random (- (vector-length deck) 1)))

&lt;/source&gt;

=== Smalltalk ===
&lt;source lang=&quot;smalltalk&quot;&gt;
|deck|

deck := (1 to:10) asArray randomShuffle.
[ deck isSorted ] whileFalse:[
    deck randomShuffle
]
&lt;/source&gt;

===  C++ ===

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
 #include &lt;iostream&gt;
 #include &lt;ctime&gt;
 #include &lt;cstdlib&gt;
 #include &lt;vector&gt;
 #include &lt;algorithm&gt;
 #include &lt;iterator&gt;

 using namespace std;
 static const int NUM = 7;
 
 bool IsInOrder(const vector&lt;int&gt;&amp; x)
 {
 	return adjacent_find(x.begin(), x.end(), greater&lt;int&gt;()) == x.end();
 }
 
 int main()
 {
 	int counter = 0;
 	srand(time(0));
 	vector&lt;int&gt; bogo;
 	
 	// Initiate the vector with NUM random numbers
 	generate_n(back_inserter(bogo), NUM, rand);

 	// Bogosort
 	while(!IsInOrder(bogo))
 	{
 		random_shuffle(bogo.begin(), bogo.end());
 		copy(bogo.begin(), bogo.end(), ostream_iterator&lt;int&gt;(cout, &quot; &quot;));
 		cout &lt;&lt; &quot;\n\n&quot;;
 		counter++;
 	}
 	cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Sorting took &quot; &lt;&lt; counter &lt;&lt; &quot; tries.&quot; &lt;&lt; endl;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;


Various other implementations in C++ are available, including an [[Standard Template Library|STL]]-style algorithm, which was inspired by discussions on the ACCU General mailing list.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Multiplayer computer games are a branch of [[w:Video game|video games]] which link individual users through a number of different mediums, who all access the same video game application.  One of the more common [[w:Computing platform|platforms]] for users to access an application is called a [[w:Personal computer|personal computer]].  It is common for the user to [[w:Installation (computer programs)|install]] the game from a [[w:Compact Disc|compact disc]] or from a [[w:Uploading and downloading|download]] accessed directly from the internet.  Some multiplayer computer games can also be played through the user's web browser without any significant download necessary beyond the potential need for [[w:HTTP cookie|cookies]] and [[w:Plug-in (computing)|plugins]].  There is also the option for users to access multiplayer games with [[w:Video game console|game consoles]] such as the [[w:Xbox 360|Xbox 360]] and [[w:PlayStation 3|Playstation 3]], which allow either [[w:Computer network|networked]] or [[w:Hotseat (multiplayer mode)|hotseat]] interaction with other players, through that system specifically rather than through a personal computer.

== History ==

=== Origins ===

The relatively rapid rise of the computer as a personal gaming instrument dates back to the 1970s.  The first recorded multiplayer computer games were based on closely associated, closed networks which linked select machines that had both geographical proximity to one another and technological compatibility. Up to hundreds of personal computer terminals could be connected through serial lines, linked through [[w:Minicomputer|minicomputers]] (small mainframes). Each terminal would run an instance of the computer game while sharing memory across the mainframes. The first computer games included content such as first-person combat&lt;ref&gt;http://web.archive.org/web/20010410145350/http://www.geocities.com/jim_bowery/spasim.html&lt;/ref&gt;, large scale warfare, real time strategy including developing economies and trade, and space exploration.  Although similar to modern day [[w:Local area network|Local Area Networks]] (LAN), these systems were a more basic and restricted version of the networks being used today. The first games which were truly connected through a LAN arose in the early 1990s.

=== Today ===

Since the advent of multiplayer gaming there has been the creation of a diverse set of methods through which to play these games.  Different avenues for multiplayer gaming include hotseat, LAN, [[w:Play-by-mail game|play-by-email]], play-by-post, [[w:Play-by-post role-playing game|play-by-internet]], and [[w:Online game|online games]]. The last category, online games, is the most common form of multiplayer gaming.  This gaming can be pursued either through the web or simply through an application which accesses the internet but which is not [[w:Web hosting service|hosted]] directly by a website anchored in the web.  The most common genres of online gaming are Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Games ([[w:Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|MMORPG]]), Massivley Multiplayer Online Real Time Stategy ([[w:Real-time strategy|MMORTS]]), and Massively Multiplayer Online First Person Shooters ([[w:First-person shooter|MMOFPS]]), although there are a number of other popular types of [[w:Massively multiplayer online game|multiplayer online games]]. Most of these games are able to connect millions of users to each other through the use of large servers located geographically throughout the world to provide a better overall online experience in a process called matchmaking. Hosting services also come equipped with software that allows players to be matched up with other players with similar skills or abilities who are looking for a competitive game.  The presence of online gaming in modern day is undeniable in much of the world and manifests in many forms. Online tournaments attract many competitors in many different nations linked across the internet or even in person, and video game conventions entice thousands of individuals to attend.  Movies and novels have been adapted into video game format and vice versa, and world renown composers offer their services to video game scores.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.npr.org/blogs/therecord/2010/12/01/131702650/composers-find-new-playgrounds-in-video-games&lt;/ref&gt;  The rise of online multiplayer games also owes credit to the world's movement toward electronic commerce, networking, and education.  Were there not so many practical applications of usage of the internet, the games we see today may not have ever become so prolific.

== Common Platforms ==

=== Personal computer ===
'''PC:''' Personal computer gaming is the most pervasive and widespread method for gaming.&lt;ref&gt;http://kotaku.com/5206876/what-ails-the-worlds-biggest-gaming-platform&lt;/ref&gt;  PC gaming has the advantage of oftentimes bridging the proprietary divides created between game consoles such as those developed by Microsoft and Sony.  For example, gaming titles that are released by Sony for the Playstation may be restricted from distribution to Microsoft or Nintendo consoles but still released for computer systems.

=== Video game console ===
'''Xbox 360 (Xbox Live):''' Developed in 2005, Microsoft's Xbox 360 is the most popular gaming console today. This console has the ability to connect to the internet and has an online gaming network called [[w:Xbox Live|Xbox Live]], which offers and supports various levels of membership and features. The 360 uses computer-based processing cores and makes good use of its hardware for graphics delivery even though it does not possess the most sophisticated processor and graphics card when compared against other systems. &lt;ref name=howstuffworks&gt;http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/video-game5.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Playstation 3 (Playstation Network PSN):''' Launched in 2006, Sony's Playstation 3 (PS3) is the third and most technologically advanced version of its product line which began in 1995. Unlike its predecessors, the PS3 features wireless network connectivity for online gaming on its [[w:PlayStation Network|PlayStation Network]] (PSN) and operates using a cell processor. The PS3 has the most distinctly impressive graphics of the three systems, according to its specifications.  The PS3 also boasts the benefit of serving as a [[w:Blue-ray Disc|Blu-ray DVD player]]. Both the PS3 and Xbox 360 possess backward compatibility with game discs designed for previous iterations of each respective system.&lt;ref name=howstuffworks/&gt;  Backwards compatibility was essential to boost initial sales for the systems.  For example, when the PS3 was first released it had a very limited number of games.  To reduce consumer switching costs the system was constructed so as to allow users to still enjoy their old collection of games which were designed for the previous versions of the console. Later models of this system do not have this feature because the Playstation 3 platform now has a significant number of unique games, and backwards compatibility with PlayStation 2 games is not a highly sought after feature of the current customer base.

'''Wii (Virtual Network):''' Released in 2006 (in the same month as the PS3), the [[w:Wii|Nintendo Wii]] is a revolutionary console that is based on actual physical movement caught by a motion sensor.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ehow.com/how-does_4588107_nintendo-wii-work.html&lt;/ref&gt;  The Wii posses the least powerful processor of the three major consoles, running at just 729 megahertz. With the weakest processor and graphics offered of recent consoles, the Wii attempts to offer a more enjoyable and enriching gaming experience rather than sheer powerhouse gaming performance.  Overall the Wii seems to boast the most broad and casual appeal, with many demographics expressing an interest in using the Wii console.&lt;ref name=howstuffworks/&gt;

''' Kinect: ''' Kinect is a motion sensing input device by Microsoft for the Xbox 360 video game console. It’s like a webcam extra for the Xbox. it enables players to use and play it with the Xbox 360 just use your hands. The Kinect is aimed expend it’s users and make the user has a new different life experience.  A version for Windows was released on February 1, 2012. The most different change compared with general game console for Kinect is the way of using your own hands as a controller and visual contact. There are more and more games are developed for Kinect. The Kinect made Xbox takes more game console market and more profit since it's realeased. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.xbox.com/en-US/kinect&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hand held device ===
Hand held gaming devices date back to 1970's when Mattel first released Auto Race, the first hand held electronic game. &lt;ref&gt;Loguidice, Bill; Matt Barton (2008-08-15). &quot;A History of Gaming Platforms: Mattel Intellivision&quot;. Gamasutra. http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=18518. Retrieved 2008-12-27.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then the most popular hand held console has been the Nintendo line of Game Boys.  This line did not offer a significant multi-player hand held experience until the birth of the [[w:Nintendo DS|Nintendo DS]] in 2004. This gaming system allows connectivity for up to 16 players and has WiFi capabilities. The DS line also possesses backwards compatibility with [[w:Game Boy Advance|Game Boy Advance]] games, helping the DS line to become one of the greatest selling hand held lines of all time, with more than 104 million units sold. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2009/090507e.pdf#page=22&lt;/ref&gt; Nintendo has had much success in its hand held video game consoles and with the expansion of the DS it has shown a level of dominance in the multi-player arena as well. The popularity of multi-player gaming has grown and Nintendo has been able to capitalize on that growth with the development of the DS. The DS allows people to connect on the go; playing their games together in transit, on school campuses, and even while waiting for the start of their favorite movie's midnight premiere.

Another popular hand held gaming device with multi-player functionality is the [[w:PlayStation Portable|PlayStation Portable]], released in 2005. Known as the PSP, this unit is capable of using cable and wireless connections to link with the PlayStation 3, other PSPs, and the internet, which emulates the same multi-player attractiveness as the Nintendo DS.

Lastly, the most recent addition to the hand held family is the [[w:Playstation vita|Playstation Vita]]. Released on February 22, 2012 by [[w:Sony Computer Entertainment|Sony Computer Entertainment]] the Playstation Vita is now the 8th generation in modern gaming devices. The processor in the Playstation Vita is similar to that of the original [[w:Xbox|Xbox]]. It also offers the same features as the PSP with cable and wireless connections. Added features included two .3 megapixel cameras that allow videoconferencing from the internet possible. This is a new step for gaming devices to allow the same interaction that a regular Personal Computer or laptop markets. This type of software also competes with cellphones due to its ability to reach other users of the device. The Playstation Vita allows has a touchscreen system to provide convenience and user friendly technology.

=== Mobile/Cellphone ===
A multiplayer mobile game is often a remake of a classic multiplayer game for a PC or game console. Most mobile games are single player with computer animated opponents or are linked to a external network device. This can include: Wi-Fi, wireless lan, or even bluetooth technology. [[w:BlueTooth|BlueTooth]] games are designed to share game information rather than give a on screen interaction. It is limited geographically within the Bluetooth's range. With the use of a online browser, network games can be accessed by any player at any time. Although these games have limited memory and are not graphically advanced, the focus by content creators is to create a large number players interested in the game. In general, the larger the network size in this market, the more interaction and fun the game is for the average consumer. Game applications include Scrabble and Draw Something. Older mobile phones supporting mobile and even calculators have gaming that is connected by a wired port, usually USB. &lt;ref&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_game &lt;/ref&gt;

A GPRS connection which is common among GSM mobile phones can be used to share data globally. Developers can connect players of mobile games with one server and share data among everyone. Some have invented cross platform games, allowing a mobile gamer to play against a PC gamer. This way of interaction best supports turn based games and role playing games. Faster connections like UMTS and HSDPA allow real time multiplayer gaming. More multiplayer mobile games continue to enter the market with an increasing demand.

=== Success in Video Game Consoles === 
With the advances in technology, the Xbox 360, the Playstation 3, and the Nintendo Wii, have created an innovative gaming system environment. These consoles allow users using the same systems to connect to each other and see what activities their friends are doing at that moment. The ability for anyone using a specific console to send friend requests, videos, messages etc. to other friends who are on the same system is accessible as well. This creates an expanding gaming environment, much like social networks, that keeps users engaged in online multiplayer gaming. Companies such as Microsoft or Sony are working very hard to get as many users as possible operating with their system for as long as they possibly can. By introducing new venues through the Xbox or PS3, such as Netflix, YouTube, Hulu Plus, and others, the users of these operating systems no longer need to enjoy these entities by other means. Microsoft and Sony have brought these venues to the users at no cost of buying an Xbox or PS3. The importance of keeping gamers online and in continuous contact with their selected console, has not only caused an increase in console activity in the latest years, but has increased the number of users who are involved with multiplayer gaming. The simplicity that Xbox and PS3 have created for its users, has had an enormous effect on friends and other observers to go and purchase one for themselves. In total, the number of game consoles purchased between Microsoft's Xbox 360, Sony's PS3, and Nintendo's Wii, has reached 82.2 million units sold ending in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.digital-digest.com/blog/DVDGuy/2011/09/13/game-consoles-%E2%80%93-august-2011-npd-sales-figure-analysis/&lt;/ref&gt; Keeping users interested by creating innovative devices can attract more users to multiplayer video games.

===Failure in Multiplayer Game Production===
Entering and competing in the multiplayer game industry more often does not lead to success. The major competitors in the industry have the advantage over others because they have gained market power through previous production. Most of the popular games in the multiplayer gaming industry are either sequels or are in some way related to another popular game. Industry types estimated that 10% of games produced 90% of revenue, and only 20% of games turn a profit.&lt;ref&gt;http://voices.yahoo.com/great-failures-video-gaming-3068023.html?cat=19&lt;/ref&gt; In the multiplayer gaming industry, it is known that failure in accordance to production, occurs when producers are blinded from past successes and ruin their reputation by releasing games that they have unfamiliarity with. We see this mistake made by numerous, big time competitors in the industry.

====Nintendo====
At the time Nintendo had yet to experience failure. The Virtual Boy was a monumental failure for Nintendo and was said to have caused blindness from the Pseudo 3D in red and black. What Nintendo tried to do with the Virtual Boy was create a 3D system that was portable. Instead, Nintendo is said to have given consumers many headaches and caused eye irritations. Nintendo also failed earlier in the industry by creating a console with cartridge formats. If not for the major popularity of Zelda and Mario, Nintendo might not be a major competitor today.

==== Playstation====
Right as the PS3 was to be introduced and placed on shelves for sale, the hype that Sony and Playstation had created for PS3 from its extremely positive feedback from PS2, which is said to be the best selling game system of all time, did not meet expectations from a few different reasons. Sony introduced an extremely difficult to use controller, questionable graphics, poor marketing schemes, as well as pricing the new console at $600. PS3 sales upon launch were dismal, and was the least successful of the three consoles.

===Less Common/Outdated===
'''The Dreamcast''' was launched in 1998 by Sega. [[w:Dreamcast|Dreamcast]] was the first game console to have a built-in modem and internet capabilities. Holding a 200 MHz SH-4 processor it originally had a dial-up connection although a boardband adapter was also a available accessory for highspeed boardband connection. It allowed users to connect with others in hotseat, LAN, and even MMORPG games such a [[w:Phantasy Star Online|Phantasy Star Online]]. Ahead of its time online gaming had not become a popular [[w:Network effect|network externality]] for users to sustain production of the console and was thus discontinued in 2001. Although the system failed to provide sustainable growth and profit it did revolutionize what console were capable of and was the foundational building block for next generation consoles.

== Getting Started ==

=== Purchase and Use ===

In the consumer market for multiplayer computer gaming there are many different genres and styles to which users have access.  These games can be purchased from electronics distributors, directly through the manufacturer, or through other third party services on the internet. An example of a game which requires an up-front purchase but which is free to play following that purchase is the [[w:First-person shooter|first-person shooter]] [[w:Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2|Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2]]. A game which requires an up front purchase price and which also requires monthly payments through a [[w:Subscription business model|subscription]] is [[w:World of Warcraft|World of Warcraft]]. A game which requires no up front purchase and no monthly subscription is [[w:League of Legends|League of Legends]].  A game played directly through the browser which is free to acquire but may require a fee to play could be an [[w:Online poker|online poker]] site.  Many online games typically require an upfront purchase cost which generates a significant amount of revenue for the manufacturer and associated development companies, but many firms find it more valuable to require that games be paid for on a time-specific basis through either subscription payments, or by offering their services at a [[w:Freemium|freemium]].

==== Initial Purchase Cost ====

For the games which require an initial purchase cost for play, manufacturers have found lucrative profits throughout the many years during which this has been the most predominant distribution and access method.  Sales have historically been conducted through a physical location, typically an electronics store, but as transmission of information goods becomes more seamless and easily conducted there has been a shift toward digital distribution either through a game-specific portal such as [[w:Steam (software)|Steam]] or though an online store. As of mid-2009 sales of online games generated around $11 billion in revenue.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.next-gen.biz/news/online-game-sales-to-top-11b-this-year-analyst&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Versioning ====

One way in which game developers are able to capture as much initial purchasing revenue possible is through [[w:Software versioning|versioning]] their product. Versioning is the creation and marketing different versions of a given product that is catered to match the differing values of different consumer demographics. When versioning is used as a business strategy it is most effectively employed in creating simple, mid-range, and high-end versions as a standard.  The [[w:Madden NFL|Madden NFL]] football game series has been producing its games for almost two decades and thus has a devoted fan base that will purchases these games consistently for each release. From time to time [[w:Electronic Arts|Electronic Arts]], the developer of Madden NFL, will release a standard version of an upcoming game and a &quot;superior&quot; (more expensive) collector's edition game with additional online and offline content. This strategy assumes the most highly devoted members of the fan base are willing to pay the increased cost for the higher end version and that regular consumers in the video game market will purchase the standard version. The Madden network is large but it is not large enough to successfully sustain a third versioning tier, however this is not the case with Activision's Call of Duty series. [[w:Call of Duty: Black Ops|Call of Duty: Black Ops]] is a video game produced by Activision and developed by [[w:Treyarch|Treyarch]]. The game's predecessor, &quot;Modern Warfare 2&quot;, is the all time best selling multiplayer game in history, beating the record set by another predecessor &quot;Modern Warfare (part 1).&quot; Based on pre-order numbers, early reports show that Black Ops will top the record set by Modern Warfare 2, setting new sales and revenue records.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gamespot.com/xbox360/action/callofduty7workingtitle/news.html?sid=6281276&amp;om_act=convert&amp;om_clk=gsupdates&amp;tag=updates%3Btitle%3B8&lt;/ref&gt; As it relates to versioning, Blacks Ops much like Modern Warfare 2, will release in the form of three editions: standard, &quot;hardened,&quot; and &quot;prestige.&quot; Standard will sell for $59.99, hardened for $79.99, and prestige for $149.99.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.callofduty.com/game&lt;/ref&gt; The higher the version the more content a consumer can receive. Just as with Madden, the die-hard fans will purchase the highest end, and the basic fans will purchase the lowest. But the beauty of Black Ops is the fact that they are producing a mid-range product. The mid-range product or the &quot;hardened&quot; edition, is key for basic buyers who have a bit more value for the game but not enough to be considered hardcore and for hardcore fans who may not derive value from spending $150 on a video game.

==== Digital Distribution ====

The digital distribution of games has allowed for new distribution portals, such as Steam, to arise and meet consumer demand. Since its launch in 2002, Steam has quickly created a user base of 30 million accounts, with approximately 6 million unique users accessing Steam each day. &lt;ref name=steamnews&gt;http://store.steampowered.com/news/4502/&lt;/ref&gt; Steam is a communications platform designed by Valve to connect developers and consumers directly. This allows smaller fanchises and independent game developers a chance to promote titles that would otherwise go unnoticed. Today there are over 1500 games avialable to purchase on the Steam website. It is estimated that Steam owns at least 70% of the digital distribution market share. [2] By bundling its products with an active online community with the ability to chat and network, Steam has found a way to directly connect its customers with one another in a way that was previously unavailable. Gamers are able to view what games their friends have purchased as well as statistics revealing how much time they spend playing each game. By providing users with this information, Steam is able to encourage the sale of its games through individual promotion by its users. With continued growth of over 100% in unit sales in the past 6 years&lt;ref name=steamnews/&gt;, Steam has quickly become a leader in online game distribution. To meet the ever rising demand, Steam recently developed its infrastructure to reach speeds of 400Gps. At this speed, a digitized version of the Oxford English Dictionary could be downloaded 92.6 times per second. &lt;ref name=steamnews/&gt; With over 1,200 games now offered in 2010 &lt;ref name=steamnews/&gt;, it is likely that Steam will continue to lead the digital distribution revolution.

==== Subscription vs. 'Freemium' models ====

The first major subscription-based online multiplayer games with which we are familiar date back to 1997 with the advent of [[w:Ultima Online|Ultima Online]] and 1999  with the appearance of [[w:Asheron's Call|Asheron's Call]]. World of Warcraft has been the most successful of this genre to date, boasting more than 11.5 million monthly subscribers. For games like this, the players are paying a monthly fee, but in return the game they are playing is essentially never ending.  The monthly fee adds significant revenue to the game producer.  Because of high revenues, funding is available to make continuous changes to the game.  This enables players to have a variety of new challenges at any given point in time.

Online Computer game manufacturers requiring a monthly subscription have a distinct advantage when compared to those games that a free to play.  [[w:Blizzard Entertainment|Blizzard Entertainment]], a highly successful manufacturer of online games, has benefited greatly from the World of Warcraft games.  Instead of investing extensively with the development of new games, Blizzard worked on improving and adding new features to the World of Warcraft.  Without the release of one new computer game, Activision Blizzard generated a revenue of 1.2 billion dollars last year.  They have successfully captured the second largest number of subscribers for games of the same type. Second Life, by San Francisco-based Linden Labs, is the only game that surpassed the World of Warcraft’s subscription numbers.  This was only because their game was free to play on the internet.
&lt;ref&gt;http://seekingalpha.com/article/193148-blizzard-s-world-of-warcraft-the-china-growth-story&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on the World of Warcraft, it can reasonably be inferred that charging for online subscriptions can be more profitable than simply producing a large number of new games.  Blizzards time and effort that is allocated to its online subscription games are enough to make people continue to pay and play.  By adding new features every so often, people’s interests are peaked and boredom is unlikely.  Other companies have also begun adding to the online portion of existing games as well.  For example, the creators of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 made new maps available for purchase.  People undoubtedly purchased these map packs because it was something new to keep the game from being too repetitive.   The practice of adding new features most likely stems from the falling revenue of a given game.  

Contemporarily, we are starting to see this stringent money making strategy with which online video game producers are releasing what we can call &quot;full-partial games.&quot; These games are not to be confused with demos or pre-release copies; they are the actual game, however with missing online playable content (even sometimes offline). Two of the most popular 2010 games have or will feature aspects of this strategy. For example NCAA Football 11 for the XBOX 360 &amp; Playstation 3 consoles, released its game in July 2010 for $59.99. Once purchased, the game could be enhanced by purchasing a &quot;create your own school&quot; mode, where an individual could create and develop one's own university football team and use that team while online. Similarly, Call of Duty: Black Ops, the most anticipated game to be released in 2010 (November 9, 2010), will be release with the standard retail price of $59.99 but with an option to purchase additional maps for online gaming. By releasing these games in their full nature yet with expansion potential, producers are able to initiate more demand for their product and thus sell the rest of the content separately from the game generating more profit.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.businessweek.com/innovate/content/aug2008/id20080815_246585.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Freemium games do not require a time-specific subscription in order for the consumer to participate.  The player can download and play the full core content of the game without spending a penny on the game itself, but is granted the option to enrich their gaming experience through purchase of advanced content which may or may not only provide an improved gameplay experience, but which would allow and edge in performance in-game. A survey conducted specifically regarding purchases of additional content in-game found that over half of online game players made their purchases in free to play games.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.virtualgoodsnews.com/2009/09/over-half-of-gamers-purchasing-in-freemium-games.html&lt;/ref&gt;  In this types of game in some instances it is essentially a requirement to purchase items to perform well within the online environment, but in others the manufacturers limit the items which can be purchased so as to only enhance the experience of the player rather then actually grant them a leg up when competing against other online players.  One example of a free-to-play game with pay-to-play enhancements which can really contribute to a player's in-game success is the Korean based [[w:MapleStory|MapleStory]] which has generated millions of dollars in revenue and claims to have surpassed 100 million online players.  League of Legends is a game which allows real money purchase of game-specific currency that can be used to buy things like outfits for characters, extra characters beyond those which are free-to-play, and other enhancements which promote more in depth gameplay but which do not ostracize the portion of the community that cannot afford extra expense.

=== Making a Profit ===

Based upon simple economic analysis it can be safely stated that if there were no profits involved in the online video game industry we would not see the dominant market which serves as the focus of this discussion. Multi-player games, especially those played on-line, have immense Economies of Scale. Once the developers have the hardware base (servers, memory storage, etc.) they can support a continuously growing user base with nearly no additional cost. By keeping a desirable product this market has been able to successfully generate revenues in a variety of different ways. It has crafted an industry that didn't exist before the mid-nineties.  Initial purchase, subscription fees, and freemium services are three of the most lucrative and observable ways for online games to make a profit, and it appears that these methods will continue to do well for this industry. 

One reason multi-player games have become so popular is due to network externalities.  For example, let’s say Taylor wants to buy Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2.  He could receive two different types of value from it.  The first type of value that he would receive would come from the single player mode of the game.  He would be able to play through it, and would not need any additional people to play with him.  He would then be able to receive additional value when another person buys the same game.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.utdallas.edu/~liebowit/palgrave/network.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Once this occurs, he can play multi-player mode on the internet.  The games value will continue to increase to Taylor as more people buy it.  It works the other way as well.  If no other person purchases the game (or he believes no one will purchase it) then it is worth much less to him. He could only have access to one part of the product.  The positive network externality described above provides evidence as to why multi-player games are able to grow in popularity rapidly.  It is usually beneficial for game producers to market their game in a way that allows for a high number of initial purchases in order to make the extra value available to consumers.   

==== Advertising ====

With games that are visually stunning and deceivingly realistic, advertisements are fairly prominent.  In racing games it is not uncommon to observe billboards emboldened with the name of the manufacturer of the world through which you maneuver your speeding card, nor is it unheard of that a specific brand or product be brought up not-so-discretely in the course of dialogue between your personal avatar and a non-player-character within the game. This is similar to advertising efforts made in Hollywood; just like in a movie, if the character in a game goes to pick up food somewhere, then a specific restaurant chain may be displayed. Or if the character is walking down a street, certain department stores or even banks are made visible.&lt;ref&gt;http://advertising.about.com/od/promotions/a/prodplacegames_2.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  Not only are there advertisements inside the product itself, but surrounding the game there may be plenty of opportunity for third party marketing.  Banners and pop-ads are commonplace when accessing browser-based online games, and even in some console specific markets such as the Xbox Arcade.  The game itself could be an advertisement as well.  For example the game America's Army was made specifically as a recruitment effort for the United States Military.&lt;ref&gt;http://images.businessweek.com/ss/08/08/0815_make_money_from_games/6.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Call of Duty's Modern Warfare 3 took gaming advertising to whole new levels with the introduction of the new game. The popularity that the Modern Warfare name has achieved with its consumers, has called for advertisements in magazines, Facebook, and on television commercials. Facebook allows its users to &quot;like&quot; any of the recent Modern Warfare products and this gives Facebook users the ability to connect with friends who use it as well. The makers of Modern Warfare see this as a way for Facebook users to connect with each other, since if friends on Facebook see people who &quot;like&quot; Modern Warfare, they may me more likely to go purchase the game for themselves. Another interesting advertisement scheme that the game Modern Warfare 3 introduced to its followers was with Jeep. Jeep introduced a new model that was branded Jeep, the Modern Warfare 3 edition. The fan base that has been created by the Modern Warfare game has taken to the streets and now everyday drivers know who plays Modern Warfare 3 and this tactic gives the game company an advantage because if non-users notice the Jeep branded with Modern Warfare 3 on the spare tire, they may be affected by the advertising and potentially be influenced to buy the game or buy the car.

==== Multiple Installments ====

Many games are able to carry on successfully through many iterations by carrying on from the success of a previous version.  Bungie's Halo has come out in five different versions to date, and Rockstar Games' Grand Theft Auto has exceeded even that number.  Loyalty to a particular game or brand can bring substantial rewards for manufacturers, so long as they maintain the level of quality which their consumers have come to enjoy. Not only does this provide the generation of revenue from a new game title, but also saves the costs of developing an entirely new and untested game model for distribution.

== PC Single System ==

Today's console and computer games are made for home theater PCs, idea of a multiplayer game usually describes players who play together by using remote controllers that are either wireless or plugged into the game system. Aside from [[w:Local Area Network|Local Area Network]] console systems, the maximum number of players on a PC is not a standardized number. However, as the number increases the amount of bandwidth and server demand increases. When this demand exceed its potential the server can crash. Due to the popularity of USB game controllers, PC multiplayer games are capped by the amount of USB ports equipped on their console, whether the USB device is supported on the operating system they own, and the type of controllers a particular developer wants to support. For home console games, developers often use split-screen, single play area, or hotseat from the viewpoint when interacting with the game. Each type offers their benefits and is more appropriate than others depending on the type of console and genre of multiplayer game.

==== Splitscreen ====
Split screen is mostly used in non-networked for multiplayer video games. A split screen can be either in a two-player form or a four-player form on one screen. The videogame display is divided into equally-sized areas so that the players can move about without having to be in the same area. Splitscreen was widely popular before world wide web connection allowed users to interact in the same from different geographic areas. During its most popular usage splitscreen was used for genres like first person shooters and racing.

==== Single Play Area ====
A single play area camera moves the same way as if you were playing the game by yourself. All the players are viewed on one screen and are limited to move about together rather than able to explore different areas at once. Early arcade games such as the Simpsons, gauntlet, and street fighter used this type of interaction. Common game genre for this type include: adventure, role playing games, cooperation, and fighter.

==== HotSeat ====
The term Hotseat is used to describe opponents who take turns being the operator of one controller for the same game. Because of this it is more commonly known as turn based games. These types of games are slower pace and allow players to decide on what their moves will discretely rather than simultaneously. Game genres include strategic, puzzle, and simulation games.   

= The Different Multiplayer Modes with Advantages and Disadvantages =
There are three different modes of multiplayer games which include single-head, LAN, and Internet. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.pineight.com/rant/multi/&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Single-Head==
Single-head games involve one computer with one display and can use multiple controllers. This mode can either be split screen like in Goldeneye 007 or this mode can place the players into a shared view such as Super Smash Bros.

===Advantages===
Can be less expensive for users only using one computer or monitor.

===Disadvantages===
Limited to players among geographic neighbors.

Games whose design requires a first-person or behind-character view must split the screen, giving less screen area per player.

Generally limited to genres that either are turn-based or work well on a gamepad.

Handheld play is for turn-based games only.

==LAN==
LAN games are games that involve multiple computers on a local area network such as Starcraft.

===Advantages===
Permits for handheld play.

Permits for real-time use of keyboard and mouse.

Use of full screen allows for a more detailed first-person or behind-character view.

===Disadvantages===
Limited to players among geographic neighbors.

Can be expensive with requirements of one computer per player and one monitor per player.

Requires one software licensed per computer.

==Internet==
Internet games involve multiple computers on the Internet. Many LAN games have become accessible through the Internet by private matches or matchmaking. The Internet allows for games with large persistent worlds, such as massively multiplayer online role-playing games.

===Advantages===
Use of full screen allows for a more detailed first-person or behind-character view.

Allows for real-time use of controller, keyboard, or mouse.

Large amounts of players.

Allows for handheld play in select hotspots.

===Disadvantages===
Pool of players consists largely of strangers.

Occasionally certain users causes other players to not enjoy the game.

Requires one computer per player and one monitor per player.

Monthly fee applies to Internet access and to many games.

Virtually all implementations require one software license per computer.

Players in geographic areas without higher-speed residential Internet access are at a severe disadvantage in real-time games.

== Virtual economies ==

One unique aspect of online multiplayer games is the conception of [[w:Virtual economy|virtual economies]]. A virtual economy refers not to the exchange of real world monetary funds for in-game rewards, but instead refers to the generation and accumulation of wealth and resources within a video game or other closed model.  To avoid confusion, the existence of real money transactions for the acquisition of virtual goods is persistent and identifiable, but this is outside the scope of the virtual economy and refers to a mixed economy of virtual markets and secondary markets.  Many games which have already been mentioned here involve virtual economies such as Asheron's Call, World of Warcraft, and League of Legends.  These virtual economies can act in a variety of forms and either exist as persistent markets which largely adhere to global exchange markets under fixed exchange rates, or in session-based form where the funds necessary for a purchase are always in the same amount and can be acquired in a more or less predictable way. 

=== Session based ===

In any given session-based game - such as a real time strategy game - when a user seeks to acquire new goods or inventory through an in-game purchase they are typically dictated to the same terms each time a session is started.  In the game [[w:StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty|StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty]] by Blizzard Entertainment the player's objective is to micromanage a small outer space installation comprised of builder units and a base of operations.  From these base components resources can be harvested and new buildings and units can be purchased, but always for the same purchase cost. Unless a large overhaul of the game is conducted via Blizzard Entertainment patching the client or in-game mechanics then this will continue to be the case.

=== Persistent world ===

Much more complex and dynamic, the virtual economies of persistent online worlds change based upon the intuitive principles of economics to which many of us adhere each day.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gamestudies.org/0302/castronova/&lt;/ref&gt;  In this manner players are given a set of fiscal and monetary rules which include a currency for the persistent world, constant exchange rates between currencies where necessary, and a marketplace for exchange. With these principles in place, players are then able to acquire wealth and items as they interact with one another and engage in the virtual world.  If Player A were to enter a world and try to purchase an apple from a NPC (Non-player character) vendor in Town A, the price may be ten (10) gold pieces.  But if during the player's travels through the game they find that Player B has, through their own adventures, acquired a surplus of apples and is selling them for eight (8) gold pieces, this is where the markets begin to emerge.  When Player A and Player B are linked up through a forum or market the principles of economics become clearly represented.  When these interactions are not just between two players but instead between millions, the economies become far more complex and involved.

== Secondary markets ==

There are secondary economic markets which function outside of the developer's intention for the game.  These markets do not include transactions between the consumer and the developer of a video game, but instead involve exchanges of real monetary funds between consumers for in-game goods or game-related goods.

===Virtual Good Sales===
As large scale games such as World of Warcraft continue to expand, new markets for in-game virtual goods have arisen. Some companies have tried to capitalize in this by offering special features to users willing to purchase special in game items for a small fee. In Softnyx's Gunbound, users are able to purchase items that increase their characters abilities and enhance the overall game play experience. Although developers are able to capitalize on new market, so are consumers. 

====Gold Farmers====
In several countries, including China, there are large collections of players whose job is to collect in game currency in popular games and sell said currency for real money over the internet. 
These workers are known as &quot;gold farmers&quot; or &quot;real money traders&quot; (RTF). &lt;ref name=eurogamer&gt;http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/gold-trading-exposed-the-sellers-article&lt;/ref&gt; In game goods are purchased much in the same way any normal consumable good would be. Websites are set up devoted to the sale of in game currencies or items, and users are able to purchase them via credit or debit card. &lt;ref name=eurogamer/&gt; Recently, there has been some abuse of gold farmers in the United States and overseas. For instance, prisoners of jails within a country are forced to farm various games up to 20 hours a day in order to make a real world profit.

====Selling Accounts====
The most common form of virtual selling is the sale of online game accounts themselves. In similar fashion to gold farming, a large collection of users may accumulate wealth and skill status on a character with the sole intention of eventually selling the character to a consumer. The most common example of this is also easily seen in the game World of Warcraft. Through websites such as www.wowgoldfacts.com, users are able to purchase accounts for as little as $100 USD for low level accounts to as much as $1500 USD for the higher-end characters.&lt;ref name=eurogamer/&gt;

====Power Leveling====
The practice of power leveling involves the disclose of a user's name and password to a third party, sometimes a gold farmer, in order to advance a characters skill level or accumulate in game wealth for a player. This practice is not as common as the purchasing of virtual goods directly or selling of virtual accounts, but has seen a recent spike in the usage of these services has increased since the development of large scale MMORPGs such as World of Warcraft. &lt;ref name=eurogamer/&gt;

== Long tail network effects ==

Persistent online communities have the ability to keep a game running long beyond when the graphics and other various components have since become obsolete. Long tail economics bolsters an idea that a long running video game can persist not based solely upon the direct, intended appeal of the game, but also upon the vitality of the community of that game.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.siliconvalleywatcher.com/mt/archives/2008/03/long_tail_econo.php&lt;/ref&gt; [[w:Diablo II|Diablo II]], distributed by Blizzard Entertainment, was first released on June 29, 2000 and runs on software that was developed over a decade ago.&lt;ref&gt;http://us.blizzard.com/diablo3/events/d2anniversary.xml&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of its relatively old age for the gaming world, Diablo II is still running strong.  There is an extremely loyal following for this game that numbers in the millions, when combined with the following of Starcraft, another legacy game released by Blizzard in March of 1998.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gamespot.com/pc/strategy/starcraftiilegacyofthevoid/news.html?sid=6271382&lt;/ref&gt;


==internet censorship controls==

Every country has it’s own internet censorship controls. Some country are more strict, some country are less strict. The different censorship controlling made every game developing company need to face a same problem: change their strategy for every country.

== Renaming a book ==

Please have an administrator do that.  They are able to move the root page of the book and all subpages at once.  You duplicated existing subpages under the new root name when that extra work was not necessary.  Just a tip for next time. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 00:25, 25 September 2010 (UTC)

:OK. 2 Q's. Is there a way for me to do this without cutting and pasting existing pages? (if I need to do it in future). If I need Admin privileges to do this, how do I get 'em? --[[User:Scifipete|Scifipete]] ([[User talk:Scifipete|talk]]) 13:43, 25 September 2010 (UTC)

::It's extra work for you to cut and paste each page and then I have to go back, figure out what pages are duplicates, and delete each by hand.  Getting administrator privileges is something that is earned with a great deal of time and experience.  Both could be something you acquire eventually, but if you were nominated today, people would want to wait and see.  Until then, it's fastest to simply let an administrator know or post at [[Wikibooks:Reading room/Administrative Assistance]] where someone can do it in one fell swoop.  It won't take long; that page is monitored by all the admins. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 03:53, 26 September 2010 (UTC)

:::OK, if that's the preferred method. The wikibook is evolving, and there's likely to be a number of these 'suggestions' by contributors --[[User:Scifipete|Scifipete]] ([[User talk:Scifipete|talk]]) 15:32, 26 September 2010 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The approach to solving described here was written quickly and could definitely be improved. It doesn't describe, really, the purpose of using the dots and how it works in practice. Starting out with just two dots for one number per square means that if you identify a cell number, and that cell contains a dot for another number, you can immediately mark the cell with the other dot as being that number. It is also very easy to see if there are two cells with the same two-dot marks.

The dots are small and don't interfere with writing the cell numbers as they are identified. I probably wouldn't use them if using a pencil. I used to use a pencil and did write the small numbers at that point.

However, it's faster to make a dot, and easier to write something else in if needed. --[[User:Abd|Abd]] ([[User talk:Abd|talk]]) 01:49, 17 September 2010 (UTC)
:I use the dot-approach when I solve Sudokus, though I don't use any of the other notations described here.  Though I came up with the notation myself, I find it gratifying to know that I'm not the ony one to have come up with it. I find it easy to remember where each one goes because the dots are laid out the same as a phone's keypad.  I imagine a drawing would be really useful for illustrating the technique(s). --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 02:55, 17 September 2010 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{book title|Chapter II: A Way of Life}}

The most noticeable social change between the start of WWI and the end of WWII was the employment of women. Prior to WWI it was housework, in all its variations, followed by shop work, teaching and nursing. Between the wars light factory work and offices can be added to the list... previously, these positions had been the preserves of men. Early during WWII 'all out war' saw women taking over the jobs of the young men who were fighting… the older men promoted to become overseers, managers, and senior clerks. The use of women in factories, offices, and shops escalated as the years went by. By the time, the Second World War was well underway women were finally accepted as being ‘essential for the country’s economic survival’. Thereafter, the employment of women continued apace. It took another fifty years for girls to be considered suitable for technical work and given suitable training in-house and at Further Education Colleges. In the printing industry, for instance, there were no women employed in any of the craft sections until the 1980s. In graphic reproduction studios, the training of girls began for film planners, but even so, there were no indentured apprentices. Industry stepped back from long periods of training for girls - believing that in many cases it would be a wasted effort. 

The country's investments during the inter-war years, technical innovations particularly towards the latter half, and the improvement of managing mass labour, joined with new skills training, improved capital investment services, housing and leisure services... these all  contributed to the affluence of the suburban worker. The increasing use of women in work initially competed with men but by the time rearmament was well underway women were a force to be reckoned with.    

Girls leaving school in the 1950s were expected to work up to the time they were to have children. This was the first time girls in mass had these expectations – it was the beginnings of an understanding of female ‘self-worth’. This lead to sexual liberation and the concept of ‘the modern marriage’. Within fifty years,the ridged social structure was transformed.  ‘Flower power’, nuclear disarmament, hippies, rockers, trial marriages, television watching, lost innocence, drug taking, contraception, part-time working, job sharing, single parenthood, increased alcohol addiction, and divorce, played their part in the social changes that took place. These new social changes were the preserves of the mainly young; they had more money available to spend. The extended school leaving age, increased university places, grants and allowances, all allowed a greater freedom of expression. This was demonstrably obvious as freedom marches began, Amnesty International flourished, and support soared to help and encourage Left Wing industrial disputes.If previously it could be said to be 'the age of women's freedom, then this was 'the age of youth culture'. 

The local town farm, a mile from the town's centre, with it's fields lining either side of the dual-carriageway, gave good grass for the cows…, which in turn provided milk for the dairy - bottled for the town and surrounding area. [During the war, these fields held a local searchlight battery]. The milking parlour, built next to the bottling factory stood opposite the stables and sheds - housing the milk carts painted in red and white livery… The horses, harnessed to all delivery carts, remembered their round as well as the milkman… never needed to be told to ‘walk on’. These horses provided the necessary manure for tomatoes and roses. The farm’s original estate had been a deer park of over two hundred acres - the first recorded building on that site was in 1560. The present farmhouse, which boasts Farm Produce painted in large letters on the side, was built in the 1750s. Gypsy caravans travelled along the main road sometimes in convoy. Many of them were richly painted - with floral designs, with beautifully carved furniture and antique porcelain. They told fortunes at fairs and sold pegs and rattraps door to door. The women brought round baskets of ‘lucky heather’ leaving special chalk marks outside the house, where sales were made.

Four main churches served the town’s citizens. The Roman Catholic Church, which was, positioned half way down The Drive, The Church of England created the parish in 1930 - graced the cross roads near Village Way. The Baptists eventually found their home in The  Avenue... The Methodist’s Chapel behind railings and privet hedge stationed at the corner, and The Christian Science Hall  not far away from the Noncomformist Chapel. These places of worship were stationed at the boundaries of the town and gave shelter to their own school and choir, plus sundry other associations and groups… the largest congregation attending the Roman Catholic Church whose congregation spilled out onto the car-park and pavement after the service, showing bonhomie and goodwill. Church going was undoubtably for the few. Religion had suffered at the hands or two world wars that threatened life and limb for millions, questioning the love of god which allows all such suffering. Eventually this falling off affected all those things associated with a religious upbringing including attached youth clubs.

Every national club and association celebrated Saint George’s Day, The Sovereign’s Birthday, Empire Day and other special events associated with the club.  The National Flag of St. George was raised on those special national days. The majority of boys in every town were members of national youth associations like the Boy Scouts, Church Lads, or Boys Brigade. Older youths joined Army, Navy, and Air Force Cadet Corps. Girls too had their organisations, which they usually finished when they reached school-leaving age - at fifteen or sixteen. Monthly church parades saw the various organizations march behind each other following the Boys Brigade band. Flags held at the slope before the church door as the signatories filed in… lead by The Mayor. This show of convention and conformity was looked on seriously by all concerned not as an embarrassment but as a local gathering of solidarity.

Other than perhaps the architecture and town planning this was a society that had changed little from that lived for the last twenty-five years. Patterns of life and expectancy were set before that period. Most residents upbringing went back to the turn of the century codes of late Victorian life - maintaining behaviour learnt when children were inbuded with standards acknowledging shame, honour, duty, integrity and honesty expected and not only talked about by parents but also emphasised at school, church and youth club. Sundays were a day of rest. No games allowed, no card playing, and ‘no going to the pictures’. Church attendance, reading, going for walks, picking blackberries in the summer, filling a stamp album in the winter, listening to the radio… all these were allowed and encouraged.

General heating in all homes was by coal fire and the cooking by gas. Lead pipes continued to be laid and no loft or window insulation installed. Cavity walls were not thought of, concrete or breezeblocks unknown and pipe work inside the house exposed. Damp courses laid in slate and all wood joints nailed, not bolted or screwed. In the winter ice formed on the insides of the windows and there was always the danger of pipes freezing up. Plugs were kept in the sink to stop the dripping tap freezing the outflow pipe - becoming blocked.

Terms of endearment were never used, love - not mentioned, affection never exhibited. Hand holding, kissing and arms round shoulders not countenanced. Boys followed a Kiplinesque character raised to serve the nation, and girls nursed those that were injured. Sexual thoughts words and deeds never spoken of. This was not only a source of guilty daydreaming but total embarrassment. Procreation, it seems, was a mystery to the nation. All this may suggest frustration - being lonely and unloved, but that would be wrong. If society proceeded along these lines and no questions asked, who was going to change or challenge it? 'Ignorance is Bliss' declares the popular radio programme. Perhaps society was downtrodden, or could it have been reasonably happy... I believe it was the latter. There were still many craft skills that needed filling...  what father did still controlled many children’s choice of a job. What was shown at the cinema - mostly made in America, and what was printed in glossy magazines, became the latest craze, which had a knock-on effect - to be copied here. Even though the country had gone through two world wars compared to today's world it was an age of innocence.

The chairman of the Great Central Railway, which had joint running rights over the Metropolitan line, decided the correct place to build the new stations. The fields, between where the Edwardian houses finished and the Arts and Crafts Houses, close to the golf club at Moor Park, would be extensively developed, with three-hundred roads created. The existing railways stations could no longer cope with the influx of passengers. The station opened on the 22nd March 1915 just where a farm access road passed under the existing line. The Metropolitan Railway Line affected the character of north-west Middlesex. The peak year for new-builds was 1934. The houses were built for white-collar workers and highly paid manual workers. Average weekly wage was then £2.15s.0d.

The new station, opened in 1915,  nestled in a hollow under the railway bridge… spanning Station Road, was recognisable by the telephone boxes - at the entrance to the booking hall… The architectural style looked to the age of art deco rather than art nouveau - observed in the letterform, tile, and paintwork’s colour scheme. It declared the age of the Metropolitan Railway Line… a line that ran between Bakers Street and Amersham, Aldersgate and Aylesbury. The train company’s brown livery decorated the carriages. All the Aylesbury line locomotives were steam driven, as were a number on the Metropolitan - the majority however were powered by electric motors. It was not until some years after the war that the line was completely electrified.

The carriages held ten people sitting - five on either side. In the rush hour, a further six stood… swaying, while adjusting their stance - attempting to keep their feet. Clasping hold of the luggage rack, each tried to read. Smokers, who were the majority, relied on the nearest person to open the window, to suffer the draughts, occasional drops of rain, and smoke… The interior sprung seats bounced the occupants to the tune of the joints in the rail, as the train swayed and lurched along the track… The seated, appreciating their luck, began to nod off… It was only the first and last compartments that banned smoking, all the others smelt strongly of tobacco. On cold and wet days, the carriage windows soon streamed with condensation - areas cleared of mist, made by the person sitting next to the window, gave a clue to the whereabouts of the train on the line. The dripping raincoats, flapping umbrellas, and sneezing passengers heaved a concerted sigh as the train moves off… conversation again stilled as newspapers reopened… At eye level, underneath the netted luggage racks, brass-framed prints advertised seaside resorts… A London underground map took up the centre frame, frequently hidden when the carriage was crowded, causing panic for passengers unfamiliar with the line - not knowing where they were.  Platforms and waiting rooms were made mainly of wood emblazoned with hearts and arrows carved by the younger passengers, who, on the walls, proclaiming their hearts desire… more pungent cartoonists, criticised the punctuality of trains – which they often, ‘died waiting for…!’

At night, looking out the front bedroom windows, could be seen the orange glow of opened fireboxes, as the firemen shovelled in another load of coal. The shunting tank engines, coupling-up their wagons in the sidings, gave cheery toots, as their flashy cousins - the express trains, thundered on their way giving - warnings more urgent – a shriek, that gradually fell away, as they disappeared up the line. The nightly routine of coal delivery into the pens continued supervised by the siding's controller, as the nightlong process resumed...

As with all large towns several bus routes serviced the citizens, some ran to the nearest main town and beyond. They were mostly single deckers and all had their conductors - who issued punched tickets. They ran at ten-minute intervals servicing a growing queue as the time-approached rush hour. A bus ride was a community affair: getting on and off, lurching from hand bar to strap… up the bus; the favoured seat, ringing the bell, standing in packed togetherness, listening to each other’s conversations; wiping the condensation off the windows… It was not often that someone was turned away even if the bus was overloaded… The conductor stood at the door taking the fares of all the unpaid passengers - those he was unable to reach when he forced his way up the aisle… piling up the spent ticket underfoot. He was an expert at issuing out loose change, having a pile of pennies in his hand ready, as he punched the green cards.
 
Horses and liveried carts made local deliveries. Housewives took in a delivery of milk - in quart, pint, and half-pint bottles; quite often the milkman he would leave a crate for collection - the next time he called. The rag-and-bone man came round in his cart calling out ‘any-old-iron’ or ‘rag-a-bones’ in a sing-song voice and the knife-sharpener echoed with ‘scissors-to-grind’. The newspaper seller, on the corner of the high road, stood by his upturned orange box outside United Dairies, his newspapers folded under his arm,  calling out, through clenched rolled cigarette, ‘star, news or standard’.

Coal and coke was delivered in hundred weight sacks by the coalman wearing his leather hood and shoulder apron. At least four times a year a gypsy woman called to sell pegs and a posy of heather. Children played in the streets and called at each other’s houses. Roller-skaters held onto the backs of passing carts… The chalked stumps, still visible on the garage doors from the match the day before… stayed - all through the war. Front doors remained open in the summer behind sun blinds as the breeze ruffled the material... There was no fear of intruders!

The jolliest annual attraction - attended by the majority of children, was the local fair… the license granted by King Edward III in 1336. Their parents, needing little encouragement, attended in the evening. The fair took up the whole of the High Street being within arms length of the houses on either side of the road. Stalls and merry-go-rounds, helter-skelter, ghost house and candyfloss, roll-a-penny and toss a ring, all vied for attention… the stall owners shouting out in encouragement. The streamers, strung lights and colourful bunting all contributed to the colourful occasion whilst the steam organs piped-out the old pre-war tunes... The fair, held on one day only - the first Wednesday-after-Whit… [Its Charter awarded by Edward I], was always well attended, even during the war years. There were never any disturbances needing the authority of a policeman although they were very evident.

As there was no town industry, it was unusual to see any heavy traffic. The one exception was the brewer’s dray drawn by four huge shire horses, with jingling harness and tiny brass bells on their heads, driven by the drayman with his bowler hat, sitting on a high seat at the front of the dray. The heavy open sided wagon clattered along the road making for The the town's Hotel. Its ironclad wheels appeared to us boys as massive. The drayman had a waterproof sheet drawn over his knees in all weathers, at his side a long whip stood in its holder. The carrier’s van would be seen most days. The only large motor wagon belonged to the local removers, its green painted sides proclaimed its purpose guaranteeing ‘same day service’. 

As the prosperity of the townspeople improved some of the fathers acquired motor bikes whilst others added a sidecar. The wife sat on the pillion seat and the children sat in the sidecar. It was a popular way for families to meet up – having a day out at the seaside. As there were few cars, the motorcycle assumed an important part of family life. The A. A. patrolman was available for their owners assistance if they became members. The brown uniformed patrolman had a regular route to patrol and their motorbike and sidecar painted a bright yellow was often to be seen. The sidecar carried all his equipment necessary for basic repairs. His brown uniform jacket, jodhpurs, calf high leather boots and leather gauntlets were accompanied by polished brass buttons, peaked hat and A. A. badge If he passed a car or motorbike bearing an association badge he saluted whether he was attending to a repair or not. His route took him past the yellow boxes decorated with a little garden which carried a telephone which either he could use of any member of the association.

The nearest box was in Station Road close to The British Restaurant. The British Restaurant chain was a government institution organized in 1942 to cater for people who could not for one reason or another cook their own meals. There was one at Bennett’s Park, Station Road, and behind the cinema. For a shilling, you could buy a three-course meal when they first opened. They were cheaply built, as prefabrications on a concrete slab and seen in most large towns. Others situated in suitable halls or galleries. In effect they were soup kitchens but on a far larger scale and served a variety of meals. After the war they still existed but soon operated on a different footing having to make a profit - hired out for jumble sales and evening classes – in effect became community centres. By 1943, they served 700,000 meals per day charging an increased fee of 1 shilling and tuppence [about 6p] for a two-course meal.

Sharing the same site, at the back of The British Restaurant, was the Home Guard Hut.  It served also as Number 21, Air Raid Precautions [ARP], and Wardens’ post.
Just up Station Road almost on the corner of the crossroads was the cinema. The Associated British Cinema [ABC] group owned the classically styled Embassy Cinema, which opened in October 1929. The frontage, decorated with linked railings, bordered oblong gardens decorating the ‘notice boards’ giving the current and future film previews. The large, wooden, double doors at the side of the cinema, lead to the deserted car park - marked out at the back. Beyond… the towns wood yard – opposite the British Restaurant.

The ‘pictures’ or ‘flicks’ – was the main form of public entertainment; from the earliest, silent, black and white films to cinemascope and Technicolor, upto the age of television it performed its role for fifty years. The sound, delivered from a single, central source behind the square screen - had to wait until after the war to be improved - not a patch on Technicolor and stereophonic sound, of later times. The majority of cinema audiences participated at least once a week… watching films from Hollywood – a life very different - made the entertainment romantic and exciting. Every night queues formed outside the cinema behind price boards – the queues stretched right round the cinema. Patrons slowly shuffled in during, but mainly after, each three-hour performance; if there were no seats left then there was standing room only, which you might have to put up with for the whole length of the film. 

A thick, grey, smoky haze greeted the ticket holder as the usherette’s torch sent a beam of projected light into the black interior… penetrating the fog… lighting-up the rows of seats. The rustle of sweet papers and the rasp of matches punctuated the film’s performance. Courting couples filled the back row, with those standing, unable to have seats, leaning over the rail. The main event – ‘A’ film, was the public draw - enticed the audience in. A newsreel followed the advertisements and trailers… before the second featured, ‘B’ film. Larger cinemas, particularly on a Saturday evening, would put on a talent contest, band, or organ recital… with the audience singing along - following the words shown on the screen. The nearest large cinema was the Granada, which also accommodated the Herga cinema and the rather grand Coliseum theatre. It was an enormous treat to sit in its plush, red seats - particularly in the circle, and see the occasional West End Shows. The Langham in Bridge Street, was part of a small chain called the Modern Cinema Company opening in 1936. The Grosvenor became part of the Odeon chain opened the same year. 

The area Police Station was two miles down the Road. You would always see a police officer on duty walking along the main street of all towns - at least twice a day, and again during the night… checking all the shop’s doors and windows, the alleyways and side roads. The patrolling sergeant, who would phone into the police station - using the blue call boxes found at most main-road junctions. If, as a child, or even adult, told to ‘abide by the law’ you did as instructed. Police officers were very much-respected citizens, perhaps, even feared… They saw to it that there was no cycling on the pavements and bikes had efficient brakes and a bell.

All parks, recreation grounds and sports areas monitored by their Keepers – who acted very much like police officers in their duties. The Yeading Walk Gardens or Streamside Walk, and Park Way, as all the other parks in the Borough, had carefully designed flowerbeds arranged in floral decoration – to give a fantastic riot of colour all summer season. Their beauty replicated those gardens at the seaside and London parks. The grass beautifully manicured and the edges trimmed. No cycling or roller-skating - no walking on the grass or running about. The garden’s facilities were built for recreational walking and it good maintenance, considered important to the town’s standing. Bands played every weekend at the larger parks… fountains worked, paving regularly levelled and autumn leaves gathered… Cricket pitches, bowling greens and tennis courts all carefully manicured and maintained. Competitions organised by the local authorities, between each other – award certificates to the best Head Gardner… who - vied to outdo each other… The workers used their winning certificates to obtain better jobs. Councils produced their own seedlings, trees, and plants at the town’s nursery. The local park was Streamside Walk - its paths wandered over stones bridges… alongside the river. 

Streets had their own sweepers, who swept into the gutters the dust and waste - made up into piles, to be loaded onto their carts and taken back to the Council depot. Dustmen called once a week in the corporation dustcart, which had curved sliding-lids to half a dozen compartments. Each house had their own dustbin… there being no limit to the amount collected or type… just size - which could be picked up later if it could not be thrown up onto the roof of the wagon. A great deal of waste was thrown onto the kitchen fire or onto the garden bonfire - along with the garden clippings. There was little or no packaging… most meat or dairy produce was wrapped in greaseproof paper. Gas lampposts had small wire-caged boxes attached to take cigarette boxes or sweet paper, there being no large receptacles. Sand boxes were conveniently placed at main street corners, hills and level crossing - to give grip for horses and cars - in icy conditions.

{{navigate|Next=Numbers}}

Take a look at [[n:Bird_flu_may_infect_20_percent_of_world's_population,_kill_millions|this news report]] (at &lt;span class=&quot;plainlinks&quot;&gt; http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Bird_flu_may_infect_20_percent_of_world's_population,_kill_millions &lt;/span&gt;). The Spanish 'flu killed 50 million people. But is that exact? Surely it could have killed 50,000,000,001? Or perhaps 49,999,999,999? Of course! The numbers are not '''exact''' because it is '''approximate'''. But what do '''exact''', '''approximate''', and '''estimate''' mean in mathematics? How can we estimate?

== What is estimation? ==
{{sidebox|&lt;center&gt;&lt;big&gt;Definition table&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;|
*'''Approximation''': Making numbers simpler
**'''Approximate''': (''adj'') A number that is close to the exact value
*'''Estimation''': Guessing data, but trying to be close enough
**'''Estimate''': (''v'') To guess data while trying to be close enough
*'''Exact value''': The 100% correct value of a number
}}
Take a look at this number.
&lt;center&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;6&quot;&gt;'''213,487,104,577'''&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Big number, huh? Now let's make it a tad simpler.
&lt;center&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;6&quot;&gt;'''213,400,000,000'''&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Ta-daa! It's much neater than the previous one. So what did we do? Did we use...
*...estimation?
*...approximation?

The answer is approximation. Approximation is the science of making numbers simpler. However, approximation is a crucial element of estimation. In a broad sense, estimation means guessing some kind of value and trying to be as close to the real value as we want. Sometimes the result can be really far off, however, as we will see later.

There are different ways of estimating. In mathematics, we often estimate the result of an operation because we don't want to waste time calculating the whole thing. We do the same in daily life. Sometimes, different methods of estimation may be suitable in some contexts, but unsuitable in others. We shall explore that further on in this book.

An '''error''' occurs when there is a difference between the exact and approximate value of something. We will discuss this in detail later as we need to know about some other basic concepts of approximation and estimation first.

== Why estimate? ==
Why should we estimate? First, estimation can give us the rough idea about something. Sometimes, we need to calculate something but do not have a calculator or paper and pen. We must use mental mathematics to get the answer. That' where estimation comes in handy. Secondly, estimation can allow us to see whether our answer is reasonable. Consider the following example.

&lt;center&gt;34+62=299&lt;/center&gt;

By estimating the answer of 34+62=299, we find that the answer is unreasonable and incorrect.

Why should we use approximation?

We can use approximation to remember something more easily. For example, do you think it is easier to remember that 10 million people died in the Spanish 'flu pandemioc, or that 10,794,194 people died? Probably 10 million! We can also use approximation when the exact value of something is unknown or constantly changing. The world population is one of the best examples. It is changing constantly, because people are born every second. We can never find out the exact value in measurements. This will be discussed later on.

== Vocabulary list ==
*[[:simple:wikt:Approximation|Approximation]]
*{{st|Estimation}}
*{{st|Exact}}
*[[w:Approximate error|Error]]

== Exercise ==
Give one example of estimation and one example of approximation in daily life.

Answers:
Answers will vary.

Is it possible to compile Qt 64Bit on a 32Bit Windows? --[[Special:Contributions/92.79.131.147|92.79.131.147]] ([[User talk:92.79.131.147|talk]]) 15:08, 17 September 2010 (UTC)

• Yes, you just need to install and set-up the x64 compiler from Visual Studio, properly.

I think your list is so good that I have taken this to the [http://de.wikibooks.org/wiki/Gitarre:_Auswahl_einiger_Lieder_mit_Akkorden German wikibooks]. If our list will be revised, then I add the supplements in your list. Greeting from Germany --[[User:Mjchael|Mjchael]] ([[User talk:Mjchael|talk]]) 15:40, 17 September 2010 (UTC)

== Stars ==
I would recommend leaving out the grey stars as it looks like it's saying 1/3, meaning this page is a third finished, just one star would be better to mean easy, or just the words 'easy', 'int' and 'adv' might be clearer. - [[Special:Contributions/149.255.38.228|149.255.38.228]] ([[User talk:149.255.38.228|discuss]]) 15:57, 9 February 2012 (UTC)

== I'm going to recommend that this page be deleted ==

I'm going to request a deletion of this page. It consist of external links - that is all it is. Wikibooks is not a directory for external links. There are millions of tabs out there and the list can be construed as endless.

Cheers

:I object. This is a very useful page for novice guitarists whom are looking for one place to go to in order to easily access a large variety of simple chords to notable songs from all time. I agree that such a list can theoretically be endless (especially if at some time in the future hundreds of people would become involved in the expansion of the list), nevertheless, as the list would keep on growing we could re organize the content and split it into various pages (for example - a new division to the content based on the genre of songs). The best proof for how useful this page is for novice guitar players can be found in it's statistics page - as you can see [http://stats.grok.se/en.b/latest/Guitar/Guitar_Chords_Song_Library here], this page is the 33rd most watch page on Wikibooks! (it was watched 13,393 times in the last 30 days alone!). [[User:Kodos|Kodos]] ([[User talk:Kodos|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kodos|contribs]]) 14:33, 17 August 2013 (UTC)
::I've removed RFD tag + restored original lists, minus the external links, as a lot of time passed since RFD placement yet there wasn't anyone else besides Sluffs whom demanded the article be deleted, and as the alternative was actually much worse. I plan on improving the lists as much as I can in the near future. [[User:Kodos|Kodos]] ([[User talk:Kodos|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kodos|contribs]]) 17:27, 8 May 2014 (UTC)

There was no consensus at RFD.

== Welcome, GoRight! ==

Congratulations.

I think you will find the smaller wikis a vast improvement in sense of community and general helpfulness, over en.wikipedia. Just remember to be nice! Wikibooks has some special rules; a simple summary is that Wikibooks is intended for textbooks, and original research isn't allowed. But some kinds of original writing are allowed. However, Wikiversity, which is historically and practically connected with Wikibooks, is very clear that you can present original research, and you can opt out of NPOV on pages. If you proceed slowly, you will be, I'm sure, helped should you cross some boundary.

One rule I encourage you to follow: don't import disputes here from other wikis. If you run into a user you had problems with elsewhere, avoid assuming you will have problems with that person here. Don't accuse people here of misbehavior based on what they did there. And should someone follow you here with accusations, step aside. Don't fall for the temptation to respond intemperately. You will find admins on these smaller wikis are generally not inclined to jump for blocks. The small wikis need users, they don't want to drive them away! En.wikipedia, this isn't.

Respect the community here, and it will respect you. It is not uncommon for users banned from Wikipedia to become sysops on the other wikis. It kinda changes one's attitude. --[[User:Abd|Abd]] ([[User talk:Abd|talk]]) 04:32, 18 September 2010 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
The table below is based on the vocabulary from the [[French]] book, which is gathered on [[../French Word List |this page]]. CEFR references relate to [http://www.coe.int/t/dg4/linguistic/Source/FinalBreakthrough%20specification_6Nov01.rtf this paper] from the Council of Europe [http://www.coe.int/t/dg4/linguistic/Publications_EN.asp web site]. The &quot;Pattern&quot; column labels the verbs according to Bescherelle's system.
