|&lt;h1&gt;&lt;center&gt;Part 1: Articles and Nouns&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
In Part 1 we will discuss articles and nouns, as they relate to holidays and celebrations.  &lt;br&gt;
Before we move into more complicated grammar components, starting off with a general &lt;br&gt;
understanding of how masculine and feminine structures work in Spanish will give a great basis.&lt;br&gt;

'''Spiritual Almanac'''
(taken from discussions on Internet forums about Yoga, God, religion, mysticism and spirituality)

My personal basis in philosophy is that of happiness. This philosophy is based on the Greek Epicurus and modern research on happiness. I believe striving toward happiness is at the core of human existence. Everyone would like to be happy and to avoid suffering. The highest level of happiness is [[w:Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]]. Enlightenment is at the core of happiness philosophy. You could also describe this as a life in light, or the kingdom of God (paradise).
 
I’ve searched for a way to lasting happiness my entire life. This path has lead me to the philosophy of Epicurus. Later, I became occupied with Buddhism, Taoism, Hinduism, and Christianity. I found helpful techniques everywhere among these teachings. Professionally, I was a lawyer first and then a Yoga teacher and a psychotherapist. I am for the unity of religions and the personal way of spirituality for each person. People of all religions should work together toward a happy world. They should speak to one another, and learn from one another.

[[File:Socrates.jpg|thumb|Socrates: What is the meaning of life?]] 

1. The greatest happiness is experienced in a life of light (in God, in enlightened existence) and in all-encompassing love. When one lives with this depth of meaning of life, one no longer needs to search for the meaning of life.
 
2. The basis of the spiritual way is enlightenment, sainthood, life in light (in the kingdom of God). God is to be found in each and every one of us, and in order to find God one has to change their consciousness, to be aware of God. The important thing is to find peace, love, happiness and joy and to develop them in oneself. The main techniques along the way to enlightenment are meditation and thought work. 

3. With meditation, you can find a calm inner state. You can quiet the thoughts with a mantra or prayer, through concentration on an outer or inner point, or through conscious observation and stopping the thoughts. Then peace and calm can exist. What’s fascinating is that with a longer practice of meditation, inner joy and happiness arise as well.
 
4. Inner peace and happiness arise when you work consistently on your thoughts. When you overcome thoughts and feelings like rage, addiction and fear by stopping the thoughts or by replacing the negative thoughts with positive thoughts. When that is successfully achieved, peace of mind can be obtained. Then the mind can concern itself with positive things. If you concentrate on love, happiness and joy in life and then live these qualities as well, then happiness and joy in life will arise naturally.

5. At some point a change occurs in the spirit. You arrive at a higher level of happiness. You experience life as mainly a happy thing. The more you cleanse your inner being, the greater your happiness can become, until enlightenment is achieved. Enlightenment is a very particular level of the spirit. The spirit is so far removed  from negativity, addiction, fear and rage that the light of God can flow within. Enlightenment can be described as existence without attachments, without addictions (the “I am” from Moses, one rests in the simple state of being and is no longer attached to worldly things), as being conscious of God (unity consciousness, one lives in light in the kingdom of God) and as happiness (inner happiness, joy and love).  These three characteristics belong together and serve one another. 

6. With emphasis on taking the path of inner calm, we can reach a God-consciousness, which means we can find God in inner peace and calm. We can also concentrate on developing a consciousness of unity. We can identify with other people and other beings. We can wish them happiness and help them as much as possible.

7. If you experience other people in a positive way, you know what all-encompassing love is. It develops as an encompassing inner happiness, a unity consciousness of love that at some point leads to enlightenment. Jesus taught the way of all-encompassing love for that reason. He also advised his followers to love their enemies. We can consider our enemies among our own problems and suffering. If we can accept this, see this in a positive light and love, then we have found a way to God-consciousness. In order to enter the kingdom of God, your love must be all-encompassing, unconditional, and practiced constantly. I send all beings light and pray for my fellow humans every day. I work for a world of love, peace and happiness.

8. It’s important to me also remember to enjoy life, to keep joy in life, besides taking the path of inner calm and all-encompassing love. I love myself enough. I do what is fun. I enjoy life every day. I know spiritual exercises with which I can create happiness in myself, in a way comparable to Jesus’ transfiguration on the mountain. Jesus prayed to God, and visualized God in himself, and meditated (brought his thoughts to a state of calm rest) and came to the light.

9.  How do you have fun in life? There are a lot of opportunities to take to create joy in life. It varies from person to person. You can eat something you like, listen to good music, watch a nice film, talk to positive people or chat with them online. You can do something creative, such as making music, painting, and writing, exercising or playing sports or look for a fascinating mission. I like to make videos and to save the world. It’s important to center yourself in your inner happiness first, otherwise everything is superficial and pointless. I also consider which spiritual exercises I need each day in order to arrive at this state of happiness. If you have inner happiness, then joy in life will develop almost by itself. You only need little things to enjoy to experience the beauty of life.

10. Those who see themselves as being responsible for saving the world will never be bored. There is always something to do. It doesn’t have to be anything big. You can speak some kind words to build up other people, or say a prayer for people or save the life of an animal. I can constantly save the lives of frogs, toads and snails. I bless them then. In this way good karma results that will at some point come back to me. I can even send good karma to other people if I have too much. Doing good is a lot of fun, as long as you don’t overwhelm yourself and as long as you are creative about it. 

11. The path of a spiritual practice varies from individual to individual. I live as a hermit. For me, the spiritual practice is different than for someone with a career and a family. It is even further removed when you live as a monk or a nun in a monastery. I live according to a spiritual plan for each day. I cleanse my inner being by reading, praying, going for walks, meditating and working. I do everything at the right moment and for the right amount of time so that I am constantly in the state of cleansing. It takes a lot of inner sense and discipline. 

12. I had a lot of enlightenment experiences. I have gotten to know the mystery of God. I have risen to high levels of paradise consciousness with my spirit. But I still have a lot to cleanse. One could say that I am still just a poor sinner. I have lived as a hermit for 25 years. The inner cleansing takes a long time for most people. At the moment, I am going through a phase of intense transformation. I live in times of happiness, in times of darkness, and times of inner conflict. I experience my way as being lead by God. Everything seems to follow an exact plan, but I don’t know what lies ahead; the end of the plan.

13. I follow the path of the Christian desert masters. They described exactly how one should live as a spiritual hermit, how one should practice. The main point of the desert fathers is that you should sit in your hut and then feel out an effective way of spiritual practice. This was called “your hut will teach you.” Enlightenment appears basically through the way of rest, love, and thought work. God is to be found in the calm. Modern research in happiness states that calm makes you happy. The art of the spiritual way is to find the correct amount of calm. Too much rest makes one lazy and slow. The desert fathers recommended not only to sit in your hut and wait for the spirit of God, but to work toward this. 

14. On the other hand, they warned about too much work. If you stretch a bow to far, it will break. If a hermit or monk is too active on the outside then God cannot come in because God needs calm. The calm must be great enough that the body and spirit can heal from the inner tension. The hermits in the  desert had enough calm already due to their isolated life, separate from the outside world. A constantly calm state feels unbearable first, but that is how the process of inner healing can begin. 

15. Problems with enough rest result in a monastery. Here there’s the danger one might work too much, or let oneself be distracted by one another, so that the inner process needed for oneself cannot be established, or to lose oneself in external rules. A basic rule of the desert fathers was to work only as much as the space the body needs when it lies down. God is the focus, and not the work. The work should only serve to bring forth a life in God (in light) and to hold onto that. A hermit has to sensitively feel out how much work will take him or her forward toward that goal. 

16. On the path to God, a deciding factor is the nature of one’s thoughts. A spiritual person has to find a way to dissolve inner conflict, blockages and false images to the best of his or her ability. He or she has to overcome fear, addiction and rage. This way, at some point in time an inner change will occur and that person will arrive in a state of happiness. In that sense, he or she is healed. The victory over suffering is the awakening of inner light. 

17. Having people accompany you in life makes the way easier. Two people can live in love, if they put their relationship together in the right way. Two people can support each other along the spiritual way. They can strengthen one another energetically and mentally. God made man and woman so that they can live together in paradise. The main story in the bible shows that. The mystery is that they can both awaken the kundalini snake that wraps itself around the tree of enlightenment with their love and sexual energy. They were then allowed to eat the apple of enlightenment which stands for unity, oneness and life in God (symbolized through its round shape). I lived without much contact for ten years. Then I realized some contact does me good.  It’s wonderful that it’s very simple and easy to get contact with other people over the internet. 

18. I’ve tried a lot of different things in my life. I’ve done karate, I’ve gone hiking, went dancing in clubs, went skiing, discussed political topics at events and visited psychology seminars. I had a political, philosophical, a psychological and a spiritual phase. At the moment, everything has rather come to rest. For awhile, I practiced strictly and now I practice more according to how I feel. The only difficult thing for me at present are the extremely powerful kundalini developments. I hope, though, that one day I will get over that phase and simply be in happiness, in peace, love and strength. 

19. Western yogis are free to shape their spiritual paths according to their needs. Some live alone, some in a group, and others in a relationship. I live my life in a way that makes me feel well. It’s important for me to have a mission or goal that excites me. I’ve studied a lot of different things, taken various workshops in the spiritual scene and written a lot of books and lead a lot of yoga groups. My path is never boring. 

20.  I see myself as a mystic who is beyond religions but somehow also finds himself within all of the religions. In enlightenment, I experienced a dimension that can be described as God, nirvana, or unity. I recognized that religions use different names for this state of consciousness. My enlightenment experience allowed me to see the common thread between Christianity and Buddhism. This common thread is the enlightened state of being. Moses could see the light of God in the world (the burning bush) and received knowledge of “ I am “ in God. This “ I am” state is achieved when the ego disappears and when one arrives in unity consciousness. This unity consciousness canbe given the name “Nirvana”. Nirvana means deletion, nothing, emptiness, dissolution of the ego. It isn’t an absolute state of nothingness, rather one arrives in light via this state of nothingness. Nothingness and happiness go together. In Christianty Master Eckhart and Pseudo-Dionysius Areopagita (negative theology) worked with this concept particularly. 

21. I would like to share with you my kundalini experiences. First there was a very strenuous phase which lasted some five weeks. The chakras opened and the energy started to flow intensely. Every few days I had a short break to recover, then it started up again. Then I had a few weeks of rest. I used that time to mentally prepare myself, which was useful since the whole process started up again. A few times I was really at my wits’ end,  really at the limit of what I can take. What bothered me the most were the sleepless nights. I could only get myself through with the help of spiritual exercises. 

22. The energy processes vary a lot. The night before yesterday I observed this. I sat in front of the television and felt how the tension in my solar plexus chakra eased. This transformation period took two hours. I had the feeling that my body was being turned inside out. I felt a tugging everywhere, and felt I might break down. I watched very interesting films on TV so that I would be distracted enough from my inner crisis so I could get through it. Ten after 24 hours the energy began to flow through the solar plexus chakra into the body. I felt like I was under an intense electrical charge and couldn’t sleep. But it was a form of happiness energy, so this made it easier to get through. 

23. The nightly processes of tension dissolving are varied. They range from painful to enjoyable to a combination. It depends on whether the happiness energy dominates or the dissolving of old tension and problems. Mostly the nights are a mixture of both and are rather difficult. I have to constantly consider which spiritual techniques (visiualization, mantras, meditation, yoga poses) will help me through the process. The right technique dissolves blockages and gets the energy to flow again. Sometimes I have to try one thing for awhile before it starts to work effectively.
 
24. In bigger conflicts I listen to the help of my masters. Once I thought I wouldn’t make it through the night because I was so exhausted from the strain of the previous days. I fell asleep immediately and felt better, even though the energy flow in my body was so strong I never would have thought I could sleep. One day I needed to get things done that required a lot of inner strength, and that was after a sleepless night. Right before getting out of bed, strength shot through me. I felt like I had the strength of a giant and could use that to get everything done. This was a miracle to me. 

25. The energy isn’t just felt by me, but from other people too. A woman visited me as I was at that time working on the energy in me. She was so happy near me that she hardly wanted to go home. As I visited my mother, happiness energy suddenly flowed through me and I was happy to rest in bliss for about an hour. That affected my mother, too. Our conversation was calm and positive. 

26. I’m a lazy Yogi at the moment. My yoga consists of a walk while doing breath of fire and mantras. I lay in bed in yoga posititions and meditate. That’s enough for me right now. I am constantly in intense energy processes. My main meditation is watching TV. I am just there and live my life. I connect with God every day and my enlightened masters. I listen to my inner voice and do what it advises me at any given moment. That’s how I get through all of my spiritual crises. 

27. There are many bad gurus. I recommend that everyone test the enlightened masters and to follow only the good ones. For me, they are Buddha, Jesus, Patanjali, Laotse and Socrates. Their teachings can help us find our way to light. 

28. It began with the awakening of my ability to sense energy in 1986. Since that time, I can feel the energy of other people and help them. In 1987 I started small meditation groups where I also taught positive thinking. At that time, I still worked as a lawyer. After splitting up with my ex wife I gave up my lawyer profession and have lived as a hermit for 25 years. In the course of the last few years I’ve written a lot of texts online in German and English. Many people connect with me mentally and spiritually. I feel their energy, their trust and help them as much as I can.

29. I had a happy family, a nice wife and a lovable son. But life is constant change. Now I live as a hermit. How do you arrive in light? In that you leave material things behind and develop inner happiness. Enlightenment exceeds even the happiness of the happiest family. 
30. I’ve recognized that the deepest point of life is to be happy and to live in all-encompassing love. One arrives in all-encompassing love when one works for a happy world. If you have this goal, there is always something to do. Life is never boring and always has a purpose. One just has to see in any given moment, what needs to be done and what one can do. 

31. Everyone is allowed to find his own spiritual way. I refer to the enlightened masters and their teachings which inspire me. I can say that I have the feeling my way works for me. I am careful and approach the spiritual path with wisdom. I generally advise following a gentle spiritual way.

1. A yogi is a person who practices yoga. Yoga consists of physical and mental, spiritual exercises. The goal of yoga is to develop the self, to find enlightenment. There are many different directions in yoga. Yoga goes beyond religion. Buddha was also a yogi. Even the Christian dessert teachers were yogis. 

2. Yoga is there for people, and for that reason needs to be adapted to cultural and personal conditions. The modern western yoga is different from the traditional, Indian yoga. Often, yoga is only practiced as bodily exercise in the west, with the goal of flexibility, health, beauty or relaxation. The spiritual content is missing. That’s a problem for many Indian yoga masters such as Swami Sivananda. For me, it’s OK. Variation is the strength of western yoga. 

3. Enlightenment takes place through the dissolving of tension (energy blockages) in the body and spirit. The way to this end varies from person to person and requires a good inner sense for what one needs at any given time. Sometimes extreme exercises and sometimes gentle ones are necessary, depending on the given moment. Rigid dogma is the wrong way. A real enlightened master gives every student exactly what that student needs. 

4. I go about finding what does me good along the spiritual path in an undogmatic way. I’m vegetarian and don’t do any drugs (smoking, alcohol and other substances) or gamble. But sometimes I do eat meat when my body needs it. I get a buzz from chocolate or watching TV when my soul needs it. My game is called enlightenment. You never know when you will win and what comes next, and that’s what makes the spiritual way so exciting.  What is material gain next to eternal bliss?

5. And what about sexuality? Does a yogi have to do without it? No! For a tantric yogi, sexuality is also a way to God when practiced correctly. It’s important, according to the Hatha yoga principles, that one sticks to moral principles. For me, among the most important are loyalty in a relationship. If a yogi has a relationship, he or she should live by loyalty, love, and honesty. 

6. Self-disciplince is important on the path of yoga. Self-discipline is the main way to spiritual success, but one shouldn’t overdo it. Too feel discipline causes tension and energy blockages. One should sense exactly whether discipline is necessary at any given time, or whether being laidback is more appropriate. Staying in an asana for hours can be a good thing or a bad thing. Buddha found that extreme practice makes the body weak and for that reason suggested a middle way. Why should one practice in the extreme cold of a cave in the Himalayas when you can practice in a nice warm house in Germany, with an internet connection? Why rub ashes onto yourself when you can wash yourself with soap? Why hold your breath when you can succeed with simpler exercises? 

7. Along the yogic path, one gets great power. The chakras open up, the kundalini energy is activated and spiritual energy develops in an unimaginable way. The spiritual energy is neutral and can be abused. For that reason a yogi should always ground him or herself in love, empathy and humility. Yoga should be combined with positive thinking. 

8. A yogi should hold to the ten ground rules of Patanjali. 1. Non-violence (Ahimsa). Don’t hurt or kill others. Be ready for peace, live gently. 2. Truth (Satya) Live in truth. Be honest to yourself and others. 3. Righteousness (Asteya). Don’t steal, cheat or betray. A yogi is honest in his life’s work. 4. Wisdom (Brahmacharya) . Live spiritually, in wisdom(Brahmacharya. Don’t serve money, serve God. Differentiate between the essential and the non-eseential. 5. Simplicity (Aparigraha). Have moderation in what you enjoy. A spiritual person lives modestly on the outside and richly on the outside. A yogi doesn’t use energy on what he does in the outer world, but lives calmly, and turns to the inside and cleanses himself from the inside. 

9. Further principles of yoga according to Patanjali: 6: Honoring the spiritual goal (Ishvara, the personal divinity). So that we don’t lose our spiritual way, it’s necessary to concentrate on our spiritual goals, and to refocus on them when necessary. 7. Sacrifice of the Ego. (Saucha, purification/cleansing). Without sacrificing the ego, it’s not possible to come to enlightenment. To sacrifice the ego the right way is an art. Those who sacrifice too much create tension. Those who sacrifice too little don’t dissolve any ego tension or attachments. How do you come to inner peace, inner strength, and all-encompassing love the right way today? What’s the right way for you at this given moment?

10. Further principles of yoga according to Patanjali. 8: Goal-oriented life (Tapas). Tapas means to lead a disciplined life. 9. Self-study. (Swadhyaya). Reading from a spiritual book daily helps us stay on the spiritual way, and makes us spiritual winners.10. Satisfaction (Santosha). Plan your day and your life so that you are satisfied. Which thoughts help you to come to satisfaction? 

11. There are gentle and there are extreme spiritual techniques. Extreme exercises can lead to spiritual breakthroughs. It’s important to practice with wisdom. For me, God makes my personal life sufficiently extreme. There are difficult faces to go through, again and again which lead to spiritual breakthroughs. They develop on their own, during my daily life. That’s enough. I generally prefer a gentle spiritual way. 

12. There are dogmatic and non-dogmatic people in spirituality. From my perspective, everything has it’s right to exist in the way of spirituality. It depends on whether you use wisdom to find the right path for you personally. Dogamtic people usually have great strength and are consistent along their way. If that’s connected to ego, then it leads to ego, and if connected with wisdom, leads to light. Unfortunately, dogmatic people are usually not able to apply self-awareness to their own situation. We need self-discipline and wisdom along the spiritual way to be successful. I feel out my way each day to find my personal combination of these elements, wisdom and self-discipline. 

13. The spiritual path is a free decision. Enlightenment is voluntary. No one is forced into happiness. The free will is respected. However, the brain is like a computer when we look at it closely. The mind is programmed through experiences and our reactions towards them, as well as our thoughts. An inner program comes into being, according to what a person decides. I have had countless experiences in the course of thousands of lives. I thought about life and established happiness as a goal of life. In this life, I read about the philosopher Epicurus and decided to take the path of inner happiness. It was a free decision. But I couldn’t do anything else but decide this, on the basis of what I knew before. According to Laotse, “if the wise learn of the true way, they must take that course. If a fool hears of the way of enlightenment, he laughs out loud. If he isn’t laughing, it isn’t the true spiritual path.”

14. The will of a human is free, to look at it from a very basic perspective. However, people make decisions based on outer impulses and inner programs, depending on the person. In this way, decisions are determined, or pre-determined. Only in enlightenment does a person get true freedom because he or she is free of worldly impulses, attachments and wishes. He or she is happy and in a desireless state because he or she is happy from the inside. This person doesn’t need any material things anymore to be happy. A life in the light of God is enough. He or she can still enjoy material existence if he or she likes though. 

15. Enlightenment is consciousness, pure and without an identity. In order to act in the world, a person has to take on an identity. In that case, you’re like a free actor who can decide which role you would like to take. The enlightened always know that it is just a roll. The enlightened are beyond all roles. They can decide to be the good guys or the bad guys. The path of evil strengthens the ego and distances one from light. The way of good encourages inner happiness and love. If you combine love with wisdom and self-discipline, you arrive along the way of good in a life of light. I also believe that you can arrive in light along the path of evil.  The path of evil causes you to encounter suffering, to achieve wisdom and then destroys attachments to the world. Before you arrive in enlightenment though, you have to get rid of your bad karma. Many evil people will often become saints or healers in their last lives on earth. 

16. I observe in myself that I mostly took the path of good in my earlier lives. For that reason, my mind is basically programmed along the path of good. Once I could decide freely within enlightenment, if I wanted to take on a good or evil identity, I automatically decided on the path of good. So that we have a lot of good enlightened people, the enlightenment path of love should be taught. The enlightenment path of love can take a bit longer than direct enlightenment, but the world benefits greatly from this. In Tibet some thousand years ago there was a conflict between Tibetan Buddhism (way of love) and Zen Buddhism (strict meditation and quick enlightenment). The Tibetan king decided on the way of love. For that reason, Tibetan Buddhism puts a lot of value in a thorough teaching of the mind. Only when a good basis in love and wisdom is achieved, can quick techniques and intensive meditation (three years as a yogi) lead to enlightenment. 

17. For me, God is formless, the incomprehensible behind all forms. Shiva, Vishnu and Brahma are just forms of God, just like Jesus, Buddha and Krishna are forms of godly consciousness. I root myself in the formless and use the form of God to bring myself forward in my concrete moments and to lead to light. Sometimes Krishna (the master of love) an inspiring role model, sometimes  Jesus (the master of ego sacrifice), sometimes Buddha (the master of peace and calm), sometimes Shiva (the strict yogi), sometimes Brahma (the wise), and sometimes Ganesha ( the God of happiness and joy in life). Another way to see it is that every spiritual role model has all of the important aspects and forms in God in itself. 

18. I don’t consider other religions to be less than my own. We should recognize one another as being equal in value. Only in this way can love and peace be built upon. Religious and cultural pluralism is the way in light today. 

19. After an intense practice of rune yoga I awoke with a distinct sense of energy. Since that time, I can sense the energy of others and mentally help them. In 1987, I also began to direct small groups in meditation and positive thinking. At the time I still worked as a lawyer. After separating from my ex-wife I gave up my lawyer practice and have lived as a hermit for 25 years. 

20. I believe I am lead by God and get all of the necessary help from God. As a former atheist I have experienced some difficulty in believing in God. But I observe that my life is directed in a mysterious way. If a crisis gets too big, I always get some help. Suddenly I can sleep, happiness energy is awakened, a nice person appears, or I can be happy about something. When I have to take care of things in the outside world, the cleansing process is reduced. Every day, an optimal development process takes place that normally challenges me a lot, but doesn’t overwhelm me. And that has been taking place for 25 years! 

21. I experience God as an identity-less ”I am”, as a higher consciousness. I can only say that life develops in a certain way that I think is steered. I can’t say who controls this. I think it comes from the enlightened masters I’m mentally connected with. You can see their pictures in this almanac. 

22. I see it like this: the enlightened masters comprise a complete consciousness that can help in the cosmos, to take direct action. Normally, this consciousness rests happily within itself. It helps especially when it is asked for help. In order to achieve constant guidance, a daily prayer is very important. I connect with my enlightened masters daily. One can also pray directly to God. It doesn’t matter which name you speak to the higher consciousness with. Important is only that you are serious about receiving real guidance and help. Then you get help so that you go forward spiritually, and not so that all egoistical wishes are fulfilled. I especially recommend to everyone to connect with the higher consciousness daily. Everyone can do that in his or her own way. 

23. Important in my view, is that one takes the spiritual way consistently daily. It doesn’t matter which exercises are done. One should feel what one needs and what does one good. It doesn’t have to be any particular or special exercises. The important hing is it should bring you further spiritually. Everything will happen at the right time. A good exercise is a to read daily from a spiritual book, or to pull an oracle card, or to pray, say a mantra, to visualize an image of an enlightened master. Those who have more time can meditate daily, do yoga and go for walks. 

24. Being alone is a necessary exercise for me. I have to live alone so that I can develop myself spiritually. But I don’t need to be that strict about it. For me, the middle way is good where I have some contact. Even a relationship isn’t out of the question. I lived the first twelve years as a yogi in a relationship. Then there was a time where my spiritual energy disappeared and I hardly had any energy for a relationship. Now it seems my energy is developing slowling again. 

25. Many Christians are afraid of yoga nad meditation. But Jesus was a yogi. He received kundalini energy (the holy Ghost, symbolized through the baptism) by Johnn the Baptist and meditated for 40 days in the desert. He overcame the devil (his ego) and could help other people with spiritual energy (the angels served him). Buddha also meditated and the devil appeared ( his ego) and tried to tempt him. He let go of his worldly attachments and turned to the light and the devil disappeared. The enlightenment stories of Buddha and Jesus are very similar. 

26. Principally, the way of inner and outer happiness are opposites. If you take the path of outer happiness, you built up attachments on outer things and other people who will reduce your happiness in the long run. If you go the path of inner happiness, you will reduce and get rid of your attachments. Attachments are inner tension. The more you let go of your inner tension, the more happiness can develop within you. 

27. The enlightened masters (God) lead us through our inner voice, to truth. It is important to have constant contact with one’s own voice of truth and wisdom. We should feel within ourselves and ask what is important at that moment along the way of wisdom.

28. Meditation of the inner voice: 1. Sit down in the meditation position (sit Indian style, or in a chair) Close your eyes. Breathe in and out. Relax. 2. Stop all thoughts for a minute and relax. 3. Visualize the earth, move one hand and thin :” I send light. May all beings be happy. May the world be happy.” Send light to suffering people. Use the TV as a window to the world and surround all beings with light. 4. Put your hand on your lap. Imagine yourself as Buddha, Shiva or a goddess. Move your toes and think this mantra : “I am a goddess (Buddha, Shiva) of peace. I take the path of peace. I live in peace.” 5. Visualize the cosmos around you full of stars. Make big circles with your arms and think: “I take things as they are. I let go of my false desires. I flow with positivity in my life.” 6. Connect with the enlightened masters or God. Rub the palms of your hands in front of your heart chakra and think: “om all enlightened masters (God). Om inner wisdom. I ask for guidance and help along my way.” 

29. Holy wars take place in many lands of the world and cause suffering. The solution is clear: we have to accept that we live in a world of varied religions. We have to learn to be loving, peaceful, tolerant and non-violent with one another.

1. After my enlightenment experience, I recognized that enlightenment is the deeper point of life. Enlightenment is the deliverance from the suffering of life. Enlightenment is the greatest happiness and highest fulfillment. In enlightenment, you realize your true self. Summarized: those who live enlightened, live better. An unenlightened person thinks that he or she will be happier with more money, sex, recognition, consumption and material riches. Only the wise recognize that inner prosperity will make you happier than material prosperity. You can enjoy life and develop spiritually at the same time. There are strict spiritual practitioners and there are moderate spiritual practitioners. I represent the way of the moderate practitioners who have enough fun in life.

2. When you are completely pure inside, God can enter and fill you with peace, love and happiness. In the Bible, it says the human being must choose between God (inner happiness) and money (the way of material happiness). Those who want to go forward spiritually should choose the path of inner happiness. 
 
3. There are various stages of enlightenment. Enlightenment begins with the feeling of harmony with oneself and the world. Then peace, happiness and love appears. Then the stage of dissolving of the “I” consciousness and the presence of the consciousness of unity (God consciousness) comes into being. The highest stage (full enlightenment)  is Nirvikalpa Samadhi, the resting in a dimension of highest happiness. This can be considered unity with God, the unity of Shiva and Shakti (the human being and God), or as the highest paradies (Sathyaloka, the place of highest truth). Only once have I reached this state, after my kundalini energy completely unfurled. It rose as a thick ray of energy from the bottom of the pelvis up to the head. Then there was a change of consciousness and I was in highest happiness. I was aware that this was the goal of all souls. The highest goal is not “simple” enlightenment, rather the “full” enlightenment (to be Buddha, or a Jivanmukta).

4. [[w:Sivananda Saraswati|Swami Sivananda]]: ”Samadhi (enlightenment) is unity. The spirit goes into the eternal, the Atman, like salt in water or camphor in flames. It is a state of pure consciousness. Recognition made in Samadhi is the recognition of God. In Samadhi there isn’t consciousness of the body or of the mind. There is only existence (sat). The one meditating has dissolved his personality in the ocean of God, drowned and forgotten, until he is just a tool of God. When he opens his mouth, he speaks without effort and without consideration through the direct intuition of the word of God, and when he lifts his hand, God streams through it to work miracles.”

5. Samadhi is not a state of dullness, forgetfullness or deletion. It is a state of absolute consciousness that defies every attempt to describe it. It isn’t the end destination of all. It is moksha (freedom, the release from suffering). The human being now rests in his middle- the goal of his search in absolute freedom, independence and perfection. 

6. People generally believe Samadhi means to sit with a loincloth in a state of nothingness consciousness in the lotus position. Such Samadhis are brought about through Hatha Yoga kriyas. In Jada Samadhi the prana is moved up high and held in one chakra. Through this one can anchor the self in serenity, strength, love, clarity or unity. 

7. Full enlightenment is totally different. There, all doubt, confusion and the three knots avidya (uncertainty), kam (worldly longing) and karma (determination, destiny) are destroyed. It gives fearlessness and an unbreakable state of mind. The Samadhi state also holds firm when taking action. Those who are anchored in complete enlightenment hold the mind and spirit in balance and use them as a service to other people.

8. In Samadhi, the cleansed spirit goes to God and becomes God consciousness. To know Brahman means to become Brahman. When the spirit becomes Brahman, it also dissolves the world, which is a creation of the spirit, in the Brahman and the spirit becomes Brahman. In this experience darkness and emptiness do not exist. There is only light. It is an experience of unity, and oneness. Time and space cease to exist, there is only eternity. You become all-knowing and all-powerful. You know the mystery of creation. You have achieved immortality, higher knowledge and eternal bliss. Every duality disappears, there is no subject and no object. 

9. When you are rooted in the highes Nirvikalpa Samdhi, you don’t have any body consciousness. You have the full awareness of Brahman. There is nothing other than the self. It is a wonderful experience. You are full of reverence. It is a state that one must achieve through one’s own efforts. It is without end, complete and an experience from existence and pure consciousness. When you have this experience , the mind, wishes, activities and feelings of joy and worry disappear. 

10. Samadhi gives moksha. That is the high point of yoga. With the recognition of the self, uncertainty disappears. With the disappearance of the main reason for the uncertainty, the ”I” thinking disappears. The yogi now has knowledge of the past and future, as well as from the present. Everything is “now”. Everything is “here”. Time and space do not matter anymore.

11. A person who comes out of Samadhi can still live like they did before, but their consciousness is greatly changed. No one can reach Samadhi until they are a pure soul. You have to have a pure heart. The spirit has to be full cleansed. Only then is the person ready to receive the light of God. You have to be strong enough to take the pressure of a sudden consciousness expansion and to be able to tolerate a cosmic viewpoint. 

12. Deep meditation leads to Samadhi, to being one with God. Contemplate God. Fill your spirit with God. Identify your spirit with God. The way you think, is the way you will be. Think yourself godly and you will become that. Be silent. Recognize yourself. Let your spirit go into God. 

13. The leadership through the inner voice of wisdom is very important. Only this way can you tell what the wrong and right techniques are. The same techniques can be in one moment wrong, and the next minute the right ones. If you don’t progress spiritually, then that is an indication of a wrong method of practicing. In contrast, if you arrive in light, love, happiness, peace, and truth and strength, then you are doing the right things. 

14. The real fulfillment of life can be enoyed with a positive psyche only. Those who are enlightened recognized their world as a paradise. The small things are enough to make great joy. God is fulfillment but only a fulfillment that comes from the inside. It is important to also flow positively with life, go with the flow, and to not become attached to material things. ;-)

15. Even in the western world we can realize our inner happiness and come to enlightenment. We don’t have to live as strict hermits away from the world in order to do that. Through the grace of the enlightened masters it’s possible without the most extreme circumstances. They can give us energy, wisdom, strength and love that we can use along our way. When we connect to an enlightened master of our choice every day and do enough spiritual exercises then we can grow in this material world, also spiritually. Particularly we can arrive in paradise after death. That is a great gift. Those who understand can practice master yoga every day by calling to the enlightened, praying, using an oracle and reading. 

16. Some people proceed best along the spiritual path when they are strict about it, as monks, nuns, hermits, yogis or desert dwellers. According to Amritanandamayi, you come to enlightenment five times faster when you live along. Asceticism isn’t the only spiritual way. Only a few people are able to live this way. I believe in reincarnation. Most people develop in the course of many lives. There is also a way to spiritually cleanse on the other side. In Amitabha Buddhism, there is a paradise in between lives where you can develop slowly to the highest state of nirvana (happiness, light, God). This paradise in between is basically what one usually thinks of paradise in Christianity. 

17. You can always develop further spiritually. After enlightenment, there are also a lot of stages of enlightenment. According to my experience there is a stage of unity consciousness, and after that the stage of omni-presence, all-knowingness, and all-powerfullness. Swami Sivananda describes these states as the signs of full enlightenment. One can deal everywhere and help people everywhere, also from other dimensions. This happens according to my experience through thinking, visions, dreams, energy transfer (giving peace, strength, love, happiness, wisdom). Before you achieve these powers, there is a long path to take. I observed in myself that these abilities develop slowly. I am still at the beginning. 

18. The greatest meaning in life is experienced through the way of enlightenment and the way of love. The way of enlightenment is developed through deep potential for happiness. You live in unity, harmony, and light. That gives you a deep feeling of meaningfulness. Those who live in love, experience life as full of meaning. If you are searching for meaning in your life, then you should concentrate on these points. 

19. Material happiness is an illusion. True happiness is only obtained through enlightenment. Enlightenment is the deeper meaning of life. True happiness remains even when unfortunate things occur in life. That destroys the illusion of outer happiness. Buddha taught life is mainly suffering. In Christianty, the cross is the main point of focus. Along the way of inner happiness, you open your inner sources of happiness and rise above all outer suffering one day. There are many ways to enlightenment. Find the way that fits you and works best. Principally happiness arises through spiritual practice like yoga, walking, meditating and thinking positively. It is helpful to have an enlightened master. 

20. Without sacrifice, you can’t break through into the light of enlightenment. The sacrifice of the ego and incorporating the self into the will of God (will of life, the universe).  Letting go of the ego and sacrificing the right way is a great art. If you sacrifice incorrectly, you create more tension. We shouldn’t let go of too much at once and not too little either. If done correctly, you let go of inner tension. I am creative about my rituals of ego sacrifice. I can tell what I need at any given time and what will work best. To do this with wisdom, you need to think about a situation exactly and consider what the best way is at the time. In this way, you give up your ego. It’s similar to a sacrifice of love, where you give something or someone up because you love them. I prefer sacrificing for something I like. If I don’t like a situation, I eat so many sweets that I can tolerate the situation, or I watch TV until I’ve forgotten all of the suffering in my life. 

21. There once was a king who wanted to realize his inner happiness. His priests explained to him that a five- fold renunciation was necessary. First, the king renounced his kingdom. He moved into a forest and lived as a yogi. The second thing he gave up was sexuality. He lived without a relationship in order to effectively put his energy into his spiritual exercises. That was the biggest sacrifice for him. The third thing he gave up were his thoughts. He meditated a lot and lived in peace. The fourth thing he gave up was his “me” consciousness.He let go of his ego and went through the great emptiness and landed in light. It feels unpleasant when the ego is destroyed. But behind that unpleasantness, awaits inner happiness. Those who know that, can easily let go of their ego. The king enjoyed the happiness of enlightenment for a time. Then he thought on the suffering of his fellow humans. They didn’t know the way to inner happiness. They needed an enlightened helper to show them the way to inner peace, love and happiness. The king sacrificed his lone enjoyment of happiness and went back to his kingdom. He helped a lot of people along the spiritual way. He lived as a hatha yogi with constant practice, as a karma yogi of great love and a bhogi yogi in immeasurable happiness in a constant consciousness of paradise (in God, light, unity consciousness). The fifth thing he sacrificed proved to be the biggest source of grace in his life. 

22. The best spiritual exercise is the exercise that brings you forward in any given moment. That could be reading from a spiritual book, a nice walk in the woods, meditation, meeting a spiritual person. Siddhasana can be a good exercise for advanced yogis. I reached the Nirvikalpa-Samadhi when laying down. The kundalini energy shot out of the skull chakra and into the heaven and came back in a big circle with a standing yoga exercise. Then I was integrated into the unity of the cosmos at a deep level. When walking the holy Ghost of God came to me and went into me. I received a holy energy baptism like the first baptism of Christ at Pentecost. The fire built itself around my head of energy. I was aware that I was blessed and lead by God. These were all very simple exercises that brought a high level of success. The spiritual way doesn’t need to be complicated. It’s enough to go walking regularly, a bit of yoga, some meditation, and reading daily in a spiritual book in addition to consistent thought work, positive thinking. 

23. You can activate kundalini energy with spiritual exercises. You can come to a state of strength, serenity, and happiness. You can put so much strength into your erxercises that you go above and beyond all of your problems. Physical yoga exercises are helpful, as well as God- Yoga (visualizing God), kundalini meditaion and working with negative thoughts such as fear, rage and addiction. You have to see inside yourself which technique will work for you best in which moment.

24. Working with kundalini energy is a process not well known in the west. But it is the strongest energy a person has within him or herself. When it develops, a cleansing process often accompanies it for a longer or shorter period of time, as I am going through currently. There are some reports over such processes in spiritual literature. The most well-known is the Gopi Krishna. Gopi Krishna (1903-1984) was an Indian yogi, mystic, academic and author. After he awoke to kundalini energy at the age of 34,  he began to research the phenomen of Kundalini energy. According to his own accounts, he perceived streams of light, heard otherworldly sounds, and moved into a boundless state of consciousness. 

25. The American David Ramon Hawkins (1927-2012) was a doctor and a psychiatrist. He had uncommon supernatural experiences of hell, happiness and godly peace. He was an alchoholic and reached a point where he didn’t know what to do. He called to God, “if there is a God, I ask him to help me now.” He fell unconscious and woke up as an enlightened person the next day. The enlightenment leap helped him to spontaneously heal from addiction and also from 15 chronic illness. He dissolved his personal ego. He needed 30 years to integrate this consciousness leap. 

26. The development of kundalini proceeds in various ways. According to Indian teachings, it has its own intelligence and does what each person needs. You can say that the cleansing process is controlled by God. You are challenged, but will not be overwhelmed by the process.Jesus’ kundalini energy was activated through John the Baptist. Then it developed in the desert for 40 days so that Jesus could only meditate in the desert. Finally, his ego let go (the devil)  in a last temptation and Jesus received healing powers (the angels served him). Such a fast kundalini development is possible for great enlightened souls who have incarnated on earth. That is also how it took place for  Holy Antonius, the founder of the desert fathers and Christian hermits. He reported demons which harassed him for years.

27. In 1986 kundalini energy was awakened after an intense enlightenment experience. Since that time, I’ve found myself in a state of constant cleansing. I’m going through another time of transformation now. The first five weeks were really difficult. Then it calmed down a bit. Every day I went through an intense cleansing process from morning until night, and only sometimes did the kundalini energy unfurl. This is how it was just yesterday and the day before yesterday. The day before yesterday I felt very restless.At 3 in the morning I realized the kundalini energy was very active. I could feel a strong charge in myself that kept me from sleeping. After 24 hours this energy flowed  through me until it suddenly disappeared. This energy was really powerful. I could only concentrate and try to go with the flow in a positive way. I meditated on the suffering in myself in the world. This way, I received a lot of inner strength and could get through the cleansing process. 

28. (Quote Wikipedia): In Tantric writings, kundalini is described as etheric power in humans. According to these writings, this energy is resting under the lowest part of the spine and is symbolically portrayed as a coiled snake sleeping in the lowest chakra.Through yogic practice, it can be awakened and rise through the chakras and cause transformation. If it reaches the highest chakra, it unites with the cosmic spirit and brings highest happiness to the person experiencing the transformation. Certain phenomena are described as appearing with the rising kundalini. Among these include heat waves, a feeling of warmth, cold spells, ticks (unintended shaking, trembling), chronic and temporary pain in the whole body, numbness of hands and feet, laughing, crying and ecstatic happiness.

29.(Quote from Sahaja): According to the old sources, kundalini is the most subtle, holy and powerful energy in the universe. Kundalini isn’t a modern discovery, it was already described thousands of years before Christ. Shri Mataji Nirmali Devi explained Kundalini as the energy of the godly wish to become one with God again. This energy has been at work since the beginning of time and moves evolution forward. Knowledge of kundalini provides a bridge between creation and evolution theories. Kundalini is the godly power which controls evolution. In the western tradition this power has been called the Holy Ghost. If a person is pure in his or her inner being, they achieve freedom, Moksha when the Kundalini awakens. This full freedom occurred with Buddha as he had let go of all attachments and temptations before his self-realization.  If the kundalini energy is awakened in “imperfect” people, the various chakras start to cleanse.Sat-Chit-Ananda-the truth, the consciousness, permeates everything and makes pure joy a reality. 

30. Enlightenment goes beyond normal perceptions of happiness, joy and suffering. It is a higher level of happiness that brings great inner peace with it. One can also achieve highest happiness using certain techniques. That’s what I consider Samadhi. You can rest in highest happiness on the other side (highest paradise, satyaloka). You can use your body on earth to develop a strong happiness energy. Anandamayi Ma rested in enlightenment unity consciousness in her life. She practiced intensive Hatha and divinity yoga as well as meditation for six years. She reached immeasurable happiness this way. It’s particular to the experience on earth to also be able to go through great suffering. But you can use your body and spirit to develop inner happiness, peace, power and love. 

31. I am a yogi. Buddha was a yogi. I can also practice buddhist techniques. As a yogi, I believe in Ramakrishna (neo-Hinduism) and the unity of all religions. I can use exercises from different religions and consider all religions to be good. The different religions have different names for God. In Buddhism, the term Nirvana is used. God is the highest dimension of consciousness that you experience in enlightenment. (Light, unity). God as a person is my enlightened master and an avatar like Krishna and Jesus. They can help me with their abilities to see all, know all, and to be all-powerful to help me along the spiritual way and help lead me to light.

1. In Christianity you practice gratitude. If you practice gratitutde every day, your happiness increases. The American happiness researcher Sonja Lyubimirsky  stated you can increase your general level of happiness in life by 40% if you think positively on a consistent basis. Sonja recommends exercising regularly, to eat healthy and to meditate 20 minutes every day. 

2. A clear line to a goal is important. We should practice in a goal-oriented way. We have to be clear about the goal of inner happiness, enlightenment, a life in light and to concentrate on God. Then we can find exercises that bring us forward personally. We can do exercises from various religions without losing ourselves in them. We should listen to our inner voice of truth to lead us. If we are confused by the diversity of religions, we should concentrate on one religion. But one can also lose the way with a single religion because there are traps everywhere along the spiritual way. The biggest traps are dogma and personally being more dedicated to a worldly orientation, being more concerned with material reality in secret. 

3. Honesty with oneself is the basis of the spiritual path. Everyone has negative characteristics, it’s important to work on them. Pride is the most dangerous characteristic on the spiritual path because it can exist even after enlightenment. Arrogance is overcome with humility and through love. We see the suffering in the world and in our own lives. Then we can live with modesty. We recognize our unity with all beings, wish every being happiness and thus overcome our ego-centric nature.

4. Tension is in the body and spirit. For the body we need physical exercise, and for the spirit we need spiritual and mental exercise. If both areas are cleansed enough, inner happiness arises. The mistake western psycho-therapy makes is to concentrate on just the mind or the body. The way to success to combine both, and the spirit. In my positive thinking groups I’ve always also meditated. In my yoga groups, I’ve always released blocked feelings like fear, rage, sadness and addiction and practiced positive thinking. Trauma is best released through mental exercises, physical exercise, lots of rest and lots of love. Along the yogic way, through the years, past trauma is released. With me, first traumatic experiences from this life and then from past lives appeared, and I relived them again and then they disappeared. 

5. Yoga of love (bhakti yoga, karma yoga) is a way to do yoga exercises while combining them with the energy of love. Yoga also possesses a power to cleanse and can lead you to enlightenment in a simple way. Yoga of love awakens the love in you, and brings you to a life in light and love. 1. Find a spiritual role model you like and trust. 2. Connect to this role model daily. 3. Send light and love to all people regularly. 4. Feel connected to your role model while you do your yoga exercises. 5. Wish for happiness for all beings, as well as love and peace. 

6. Samadhi means happiness, in my view, which is experienced in deep meditation and enlightenment. Moses practiced kundalini yoga and reached enlightenment. It is also implied that he threw his staff (kundalini channel) onto to the earth (he earthed himself), the staff then changed into a snake (the kundalini energy rose) which gave him special powers. Kundalini yoga is the basis of Judaism and Christianity, even if only a few Christians realize that. They don’t understand the symbolic language of the bible. In paradise, the kundalini snake wrapped itself around the tree of enlightenment (the kundalini channel). Jesus also practiced meditation on the mountain. He arrived quickly in light and could see Moses and Elia (two desert yogis). 

7. You don’t have to know the term kundalini to practice kundalini yoga. If you look closer at Christian and Jewish teachings, you will find a lot of techniques of kundalini yoga. Jacob  wrestled with God and put his hands on his hips. That is a yoga technique to awaken kundalini energy. To visualize God is a technique of kundalini yoga, just as it is kundalini yoga to connect with the saints and angels or to visualize paradise with a tree. To see two trees in paradise means to activate both of the side channels. To bless   other people with light will get the light flowing in yourself as well. 

8. There is only one energy, one light, one God, one Holy Ghost. The spiritual energy can be awakened in many different ways. Kundalini yoga is the way to activate the middle energy channel. That’s one of the quick ways to enlightenment, but isn’t the only one. The energy of God can also flow from the heavens through the crown chakra or fill the heart chakra or appear when a person is grounded well. One of the ways to ground yourself is to go for a walk. 

9. In yoga, there’s a technique where you can consciously leave the body. Advanced yogis can die when they consider the point in time to be correct. When the soul leaves the body through the skull chakra, it ascends to heaven. The body then dies within three days. In Tibetan Buddhism there is training to learn how to do this. In Amitabha Buddhism you visualize a golden Buddha Amitabha above the crown chakra in heaven, in order to ascend there with a mantra. I believe that at some advanced point in time in yoga, you automatically get the ability to consciously leave the body and consciously die. Pyar Troll tried that once in meditation, arrived in highest paradise and then didn’t want to leave. Only the love of his followers brought him back to earth. 

11. You advanced quickest along the way that is best for you. Many yogis like to live very disciplined and strict lives. I prefer the middle way. Swama Sivananda gave his students either the way of karma yoga (love), of hatha yoga (body exercises), of jnana yoga (wisdom, contemplation, “who am I?” ), of raja yoga (meditation) or of bhakti yoga (honoring God and masters), depending on the personalities of said students. Some students he recommended take a strict way, others a more gentle approach. Generally speaking, the students advanced more when being consistent. 

11. I don’t believe it’s necessary to sacrifice chocolate in order to come to enlightenment. Enlightenment requires an inner departure from the world more so than a complete outer renunciation. If you become attached to worldly enjoyment and have worldly wishes, your energy goes to the outer world. You rest in the inner happiness of enlightenment when the energy is directed inwards and can collect there. Outer renunciation can be helpful so that the spirit isn’t always occupied by material things. For me, it was important to destroy all attachment. I had to give up sex as a part of that. 

12. Generally, I prefer a medium spiritual way. You should center yourself in God and not in the outer world, but joy in life can be helpful for the spiritual way. The important thing is to enjoy everything in the right amount and right way. I eat chocolate every day to motivate myself for the spiritual way. I can take the spiritual approach when it’s connected to worldly joy. A tantra yogi is allowed to eat meat and have a relationship. In enlightenment, there is no more separation between the world and God. Everything is light and can be a help or a hindrance along the spiritual way. 

13. We need a lot of yogis in the west. I teach a simple way that can be practiced by everyone. I’ve developed my yoga style in a simple way for normal people who attend the night school where I teach. No one needs to be super- strict. It’s enough to live according the five basics of health (some exercise, healthy diet, avoid harmful substances, enough relaxation, positive thinking).

14. According to the Indian philosophy, we’re living in the Kali Yuga era, the era of the ego and suffering. This era will be stopped someday by the golden era. In order for this to happen, all good people have to do something. With the support of God, the efforts of good people will make it succeed. God’s support is already reinforced by many enlightened masters, angels, saints. He sent them to earth to achieve the victory of the good. Important is that humankind overcomes its extreme ego. This is what the enlightened masters are working for. 

15. You have to let go of the world to come to the level of light. You have to make the glass of worldly wishes empty so that God can fill it with light. In the Bible, it says that you have to basically choose between God (inner happiness) and money (worldly happiness). Buddha taught that attachment on worldly pleasures has to be let go of in order to come to nirvana. The spiritual energy of a person can flow into the outside world, or can collect on the inside. In yoga, living away from the world and getting a lot of rest is important. You can live within the world, and be departed from it on the inside.  According to my experience, you can enjoy material pleasure to encourage your inner happiness. I prefer to take a medium, moderate spiritual approach. 

16. After I had lived as a yogi for seven years, I was suddenly overcome by the desire to know about my previous lives. I sent my senses back in time and felt a resonance at a certain time. Then a certain resistence appeared, then I felt, saw even closer. One after another, I mentally sensed four earlier lives. I could recognize the place, time and also the nature of these previous lives. In yoga, you use spiritual exercises systematically to get rid of tension in the body and mind. Then one day you can access stress situations from earlier lives. Traumatizing and particularly stressful events remain in the spirit , and when you get rid of tension, the situations which caused you stress before appear in dreams or when you are awake as short scenes that are viewed in the mind’s eye. The processes of dissolving tension are often combined with bodily reactions like restlessness, muscle shivers, heat or cold waves. 

17. For me, first the tension from my present life dissolved. In film-like scenes in my mind’s eye, I saw stressful exam situations,  relationship conflicts and accidents I wanted to forget. As I could still remember what had caused me stress, the connection between the spiritual exercises and the letting go of inner tension and the appearance of dreams and images was apparent to me. I learnt to differentiate between dreams that came as a result of the exercises and dissolving of tension, and normal dreams. After 11 years as a yogi, suddenly earlier lives appeared in my mind. First, only single earlier lives appeared, then suddenly many came to the surface of my consciousness. After four years the process began to dissipate. In contrast to the intentional attempt to learn about my past lives, now I was seeing short films play before my eyes. I recognized the details of the stress situations and the surroundings I was in. In some pictures I could see some geographic and landmarks of what era I was in. In the course of my spiritual cleansing processes, I have seen some thousands of earlier lives. 

18. After my last relationship came to an end, I lived alone for ten years. For three years I’ve met a lot of friends over the internet. I think that’s very nice. It’s easier to be happy when you have at least one good friend. It’s important to be positive and honest when communicating with one another so that both friends can grow spiritually and have harmony, love and truth with one another and within each of themselves. 

19. I was just at the drug store. An Indian woman works there as a cashier. At first, I thought it was Mother Meera sitting there. She is about the same size and same age. The Indian woman had strong spiritual energy. I think she also sensed me, too. I didn’t say that I live here as a yogi and am a yoga teacher. (Maybe then she would have tried to make me her house priest) I wondered where she got such strong energy. She probably does her spiritual rituals daily, like most Indian woman. She connects with her enlightened masters and is guided by them daily. She probably does her job as karma yoga. She doesn’t do it to earn money, but as service to other people. She greets every customer warmly and talks to each one. She builds up her customers emotionally. I felt stronger emotionally after talking to her. I smiled after visiting. I should go to that shop more often. 

20. This last night I had another cleansing crisis. Strong energies flowed through me and I couldn’t sleep. My psyche was ready to break down. I considered what techniques might help. I oriented myself around God-Yoga. I connected my energy with the death goddess Kali with the chain of skulls around her neck. I sacrificed myself in my suffering. I then connected with the goddess of strength Durga, who rides on a Tiger. I identified with her, and received a lot of energy. Then I saw myself as the goddess of happiness, Lakshmi in order to connect with inner happiness. As Sarasvati, I centered myself in wisdom to get through the difficulties. Finally, I was Sri Devi, the mother of all beings. I sent all beings light and so arrived in the dimension of all-encompassing love. The five goddesses activated my kundalini energy and gave me the power to get through the difficult times. I let go of the five goddesses in that I made it clear that God is pure consciousness and above all identities. You can dissolve the goddesses in God, or let their energies play out and disappear on their own. 

21.  God-yoga (role model yoga) is the highest form of yoga. The four main goddesses in yoga are Durga (the power goddess on the tiger), Kali ( the black goddess with the sword), Sarasvati (the wise goddess with the book), and Lakshmi (the happiness goddess with the giving hands.) Durga is the goddess of strength. She rides a tiger or lion. She has the strength of a tiger. Whatever she decides to do, she accomplishes. She is a winner. We stretch both fists high, shake them and think of the word “strength” until we feel the strength of Durga within. Kali is the black goddess with the sword. She cuts off Shiva’s head (her own head). She sacrifices her ego and thus comes to inner peace. She gets through the overcoming of all attachments, and over her own body and comes to a life in light. Sacrifice your ego. Put your hands in your lap. Rub your right foot and then your left foot in a circle against the earth, feel and visualize the ground beneath you and think :” I let go of my false wishes. I accept the suffering in my life. I flow positively with life.” What do you need to let go of today? What do you want to accept today? What is your way of ego-sacrifice and inner peace?

22. A lot of people experiment with contact to spirits on the other side. In shamanism, you call dead relatives or protective spirits. In Satanism, you connect with satan to get his power and strength. Channeling lets you connect with angels and ascended masters and for them to speak through you. You don’t know if you’re dealing with good or bad spirits. A woman told me once that she became possessed by a devil when channeling  who steals her strength and is impossible to get rid of. What can you do in such situations? You can connect with higher spirits like Jesus, Krishna or Buddha who are obviously good and enlightened. Then you get help. You can concentrate on positive characteristics such as peace, love, wisdom and happiness. Then at some point fear and negative beings will get weaker. You can also orient yourself around the fact that there is only God, and that God is in everything that appears and everything can and will be dissolved in pure consciousness one day.

23. How do you solve the problem of fear of the devil at a deep level? By destroying him, which is done by having a non- dualistic image of God. God is above the devil. God is enlightenment consciousness of peace, love and happiness. God is pure light. God is knowledge of unity. Those who rest within God know there is no devil and no demons. Fear of the devil can be overcome by achieving an enlightenment consciousness. If you don’t have any more thoughts, then fears and devils disappear. There are two basic techniques for this. If you get afraid by thinking of the devil, then concentrate on God, and become one with God. This can also be achieved through a prayer to God, Jesus or an enlightened master you trust. Pray as long as you need to come to the pure light of God. Another way is to do a resting meditation and allow all of your fears to come and go as they wish. They will then play out and disappear on their own. Both techniques of prayer and meditation are good to combine. 

24. I don’t believe in curses. Those who go with God are protected. If someone curses you, then connect with God or an enlightened master through a prayer. Pray for those who curse and send them light. In that way, no curse can reach you. Today, every person is confronted with negative energies. We have to learn to deal with that in a positive way. When there’s a problem in your life, it doesn’t necessarily come from a curse. There are problems in every life, and they help you to inner growth. 

25. Saint Patrick, the missionary of Ireland was constantly attacked by evil sorcerers. They couldn’t do anything to him because he had protected himself with a prayer (lorica prayer): “I call to God to protect me from the sorcery of the women and smiths and druids. Christ protect me against poison, against fire, water, wounds. Christ be with me, Christ me in front of me, Christ behind me, Christ in me, Christ under me, Christ above me, Christ to the right, Christ to the left, Christ be where I lie, Christ be where I sit, Christ where I stand, Christ be in the heart of everyone, Christ be in the mouth of all those who speak of me, Christ be in the eye of those who see me, Christ be in every ear that hears me.” 

26. Overcoming negative energies is often hard work that takes a long time. Continue consistently on the way of light and everything will be good. Things will get easier, and problems will disappear. The important thing is you work with your thoughts and bring them to rest. Then positive thinking and meditation can take place. Through the way of light you can dissolve all negative energies that affect you from the outside. When you accept the suffering in your life calmly and concentrate on the good in life, you can also be happy in a life that is constantly changing on the outside. 

27. The kundalini energy has been rather extreme for me for the last two months. I am exhausted, but I still manage to get through the crises. At the moment, things have calmed a bit and there is a certain happiness energy present. I switch between states of happiness and inner cleansing. The happiness energy is slowly growing. I consider my life blessed. 

28. I cleanse myself regularly with my walks, through meditation, by reading spiritual texts and with my work for a happy world. I am constantly in a cleansing and growth process. Every day I connect with my enlightened masters and listen to my inner voice. In this way, I am lead through life in an optimal way. Negative energies are cleansed on their own. Happiness, peace and love develop. It’s important that I bring many elements of joy into my life every day. 

29. Beware of the false gurus in every religion. They bring only messages of violence, material riches and separation. They work for their egos and take advantage of their followers. They are very clever. We can only see through them using a lot of wisdom. We should take note of the fruits of their efforts. Do they harvest the fruits of peace, love, happiness and enlightenment? Or is it hate, war and ego? Do they tolerate other opinions or do they accept only their own? A true mystic lives in wisdom and love. He or she radiates truth and love. 

30. The TV asana is one of my favorite exercises. I can manage it for three hours, though normally two hours are enough. If you watch TV with enough inner sense, you can also come to enlightenment that way. For me, TV has become a type of meditation. Watching TV and going for walks regularly are my Buddha way to light.  The important thing when watching TV is that you see through the negative thoughts and attachments and let go of them. Watching TV can be an intense spiritual training that helps you to overcome various material attachments. How do you get rid of material addiction? By recognizing that enlightenment is better than the rich and beautiful. God is bigger than TV. Those who recognize that work toward a life in light, for inner peace and all-encompassing love.

[[File:The Hindu Goddess Parvati LACMA M.72.1.14 (1 of 2).jpg|thumb|The Hindu Goddess Parvati]]
1. Love is on its way. Yesterday evening, a blockage in my heart chakra let go. In this way, my front energy channel opened. I felt such a strong cleansing in the channel from the forehead over the heart chakra to the tips of the toes that I couldn’t fall asleep for a long time. Then suddenly the energy became weaker, and I fell into a restless sleep that I woke up from several times. After waking up for the day, I went for my walk in the woods, to get moving and use the energy for something. Then I meditated for an hour, and now I feel better. 

2. I’ve been posting fairytales in an esoteric forum daily, as of late. Today I posted the Rossmann’s Magic Harp. In the original version, a man with a blocked heart chakra falls in love with an angel and chaos ensues. He has to choose between his wife and the angel. If we see the angel as the ambassador of God, the man has to choose between God (enlightenment) and the outside world. He decides on his wife, but is never really happy. That’s how it is once you’ve gotten to know great happiness just once. But according to my experience, you can make compromises. You should take the spiritual path as the main point of your life. If a relationship is lived out wisely, then it can be a way of light and support both partners on the spiritual way. Then at some point, both live in light, in paradise and in all-encompassing love and in God. That would be my end for the fairytale. 

3. What is the spiritual meaning of the fairytale Sleeping Beauty? Those who want to come to enlightenment and a life in God and light first have to work with their thoughts. They have to put their thoughts in order, and make a golden carpet of happiness from their thoughts. They have to think positively and should think of the characteristics of inner peace, love, wisdom, self-discipline and joy of life and train these characteristics.  That’s what the German version of the story tells us. 

4. The daily work with ones thoughts are symbolized by the spinning wheel. Those who work on their thoughts enough will come to a point in time where the chakras open. The spiritual energy begins to flow. Then it’s time to emphasize meditation. When Sleeping Beauty sleeps, it means she is meditating. She meditates on the kundalini energy that woke her up through a prick on the finger. In yoga it is called the bite of the kundalini snake. A chakra in the finger or point of the toe opens through the grace of God (or a wise woman). The enlightenment energy flows gently and continuously into the person. It is a great blessing when such takes place. The person is blessed with enlightenment. Then that person needs to just wait and do their spiritual exercises regularly. Sleeping Beauty slept for 100 years. 

5. When the time is right, the roses start to bloom and the prince appears. Sleeping Beauty is kissed awake through God (light, the Holy Ghost) and the mystic wedding can take place. The mystic wedding consists of three steps: cleansing, enlightenment, and unity. The person is filled with light, feels his world is full of light and his or her ego is dissolved and he or she lives in light and in a paradise of the consciousness. He or she recognizes the roses of love in the world. He or she concentrates on the good and beautiful, and remains in light. 

6. I’ve lived as a yogi for 25 years and have worked toward enlightenment. Along the way on the mountain of happiness, I’ve encountered a lot of swamps, steep paths and dark forests. I hide at night mainly to grow spiritually. Somehow I always manage to get enough sleep, but it’s a difficult and strenuous time. 

7. The divine source has opened. It bubbles with joy. It brings darkness into light. I dissolve it through meditation and positive thinking. When negative images from earlier lives appear, I let them play out and go through the rage and sadness, become one with all of the monsters, enemies from earlier lives, and they dissolve. If you block your fear, it becomes stronger. If you sacrifice yourself to yourself, the fears disappear. And suddenly the little yogi comes to light. 

8. Yesterday, my musician friend from Berlin came to visit. His mother lives nearby. He visits her every three months and then comes to visit me too. He gets yoga cookies with chocolate and a cup of coffee. We get along well. He tells me about his life as a musician. I tell him the latest details from my wild yogi life. 

9. There once was a woman who was searching for happiness. One day she came to a big forest and met an old yogi there. The old yogi was nice and she fell in love with him. She fell in love with his spiritual self. She learnt through love to get to know herself better. By loving the old yogi, she found her way to herself. The yogi showed her his big forest, the wild animals and the sun in the sky. In the spring they planted flowers of love. The whole summer long, flowers bloomed of all different types. Their life was full of color, sun and the singing of the birds. In the fall, they were overjoyed at the sight of the mushrooms in the forest. In the winter, they loved the snow and clear air. They talked about God, spirituality and love. They were happy with one another. One day, they both awoke in light. They lived in light, in God, and in love. Many people came and visited them. And if they haven’t died yet, then they still live today and give the gift of the flowers of light and of love. 

10. There are enlightened masters in every religion, who teach the unity of all religions and don’t mind mixing belief systems. In Christianity, the Catholic priest Bede Griffiths that only all of the religions together can give way to the complete picture. In Hinduism, Ramakrishna practiced all of the major religions and recognized they all lead to enlightenment. The Tibetan Buddhism is a mixture of many different Hindu teachings connected with the way of Buddha. 

11. I compared my enlightenment with the teachings of Jesus, Buddha and yoga. I recognized that all of the major religions are based around an enlightenment experience. You could also call this a God experience. The basis of all religions on a deeper level is mysticism, I am convinced of it. I have also recognized the fact that religions have varied points of emphasis and varied energies and I need the energy of every religion. According to the teachings of yoga, you can follow the masters of various religions. You can follow your own favorite mix. 

12. Rumi (sufi mystic): If you do things from your soul, then you will be in harmony with yourself. Then you will feel joyful. 

13. Nils: Hello Karl, how is your enlightenment developing? Karl: Personal progress is always interrupted by doubt. The need for calm is growing, and the silence is as well, and listening to the depth of my heart. I melt into the universe, into everything. I overcome dualism, also time and space. 

14. Nils: I’ve met a woman over the internet whom I write emails with daily. Sometimes we talk on the telephone. I’ve decided to take things as they come. If a woman enters my life, then that’s how it should be. I see myself as being lead by God. And if God thinks I need a woman and a woman needs me, then there is no reason to go against this. I’m curious as to how my spiritual path will develop.

15. Feelings come and go. That belongs to life, and especially to love. If there isn’t any jealousy, then there also isn’t any kind of deep love either. It’s important not to overdo it. Along the way of enlightenment, you learn to keep feelings within a certain framework and not to let them rule you. You learn to center yourself in God, in your inner happiness. Then you don’t become overcome by feelings like fear, rage, jealousy or grief. 
 
16. Two people fall in love. Then after awhile, love disappears and then boredom or hatred appears. This can only be avoided through the spiritual approach to life. If two people go the spiritual way together, then they can open the heart chakra further and futrhter, and things will never get boring because enlightenment and love is a constant adventure. 
 
17. The yoga god Shiva meditates and switches between phases of outer activity and meditation. (Having a relationship and resting in meditation). That’s a good way to grow in light. Through tantric yoga, kundalini energy can be activated. You meditate afterward. Then the man and woman heal and become enlightened. Tantric yoga is a way of healing in the context of a relationship, when it’s based on love and loyalty. 

18. You can base a relationship around striving for enlightenment. You should emphasize God (spirituality, calm, centering oneself). One should always listen to the voice of inner wisdom. 

19. Living alone is difficult for most people. You can harden on the inside and block sexuality and the desire for a relationship. There are people who have hindered their enlightenment. It’s important for me to have enough joy in life in my spiritual approach. A relationship can be a part of that. 

20. Experiencing God is possible. A person can develop their inner happiness, inner peace, and love. He or she can live in light. Meditation is a way to enlightenment. First you become enlightened through meditation and then you practice keeping this state of being after meditating. Meditation and acting in the world will become one state of being. 

21. For the spiritual approach you don’t need yoga exercises. But it’s faster with asanas for most people. The asanas stabilize the health and help get rid of tension. If the body isn’t cleansed of tension, spiritual progress is difficult. In yoga and in Tibetan Buddhism, that’s the reason you do bodily exercises for a long time before you begin with higher forms of meditation. In my view, it doesn’t need to be yoga exercises. Taking walks regularly is also a good way to cleanse the inner self. Muktananda first took a pilgrimage to India for 20 years before he committed to 9 years of intense meditation. I take daily walks as my main bodily exercise, but combine it with mantras and breath exercises. 

22. I just got back from a child’s birthday party where I was invited as the magician. It finally worked out! It’s difficult to be a convincing magician for kids these days. Six months ago, it didn’t work out at all. But you can always learn from your mistakes. This time I did everything right: I focused on my strengths. My strengths are yoga and psychology. First I did laugh yoga with the children. Then everyone got into a good mood. And then I showed them my magic tricks. I made a handkerchief appear from my sleeve and the audience could rip it up. Then I made the kerchief disappear in my fist and conjured a whole kerchief from my sleeve. 

23. I conjured a pink plush elephant from my magic hat. I put a little plush mouse into the magic hat and took out a big one from underneath. Finally everyone took a tarot card and I interpreted them. They were happy about that because they felt acknowledged and got a positive perspective on life. What does the happiness oracle say to you today?

24. At the child’s birthday party, there were a lot of energetically sick children and mothers. On the outside I was a happy magician, but energetically I worked as a healer. I took on many energies. I needed two days to work them out. During the course of those two days, visions of people appeared originating from the people whose energy I needed to cleanse myself of. I was a magician on the inside and outside, at the child’s birthday party. I wasn’t a healer on purpose. I don’t see myself as a healer. I’m just a simple yogi. But if God wants it, then healing takes place in my presence. 

25. Whether or not perfect enlightenment exists, I don’t know. Once your ego has left the picture, you take things as they are. Everything is perfect at that point, even things that aren’t perfect normally. If you find happiness and peace, then the perfect enlightenment isn’t important to you anymore. It’s just enough to find your way of happiness. According to my experience, there is a level of cosmic consciousness (egolessness). But there are many further levels, that are connected to abilities such as healing and seeing into the future. 

26. Enlightenment goes hand in hand with self-realization. The way there varies from person to person. According to my experience, it is enough to orient yourself around truth and love and to take your personal approach. At some point, you experience God. This might occur after some lives. It goes faster when you lead your life spiritually and can see exactly what is most effective, and wisest. 

27. Those who connect to God or an enlightened master are blessed. He or she is lucky or blessed and is guided into the light. All of the negative happenings in their lives develop into blessings. Difficult times lead to inner growth. If you have a good heart, the devil can’t reach you. The devil is a symbol for the ego. In order to come to enlightenment, you have to overcome the ego and develop a cosmic consciousness. You have to learn to deal with suffering in a laidback way. You can’t get trapped in worldly addictions like the ferryman, who longs for money and material riches. You have to let go of your wordly wishes. Then you are free. Get the three golden hairs daily with spiritual practice, all-encompassing love and prayer to God. Then you will be blessed. 

28. The personal image of God often leads to problems with great suffering in the world. Many people have lost their faith for that reason, but God is above joy and above suffering. God is the enlightened consciousness of unity. Moses speaks of “I am”. If you take things as they come, you will come to inner peace. If you practice enough spiritual exercises, you can reach enlightenment. In enlightenment, you can rise above outer suffering. The spiritual way helps to deal with suffering. We should avoid suffering as much as it is possible. 

29. The fairytale of the Six Servants gives away the techniques we need to come to enlightenment. The first thing we need to do is to see our goal clearly. Then we need to be light. The second thing we need is the perseverance to reach our goal. We need the long legs of the servant. The third thing we need is a good sense of ourselves and what exercises are effective. We have to be like the clairvoyant  to hear within the self. We need techniques like meditation and thought work to charge ourselves with spiritual energy. We need to learn to save energy in the belly, like the fat man. There’s a simple technique for that. We visualize our foot in our bellies and think a mantra (for example: I’m thankful for the good food) or a prayer (God bless my food). That’s a good exercise for christimas. At some point, the kundalini energy rises in the body and inner happiness appears. If we give that happiness on to other people, there will be a happy Christmas. 

30. Once we’ve awakened our inner happiness with kundalini yoga, we meditate on the spiritual energy. A good technique for that is the tratak, the meditation gaze. If we concentrate on an outer point, we can keep the spirit calm. If we don’t fall asleep during the medtation (the third test in the fairy tale, then our consciousness will change to enlightenment consciousness at some point. We arrive in the unity of the cosmos (the golden ring) and feel the energy of God in and around us (the energy sea) and the mystic wedding can take place. The energy of God begins to cleanse us on the inside. There are cold and heat waves, like the servent felt in the fire. Then the body can let go of inner tension through spasms. If we meditate enough, the inner impurities will be burnt and we land in light. 

31. But there is a danger: the spiritual pride. Even an enlightened person can have certain negative characteristics. We need to develop humility and modesty. We should see ourselves as servants of our fellow humans. Then we can come to complete enlightenment. We are happy on the inside and outside. We can recognize the beauty in the world (the beauty and the daughter of the king) without following into the trap of the sorceress. We get the enlightenment view of the world. What thoughts help you to see your world as a paradise? What is your positive thought of the day?

1.  The fairy tale of the Valiant Little Tailor gives us courage. Trust yourself and live wisely. Even a weak person can win on the spiritual way. You only need perseverance. There are seven chakras (energy gates). When all of them are purified, the kundalini energy rises in the body to the head and you are united with God. You live in unity and light. In order to achieve the mystic wedding, the little tailor has to be clever and courageous. He wins over his inner giants, and cleverly flows with his inner impulses and directs them in the right direction.

2.  The unicorn represents the enlightenment energy that the tailor awakens through clever spiritual exercises in the tree of enlightenment (the kundalini channel). The wild boar, or the wild nature of the tailor (the ego) is tamed. It is locked into a church. In this way the inner transformation can succeed. The tailor becomes king and marries the daughter of the king. He becomes a master of life who lives in light. 

3. My enlightenment is progressing slowly. Six months ago, the big transformation began. The first five weeks were difficult. Then it got easier. I experienced days of intense purification and days of recovery, changing between the two. The cleansing mostly began with a difficult phase where energy blockages from earlier lives dissolved. Then came old feelings and old fears. Thankfully, this phase mostly began in the evening when I watched TV. I was therefore distracted and could get through it. Then around midnight the energy of happiness began to flow. That can last up to 24 hours. It annoyed me a little because I couldn’t sleep and then the next day was tired. 

4. In enlightenment, you experience God and comprehend what God is. Moses described the central being and the way to God as “I am”. God is in silence and calm and can be found within the calm. Then you arrive in happy existence and see God as light in the world. It doesn’t mean you have fear in God, but that you let go of your own will in favor of God. 

5. The point is to be merciful and to find the mercy and grace of God. God goes beyond material. People block their way to God when they focus on material instead of God. Those who are merciful, help the poor and work for the happiness of all beings will be rewarded with growth in the light. 

6. If you see God as a person in heaven, then you have problems with the suffering on earth. If you try to be within God, you overcome the inner suffering. Then through the way of spiritual practice you can accept suffering at a deeper level and integrate it within your life and grow within and arrive in peace. You will find that despite and because of your suffering you will grow in light and develop inner happiness. You can be blessed however your outer life develops. 

7. Kundalini processes are constantly taking place within me. The night before yesterday, I couldn’t sleeping because such strong energy was flowing. I lay the entire night in a state of happiness energy, and the day too. But exactly at 8 pm something let go in me. I went through difficult energies that I overcame by watching interesting television. Then I meditated an hour and went for a walk in the forest and again arrived in happiness. 

8. I have a crazy daily schedule. I mostly watch TV from 8-10 pm. Then I meditate an hour and go into the forest for an hour. At 12 midnight I’m on the internet for an hour. Then I read a little and go to bed. I sleep and meditate until 10 or 11 am. At 1pm I am normally available. I sit at the computer and take care of my tasks. When I’m done with that, I go for a walk, eat and meditate. This daily schedule works for me, but I’m flexible. I can change my schedule according to outer or inner situations. I feel within myself, what the correct way is at any given time. So I remain in a constant spiritual process of growth. 

9. Survey on happiness 2013: health and family and friends are among the most important factors for people to develop personal happiness. People also consider work important, but religion is less and less important in the eyes of most people. One third of those surveyed think it is important, two thirds think it is not important, and 34 percent think religion has nothing to do with it. 72 percent of Germans belong to a religious community, but even among them, they have less and less religious conviction. 

10. China is going in the wrong direction and doesn’t notice. Maximum economic growth and maximum consumption are a stupid idea. The people in China will just keep getting unhappier and unhappier despite growing wealth. Just like in Germany. Depression is growing. People are more psychically ill. The point of life is maximum inner happiness and not maximum outer happiness. The right idea is a socialist one, that everyone has enough to eat and a good life. Then there can be inner self-realization. A happy and thriving society can only be based on inner happiness and the associated principles of spirituality, enlightenment and all-encompassing love. Reforms are correct and necessary. But the correct long-term perspective is missing in the reforms that take place today. As long as that isn’t recognized, China will just collapse. It shouldn’t orient itself as a country around the west, but on the wisdom of the Chinese ancients. 

11. I’ve had some detail discussions about God in a Catholic and a Protestant internet forum. I’ve published this in the American Wikibooks and on the German Wordpress site. I felt the energies of the readers flow through me all week. Many people connected with my heart. I sent them light and love and prayed for them. I healed and cleansed them as much as possible. Otherwise, I prayed with my masters and left the healing to God. As far as help is needed, it will come from God. I believe that. 

12. The readers had a varied array of problems. Many monks blocked their sexual energy because they consider sex sinful. They view sexuality in a dogmatic way. They were so tense, they couldn’t go forward in their spirituality. I could feel their problems. I considered how I could help them. All of the encouraging words that they should see things in a more laidback way were no help. I walked in the forest, did my spiritual exercises and healed them spontaneously. Spontaneously a lot of the blockages were healed, just by going for a walk.

13. Many of the readers were conflicted over whether God exists as a being who can act and intervene in the world. Does God help in times of emergency? I was also concerned with the question. The answer came the same night. I had a healing vision and I felt healing within minutes. It was clear that God intervened when my way became difficult. I now feel more calm when going through my kundalini processes. If God helps me, then everything will surely be alright in the end. I also believe though, that God puts me through a bit too many difficulties and could help me more. But God probably thinks I can handle it and will grow from the experience.

14. Afterwards, I thought about God. God is enlightenment consciousness that flows through the cosmos. God is happy existence, peace, and unity consciousness. God is in “I am”, in enlightened existence. Enlightened existence arises through serenity, meditation and working on the mind (to take things as they are, and to let go of material wishes). 

15.. God is also love. The love of God acts especially though the enlightened masters. The enlightened masters are the incorporation of the love of God so that God can help people.All of them together form the energy field of love. Everyone helps with his or her special abilities. 

16. Tibetan Buddhism came into existence around 900 AD. There is still a lot to be done for it to adjust to today’s world. Otherwise, Tibetan Buddhism is a good religion that deals with meditation, kundalini yoga and all encompassing love. The Dalai Lama believes in equality for men and women. He teaches modesty and love for other beings. 

17. Words of the Dalai Lama: those who feel demoralized, sad and only complain won’t solve their problems that way. If we only pray, we won’t solve our problems. We have to trust ourselves, and never give up. 

18. There is a tantric practice in Tibetan Buddhism. The Nyingmapa bransch of Tibetan Buddhism is nondogmatic and members can live as monks or as free yogis in relationships. Normally, sexual union is only visualized. Through Tantric God unity images the kundalini energy is activated. 

19. I have just discovered an interesting video online. It deals with the cooperation of masculine and feminine energies. At the first level, it deals with addictive relationships. At the second level, you concentrate on yourself (self-enlightenment). At the third level, you flow positively with all energies. At this level, men and women work together toward enlightenment. 

20. I’ve lived as a yogi and a hermit for 25 years. At the moment, something is changing. I don’t know how long this transformation phase will last. I don’t know what the next step is in this transformation and which missions I will have to fulfill. I can only wait and see what the right way will be. I navigate my way creatively every day. How much personal contact is important? How much peace and quiet and solitude do I need?

21. Some perfectionism is sometimes helpful, but one shouldn’t overdo it. I try to balance this. I combine goal-oriented thinking and self-discipline with a laid-back attitude and knowing that I am imperfect. I feel out what I need to grow optimally spiritually. That is my perfectionism; the exact observation and feeling out what I need. 

22. I have a difficult time behind me. Now it seems to be getting better. I go to bed, observe my body and am curious what will happen. Does the energy start to flow? Is it so strong that I can’t sleep? How long will the energy flow? Three hours, 24 hours, or 2 days? If I get four hours of sleep I’m happy. That’s enough for me. The cleansing process circles my body and my spirit. Again and again fears, relationship longings and additions and nervousness appear. The most difficult phases are overcome by watching TV, going for walks, doing meditation and mantras. I enjoy something nice to awaken joy. 

23. I have a girlfriend. OK, ”girlfriend” is maybe going too far. She wrote to me online and we email, skype or talk on the telephon every day. It’s like a real relationship because we can feel each other’s energies even at a distance. God sent her to me so that I would be strengthened and encouraged on my way. She is very self-confident. She just explained to me: “the mistress recognizes the master”.

24.  We learn from one another and support each other along the spiritual way. She says “life is beautiful.” I would formulate it for myself like this: “life is. You can use joy or suffering in order to grow in enlightenment.”

25. My girlfriend is an important part of my spiritual path at the moment. I connect with her, meditate on her and am in happiness. I see her as a goddess, and activate my kundalini energy that way. I send her light and she dances in happiness. My life is beautiful through her. I can get over the difficult phases. There isn’t any more boredom as a hermit. There is something to talk about daily, something to love, and to learn and to laugh about. She has a good sense of humor. I like that. 

26. The magic of happiness is the enlightenment. In enlightenment you get a view of paradise. You see your world as paradise. You can be successful in love because you have happiness, love and positivity in you. 

27. In Mahayana Buddhism there is the goal to free all beings on earth of their suffering. Jesus sacrificed himself to help his suffering fellow humans. He gave his own life to help people on the way of enlightenment and all-encompassing love. In Yoga, we think the mantra “Lokah Samastah Sukhino Bhavantu” (May all beings be happy.) We practice the way of all-encompassing love and help others as much as possible.

28. Through capitalist globalism a lot of problems in the world are worsening. Although the middle class has grown in India and China and the number of poor perhaps a bit lower, the poverty problem has not been solved. Poverty and hunger in Africa is growing. Through the pressure of industrialization, depression, fear and psychic illness is increasing. 

29. The slums are growing world wide. Two thirds of the farmers in the developing countries will lose their jobs due to farming becoming industrialized. A smaller number of people own more land. The number of landless and starving farmers is increasing. These problems can only be solved by dividing riches more fairly. 

30. We have to change from predator capitalism to a social market economy. Social, economic and ecological problems have to be solved democratically. That can only work when people are centered in positive values like love, peace and justice. Egotistical people in the economy and politics shouldn’t be rewarded anymore. Only people with integrity should rise to the top. Positive values should be taught in school and not egotistical pressure to achieve. For a happy world to exist, we need people to find a positive way of dealing with each other. We should visualize ourselves as Buddha, a Goddess or an angel and think “I send all beings light. May all beings be happy. May there be a happy world.”

1. The [[w:Kundalini|kundalini energy]] has been flowing strongly for a few months. I observe the various phases. 1. The tension dissolving phase. Tension dissolves from deep-seated places. That is often unpleasant. Old pain rises again. I have to go through feelings of fear and sadness. My spirit is nervous and negative. I get through these times by watching TV, listening to music, going for walks, reading or meditating. Mostly it lasts three hours, then it all calms down again. 2. The happiness energy flows. I feel how a chakra opens (at the moment its usually the solar plexus chakra) Then happiness energy flows through my body for some 24 hours. That is a bit annoying at night because I can’t sleep. On the other hand, I usually just can enjoy the feelings of happiness. 3. The recovery phase. This phase can last a bit longer. 

2. Whenever God (life, my masters) think that I need some rest, the kundalini processes stop and I can rest for a few hours or a few days. At that point I’ve gotten enough rest and the whole thing starts again. It’s a rather strenuous time for me. I hope that it will stop at some point and that I will be in lasting happiness. I know that in the meantime also. It’s a pleasant state to be in. I’m so laidback, happy, full of love and joy. All fears disappear. Such phases come every five days lately. 

3. Kundalini energy is what Christians call the holy Ghost. John the Baptist tranferred kundalini energy to Jesus. Jesus then meditated for 40 days in the desert and arrived in enlightenment. The kundalini energy arrived as a dove from energy. The energy of God can flow in many different ways into a person. It can flow from the heavens through the crown chakra, through love in the heart chakra, or through the second chakra as the power of God or through the root chakra as the peace of God (earthing). I’ve experienced all of these ways. 

4. I think there are various possibilities for life after death. A person can develop spiritually on the other side or in life on earth. Or both, combined. It depends on what a person needs and their abilities and what they have decided. As I know thousands of my earlier lives, I believe in the ability to reincarnate. Jesus promised the seriously practicing Christians a life in paradise after death .The same promise exists in Amitabha Buddhism. In yoga there are also teachings of paradise. Yogis can also come to paradise (Siddhaloka, Shivaloka). 

5. Only a few of those who have reached full enlightenment will come back to earth. Life on earth is full of suffering. One has to have a very strong sense of empathy as an enlightened being to incarnate on earth again. If you reincarnate as an enlightened on earth, you most certainly will din your personal proper spiritual path, at the right moment the right information will come. I came across the philosopher Epicure and knew spontaneously that he was right. I could only consistently follow my spiritual path from that point. A woman one read from a book on Buddhism, and immediately knew which path she had to take. 

6. I had my first enlightenment experience through my first love. She opened my heart chakra and I arrived in light. Maybe that’s why I still love women, because through them I can see  the beauty of God. 

7. For me, the Indian Gods are symbolic role models for enlightenment. If we meditate on them, pray to them and identify with them, we awaken our kundalini energy. Then we will become Gods, everyone in his own way. The Gods incorporate various characteristics that you need for enlightenment. Such characteristics as wisdom (Brahma), strength (Shiva), rest (Buddha), love (Lakshmi), meekness (Shiva let Kali overpower him) and happiness (Ganesha). 

8. In my view, there is no devil. The devil is a symbol for the ego, that you overcome with enlightenment. Jesus arrived in enlightenment after 40 days of meditation. The devil left him and the angels served him. He could help and heal other people. An enlightened (saint) doesn’t see the devil, rather God and light in his fellow beings. 

9. God goes beyond good and evil. God is light. You recognize that in enlightenment. You arrive in enlightenment in that you go beyond the level of good and evil, joy and suffering. You achieve that through meditation, in that your mind comes to rest, and also through all-encompassing love, in that you accept suffering and problems in your life. 

10. I studied law and considered the reasons for crime. I believe teaching guilt and social pre-destiny. According to the teachings of pre-destiny, everything is determined already. The reasons for crime are in the outer circumstances of life, and in the psyche. Crime  can be stopped by improving the conditions people live in and by changing the mental pre-disposition of perpetrators. Earlier in Ladakh (an Indian Buddhist region) there was no violence. First with the introduction of western civilization was there violence there. 

11. If we perceive God as a dimension of consciousness in which enlightenment is experience, then we can understand the mystery of suffering. Suffering can lead us to wisdom and empathy. Wisdom is a method to avoid suffering and to reach happiness. Empathy is a way to identify with others and to help them overcome their suffering. Both lead to an enlightened consciousness of unity. If we deal with suffering correctly, then we can grow into enlightenment. We can rise above the suffering in our lives if we do our spiritual exercises and concentrate on building a happy world. 

12. A lot of people have trouble with self-discipline, but self-discipline can be learnt. According to my experience, it’s best to make a clear daily schedule and then follow it consistently for 1-2 months. That’s the time it takes for the mind to get used to it. Self-discipline is important for the way of enlightenment and the way of love. Without self-discipline, you quickly become a victim of your own foolishness, the foolishness of others or from negative energy. In the western world, we live torn between worldly and spiritual energy. Without proper grounding in wisdom and self-discipline it’s hard to stand the worldly energies. 

13. God is a mystery that can also be described with the words, father, son and holy Ghost. From the perspective of enlightenment God is the father of the cosmos, the entirety, the unity consciousness. God as the son is every enlightened person. God as the holy Ghost is the spiritual energy. The kundalini energy mostly rises from the pelvis to the middle of the body up to the head. Then it reaches the crown chakra and consciousness of God is attained. 

14. Suffering in the world can only be ended through the overcoming of the ego of humanity and with a philosophy of love and happiness for all. Many enlightened people are needed for that. Before the Mongolians became the enlightened Tibetan masters of Buddhism, they were warrior-like and put people through a lot of suffering. Then they were a peaceful people. Humankind can become happier. Human rights are an important step in that direction. 

15. I like to plan my life well. I expect to live somewhere between 80 and 90 years. I mentally prepare myself for that. I organize my life so that I get to experience the most important things. I plan my spiritual development so that I am as enlightened as possible before my death. Those who are enlightened can go through death well, thanks to their strong inner energy, and then they reach paradise after death as they already dwell in a paradise consciousness before death. 

16. People in my family usually live to be very old, around 94 years. If I get older than 80, I see that as a gift. If I die sooner, I accept it. God’s plan goes before human plans. But a person can do a lot to live long and to become enlightened. You can live healthy and think positively. Those who eat healthy and exercise regularly live longer. Those who practice spiritually have a good chance of coming to light after death. 

17. Life can only be planned to a certain degree. There are always coincidences which can’t be planned. You have to be flexible to live well. And you should not only think of the future, but live in the present. You need to enjoy life enough. Those who experience enlightenment recognize the deeper point of life. Only a life in enlightened existence and all-encompassing love give deepest fulfillment. 

18. I experience God as an identity-less existence, as the highest consciousness in the whole cosmos. About God’s actions I can only say that my life has developed in a certain way that I see as directed. I cannot say exactly from whom these actions come. If God is a cosmic enlightenment consciousness at the center of happy existence, then God as a being who can act is above all identities and images. You can’t feel any specific being, just the results of the actions in your life. These actions are so subtle that they can only be felt, but cannot be proven. This cannot be measured scientifically, only judged by your own feelings and observed. 

19. I connect to my enlightened masters every day because they inspire me. They are Buddha, Jesus, Swami Sivananda, Sathya Sai Baba, Dalai Lama, Amritananadamayi, Anandamayi Ma, Mother Meera and Epicure. I have tested their teachings with my own experiences and have found them good. I visualize their images, think their names, and read their books. I follow their teachings as far as that works for me. There are many videos on the net which feature my masters. 

20. You can also pray directly to God, It doesn’t matter which names you use. The only important thing is that you are looking for serious guidance and help. The way God helps is to bring you forward spiritually and not to fulfill your egotistical wishes. Everyone can connect with God through prayer, calling, thinking, feeling, oracle, mantra, visualization of a spiritual role model, reading from spiritual texts. 

21. It is important to consistently take the path of wisdom and love each day. The exercises you choose to do are of secondary importance. You should feel within which exercises you need and what will do well for you. Then everything will come at the correct time. Buddha recommended observing the thoughts and to switch between activity (walking) and meditating. For yogis, daily yoga exercises are an important daily ritual. Christians prefer to pray, to read the bible and to visit the church service once a week. Esoterics like to check an oracle, consult angels or the stars for advice. God is in everything and works through everything for those who connect with him seriously. 

22. If you constantly have fearful thoughts, then they can make you sick. If you have thoughts full of rage, then these can lead to rage manifesting on the outside world. Then that person can go so far as to kill themselves of others. Thoughts create our inner feelings and are the basis for our actions. It is important to differentiate between good and bad thoughts and to overcome the bad thoughts. Only in that way can we be happy and build a better world.

23. Everyone is responsible for his or her own life. Everyone is responsible for his or her own thoughts and  actions. The inner happiness develops on its own if we can overcome our inner blockages and attachment to the outer world. The thoughts come to rest, the body relaxes. If the body is relaxed then healing and inner well-being arises. If the spirit is empty of worldly wishes, God can fill you with light and happiness. 

24.. Only those with a goal can achieve a goal.

25. Many things heal on their own. But most illnesses need good medicine. The spiritual path is medicine for inner peace, happiness and all-encompassing love. We should turn earth into a paradise and create love, peace and happiness. Humanity is developing in the direction of enlightenment and a golden age. 

26. It is easier to go through life with company. Two people can support one another on the spiritual path. They can strengthen each other energetically and mentally. God made man and woman so that they can live together in paradise. The central story in the bible shows that. The mystery is that they can both awaken the kundalini snake through their love and sexual energy. Then they can eat the apple of enlightenment, which is a symbol for entirety, unity and life in God. 

27. In that sense, we’re all alike. We are all sparks of God. We can all live in highest happiness. Of course, souls are varied. They have varied abilities and needs. They have different tasks. The problems begin though when some people exploit others, when some live in luxury and others starve. When wars over power and riches take place and people die for no reason, when not everyone is living out their abilities and needs, when not everyone can develop their spiritual potential: these are when trouble starts. 

28. There are different paths to take to get to enlightenment. It is enough to be enlightened, it is enough to have inner peace, happiness and light. But there is also the way of empathy. One sees the suffering in others and helps and wishes other beings happiness and takes others to be more important than oneself. One puts love for others as the first priority and one’s own enlightenment is secondary. The Zen Bodhisattva vow says: the number of beings is eternal, I vow to deliver them all. Greed, hate and ignorance arise constantly, I vow to overcome all of this. The gates of Dharmas is countless, I vow to enter all of them. The path of Buddha is like nothing else,I vow to realize it-

29. Buddha taught that one should bring the self to enlightenment and not harm others. That is also the main way of yoga according to Patanjali. In addition, there is the way of love in Buddhism (Mahayana, Dalai Lama) and in yoga the way of karma yoga often in connection with bhakti yoga. Along the way of love in Buddhism the Bodhisattva is the central model. A Bodisattva sacrifices the complete entrance into Nirvana until one has rescued all fellow beings. 

30. In Yoga, the God of love, Vishnu incarnates on earth when he needs to help people. There are many enlightened masters like Amritanandamayi and Mother Meera who devote their lives to the spiritual rescue of their fellow beings. Amritanandamayi had the choice of becoming a Buddha or a mother of all beings. She decided on the latter. My observation is that there is suffering in the world. There are a lot of egotistical people who cause a lot of suffering. They have the choice of continuing that or to work toward a happy world. It is a blessing that many enlightened masters don’t think just on their own happiness, but on other people. 

31. Yesterday, my television broke. Unfortunately, I was so upset about it that I set some strong energy processes in motion. I tried to stay calm, but that only worked a little. I bought a new television, installed it, and tortured myself with the directions. At some point I tried again, and it suddenly turned off. God is playing with me!

[[File:HE-BIRTH-OF-RADIO-SAI SWAMI.jpg|thumb|Sathya Sai Baba]]

1. The present is a time of healing. For the past thirty years, I’ve been burdened by burnout I had from exam stress while studying. I felt powerless and had sleep disturbances. Two weeks ago, a lot of tension dissolved from my head. That was the main cause of my sleep disturbances. For the five days since then, my body feels lighter and I have   more energy. The burnout seems to have healed. At some point that had to happen. The chakras open again and energy can flow once more. The body and the spirit are healthy again. At some point, you have a lot of love, strength, happiness and energy within. 

2. There is God. God is experienced in enlightenment. Then you know what God is. The term God should lead to enlightenment and the experience of God. There are many ways to God. There are many names for Gods. Everyone can choose the path or the name that helps him or her. God is a mystery. Jesus described the mystery of God in his way. He never said his way was the only way. John the Baptist put these words in his mouth in order to divide him from Judaism. Jesus saw himself as a Jew and a follower of Moses and Elija. Jesus didn’t want to start a new religion. His followers tried that. It began with Paul and came to a head some 100 years after Christ with the scripture of John. Today we should try to return to the original Christianity. A good basis for this is the second Vatican council 1962 to 1965 where it was recognized that the light of God shines through all religions. 

3. I believe that everyone has a free will. Everyone can decide whether to go to enlightenment and to God or not. It is the essence of my teachings to recommend the spiritual way to people and for them to decide on enlightenment as a goal. If you decide to go for enlightenment seriously, then God and enlightened masters will help and lead you. Enlightenment means dissolving the ego. And that means that things will develop differently from the way you planned. For me, a woman came into my life totally unplanned and my enlightenment path is developing entirely differently from the way I expected. 

4. There are different ways to enlightenment. The concept of Buddha is significant. A person should avoid attachments and outer enjoyment and to reject suffering and to concentrate on wisdom and should develop inner happiness and inner peace, modesty. Then he or she can reach enlightenment and become a Buddha. Jesus taught that it was good to live in the kingdom of God. The kingdom of God is life in light and the overcoming of duality (good, evil, joy, suffering). Through spiritual energy, you feel connected to everything. You are more connected to your spiritual energy, rather than your body. 

5. The Buddhist enlightenment concept can be described with the image of a resting Buddha. We practice being a Buddha and accepting things calmly. Jesus centered around sacrifice of the ego and to submit to the will of God (life) and to work for the happiness of all beings (and to live in all-encompassing love and to give endlessly). The core of the Christian teachings is love of God and to love others. 

6. In Hinduism, there are many ways to come to light. Shiva is the master of the five elements. He mastered the five characteristics of wisdom, love, strength, calm and joy while living on earth. He awoke his inner happiness with kundalini yoga. His wife Parvati (Shakti) brought love in his life. His son Ganesha preferred the way of joy. At the same time he is also the God of wisdom and success. 

7. Today I’m feeling fine. My cleansing processes are resting a bit. Yesterday night cleansing energy flowed through me for five hours. Then it stopped suddenly and I fell asleep. I slept five hours and felt recovered. After the difficult cleansing, I felt like myself again and back in my normal life. I just wrote in the esoteric forum that my inner happiness is awakened by imagining a beautiful landscape with a person I love. That’s paradise yoga, then you get a feeling of paradise daily. My dream woman exists for real in my life. I get a Darshan from my Goddess daily. 

8. My girlfriend: ”I’ve never had an enlightenment experience, but I’ve seen miracles that prove for me that confirm God’s existence, and that he is with me and also the enlightened masters. I understand that Nils has a need to pass on his experiences, and I think it’s wonderful that he does just that. I also feel that need, but I don’t have his energy or his confidence. My self-doubt, but also the constant conflicts with my ego, and the danger that I could be lead to it make me a “mistress/master in hiding.””

9. And further: ” I was convinced I could find my way on my own, as I didn’t trust anyone or anything other than my understanding and my limited senses. Today I am more humble and mild. I can give up my fighter tendencies for a time and look into the depths of things. There are words I hate such as “you must, you should, you can do this, you can’t do that.” And what do I gladly read in texts from Nils? Just these words!! But now I can perceive them in a different way. I feel their energy, the deeper meaning, not the words or single sentences that bothered me before. I read, feel and can get a lot from the experience and wisdom!”

10. In a dream a little girl appeared to Nils. She had forgotten her name, and who she was. She had lost her enlightenment consciousness. Nils hugged her and caused her to laugh. He felt a great love from heart to heart. He took the little girl by the hand and they went through the dream, full of wonder and surprise, until they both came to a river through which energy began to flow through them both. 

11. The core of enlightenment is the sacrifice of the ego. Without a sacrifice, you can’t come to enlightenment. There is the wisdom sacrifice. We orient ourselves around wisdom and take our personal way of wisdom. We live in rest and spiritual practice to come to light, but there is also the sacrifice of love. We make a sacrifice to others to help them along the spiritual way. We do things for others and go beyond our own fixation on the ego. We work for the happiness of all beings and achieve unity consciousness. 

12. A spiritual person can abstain. He or she can live without a relationship. Many yogis, monks and nuns do just that. Those who want to live in the kingdom of God, should give up outer attachments. Then the life energy flows within and awakens the inner happiness. A lot of rest, living away from the world and effective spiritual exercises like yoga, walking, meditation, reading, praying and working with the thoughts are the basis for enlightenment and a life in light. 

13. For many people, living alone is necessary to be free of the attachments to other people, sex and relationships. For me personally, it was the right thing to live without a relationship for ten years. But I see that a relationship with a woman is good for me. She brings love and joy into my life and opens my heart. I learn to communicate with another person and to see myself in another person. 

14. Relationships can be a spiritual learning process and at the same time a way of opening the heart. A positive relationship can heal through love and sexuality. They can go together to happiness, light and enlightenment. There is the way of tantric yoga. Sexuality is practiced in a way that spiritual energy is awakened and tension is dissolved. Tantric yoga is an art. Healing energies must be developed with losing oneself in worldly energies. It is important to anchor the being in calm, God, and spirituality. We should overcome our attachments through spiritual exercises, through peace and quiet and being alone. We should allow ourselves to be lead through God, our enlightened masters and the voice of our inner wisdom. 

15. [[w:Sathya Sai Baba|Sathya Sai Baba]] is a well-known Indian master. He tells most of his followers to follow the way of the spiritual relationship. He dedicated his book “Sai Baba Talks about Relationships” to his student Stephan von Stepski-Doliwa. He teaches daily meditation, positive thinking and the guidance of the inner voice. He sees sexuality as Godly energy. It should be experienced with joy and responsibility. Both partners should connect themselves with their higher selves or God or light or inner truth. The goal should be to grow in light together. Those who do good for others will harvest goodness. Those who live their relationships through God are blessed. 

16. Selfless serving is an important spiritual exercise for Sai Baba. Sai Baba says “obligate yourself to serve selflessly if you want to keep your heart pure.” Seva gives us the consciousness of unity. Sai Baba says that we should first serve our own families, only then when we’ve fulfilled our obligations in love, then we can go onto the next step of serving the community. The big goal of Sai Baba is to build a golden era on earth. Everyone can help each other. 

17. I believe that Sai Baba was enlightened. His teachings about all-encompassing love are very good. His core teachings were of love, peace, truth, justice and non-violence. He saw ways to God in all religions.

18. Wikipedia: &quot;Śri Sathya Sai Baba was an Indian guru and spiritual leader. The reputed materialisations of vibhuti (holy ash) and other small objects such as rings, necklaces, and watches by Sathya Sai Baba along with reports of miraculous healings, resurrections, clairvoyance, bilocation, and alleged omnipotence and omniscience were a source of both fame and controversy; devotees considered them signs of divinity, while sceptics viewed them as simple conjuring tricks.&quot; I can not say anything about materializations. But I know that one can help with spiritual energy and healing.

19. I think enlightened masters don’t need to be perfect and are allowed to have imperfections. Imperfections make people think. It can destroy the ego if you are aware of your own imperfections. In Tibetan Buddhism it is practiced that one is aware of his or her mistakes. On the other hand it’s important to overcome imperfections and mistakes as much as possible. We should concentrate on the positive aspects of ourselves and others. 
 
20. Last night, the energy processes continued, but I could still sleep four hours. It was interesting how the night went. I had the feeling God wants to train me to be a spiritual master who can help other people optimally spiritually. I had a lot of crises last night. I could only overcome them by doing the absolute correct thing at the correct moment. I had to view each situation exactly, figure out which energy points to concentrate on and which words (visualization, mantras, prayers) would work best. 

21. Then the blockages dissolved, the energy began to flow, the crisis was over and inner happiness arose and I came to a state of peace and quiet. I slept until the next energy process arose. Then high concentration was necessary. A new situation with new strategies for solving the problem. Ten hours of energy work are behind me. I’ve emerged victorious. If I can help myself, then I can also help others. That is probably the idea behind my hard spiritual training. I just drank a hot cocoa and went for a long walk. 

22. Girlfriend: “I am very glad if I can help to dissolve blockages on your heart. I do energy work and sometimes know what is a topic of interest with a person I deal with.”

23. Nils: &quot;Which goals do you have for your life? What do you wish for the future? What do you want to do and achieve.” Girlfriend: “ I simply want to hear and listen what the divine  wants for me, which way the divine leads me and to courageously follow my heart and my love. Otherwise, like everyone, I want to be happy. Happy with myself and to have God happy with me, and to be happy with others. And also to experience real love within a partnership.”
 
24. Nils: To go together in light is the best perspective that a person can have. Under the protection and leadership of God, you have the foundation for optimism. Everything will go well with us both. And everything is already good the way things are. We’ve found each other at exactly the right moment. Just now I’m ready for you, and you are ready for me. If we met earlier, I wouldn’t have been ready for a woman. 

25. I walk the path of all-encompassing love. I’ve taken the Bodhisattva vow with the Dalai Lama. I think it is good to work for the happiness of all beings. And it’s nice if I can do that with a partner.

26. My main method of healing is according to the five principles for health ( healthy diet, regular exercise, enough relaxation, avoiding poison, and thinking positively). Yoga helps to relieve conflict through exercise, meditation and positive thinking. In this way, you help activate the body’s self healing capacity. According to my experience you can heal yourself with spiritual energy and send this to other people as well. There are many ways to transfer energy such as reiki, shiatsu, massage hooponopono. I see myself not as a healer, rather a spiritual teacher. My girlfriend feels more attracted to healing work. I am glad that she also found Mother Meera’s teachings. 

27. The deeper point of life isn’t material happiness, it’s inner happiness. Material happiness is reached through consumption, carrier and material riches. Inner happiness is developed through spiritual exercises. Then one day you can reach light, God, inner peace and immeasurable happiness in all-encompassing love, which is the true fulfillment of life. It is also nice if you can connect inner and outer fulfillment. 

28. I’m going through a difficult time because the kundalini energy is flowing constantly, and many old hurts are coming up and keep me from sleeping. I hope that it will get better soon. Yesterday evening I was suddenly very tired. I lay down to meditate, then suddenly during the course of the evening a great layer of tension lifted. I considered what problem was hidden under that. When I went to bed, I felt the happiness energy flow as a result of the tension dissolving. After four hours the problem appeared which had caused such inner tension. 

29. I went through a dying situation from an earlier life. I didn’t want to let go of my family and friends, so I became tense for many lives. An image of a mother with many children appeared. She was happy. And now she had lost everything. I transformed myself, looked for happiness in myself and went into death. I know that people die and have to let go of attachments to the world in order to go into the light. I first went through all of the feelings of addiction, anger and mourning. I went through all of my feelings of loss enough and so let go of them. Then I tried to reach light. I imagined myself as a Buddha of happiness and activated my kundalini energy. I sent all of my friends light and reached light myself. 

30. I went for long walks, let go of my sadness, arrived in peace and was suddenly in unity. I experienced energy of calm, unity, happiness and love. I notice I achieved a leap up in consciousness.

31. God can be experienced. God is love, peace, happiness and joy. Those who experience God, are enthusiastic and want more God until they reach complete enlightenment.

[[File:Narendra Modi attends 60th birthday celebrations of Satguru Sri Mata Amritanandamayi in Kerala 2.jpg|thumb|400px|Amritanandamayi]]

1. [[w:Mata Amritanandamayi|Amritanandamayi (Amma)]] Is one of the most well-known spiritual masters today. She was born 27.9.1953 in Kerala. Already at age 5 she began her spiritual practice. Her motto was “ don’t waste a moment of your life.” At the age of 17 she reached enlightenment and with 22 she reached complete enlightenment. She established an Ashram in Souther India (Kerala) where many people from the west also live. Her teachings are typical for neo-Hinduism. She is undogmatic, humorous and emphasizes the unity of all religions. 

2. Amritanandamayi has built up a lot of humanitarian work. She set up villages for poor families. She finances schools, universities and hospitals. She started an organization for single mothers. She gives all mothers enough money to live from. That is a very big social deed in India. She works for the equal treatment of men and women. She established an Indian temple with female priests, and re-awakened the Brahma cult. Brahma is the Indian God of wisdom. Equal to him is Brahmani, the mistress. She holds a book, ap prayer chain and a musical instrument. 

3. It is good to take a specific time daily for the spiritual way. It is also good to take a particular time daily for intensive spiritual practice. The amount of time needed for enlightenment varies from person to person. Jesus needed 40 days, Ramanamaharshi 5 minutes, Buddha 6 years, Swami Shivanda 9 years, Amma 12 years and Moses 40 years.  

4. The teachings of the four stages of life are a basis in Hinduism. The four phases are: the student, the family, the spirituality and the enlightenment. In other words: “ In Hinduism there are four phases or Ashramas in life: the time of Brahmacharya or the student, Grihastha or the household, Vanaprastha or the time of the hermit and Sannyasa, the phase of ascetism.  (Yogawiki) The 60th birthday is especially celebrated in India because this is the entrance step into the spiritual life. Many Indians move to a place alone or with a partner to practice intensively spiritually. 
 
5. Enlightenment can be compared with varied levels of happiness. People live at quite varied levels of happiness. Some people are depressed, some afraid, some aggressive, some addicted, some are more or less happy. And some people are enlightened. Even an enlightened person can experience joy and suffering. But his general level of happiness is higher than others. 

6. In yoga, it is said that an enlightened person is 100 times happier than one who is not enlightened. And an enlightened person along the way of all-encompassing love is 100 times happier than a regular enlightened person. There are many levels of enlightenment. You can develop far. You don’t act from the ego anymore. You can always deal from the perspective of love and help others. Then you stabilize and strengthen your experiences in enlightenment. 

7. Laotse:”I’m good to the good, and to the evil I am also good, because I am good.” Jeses taught the way of all-encompassing love and to also love one’s enemies. According to my experience, you then arrive in light (the dimension of enlightenment beyond all duality), if you send all beings light. 

8. There are many types of spiritual students. Some follow their master word for word and some anchor themselves in their own wisdom. I belong to the latter. 

9. Those who would like to be successful along the spiritual way need self-discipline. Those who practice with a goal in mind and live in all-encompassing love while connecting with God or enlightened masters will one day arrive in light. Those who practice with perseverance will one day be filled with grace by God. 

10. Special spiritual abilities (Siddhi) develop along the spritual way. In yoga, Siddhi should not be shown to the public in order to keep the ego from becoming stronger. On the other hand it is good to help others with special abilities. They should be practiced in a way that the ego is not reinforced, they can be used subtly, and with positive motivation. 

11. It is better to be happy rather than unhappy. It is better to be wise rather than unwise. It is better to be enlightened rather than unenlightened. Those who comprehend that , make their way to the light. They find the appropriate spiritual exercises and one day arrive in a life in God. Our deepest longing is for love and for happiness and to live in eternity.  We long for a life in light, a life in God, for enlightenment. May we all recognize this longing and realize it as well.

12. The yogi is laughing about this ”” Two women are talking. One says: ”lately I’ve had such a difficult time speaking. I wanted to say, “I want to drink wine.“Instead I said, “I want to drink line”. The other said. “I experienced something just like that. At breakfast I wanted to say to my husband: “please pass me the coffee.” Instead I said: “you damn asshole, you’ve ruined my whole life!””

13. Fifteen year old girl on the internet ”My life is just school, food, TV and computer. There’s nothing worse than that…” Answer from Yogi Nils: “There is. No school, no food, no TV and no computer. Seriously, the center of life is inner happiness. Those who do not know the way of inner happiness suffer in life. Build your inner happiness daily with spiritual exercises like yoga, meditation, reading, thought work, doing good for others. Then you can see the positive in your life. Live as a spiritual person in God and you live in happiness.”

14. A person can also grow in enlightenment without a spritual practice if he or she goes through life consciously, thinks positive and does good for others.  Meditation and thought work are the main techniques on the spiritual way. At best, they are both practiced to reach enlightenment, but for some people, positive thinking is enough. For others meditation or prayer to God is enough. 

15. I differentiate between the way of enlightenment and the way of love. Both lead to a life in light, but they have different points of emphasis. Along the way of love, you try to see yourself in others, to help them and to help them become enlightened and to build a world of love and peace. Then you reach all-encompassing love, unity consciousness and light. Along the way of enlightenment peace and calm is practiced, in addition to attachment-free existence and self- discipline. God is found in calm. The mind is empty of worldly things. The thoughts calm to rest. The person relaxes deep in the soul. And suddenly inner happiness appears. 

16. The original Buddhism is the way of enlightment, just like yoga according to Patanjali. You work for your own enlightenment and try not to harm others. The Dalai Lama represented the Mahayana Buddhism, which is a mix of the way of love and the way of enlightenment. In Christianity we also find the double path of love to others and enlightenment (the love to God). Neo Hinduism follows the way of love and combines it with the path of entlightenment and the Guru yoga (Bhakti yoga).

17. Then you don’t get lost along the spiritual way and won’t risk being the victim of false gurus. Fake teachers exist all around the world, sadly. They put their ego, their riches or power as the center of their methods. They are often so clever that it is hardly noticeable, but those who look exactly and sense, will see it at some point. 

18.  There is only one truth, there is only one God. But there are many images of God. You should find the image that helps you personally along the spiritual path. Be aware that God (enlightenment) is beyond all images.

19. I see God as the higher consciousness behind the material cosmos. This consciousness works through all people, beings, and also through the material. God consciousness expresses itself through enlightenment and saints. They give us orientation to find our way to the kingdom of God and light. They help us along our spiritual way and bring spiritual energy to us. 

20. Those who have a happy life on earth will hardly reach toward enlightenment. Those who first know enlightenment as a goal accept the effort it takes. Those who know paradise will try to get there. Those who so wish, can incarnate on earth many times. No one can force you to enlightenment. At some point the soul is ready because it wants to come to happiness and it wants to be free of suffering. 

21. There are various directions in yoga. I support and teach the way of love, peace and happiness. I work for a cooperation of all religions, all spiritual people and all yogis. I try to connect the religions. For that reason, I gladly use the term God. I can also express myself in a way that Christians will understand. 

22. In Christianity, it is told to reject magic. At the same time, Jesus and Moses were magicians. They had spiritual abilities and helped others with them. The difference is that Jesus and Moses didn’t see themselves as doing magic, rather that God was acting through them. Their egos were not strengthened through the acts of magic, for that reason. They didn’t use their own energy because they acted through God’s energy, were more tools for God. 

23. I had an interesting experience yesterday. Some people connected with me mentally and wanted to have some of my spritual energy. I gave them as much energy as I could. I noticed it wasn’t enough. I asked my masters for guidance and to help these people. Suddenly I saw myself in God (surrounded by the cosmos, and in the unity of the cosmos). My kundalini energy awoke. I saw the light of God in the world. And I had so much power and happiness in me that I could give all of the people what they needed. I noticed why I wrote the sentence, that God works through me. He helped me to arrive in light and to let God act through me. 

24. God is in Yoga symbolically described as an elephant. Every unenlightened person considers only a part of the elephant. How can we see the entire elephant? How can we come to the bigger picture of the world? How can we see the unity of the world? There are a few techniques. We can meditate, let the thoughts flow by and become empty inside. 

25. We can think about the elephant and come to comprehension of the entirety. We can understand the elephant through individual parts of it. We can hold onto the tail and let God bring us into light. We let the elephant stomp on our ego. We let go of our own will in the face of life. We take things as they are. We sacrifice our worldly wishes on the altar of light.
 
26. We can begin with the head of the elephant. We can practice listening to our inner voice of wisdom. We practice seeing with the eyes of the elephant (the eyes of God). We can listen to the suffering of other beings with the big ears of the elephant and use our trunks (our hands) to do good for others. At some point we learn to ride the elephant and to mentally be permanent in enlightened existence. Then the inner sun shines and enlightens our world. 

27. If we fall from the elephant, we can use spiritual exercises to bring the light back. We use self-discipline to be back in the light of God. Christians have the mass or church service, prayer, reading in the bible and works of mercy. In Islam, one prays five times a day, goes to Mecca, fasts, gives almose and orients the self around God. 

28. In yoga there are many ways to enlightenment, such as hatha yoga (physical exercise), tantric yoga (the way of spiritual relationships), kama yoga (the clever use of joy and enjoyment), kundalini yoga (yoga of enlightenment energy), mantra yoga (meditative chanting), raja yoga (meditation), jnana yoga (the way of wisdom, thinking), bhakti yoga (master yoga) and karma yoga (doing good).

29. You should learn to watch the ego. Otherwise you can easily become a victim of it. Even enlightened persons can get lost in the trap of worldly energy. Even enlightened people can fall into the trap of power, sex and greed. There are many examples of that. Enlightenment must be developed on the basis of wisdom and all-encompassing love.

30. It is a trap to see one’s own spiritual path as the only correct path. There are many ways to come to enlightenment. Enlightenment goes beyond all concepts, but concepts are used to reach enlightenment.

[[File:Sri Anandamoyi Ma.jpg|thumb|Sri Anandamayi Ma]]

1. [[w:Anandamayi Ma|Anandamayi Ma]] (born 30.April 1896, died 27.August 1982) was a well-knwon spiritual mistress from India. Ananda means happiness. Anandamayi was a mother of happiness. She was friendly, calm and cheerful. She could tell stories well and sing nicely. She liked to dance. She taught people to laugh: “laugh as much as possible.” She was married with 12 years and moved in with her husband with 18 years old. 

2. At the age of 21 she started her six year Sadhana. She first spoke the name of the God Visnu “hari” as a mantra because her parents were followers of Vishnu. Her husband, however was a follower of Shiva, so she switched to the mantra “Shiva”. She danced to the mantras and then rested in a peaceful meditation afterward. After some months she began with bodily exercises of yoga that came to her spontaneously without having learnt them. She practiced these asanas intuitively. She practiced creative and intuitive hatha yoga, and did her mental exercises creatively and intuitively. She practiced the positive characteristics and the images that she needed at the right moment. The various divinities flowed through her mind. She visualized their forms, identified with them and thought their names as mantras and activated thus her kundalini energy. 

3. After Anandamayi Ma had loaded her body and mind with spiritual energy, she rested for three years in the great peace (raja yoga). She hardly spoke (mauna) and did little. Mostly she just sat there. She didn’t need any more exercises. She had awakened her kundalini energy and it cleansed her body, mind and soul by itself. She only needed peace and quiet. She had to stop her energy from being used in outer activities. She had to live as calmly as possible so that the energy went inside and dissolved conflicts and tensions. 

4. Anandamayi Ma was a master of hatha yoga. She gåve the world the way of creative yoga. Creative yoga consists of exercises for the body (hatha yoga), mental yoga (bhakti yoga), meditation (raja yoga) and the way of all-encompassing love (karma yoga). 

5. In 1922, her husband explained that without the initiation of a guru there could be no greater progress along the spiritual way. So she decorated her room, lit incense and initiated herself. She connected with her inner guru and a mantra appeared suddenly in her mind. 

6.  At the end of her Sadhana, she reached a state of inner happiness that fit her title of “happy-spirited mother”. At this point, she wished for all beings to experience the level of joy she had felt. She wanted to share her enlightenment with the entire world and worked as a spiritual master in India for the rest of her life. As yogi Nils heard her sentence in 2001 (“ may all beings experience this joy”) he spontaneously threw a hand into the sky and cried, “here I am! I’m ready. I want to live in great happiness.” Anandamayi Ma heard him from the other side and sent him a dream. A little snake bit Nils and awoke his kundalini energy. Nils was flooded by light for three days. The snake is a symbol of the god Shiva. A little snake meant that Nils should develop himself slowly, toward enlightenment. And that’s how it went, too. 

7. Anandamayi Ma taught a life of austerity as a yogi as well as a spiritual life within the context of a family. She recommended everyone, whatever their life situation, to meditate at a certain time each day. The core of her teachings was: “the highest calling of a person is to strive toward self-realization. All other obligations are secondary.” Those who practice spiritually 15 minutes every day will be blessed by her. Anandamayi Ma taught the unity of all religions. We can use spiritual exercsises from all of the religions. We should see what works well for each of us personally. 

8. Inner happiness can take hold in a person when the tension in body and spirit are dissolved. Buddha developed an ingenious way to do this. This was called “sitting, walking, and mind work”, If you switch between sitting and walking, then inner tension can be released in an optimal fashion. If you just sit, the mind becomes dull. Regular movement makes the mind clear and the body healthy. It gives people inner power. It enables people to take the spiritiual way. It gives them the strength to live as a winner. If you only walk or run, then the mind becomes restless. Inner happiness arises out of inner calm. If the body is held still and quiet, then you can come to the deeper dimensions of meditation. Meditating can be done while sitting or lying down. Both are good meditative positions. It varies from person to person as to which are the best. In addition to meditation and exercise, the dissolving of tension with thought work is an important method to come to enlightenment. A yogi should develop thoughts of love, wisdom and self-discipline. He has  to keep his or her thoughts stiller and stiller until he or she lives entirely in calm and peace. 

9. This basic model for the dissolving of tension has been expanded by Yogi Nils to include five activities: lying down (or sitting and meditating), reading (thought work), walking (exercise, yoga), doing good for others (work), and to enjoy life. Switching between these activities is an effective way to dissolve tension. This is his way into the light.

10. From a certain point in the course of maintaining calm, the energy of a person turns inward. He no longer lives through his outer activities. He lives from the perspective of inner cleansing, the dissolving of tension and the development of inner happiness. The yogi is then cleansed by his own life energy and doesn’t need to do very many spiritual exercises any longer. He or she then just needs to maintain a state of calm. Every yogi needs to find this point where energy goes inward. It is difficult to find, and difficult to maintain. Life energy can move to a state of over-activity or dullness. Both need to be stopped with self-discipline on a daily basis. An effective yogi life feels like constantly living against the stream of neurotic impulses. First the state of calm is boring and then suddenly the energy begins to work within. If you keep the state of calm, then inner happiness appears. 

11. According to Swami Shivananda, enlightenment can appear through silence, spiritual exercises, and all embracing love. If a yogi lives alone in silence then half the way to enlightenment ist already gone. The second half is done with spiritual practices (yoga, meditation, positive thinking). The gate to a life in the light you pass with all-encompassing love. If a yogi lives mainly for the happiness of all beeings and for a happy world then the ego will dissolve. 

12. My spiritual daily schedule is the main techinque along my way to the light. Mainly, it takes a very sensitive and consistently practiced schedule to dissolve the tension in my body and spirit. I divide my spiritual exercises throughout the day so that a constant inner cleansing will take place.
 
13.  A yogi feels out which techniques are needed at any moment. If the body is getting limp and flabby, he or she goes for a walk. If the mind is restless, he or she does some yoga or meditates. If the spirit feels against the spiritual path, the yogi reads a spiritual book. A yogi feels out where the tension lies and uses the right methods. The tension is usually found in that which the body and spirit don’t seem to want at the moment. Where the neurotic defense mechanisms are, that is the way to the light.  On the other hand, it’s good to give the body and spirit what they want sometimes, otherwise more tension is created. 

14. The way of inner happiness requires a lot of wisdom and inner feeling, and this needs to be developed daily. I begin each day with a positive attitude. Which exercises do I need in which order? Then I create a positive vision of the day and put a statue on my altar that reflects this vision. What is a positive quote for you today? Which activity brings you into the light?

15. The main principle for dealing with a painful situation is to behave correctly on the outside and to manage the thoughts and feelings as well as you can. If a problem appears, keep your head clear. What is the right thing right now? What needs to be done? Deal with the problem without becoming enmeshed in your feelings. Get a clear picture of reality. Solve the problem to the extent that you can. Consider how you can deal with stressful thoughts. Stop your stressful throughts! Are there some positive thoughts that will help you?

16. If the painful situation is over in the outer world, we can relax on the inside, too. We can heal our spiritual wounds. A Buddha goes through painful situations without spiritual wounds. But, as we aren’t yet Buddhas, wounds are likely to appear. At some point in these problems, we’ve probably created tension. This tension needs to be dissolved. 

17. If we don’t heal ourselves after stress situations, then the wounds incurred stay in the soul. They limit our spiritual well-being and lead to neurotic behaviors and can also cause physical illness. For this reason, it’s important to take enough time to recover after a stressful situation. We let ourselves relax, and we are gentle with ourselves. We let go of bottled up rage, our fears and our grief. The painful situation is worked with, worked on, and cleansed from the soul until peace and positiviity appear. We do relaxation exercises, yoga and meditation. We can go for walks, read spiritual books and enjoy something nice. With rest, exercise and some joy in life, our souls can be healed. 

18.  It’s important to examine your fears. It’s important to find the fears we’ve buried in us in order to let go of them. We think about our fears, we find positive sentences which help us. One could be “I accept reality, the way it is. I concentrate on my positive goals. I live as a winner.” Many of our fears can be dissolved with positive thoughts. It often helps to think clearly about the fears. Once we’ve recognized these fears, we can develop them into positive thoughts. In an emergency situation, we can think a positive sentence as long as a mantra to get the fearful thoughts to disappear.
 
19. For many people, it’s helpful to talk to others about problems. Who can you talk to? You can also send someone else a letter or email, or connect to enlightened masters or God. 

20. Otherwise, there is the zen meditation. This meditation can be done while sitting, lying down, or when walking. We stop all of our thoughts for a short time until we come to a state of meditation (1 to 5 minutes). We concentrate on our problem, then think some positive sentences and let our feelings and thoughts take their course. We observe our thoughts from a distance. They can develop or die down as long as it takes before they disappear. The entire time we stay in a light meditative state. The main principle with the zen meditation is that we don’t think consciously, but let the thoughts go, that they do their own thinking. The problems dissolve into nothingness this way. Calm, wellbeing, and all-encompassing positivity grow in us. We reach light and inner happiness.

21.  If a problem affects me particularly strongly, then I practice a ritual to overcome suffering. The first thing I do is take an oracle card ([[wikiversity:Happiness/A Psychological Interpretation of the Tarot|Tarot]], [[wikiversity:Buddha oracle|Buddha oracle]], [[wikiversity:Angel oracle|Angel oracle]]). When shuffling the cards, I connect with an enlightened master or God and ask for guidance and help. Then I take a card, read the text, and think how the oracle card fits to my situation. Which strategies does the oracle recommend for my situation? What does the oracle say about my problem? Which helpful thoughts does it give to me?

22. I usually start to see things from a positive perspective when reading the oracle and thinking about the text. It makes me feel better when I recognize there is a positive strategy for every situation. A positive quote from the oracle strengthens the positive in me. Thinking about it leads me to a constructive consideration process of my problem at the time. I notice that there is something I can do. I am not a helpless victim. I can live as a winner. I can solve the problem. 

23. After I take an oracle card, I read some pages in a spiritual book. I consider which book I need at the time. Which book gives me strength? Which book strengthens positive energy? A spiritual book has a positive energy field. If we take some time within this energy field, we achieve a more positive state of mind. 

24.. After reading, I go for a walk for an hour. I move my rage and nervous emotions out of my body. I practice mantras, and do meditation (five minute thought stop). Then I think about the problem. After a half an hour, I usually feel better. I begin to see things clearer and in the right perspective. I am one with the world and myself. 

25. After going for a walk, I do some yoga exercises and a longer meditation while lying down. I put some music on and stay lying down until my mind has come to rest. Then I get up, eat something nice and think about what else I need. Then I give it to myself as well. It’s often helpful to do something creative, like painting, writing, playing music and other forms of expression. We can do something good for others and bring some energy of love to them and ourselves. What is your way toward all-encompassing love and how can you take action for the happiness of all beings?

26. In terms of bigger problems, I often have to do several rounds of reading, waliing, doing good, enjoying myself and meditating. Mostly I come to the point where peace and calm arise. Then I am gentle with myself and heal myself more and more. If a problem doesn’t go away after one day, then I stop my thoughts for a longer period of time. I don’t allow myself to think about the problem, because thinking about it too much is not productive and just increases stress. I give myself some time each day to work with bigger problems. 

27. Overcoming suffering is a creative process. You have to sense what you need at each moment. What is the best way to solve problems at the moment? What will lead you to inner peace and positiviity? People vary, and so need varied strategies. It’s important though to avoid addictive things such as pills, smoking, drugs, alcohol and too many sweets. It’s better to overcome problems with techniques for inner happiness. Then we grow with the problems. We raise ourselves above the problems and land in happiness one day. May that come to be for all of us. 

28.  Work with the psyche is a personal thing. Positive thinking helps for some people. Solving problems is also important.  Supressing feelings is usually a bad idea from a spiritual perspective. But we can learn how to deal with our feelings and even learn to control themto a certain degree. Feelings come from thoughts. If we avoide negative thoughts, we avoid negative feelings. Often, we have a tiny window of time before thoughts manifest into feelings. In that moment we can decide to stay in inner peace. 

29. The main work along the spiritual way is mostly work from the shadow side. We work with our negative characteristics like attachment, fear, addiction, grief, pride, rage and foolishness. WE solve our problems. We accept things as they are. We integrate suffering into our lives. We develop our inner happiness, inner peace and our ability to just flow, and roll with things. We rise above our suffering. 

30. The journey and the goal are intertwined. We need a spiritual goal to help us find our spiritual path. We should hang onto the goal until we’ve reached it. We should sense what is right with every step we take. Being focused on the end goal and being present in the moment are not mutually exclusive, rather they compliment one another. That is the way to go. 

31. Enlightenment means intense work on one’s own pysche over a long period of time. Mother Meera says you need thousands of lives to reach enlightenment. THe main thing is to see through the way of worldly enjoyment and to comprehend the meaning of inner happiness. If you recognize enlightenment as the main goal in life, then you can practice with that goal in mind. According to Amritanandamayi, you grow five times as fast if you live in peace and calm away from others. Sathya Sai Baba said that one needs three lives as a yogi to come to complete enlightenment. The quickest spiritual way is the way that can be practiced effectively for you personally, without overwhelming yourself. It’s possible to come to enlightenment in one life as a yogi, but that can be difficult if you have a lot of tension. It is easier to find your way in the light through several lives. With every life, you grow a little in happiness, peace and love.

[[File:Mother Meera 8.jpg|thumb|Mother Meera]]

1. [[w:Mother Meera|Mother Meera]] is an enlightened master who lives in Germany. She gives light and blessings as a free gift to all people. Her Darshan is free. In the beginning just a few people went to her. Now she is in the center of the spiritual scene in Germany. Nils recommends every yogi  receive a blessing at least once in his or her life from an enlightened master. A Darshan is an important cleansing step along the spiritual way. Often, enlightenment energy is transferred that can develop into great grace one day. Mother Meera believes in the unity of religions and the right to choose individual paths in spirituality. Statements from Mother Meera:

''“God is calm. Everything comes from the calm. In calm, more work can be done.” (live in calm and deal from your presence).
“I accept everyone who comes to me sincerely.”
“I look at every side of your being. I see everything in you, in order to see where I can help, heal and give strength.”
“ You can enjoy material life, but realize it’s a representation of the divine only.” (experience joy as a part of the spiritual path).
&quot; “Every religion has its holy books. It helps to read these books.”
“My work is for the whole world.”
“Those who come to me for Darshan, always get what they need.”
”Praying helps.”
”It’s not necessary to come to me, I can help everywhere.” (It’s important to mentally connect through a mantra, a prayer, a meditation).
”Grace and mercy come into effect immediately if the striving for it is authentic.”''

2. An enlightened master connects enlightenment with all-encompassing love, empathy, and humility. He or she is modest. He or she doesn’t necessarily announce him or herself as an enlightened master. A master sees his or her fellow beings more than the elf. He or she lives for the spiritual way and to help with it, and not for the ego (money, riches, power, recognition).

3. It is an important question along the spiritual way to consider whether there is such a thing as heavenly mercy. Is there God, angels, Buddha, enlightened masters who can help us from the other side?

4. God (an avatar acting as a force of God) posesses the characteristics omni-presence, ominipotence, goodness, and is all-knowing. For this reason, he can see every person and give that person exactly what he or she needs spiritually. The more a spiritual person develops, the more they can participate in these characteristics. 

5. It is good to visit the Satsang of an enlightened person. The important thing isn’t the teaching, but the enlightened energy that you come into contact with. Everyone gets what he or she needs, what is correct for their particular level of development. Those who have an enlightened master they connect with daily is blessed and receives leadership. 

6. I’ve visited a lot of enlightened masters. Often, direct enlightenment energy is transfered directly, which results in a great step forward along my way. At the moment I visit the Satsangs of Mother Meera often. Everytime, I experience something totally different and get a different type of energy. One time, my heart chakra was healed. Another time I felt her happiness energy in me. A third time I just enjoyed the good energy in the room.

7. Can we get help? According to my experience, yes. I feel the energy of the enlightened masters. They transfer energy from their images, statues, books and words. They come from what we perceive as nothingness, which is in fact more than just an empty space. 

8. When do God, the angels and enlightened masters help us? When we connect with them through prayer, by invoking them, by visualizing them or by reading their books. WE should do that every day. They will then lead us to enlightenment, if we’re ready for it. If we take the path of love, wisdom, humility every day, grace manifests in our lives. I feel lead by God and my enlightened masters. Everything develops at the right moment in the right way. I’m amazed by it myself, because I can hardly comprehend it. 

9.Enlightenment is a good goal. There is nothing better. But there is the possibility of reincarnation. We don’t need to reach the goal in one life. You can take the right pace for you and develop through each life further into the light. Basically, there are three advantages in enlightenment. 

a. You live at a higher level of happiness. You feel more love, peace, strength and happiness. Christians can say that you live in paradise. If you have experienced enlightenment, you can say it is better to live enlightened than unenlightened. Enlightenment is the deeper meaning of life. 

b. You are free of suffering. Christians spoke of deliverance. I would say that every fear disappears and you have so much strength in happiness in you that you can easily go through every situation in life. You can integrate suffering into your life. You can overcome everything through your inner peace, strength and all-encompassing love. You also get through death especially well. 

c. After death, you come to the light. Then you live in paradise (in God) and can incarnate as an enlightened master (Siddha, Bodhisattva) on earth. If there is life after death, then the benefits are immeasurable. If there isn’t life after death, then as an enlightened being you have an optimal life on earth. 

10. There are different ways to get to enlightenment. The main way is to live alone or in a little community away from society, to meditate and to work out one’s thoughts. Along this way, Buddha, the Christian desert fathers and yogi masters such as Swami Sivananda and Anandamayi Ma are guiding lights providing good examples. I have been living as a hermit yogi for 25 years because I have the feeling this is the best way for me to make spiritual progress. In Tibetan Buddhism, it is said that you’ve already gotten halfway to enlightenment by living alone as a yogi. Only a few people live that way. There are spiritual communities, Ashrams and convents. THat can also be a good way to grow spiritually, especially with the help of an enlightened master. 

11. Even if I prefer the yogic way, I do believe that with the help of an enlightened master, you can grow spiritually when living with a job and family. An enlightened master can send a lot of energy every  day, and one can lead a spiritual life in a way that constant spiritual cleansing and growth take place. There are ways to combine a worldly life with spiritual growth. For most people, that is the main way to come to the light. The important thing is to emphasize spirituality and to connect with God and his enlightened masters. Living spiritually means to live according to the cornerstones of love, peace, truth, wisdom and self-discipline. It is helpful to have a plan. You can construct this plan according to your personal needs.
 
12. At the beginning of the spiritual way, peace, happiness, love, and trust develop. At some point an awakening can occur, which causes the concept of the self to dissolve and a perception of the unity of all things comes into being. But the way is still long after that. I experienced a great sense of inner peace and positivity after a phase of ego dissipation. However, I first recognized the great goal as my kundalini energy rose from the middle of my body to my head, to my crown chakra. Suddenly I was in a dimension of unimaginable happiness, peace, love and truth. In yoga, that’s called Sathyaloka, the location of great Truth. As a Christian, one would speak of the highest paradise where you sit beside God. It was first in this moment that I knew that the deeper meaning in life is to come to enlightenment. I didn’t have that feeling when I was first awakening. The first time that feeling appeared was when I had my great enlightenment experience. I recognized there what all religions strive for. There are various techniques in the different religions. In yoga there is hatha yoga, kundalini yoga and raja yoga (the highest meditation). 

13. Along the spiritual path, you can get lost in the abyss. It is a trap along the spiritual way. People are given the ability to deal with this, by God. We can be a force for better behavior in the world, we put a stop to egomaniacs. We should give everyone in the world something to eat, stop war, and stop murder. We should work for a world of love, peace and wisdom. This way, a golden era in the world’s history can arise. 

14. Love can cause the enlightened to incarnate onto earth once more to work for the good of all, just as Krishna and Jesus both did. I follow the teachings of the Buddhist Madhyamaka. According to these teachings, there are various levels in the cosmos and all of them are real. A spiritual master can deal on all of hte levels, and be in all of the levels. He can build an identity when it is necessary, but also rest in God without an ego in order to enjoy highest happiness. 

15.The more I go into unity, the less I am interested in doing things out in the world. I rest in my happiness and peace. But that is also a trap. An enlightened person has great capabilities to go out into the world and improve things. They can help their fellow beings to overcome their suffering and to be happy. The enlightened though can go up to their cloud of happiness and disappear into paradise. They leave the world to the powers of foolishness, the ego, destruction and suffering. The enlightenment is incomplete when you no longer can feel the suffering of your fellow beings. A full enlightened master is also completely connected with all of the beings in the cosmos. He or she can feel their suffering. Just as he or she came to happiness, the enlightened master also wants to bring others into happiness. 

16. Jesus taught his followers to love their fellow beings. One only needs to look around in his or her own circle of aquaintances to find the way to love and helping. The important thing is the love to God and to other human beings. He didn’t disconnect himself from others. Another way is is to teach people to connect with enlightened masters. Those who ask God or the enlightened for help, will get an impulse to act. Through the connection of all beings, the enlightened are helped. Mother Meera explained that praying always helps. Those who pray daily or connect with an enlightened master are shown the way to the light.

17.  A long time ago, a young man lived in India who wanted to be a Buddha and live in light. He called himself Amitabha and became a hermit. He went through a lot of spiritual crises. He put in a lot of effort to overcome his inner laziness and to figure out what was the most effective way to practice at any given moment and to do his spiritual exercises with self-discipline. Amitabha knew that only a few people can take the path of the lone yogi. The way to enlightenment is hard work. He therefore chose to create a space in heaven after his enlightenment which contained happy energy where even worldly people could land. Those who spoke the mantra “om Buddha Amitabha” (in Japanese “Om Amida Butsu”, Tibetan “Om Amitabha Hri”) or even thought the mantra would land in paradise after death, as Amitabha promised. Amitabha meditated for thirty years and landed in complete enlightenment. Now he could bring all of his seriously practicing followers into paradise. 

18. Amitabha probably lived around the same time as Jesus Christ. His teachings spread about 100 years after Christ in India, Tibet, China and Japan. He had a lot of enlightened followers who went in his footsteps. We can be sure that by calling to Amitabha from the spirit world will help. It doesn’t matter whether we see ourselves as Amitabha or see Amitabha as a real enlightened master. The Amitabha masters recommend connecting with Amitabha morning and evening through a short meditation or mantra, prayer, invocation or visualization. For me, Amitabha is also part of God. We can speak to God using the name Amitabha and get help. 

19. If we pray to God in the form of the Buddha Amitabha, then that affects our way to God. We reach God through the form of Buddha. We turn ourselves more and more into a Buddha, a Buddha of all-encompassing light and love. It is a Buddha that lives for happiness and the enlightenment of all beings. Visualize a large sun over your crown chakra. A golden Buddha sits in the sun (in the sky above you). The Budha is you. The Buddha sees the suffering on earth and sends all beings light. Move your hand in blessing and think “I send light to (person). May all beings be happy. May there be a happy world.” 

20. An important cornerstone of Amitabha Buddhism is trusting Amitabha (the other power, Tariki). It is often taught that one cannot do anything for his or her own enlightenment. We can only pray and hope that Amitabha (God or an enlightened master) will save us. In this regard,  there is a similarity with the Christian teachings of Martin Luther, that people can only be saved by the grace of God. 
I have argued against this on protestant online forums. This teaching is false and illogical. Jesus gave exact directions as to how one can become blessed, or enlightened. One has to purify the heart, live in all-encompassing love and to love God. Jacob wrote: ”Act on the words, don’t just listen. Didn’t Abraham become righteous by sacrificing his son (his ego) on the alter? One is saved through actions, not through faith alone.”

21. When striving toward enlightenment, we have to each take the respective, personally most effective way. From this perspective, Tariki (not practicing spiritual exercises, instead trusting solely in God) is a method that is sometimes helpful and sometimes not. To make a dogma of it is certainly the wrong way to go. Basically enlightenment happens through spiritual practice over a longer period. At the same time, we usually can’t find our way to enlightenment alone due to the ego fixation. We need leadership by an enlightened master. We need trust in the  higher power, but also must work on ourselves intensively. For me, the optimal spiritual way is spiritual practice, practicing all-encompassing love, daily prayer or connecting with God, Amitabha or a personal enlightened master. I find the Amitabha teachings to be fascinating. They are a common thread between Buddhism and Christianity. They have Christian, Hindu and Buddhist elements. I personally don’t believe Buddha taught them. But someone had taught these at some point, and this person probably came from a Buddhist background. At any case, the teachings of the Buddhist Amitabha pathhave been spread far and wide and well-received from a lot of people. For me, the Buddhist Amitabha way is too restrictive in its typical portrayal. I would take a less non-dogmatic approach so that people from various religious backgrounds and individuals can learn from it and still take their personally correct approach. We can each see ourselves as Amitabha, Shiva, angels, or as a goddess or use these forms to serve as messengers to connect with god. Both are a possible way to practice paradise-yoga.

22. An important point along the spiritual way is whether there is a God or a higher enlightened being that can help us from the other side. From my own experience and the knowledge I have at this point in time, I believe there is life after death. Near death research and reincarnation research as well as reports from the experiences of spiritual people also would lend weight to this conclusion. Many people can travel to the other side. They see the paradise level and meet higher beings. If there are higher beings that want to help us, then we should accept their help. If they want to lead us, bring us to enlightenment and lead us to paradise after death, then that is a huge gift. We should accept it.
 
23. There is life after death. There is a paradise on the other side. Everyone can reach this paradise. You can come to paradise through a mantra when dying. You can reach paradise with thelp of an enlightened master. You can reach paradise through a positive life. All religions are methods to come to paradise. Every person can take the personally correct path to paradise. Prayer, mantra, meditation, invocation, visualization, oracle and reading a spiritual book are all good exercises. Through paradise yoga, you can reach paradise on earth while still alive on earth. 

24. Everyone wants to be happy and not suffer. We should put our lives together in a way that makes us happy. We should consider what we need, and then give that to ourselves. We should work for a happy existence for everyone on earth. Mostly, the happiness of a person comes from within. For that reason, we should develop our inner happiness. We should think positively, speak positively, and act positively. We should find positive role models to follow. 

25. If there is life after death, we should live so that we come to a good place after we have passed. We can choose the masters who inspire us. We can choose to follow Jesus, Amitabha, Satyha Sai Baba, Mother Meera or other masters. WE can work with God, the angels or the Gods of yoga. The more we practice, the stronger the connection between our enlightened helpers. 

26. By visualizing paradise, enlightenment energy can become awakened in us. Everyone can imagine paradise so that they feel good in it. Paradise is a realm of enlightenment and light. The more we practice spiritually, the easier it is to reach paradise after death. It is good to lead a life of love, peace, self-discipline and inner happiness. 

27. Paradise is on the other side, but we can also reach it while still on earth. There is enough prosperity for everyone, we just need to share the riches of the earth fairly. No one needs to go hungry. But mostly, paradise is in everyone on the inside. We just need to change our consciousness so that we can recognize paradise in our world. We need to orient ourselves and our day around the positive in our lives. We should be grateful for what life has given us. 

28.. My masters gave me the mantra “yes” in a dream. They showed me how one can get through death and reach paradise. Those who think of paradise will reach it. Christians go to the Christian heaven, Muslims to their version, Hindus to theirs. Enlightened beings can go where they want, because they transcend all forms.

29. There will always be some suffering on earth. However, most suffering has been created by humans themselves. We could organize life so that all people have enough to eat, so that there isn’t any more war and that the environment is clean. We could reduce suffering when dying by making pain medicine available to everyone, and by helping others to develop their enlightenment consciousness before dying.

30. A soul retains its individual consciousness unless it decides to dissolve itself within God. Buddha probably did just that. However, there are also souls which will continue to exist until all beings are enlightened. In Buddhism, there is the Bodhisattva path toward this end. In Hinduism, Vishnu is the great role model along the way of love. He incarnates again and again in order to help people when it is necessary to give them assistance on their spiritual way.

[[File:Chidambaram Shiva.jpg|thumb|400px|Shiva, the enlightened dancer with life (Nataraya)]]

1.  In Hinduism, we find the term [[w:Avatar|“Avatar”]]. An Avatar is an incarnation of God. Here there are dimensions of enlightenment to be found which exceed my experiences and my knowledge. I can only speculate. When I connect with an Avatar like Mother Meera or Sathya Sai Baba or Krishna or Jesus, can this Avatar lead me perfectly along my spiritual path into the light? I feel my life is guided. Everything happens at the right moment, but I also will admit that I don’t fully comprehend that. Many people strive toward enlightenment through intensive spiritual practice. But many others try to reach their goal through prayer to an avatar and through the guidance of that avatar, find their way. 

2. Enlightenment is self-realization. Enlightenment is clarity, peace, calm, happiness, love, joy, knowledge of the connectedness of all things. In enlightenment there is no boredom. You live in happiness, and that is enough. The more enlightened you are, the more you lose interest in worldly things. However, it makes you happy to do good things for others. It is fulfilling to strive further on your way as enlightenment is without limits and cannot be measured. You can reach higher and higher dimensions of light. You can develop more and more abilities you can use to help others. 

3. Enlightenment is also just a word. Enlightenment exceeds all terms. Terms can be helpful. The term enlightenment is helpful when it helps people to reach their spiritual goals. The goal can also be described with the words God, paradise, light, nirvana, happiness, love and self-realization. The goal and the way are important. Both form the context. Some people find it helpful to concentrate on the goal, for others concentrating on the way to the goal is more helpful, and for most it helps to oncentrate on both. It’s good to take it one step at a time, but without being focused on a goal, you can wind up wandering aimlessly through life and get caught up in the various traps that life lays out. Those who have a clear goal can find their way easily. . 

4. If we visualize God on the outside, we can awaken God on the inside. We reach a cosmic consciousness by visualizing God as the great Father or Mother of all beings, and this way reach all-encompassing love. Furthermore, I believe that there are higher developed beings which can be considered God. In Yoga, they are known as avatars. 

5. In my view, the path of enlightenment solves the problems of the world at a deeper level when it is combined with the path of all-encompassing love. How do you want to convince a capitalist or a dictator to not exploit other people or try to have power over them? That would only work if you can convince such people about the path of inner happiness and love, as it has happened before in Buddhism. The Mongolians became peaceful through Buddhism. The grusome Indian ruler Ashoka brought happiness to the land once he became a Buddhist. And that is also how it should happen worldwide. All of the religions should become peaceful so that we finally make the whole world happy. The overdriven egos of the leading elites should lose their egos to love, peace and the well-being of all. 

6. Every religion provides a way to enlightenment. The various methods can be combined when done so wisely. Followers of the various religions don’t need to fight one another. They can go to the light together and help one another. I see myself as a mystic who is above all religions and spiritual paths.

7. An enlightened being can incarnate on earth if he or she would like to help mankind. If there were no enlightened beings on earth, mankind would probably just have made itself extinct. Right now we are in the middle of a transitionary period, to another, higher level of consciousness.
 
8. Whether various spiritual masters who have risen are at the same level as Jesus, Buddha or Krishna, I don’t know. I don’t know them. I would, however, sense and feel whether they are authentic or not.There are those who pretend to be enlightened in order to use others. I would compare their teachings with those of Buddha, Jesus and Krishna. 

9. Enlightenment is difficult to explain because it cannot be explained, it must be experienced. Enlightenment is life in the klingdom of God. It is the way to sainthood, or inner healing and perfection, The way of enlightenment is developed with qualities like joy, happiness, strength and all-encompassing love. 

10. I experience enlightenment as the acceptance of spiritual energy. Spiritual energy is consciousness energy. If you only have a little consciousness energy, you concentrate mainly on yourself. That’s OK that way, because the energy needs to be protected and expanded. When the energy expands, then it extends out of the body. In this case, the person is not only aware of one’s own body, but also the surrounding people and environment, and less of oneself because most of the energy is outside of the self. 

11. Spiritual energy has the characteristics happiness, love, peace, power and clarity. If the peace and clarity expand, then the mind comes to rest and be calm. The ego disappears because all the theories and concepts floating in the mind come to rest. The ego is helpful for life in the world, in a material sense. According to my experience, the ego disappears when happiness and peace have reached a certain level. The closer you get to this leve, the smaller the ego and the greater the harmony and the consciousness of the unity of all things. I feel more and more like a part of the cosmos. I am in harmony with the world. I live from my higher self. 

12. I have also experienced that the ego can be dissolved on purpose. The ego consists of attachment to enjoyment, the rejection of suffering, and foolishness. If you work hard enough for it, the ego can be destroyed. We can think:” I accept things as they are. I let go of my desires. I live in light, peace, and unity.” If we have strong tendencies to desire things, then the ego will be renewed again and again. Therefore, it is a good idea to shrink the wishes and desires down over the long term and to cultivate characteristics like acceptance, humility, inner peace and all-encompassing love. 

13. My experience has shown me that enlightenment is the deeper point of life and that there are specific ways to get there. There is the Buddhist way, which is a good way. There is also yoga, and there is Christianity. These paths are also good. There is also the esoteric New Age way, where you look for the most appropriate way for you personally. That’s good too. God is above all religions. Every good spiritual technique belongs to the whole world and can be practiced by anyone. 

14. Enlightenment is the way to rise above suffering. You become freed from suffering, fear, addiction,aggression, bodily pain, spiritual pain and unhappiness. You become anchored in God. You are happy on the inside, even when apparent suffering and unhappiness are prevalent on the outside. 

15. I practice trimurti yoga of Hatha yoga, Karma yoga and Bhakti yoga (master yoga, God yoga). I connect with my enlightened masters and spiritual role models. I work for a happy world and for the happiness of all beings. I meditate, go for walks and practice various yogic exercises. The spiritual path that is best for you, can be found using your own inner guidance and a sense of what does you good personally. 

16. Everything in the cosmos follows the cause and effect priinciple. From that point of view, there isn’t any free will. Everything is pre-determined. It’s difficult to know what has been pre-determined, so we have to do as if we have free will. In enlightenment I can feel that everything is determined. We are instruments of the cosmos like cogs in a watch. You can go about life in a relaxed way if you recognize that everything has already been determined. Then you live completely in harmony with yourself and the world. One of my enlightenment experiences I reached by imagining everything as already being determined. 

17. An enlightened master can recognize that everything has been pre-determined once he or she has reached the level of all-knowigness. Then said master knows the past, present and future of his or her students. And here there seems to be a mystery that Sai Baba reports from. If a person can see through pre-determination, he or she can rise above it and deal freely. He or she can put new impulses into motion. That became clear in a dream of my Tibetan master Lonchenpa. He showed me that he had re-written my book of life. He knew my future and could change it for the better thanks to his spiritual abilities. 

18. I am a humble person. God works to make sure that I stay humble. He brings enough suffering and difficulty into my life so that I don’t seem too amazing to myself. At the beginning of my search 30 years ago, I was enthused by my spiritual experiences. But during the course of the years, that has become mainly meaningless. They are just experiences. What matters is lasting enlightenment, and I am far from that. Furthermore, I have established that you can have the greatest spiritual experiences and most people don’t care and some will even deny they happened. It is more of a burden to speak of them. I only do it to help others along their way. 

19. [[w:Jesus|Jesus]] had an enlightened master who transfered enlightenment energy to him. That was John the Baptist. Jesus demonstrated that Christians should have an enlightened master. The transfer of enlightenment energy is the fastest way into the light. Jesus meditated after the energy transfer for 40 days in the desert and his enlightenment was complete. The devil (the ego) disappeared and the angels (spiritual energy) served him. He could heal others and help them spiritually. The word of God spoke from him. 

20. The first Christians had Jesus as a physically present enlightened master. The Apostles were also enlightened and could pass on the enlightenment energy (holy ghost). Then came the Christian desert fathers who had their enlightened fathers and mothers. There were many enlightened masters among the Christians. I am thinking mostly of Master Eckhart, Teresa from Avila, John of the Cross and the holy Frances. 

21. I interpret the Bible in terms of enlightenment. The term Son of God means that a person is enlightened, he lives in God (in the kingdom of God) and is God’s son for that reason. The teachings of the trinity describes the relationship between an enlightened person and God. God is the higher consciousness dimension in the cosmos, the unity dimension, the light. The holy Ghost is the spiritual energy that fills a person with the light of God. An enlightened person as the son of God canheal with the light of God and perform miracles. 

22. Those who would like to have experiences of God and enlightenment quickly should lead an intensively spiritual life. He or she needs to work on him or herself. This person should cultivate characteristics like love, peace, truth and self-discipline, and meditate and pray and live in love. He or she should ollow Jesus radically and not lead a life of material enjoyment. 

23. The desert mother Amma Synkleitika knew that hermits who would like to lead lives in God have to deal with a lot of hard inner work and inner fights, but in the end there is indescribable joy. In order to get through these inner fights, the desert fathers mainly concentrated on death. Those who think of their death can overcome every weakness. The thoughts of death and paradise give a spiritual person the power to follow his path to its goal.on the other hand, one should not overwhelm oneself as a monk or hermit. Many hermits needed a flower, others didn’t. Those who need joy along their way, should give themselves the joy they need. 

24. I celebrate Christmas with my old mother who is 90 years old, my sister and one of her sons. The other son is in Australia. On the first and second Christmas days I visit two neighbors. In that regard, I’m not alone. I’ve lived as a hermit for 25 years. It was difficult to be alone on Christmas the first years, because I had lived in a family before that. But, after some years passed I got used to it. Now it isn’t a big deal. I have developed my own Christmas ritual. I light candles and incense. I watch the Protestant and Catholic Christmas services on TV. I also visit people when possible. 

25.In my family, Christmas was always celebrated. We were atheists, but Christmas was an important ritual to meet people, celebrate and give gifts. I feel connected to Christianity. For that reason, I like to celebrate Christmas and think of the birth of Jesus. It is a happy event that a spiritual person was born into the world. 

26.. Jesus taught us to live in  a way that would bring us to paradise after death. How do you imagine paradise? What would be a worthwhile place? What needs to be there for you to be happy? Do you want to meet your friends, partner, children, relatives? Do you wnt to stay there or would you like to do spiritual exercises like rituals, prayer, singing, meditating to come closer to God? What would you do to get there? There are different types of paradise. There is paradise with forms of all types. In one paradise there is everything one could want. In another there are just energies like love, peace, truth, strength and happiness. 

27. The paradise of yogis is called Siddhaloka. It can also be called Shiva Loka. It is the home of the God Shiva. If you meditate on a heavenly mountain landscape full of flowers, light and bubbling springs then you can connect to this paradise energy. In [[w:Muktananda|Swami Muktananda]], Siddhaloka is the most beautiful paradise with the highest happiness energy and the greates potential for spiritual growth. 

28. The little blue star was his soul vehicle. Muktananda described exactly how one gets to Siddhaloka. You meditate, concentrate on the skull chakra and a blue star appears over the crown chakra. Muktananda flowed into this star with his soul, and the star brought him to paradise. 

29. Muktananda experienced Siddhaloka as a paradise full of rest, calm and peace. Everywhere there was blue, cheerful light. Muktananda met a lot of yogis and yoginis (female yogis). There were high mountains, green forests, bubbling springs and flowing streams. Deer played on meadows full of flowers. In the middle there was a sea with seven parts. Each of the seven parts represent the seven characteristics that can bring you to enlightenment: wisdm, peace, love, strength, joy, happiness and cosmic consciousness.

30. [[w:Paradise|Paradise]] is a state of enlightenment, inner happiness and awakened kundalini energy. Then you have a consciousness of paradise due to your great happiness.  Through visualization of a happy world, you can awaken happiness. How you can get there depends on you. For some people, it is enough to imagine a beautiful landscape where they sit with people they love. The inner energy begins to flow when they imagine springs, rivers or a sea in paradise. The visualization of a tree lets the energy flow through the middle energy channel. Once it reaches the head, then one becomes happy. The same effect can arise when imagining oneself as a Buddha, Shiva or a goddess in a palace or beautiful house. Around the house you plant beautiful flowers. 

31.Every concept of enlightenment has to be destoryed again and again when they cease to be helpful. The enlightenment is above all concepts and images of it. We find our way to the light when we are consistent with the basics of truth, wisdom and love. We should always be in good contact with our inner voice of truth and wisdom, our conscience. We should connect with an enlightened master or God or a spiritual role model every day. May we successfully follow through our way to spiritual self-realization. May we live in happiness, peace, love and light.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;!--TODO: copyedit--&gt;

In a previous chapter, we've looked at how reclamation changes the landscape of Hong Kong. Now we'll take one step backwards, and look at the extraction of reclamation materials in Hong Kong. There are three types of reclamation materials: '''Rock fill''', '''marine sand fill''' ('''soft fill''') and '''public fill'''.

== Rock Fill ==
Rock fill comes from weathered rock in granitic landscapes. The rocks are excavated from quarries in sloping ground, then mixed with cement to form rock fill.

=== Pros and Cons ===
Pros:
* Rock fill comes in very large quantity.

Cons:
* Its extraction is very costly.
* The landscape is permanently scarred as all vegetation and the top layer of rocks and regolith in the area is removed to create a barren surface. If the land is further eroded by rain, rills, gullies and a badland landscape will be formed. This reduces the quality of life of nearby areas. This is known as '''visual pollution'''.
* Rock fill potentially causes landslides. As slopes are cut for quarrying, the barren land will be exposed to the rain, and the infiltration rate will be quicker. The pore water pressure will increase, so the internal cohesion of slope particles will decrease, and the friction will also decrease. This increases the landslide risk.
* Other types of pollution are produced in the process of extracting rock fill. The machinery produces noise pollution, which disturbs nearby residences. The process of extraction will release dust into the nearby air, causing air pollution. Water pollution is also serious: As the soil has lost its protective vegetation layer, surface run-off will be sped up and rainsplash will occur. The run-off may carry the washed-off topsoil to nearby bodies of water such as rivers and lakes, reducing their capacity. This is silting/sedimentation (which has been discussed in M2). When heavy, persistent rain occurs, the ability of these bodies to hold water will decrease and the chance of overflowing will increase, inducing floods.
* The local ecosystem is destroyed. As the vegetation is removed, the animals also lose their shelter and food source, and will be forced to migrate elsewhere. It is difficult if not impossible for plant succession to occur in the area because the topsoil is also removed, revealing the harder rock layer below. It is difficult for tree roots to extend into such layers and thrive in such an environment.

=== Use ===
Rock fill is usually used in large public works projects as a huge amount of fill is needed for construction. It used to be the predominant source of fill for Hong Kong, but extraction activities have been discontinued because of exorbitant costs of extraction.

== Marine Sand Fill ==
[[File:Pearl_River.jpg|A trailing suction hopper dredger|thumb|right|200px]]
Marine sand fill refers to sand extracted from the seabed using '''trailing suction hopper dredgers''', which, as their name suggests, dredge the seabed. In Hong Kong, deposits of alluvium on seabeds are a common source.

=== Pros and Cons ===
Pros:
* Large quantity
* As the seabed is dredged, the deeper harbour can facilitate navigation.
* As the seabed is dredged, the effect of silting on the depth of the sea floor will be mitigated. Macau is an example.
* If the reclamation site is close to the '''marine borrow area''', the transport costs incurred are much lower than public fill.

Cons:
* '''Ecosystem destruction''': Marine ecosystems are destroyed when the seabed is dredged. The habitats of animals who lived on the seabed will face total destruction, and their lives will also be disturbed by the dredgers. In particular, dredging destroys coral reefs, which are important habitats for many marine animals, particularly fish.
* '''Visibility''': Dredging increases the '''suspeneded sediment''' content. The '''turbidity''' of the sand will increase, lowering '''visibility'''. The ability of sea creatures to find food is reduced, and eventually, marine life will die of starvation.
* '''Toxicity''': Sometimes, there is a layer of mud (or sludge) which covers the sand. It must be removed and deposited elsewhere. This will further increase the turbidity of the area where the sludge is deposited, disturbing more aquatic life.
** The layer of sludge may also be heavily polluted by industrial and domestic sewage if the marine borrow area is close in proximity to nearby urban or industrial areas. It may be teeming with organic chemicals and heavy metals. When the sludge is removed, the '''toxicity''' of the seawater will increase, potentially poisoning aquatic life. Penny's Bay is an example.
** If heavy metals may accumulate in marine life near the dumping and dredging sites, they will further accumulate along the food chain and finally reach humans, threatening public health. In recent years, toxic seafood has become a major concern.

=== Use ===
The use of marine sand fill is most common in Hong Kong. Apart from local marine borrow areas, sand fill is also exported from the Zhu Jiang Delta.

{{Robox|theme=2|title=Marine borrow areas in Hong Kong}}
* Tathong Channel
* East if Tung Lung Chau
* West and east of Po Toi
* Kap Shui Mun
* North of Lantau
{{Robox/Close}}

=== Impact-Reduction Measures ===
As marine sand fill is the commonest fill in Hong Kong, much has been done by the Civil Engineering and Development Department to reduce its impact.

* Monitoring: The CEDD has set up the Marine Fill Committee, which oversees the extraction of marine fill reserves to ensure sustainability.
* Extracting the right way: The Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Ordinance requires that extractors apply for environmental permits before designating marine borrow areas. They must ensure that the impact of dredging will be minimised and the environmental costs will be compensated.
* Extracting in the right place: Not all viable deposits of sand fill are exploited, for two main reasons
** Some areas are ecologically valuable with precious marine resources and they are left untouched for ecological conservation. Inner and Outer Deep Bay and Sai Kung are two examples.
** Marine fill resources offshore of Tuen Mun and Tsing Yi are covered with thick layers of contaminated sludge, so dredging is prohibited.
* Not extracting at all: Where possible, marine fill is not used at all. It is used as public fill.

== Public Fill ==
Public fill is derived from '''inert''' construction and demolition materials. 'Inert' means that hey will not decompose. They include asphalt, building debris (such as bricks), broken rock and concrete.

=== Pros and Cons ===
Pros:
* It conserves natural resources.
* The cost is lower.
* Waste is reduced, which in turn eases the landfill saturation problem.

Cons:
* '''On-site sorting''' is required, which is a cumbersome and costly process.
* It is unreliable and limited in availability

=== Use ===
Because of its limited availablity (only used in construction and demolition sites), it is used whenever possible, but it is far from the predominant fill type.

|&lt;h1&gt;Part 2: Subject Pronouns and Infinitive Verbs&lt;/h1&gt;
In Part 2, we will gain familiarity with subject pronouns.&lt;br&gt;
In this section, we will gain a solid familiarity of pronouns and infinitive verbs separately &lt;br&gt;
before we combine these ideas to begin work on creating short sentences.&lt;br&gt;

===&lt;h2&gt;&lt;u&gt;Subject Pronouns&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;===
Classes of gender and number also exist within subject pronouns. &lt;br&gt;
These two sections, gender and number, determine how nouns are treated within a sentence.&lt;br&gt;
In Spanish, it is common for subject pronouns to be omitted, as they are incorporated as part of a verb conjugation.&lt;br&gt;
We will begin verb conjugations next.&lt;br&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Dbox|Folding|The process of bending rock layers by compressional forces.}}

When two sides of a plates are pushed towards each other, compressional force occurs and the rocks will be bent. '''Folds''' and '''fold mountains''' are the two main landforms. (Note: In general, folding only occurs on sedimentary rocks.)

== Folds ==
Small-scale folding produces '''folds'''. Examples include Ma Shi Chau and Lai Chi Chong.

=== Structure ===
Parts of a fold include:
* '''Synclines''': Also known as downfold, synclines are the portions of the rock layers folded downwards.
* '''Anticlines''': Also knwon as upfold, anticlines are the portions of rocks laters foldied upwards.
* '''Trough''': The lowest points of synclines form a trough.
* '''Crest''': The lowers poitns of anticlines form a crest.
* '''Limbs''': The two sides of a fold are called limbs.
* '''Axial plane''': The plane by which the fold tilts is the axial plane.

=== Classification ===
Folds are classified according to the balance of forces on both sides. They are identified by looking at the gradient of each limb.

* '''Symmetrical fold''': The fold has the same gradient on both sides. The axial plane is vertical.
* '''Asymmetric fold''': The fold has different gradients on both sides. The axial plane is tilted.
* '''Overfold''': The two limbs tilt in the same direction. The axial plane is even more tilted.
* '''Recumbent fold''': The two limbs are nearly parallel. The axial plane is nearly horizontal.
* '''Overthrust fold''': The rock on one limb fractures. One side overrides the other. The axial plane is nearly horizontal.

== Fold Mountains ==
Fold mountains are divided into young and old. Old ones were formed during the ''Alpine Period'' (35-40 million years ago); young ones were formed during the ''Caledonian Period'' and ''Hercynian Period'' (&gt;270 million years ago). We will mainly look at young ones in the curriculum, but we need to know how the two are different.

&lt;u&gt;Young fold mountains have gone through less denudation than old fold mountains&lt;/u&gt;. They are located in areas that are still tectonically active, i.e. close to plate boundaries. (The precise definition of denudation will be discussed later, but for now, denudation is a collection of processes that moves materials from higher ground to lower ground.) Therefore, they have higher elevation, rugged relief, and very steep gradient. Older fold mountains, by comparison, tend to have lower altitude, more subdued relief and gentler gradient.

{{Robox|title=Young fold mountain ranges and their highest heights|theme=2}}
* Himalayas - 8848 m (Qomolangma Feng)
* Andes - 6962 m (Mount Aconcagua)
* Alps - 4810 m (Mont Blanc)
* Rockies - 4401 m (Mount Elbert)

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Dbox|Faulting|a displacement of rocks along a line of weakness in the rock strata}}

[Note: For those who don't know, 'displacement' is a fancy geography term saying the blocks have 'moved'.]

The line along which the two rocks slide is the ''''fault''' or '''fault line'''. We will look at faults, then at the landforms associated with faulting.

== Faults ==

=== Structure ===
TODO: Diagram
* '''Fault/Faultline''': The line along which the two rock blocks slide
* '''Fault plane''': The plane between the two blocks
* '''Downthrow''': The sinking block
* '''Upthrow''':The rising block
* '''Footwall''': The face of the sinking block touching the rising block
* '''Hanging wall''': The exposed lateral face of the rising block
* '''Fault scarp''': A 'step' on the ground caused by a fault

=== Classification ===
* '''Normal fault''': Formed by tensional force. One block slides down.
* '''Reverse fault''': Formed by compressional force. One block slides up.
* '''Tear/transform fault''': Formed by lateral/shear force. The rocks slide past each other. (There is no vertical displacement.)

== Associated Landforms ==
=== Rift Valleys (Grabens) ===
{{Dbox|Rift valley|A flat-bottom valley with steep fault-scarps and block mountains on both sides}}

Rift valleys are long, elongated and have uniform width. They are formed betweem two faults. They may be formed by normal or reverse faulting:
* When the two faults tilt towards each other, under compressional force, the two outer blocks will be displaced upwards as upthrow. The central block will be left as downthrow and form the rift valley.
* When the two faults tilt away from each other, under tensional force, the central block will sink as downthrow, forming the rift valley. The side blocks will be upthrow. If this process repeats, it may form '''parallel faults''', and a set of parallel faults forms a '''step fault'''.


=== Block Mountins (Horsts) ===
Like folding, faulting can also form mountains. 

{{Dbox|Block mountain|A flat-top mountain with steep fault-scarps and rift valleys on both sides}}

Block mountains are long, elongated and have uniform width. They are formed betweem two faults. They may be formed by normal or reverse faulting:
* When the two faults tilt away from each other, under compressional force, the central block will be pushed upwards as upthrow. The side blocks will be left as downthrow.
* When the two faults tilt towards each other, under tensional force, the two side blocks will sink as downthrow, leaving the outer blocks as upthrow, i.e. the block mountains.

{{Robox|theme=2|title=River Rhine}}
The Franco-German portion of the River Rhine is formed in the middle of a series of parallel faults which form a step fault. On the one side is the Vosges of France; on the other, the Black Forest of Germany. Both are notable block mountiains.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Intrusive vulcanicity occurs when the magma enters and solidifies in lines of weakness or '''chambers''' in the earth's crust.

== Process ==
# The magma is under great pressure.
# Plate movements and tectonic processes produce lines of weakness in the crust.
# The lines of weakness extend downwards and to the magma chamber below.
# The magma pressure is released.
# Magma and gases in the mantle rise along the cracks.
# They intrude into and solidify in chambers the earth's crust ('''intrusive vulcanicity''').

== Associated Landforms ==
Refer to the diagram and table below. The features on the left part of the diagram are landforms formed by intrusive vulcanicity.

! Name !! Description !! Formation
|-
| Batholith || It is a &lt;u&gt;large&lt;/u&gt;, &lt;u&gt;irregularly-shaped&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;reservoir&lt;/u&gt; of magma.|| Magma intrudes into a large chamber beneath the surface of the earth. It cools and solidifies at a very slow rate there. 
|-
| Sill || It is a &lt;u&gt;horizontal&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;sheet-like&lt;/u&gt; feature &lt;u&gt;between bedding planes&lt;/u&gt;.|| Magma intrudes between bedding planes. It cools and solidifies at a very slow rate there. 
|-
| Laccolith || It is a  &lt;u&gt;dome-like&lt;/u&gt; feature &lt;u&gt;between bedding planes&lt;/u&gt;.|| Magma intrudes between bedding planes, but its progression is blocked by a structure. The magma pushes up the rock layer above it. It cools and solidifies at a very slow rate there. 
|-
| Dyke || It is a &lt;u&gt;vertical or diagonal&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;wall-like&lt;/u&gt; feature &lt;u&gt;cutting across bedding planes&lt;/u&gt;.|| Magma intrudes into a line of weakness cutting across bedding planes vertically or at an angle. It cools and solidifies at a very slow rate there. 
|}

Note: The precise definition of bedding planes will be discussed in the Dynamic Earth elective. For now, bedding planes are rock layers.

== Intrusive rocks ==
'''Intrusive rocks''' are formed by intrusive vulcanicity. When magma cools and solifies in the earth's crust, rocks with large crystals are formed. If it was formed very deep in the earth's crust, it is a '''plutonic rock'''. They can be exposed onto the earth's surface after denudation. Intrusive rocks are a subset of '''igneous rocks''', which include rocks formed from intrusive and extrusive vulcanicity. These will be covered in great detail in the Dynamic Earth elective.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Process ==
# The magma is under great pressure.
# Plate movements and tectonic processes produce lines of weakness in the crust.
# The lines of weakness extend downwards and to the magma chamber below.
# The magma pressure is released.
# Magma and gases in the mantle rise along the cracks.
# They extrude onto the earth's surface ('''extrusive vulcanicity''').

There are two main types of openings through which the magma may extrude: '''Vents''' and '''fissures'''.

== Fissure Eruptions and Lava Plateaux ==
''Fissures'' are very fine lines of weakness in the crust. Very basic magma (we'll look at that term later) can rise along fissures to the earth's surface. Fissure are very gentle.

Lava flows as sheets after fissure eruptions. They from a '''lava flow'''. Continuous flow accumulates sheets of lava on the earth's surface to form a '''lava plateau''', which can be hundreds of metres thick. The Deccan Pleateau in India is an example.

== Vent Eruptions and Volcanoes ==
When magma is ejected from a vent through violent eruption, extrusive vulcanicity occurs.

=== Formation ===
# The magma is under great pressure.
# Plate movements and tectonic processes produce lines of weakness in the crust.
# The lines of weakness extend downwards and to the magma chamber below.
# The magma pressure is released.
# Magma and gases in the mantle rise along the cracks.
# They extrude onto the earth's surface ('''extrusive vulcanicity''') through a vent.
# The lava and ash cool down and solidify.
# After a series of successive eruptions, materials accumulate to form a volcano.

=== Ejected Materials ===
These materials are ejected from volcanoes:
* '''Lava''': Magma that reaches the earth's surface is called lava. It may be acidic or basic. Acidic lava is viscous, is lighter in colour and has higher silica content. Basic lava is non-viscous, is darker in colour and has lower silica content.
* '''Gases''': Gaseous compounds of sulphur and hydrogen, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and steam are released.
* '''Pyroclasts''': Solid materials like lava particles (called volcanic bombs), rock fragments and stones, volcanic ash and cinder are ejected from the bent.

=== Classification ===
Volcanoes are classified according to the ejected materials.
* '''Shield volcanoes''' or '''basic lava cones''' eject basic lava. As basic lava is non-viscous, it can reach very far from the vent before it finally cools down and solidifies. Therefore, basic lava cones have short height, concave slopes and large base area.
* '''Acidic lava cones''' eject acidic lava. As acidic lava is viscous, it cannot reach very far from the vent before it cools down and solidifies. Therefore, acidic lava cones have greater height, convex slopes and narrower base area.
* '''Ash and cinder cones''' eject lava and rock fragments which are broken into ash and cinder. They are high, conical and steep-sided.
* '''Composite volcanoes''' or '''stratovolcanoes''' eject both lava and ash, and alternate between quiet lava outflows and violent eruptions. A stratified structure is formed in the volcano, with alternating layers of ash and lava. These volcanoes have higher height, broad bases and steep, convex sides.

Here's a handy table:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
| 
!Shield volcanoes/Basic lava cones
!Acidic lava cones
!Ash and cinder cones
!Composite volcanoes
|-
| Materials ejected||Lava||Lava||Ash and cinder||Ash and lava alternatively
|-
| Viscosity of lava||Viscous||Non-viscous||N/A||
|-
| Acidity of lava||Acidic||Basic||Acidic/Basic||Acidic/Basic
|-
| Height||Low||High||High||High
|-
| Base area||Broad||Narrow||Narrow||Broad
|-
| Slope shape||Concave||Convex||Conical||Convex
|-
| Slope gradient||Gentle||Steep||Steep||Steep
|}

=== Life Cycle ===
* '''Active volcanoes''' erupt frequently.
* '''Dormant volcanoes''' have not erupted for a long time.
* '''Extinct volcanoes''' have not erupted for a very long time. The possibility of future eruptions is almost nil.

=== Volcanic Features ===
These are not important definitions, but you should understand what the terms mean.
* The '''vent''' is the central passageway by which magma passes
* The '''crater''' is the central depression above the vent from which the lava is thrown out.
* The slopes are usually symmetrical.
* A volcanic eruption may create cracks in the volcano. Lava may rise through these cracks to cause a small eruption. This forms a small volcanic cone called a '''parasitic cone''' on the side of the principal one.
* When the crater of a volcano is filled with water, a '''crater lake''' is formed.
* When small-scale eruptions occur at the vent, they form '''secondary cones''' or '''conelets''' in the middle of the crater.
* If a secondary cone/conelet appears in the middle of a crater lake, it is a '''volcanic island'''.
* A '''plug dome''' is a volcano ejecting very viscous lava that hardly flows. It expands from the insides and the outer layer is worn down very quickly by erosion. They are often secondary or parasitic cones.
* '''Calderas''' are large, circular, basin-shaped hollows on the top of a volcano, and are formed under several situations
** A very violent eruption blows off the upper part of the volcano.
** As the magma chamber emptied during the eruption, the top part of the cone lacked support, subsided and collapsed. This formed a caldera.
** Dormant and extinct volcanoes may very worn away by denudation, forming a caldera.

== Other Associated Landforms ==
* '''Hot springs''' are formed when superheated water flows onto the earth's surface by vulcanicity.
* '''Geysers''' are intermittent hot springs in which superheated water and steam are ejected to the earth's surface at regular intervals.
* '''Fumaroles''' are vents that eject steam and gases from the earth's crust.
** '''Solfataras''' are fumaroles that eject sulphur-rich gases.

      <comment>/* Notation */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Mostly taken from Prof. Arieh Iserles' course 'How to write mathematics':

=== Language ===
* Include many explanations and examples while being ''as brief as possible''.
* Include occasional jokes (if you are funny, please include some, because the main author is not funny).
* This wikibook is to be written in BRITISH english.

=== Proofs ===
* Only leave trivial things to the reader.
* Put complicated and very technical results into the appendix.

=== Theorems ===
* Always mention the weaknesses of theorems.

=== Structure ===
* Let the structure follow the intuitive comprehension process of the reader.
* Make the structure conform to every possible leaning structure (e.g. learning the theorems and definitions first, learning linear etc.).
* Use roughly equal sizes for same-level sections.
* Keep lowest level sections short.
* Include Illustrations by examples, tables and figures.
* Introduce new concepts ''just before they are needed''.
* Put important theorems in a textbox.

=== Figures ===
* Only include figures if they make a point; they shouldn't be included if they are only ornamental.
* Make the figures easy to understand.
* Link the figures to the text.

=== Notation ===
* Avoid too many subscripts, tildes, multiple indices, hats etc.
* Recall definitions if they have not been used a long time and are now to be used again.
* Don't overload notation; variables should have only one meaning.
* Don't use two different notations for the same thing.
* Use the following notation conventions throughout the book (note that we distinguish between boldface, upper case, lower case, ...):
** letter for generic element of a set: &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;
** letters for vector constants: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf u&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf v&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf w&lt;/math&gt;

      <comment>/* First example of a partial differential equation */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Navigation|next=Transport equation}}

Partial differential equations are equations of the form
:&lt;math&gt;\forall (x_1, \ldots, x_d) \in B \subseteq \mathbb R^d : h(x_1, \ldots, x_d, u(x_1, \ldots, x_d), \overbrace{\partial_{x_1} u(x_1, \ldots, x_d), \ldots, \partial_{x_d} u(x_1, \ldots, x_d), \partial_{x_1}^2 u(x_1, \ldots, x_d), \ldots}^{\text{arbitrary and arbitrarily many partial derivatives}}) = 0&lt;/math&gt;
for which a solution &lt;math&gt;u: B \to \mathbb R&lt;/math&gt; must be found. The solutions of some partial differential equations describe processes in nature; this is one reason why they are so important.

== Multiindices ==
In the whole theory of partial differential equations, ''multiindices'' are extremely important. Only with their help we are able to write down certain formulas a lot briefer.

{{TextBox| M=0 | W=100% | BG=#FFFFFF |1='''Definitions 1.1''':

A &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional '''multiindex''' is a vector &lt;math&gt;\alpha \in \mathbb N_0^d&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\mathbb N_0&lt;/math&gt; are the natural numbers and zero.

If &lt;math&gt;\alpha = (\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_d)&lt;/math&gt; is a multiindex, then its '''absolute value''' &lt;math&gt;|\alpha|&lt;/math&gt; is defined by
:&lt;math&gt;|\alpha| := \sum_{i=0}^d \alpha_i&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is a &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional multiindex, and &lt;math&gt;u: B \subseteq \mathbb R^d \to \mathbb R&lt;/math&gt; is sufficiently often differentiable, we define &lt;math&gt;\partial_\alpha u&lt;/math&gt;, the '''&lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;-th derivative''' of &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt;, as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;\partial_\alpha u := \partial_{x_1}^{\alpha_1} \cdots \partial_{x_d}^{\alpha_d} u&lt;/math&gt;}}

== Types of partial differential equations ==
We classify partial differential equations into several types, because for partial differential equations of one type we will need different solution techniques as for differential equations of other types. We classify them into linear and nonlinear equations, and into equations of different orders.

{{TextBox| M=0 | W=100% | BG=#FFFFFF |1='''Definitions 1.2''':

A '''linear''' partial differential equation is an equation of the form
:&lt;math&gt;\forall x \in B : \sum_{\alpha \in \mathbb N_0^d} a_\alpha(x) \partial_\alpha u(x) = f(x)&lt;/math&gt;
, where only finitely many of the &lt;math&gt;a_\alpha&lt;/math&gt;s are not the constant zero function. A solution takes the form of a function &lt;math&gt;u: B \to \mathbb R&lt;/math&gt;. We have &lt;math&gt;B \subseteq \mathbb R^d&lt;/math&gt; for an arbitrary &lt;math&gt;d \in \mathbb N&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f : B \to \mathbb R&lt;/math&gt; is an arbitrary function and the sum in the formula is taken over all possible &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional multiindices. If &lt;math&gt;f = 0&lt;/math&gt; the equation is called '''homogenous'''.

A partial differential equation is called '''nonlinear''' iff it is not a linear partial differential equation.
}}

{{TextBox| M=0 | W=100% | BG=#FFFFFF |1='''Definition 1.3''':

Let &lt;math&gt;n \in \mathbb N&lt;/math&gt;. We say that a partial differential equation has '''&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-th order''' iff &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the smallest number such that it is of the form
:&lt;math&gt;\forall (x_1, \ldots, x_d) \in B \subseteq \mathbb R^d : h(x_1, \ldots, x_d, u(x_1, \ldots, x_d), \overbrace{\partial_{x_1} u(x_1, \ldots, x_d), \ldots, \partial_{x_d} u(x_1, \ldots, x_d), \partial_{x_1}^2 u(x_1, \ldots, x_d), \ldots}^{\text{partial derivatives at most up to order } n}) = 0&lt;/math&gt;
}}

== First example of a partial differential equation ==
Now we are very curious what practical examples of partial differential equations look like after all.
{{TextBox| M=0 | W=100% | BG=#FFFFFF |1='''Theorem and definition 1.4''':

If &lt;math&gt;g: \mathbb R \to \mathbb R&lt;/math&gt; is a continuously differentiable function and &lt;math&gt;c \in \mathbb R&lt;/math&gt;, then the function
:&lt;math&gt;u : \mathbb R^2 \to \mathbb R, u(t, x) := g(x + ct)&lt;/math&gt;
solves the '''one-dimensional homogenous transport equation'''
:&lt;math&gt;\forall (t, x) \in \mathbb R^2 : \partial_t u(t, x) - c \partial_x u(t, x) = 0&lt;/math&gt;}}
'''Proof''': Exercise 2.

We therefore see that the one-dimensional transport equation has many different solutions; one for each continuously differentiable function in existence. However, if we require the solution to have a specific initial state, the solution becomes unique.

{{TextBox| M=0 | W=100% | BG=#FFFFFF |1='''Theorem and definition 1.5''':

If &lt;math&gt;g: \mathbb R \to \mathbb R&lt;/math&gt; is a continuously differentiable function and &lt;math&gt;c \in \mathbb R&lt;/math&gt;, then the function
:&lt;math&gt;u : \mathbb R^2 \to \mathbb R, u(t, x) := g(x + ct)&lt;/math&gt;
is the unique solution to the '''initial value problem for the one-dimensional homogenous transport equation'''
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{cases}
\forall (t, x) \in \mathbb R^2 : &amp; \partial_t u(t, x) - c \partial_x u(t, x) = 0 \\
\forall x \in \mathbb R : &amp; u(0, x) = g(x)
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;}}

'''Proof''':

Surely &lt;math&gt;\forall x \in \mathbb R : u(0, x) = g(x + c \cdot 0) = g(x)&lt;/math&gt;. Further, theorem 1.4 shows that also that
:&lt;math&gt;\forall (t, x) \in \mathbb R^2 : \partial_t u(t, x) - c \partial_x u(t, x) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

Now suppose we have an arbitrary other solution to the initial value problem. Let's name it &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;. Then for all &lt;math&gt;(t, x) \in \mathbb R^2&lt;/math&gt;, the function
:&lt;math&gt;\mu_{(t, x)}(\xi) := v(t - \xi, x + c\xi)&lt;/math&gt;
is constant:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{d\xi} v(t - \xi, x + c\xi) = \begin{pmatrix} \partial_t v (t - \xi, x + c\xi) &amp; \partial_x v (t - \xi, x + c\xi) \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ c \end{pmatrix} = -\partial_t v (t - \xi, x + c\xi) + c \partial_x v (t - \xi, x + c\xi) = 0&lt;/math&gt;
Therefore, in particular
:&lt;math&gt;\forall (t, x) \in \mathbb R^2 : \mu_{(t, x)}(0) = \mu_{(t, x)}(t)&lt;/math&gt;
, which means, inserting the definition of &lt;math&gt;\mu_{(t, x)}&lt;/math&gt;, that
:&lt;math&gt;\forall (t, x) \in \mathbb R^2 : v(t, x) = v(0, x + ct) \overset{\text{initial condition}}{=} g(x + ct)&lt;/math&gt;
, which shows that &lt;math&gt;u = v&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; was an arbitrary solution, this shows uniqueness.{{QED}}

In the next chapter, we will consider the non-homogenous arbitrary-dimensional transport equation.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Numerous factors affect the power of tectonic hazards.

== Nature of Hazards ==

=== Earthquakes ===
* The '''depth''' of the focus the the distance from the focus to the earth's surface. Earthquakes can be shallow (0-70 km), intermediate (70-300 km) or deep (&gt;300 km). The shallower the earthquake,
the more serious it is.
* The '''distance from the epicentre''' is also important. Areas closer to the centre receive more damage from earthquakes.
* '''Magnitude''' measures the amount of energy released by an earthquake. Each earthquake is assigned a number on the '''Richter Scale''', usually ranging from 1 to 9.
* '''Intensity''' measures the damage done by an earthquake. Each earthquake is assigned a grade on the '''Modified Mercalli Scale''', from I to XII.

=== Volcanic Eruptions ===
* The power of a volcano can be classified as 'explosive' or 'gentle'. Explosive eruptions cause much more damage than gentle ones.
* Acidity of magma: Non-viscous lava can spread further away from viscous lava and cause greater destruction.

=== Tsunamis ===
* A tsunami's power depends on the strength of its source. The stronger the submarine eruption/landslide/earthquake, the more serious the tsunami.
* Tsunami intensity is measured by '''run-up height''', or the maximum wave height. The greater the run-up height, the longer the waves will last when they rush inland, and the larger the area affected.
* It also depends on the distance of an area from the source of a tsunami. (NOT the proximity from the sea! See CE09Q13.)

The longer the time it takes to travel from the source of the tsunami to an area, the less an area is hit. Interpreting '''tsunami time travel maps''' occasionally pops up in the examination.

[[File:Krakatoa Tsunami 1883.jpg]]

Note, in the above map, that it does not take only 11 hours for the tsunami to travel to the eastern coast of South Africa, but slightly more than 11 hours. (A similar case is CE09Q15 - don't be tricked.)

=== Common Attributes ===
* Frequency: The more frequently an hazard occurs, the more damage it does. A dormant volcano does less damage than an active one. An area near a conservative or destructive plate boundary has more earthquakes than an intraplate area.
* Duration: The longer the duration of a hazard, the more damage it brings. The Indian Ocean Tsunami was triggered by a huge earthquake in Sumatra, lasting ten minutes.
* Areal extent: The larger the size of the area impacted, the more damage it brings. A submarine earthquake has large areal extent as it affects lots of countries that surround the ocean.
* Speed of onset: If a hazard appears faster, people will have less time to prepare and evacuate, increasing damage.

== Other Natural Factors ==
* Relief: Low-lying areas, coastal plains and narrow water inlets are more vulnerable to tsunamis. Steep slopes create faster lava flow and mudflow after volcanic eruptions and landslides after earthquakes.
* Weather: Extreme weather conditions like cold spells and heat waves can raise the death toll, since shelter and shade are insufficient.

== Human Factors ==
* Population density: Areas of higher population density have greater casualties and economic loss.
* Building strength: Brick or wooden buildings cannot withstand heavy shaking or fires.
* Preparedness: Citizens who are poorly informed and prepared about hazards will panic if a hazard occurs. Strong traditional values and low education level also lower the level of preparedness.
* Monitoring and warning systems in place:
* Government efficiency: A government hindered by corruption and excess bureaucracy cannot rescue effectively.
* Technology: Countries with higher technology can better rescue humans after earthquakes.
* Land use planning: Good land use planning can avoid creating more damage. For example, protecting hospitals will allow more victims to be treated. Moving nuclear power plants away from destructive plate boundaries will prevent them from failing.

      <comment>/* The Fourier Transform of Schwartz functions */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">In this chapter, we introduce the Fourier transform. The Fourier transform transforms functions into other functions. It can be used to solve certain types of linear differential equations.

== Definition and calculation rules ==
{{TextBox| M=0 | W=100% | BG=#FFFFFF |1='''Definition 8.1''':

Let &lt;math&gt;f \in L^1(\mathbb R^d)&lt;/math&gt; (i. e. &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is integrable). Then the '''Fourier transform''' of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is defined as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;\hat f: \mathbb R^d \to \mathbb R, \hat f(y) := \int_{\mathbb R^d} f(x) e^{-2\pi i x  \cdot y} dx&lt;/math&gt;

For the sentence ‘&lt;math&gt;\hat f&lt;/math&gt; is the Fourier transform of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;’, we also write
:&lt;math&gt;f(x) \rightarrow \hat f(y)&lt;/math&gt;}}

We recall lemma 6.11:

'''Lemma 6.11''': &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is integrable &lt;math&gt;\Leftrightarrow&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;|f|&lt;/math&gt; is integrable.

Now we're ready to prove the next theorem:

'''Theorem 8.2''': The Fourier transform of an integrable &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is well-defined.

'''Proof''': Since &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is integrable, lemma 8.2 tells us that &lt;math&gt;|f|&lt;/math&gt; is integrable. But
:&lt;math&gt;\forall x, y \in \mathbb R^d : |f(x) e^{-2\pi i x \cdot y}| = |f(x)| \cdot \overbrace{|e^{-2\pi i x \cdot y}|}^{=1} = |f(x)|&lt;/math&gt;
, and therefore &lt;math&gt;x \mapsto |f(x) e^{-2\pi i x  \cdot y}|&lt;/math&gt; is integrable. But then, by lemma 8.2, &lt;math&gt;x \mapsto f(x) e^{-2\pi i x \cdot y}&lt;/math&gt; is integrable, which is why
:&lt;math&gt;\int_{\mathbb R^d} f(x) e^{-2\pi i x \cdot y} dx = \hat f(y)&lt;/math&gt;
has a unique and well-defined value, by definition of integrability.{{QED}}

'''Theorem 8.3''': Let &lt;math&gt;f \in L^1(\mathbb R^d)&lt;/math&gt;. Then the Fourier transform of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\hat f&lt;/math&gt;, is bounded.

'''Proof''':

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\left| \int_{\mathbb R^d} f(x) e^{-2\pi i x  \cdot y} dx \right| &amp; \le \int_{\mathbb R^d} \left| f(x) e^{-2\pi i x  \cdot y} \right| dx &amp; \text{triangle ineq. for the } \int \\
&amp; = \int_{\mathbb R^d} |f(x)| dx &amp; \left| e^{-2\pi i x  \cdot y} \right| = 1 \\
&amp; \in \mathbb R &amp; f \in L^1(\mathbb R^d)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;{{QED}}

Once we have calculated the Fourier transform &lt;math&gt;\tilde f&lt;/math&gt; of a function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, we can easily find the Fourier transforms of some functions similar to &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;. The following calculation rules show examples how you can do this. But just before we state the calculation rules, we recall a definition from chapter 2, namely the power of a vector to a multiindex, because it is needed in the last calculation rule.

'''Definition 2.6''':

For a vector &lt;math&gt;x = (x_1, \ldots, x_d) \in \R^d&lt;/math&gt; and a &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional multiindex &lt;math&gt;\alpha \in \N_0^d&lt;/math&gt; we define &lt;math&gt;x^\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, '''&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; to the power of &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;''', as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;x^\alpha := x_1^{\alpha_1} \cdots x_d^{\alpha_d}&lt;/math&gt;

Now we write down the calculation rules:

{{TextBox| M=0 | W=100% | BG=#FFFFFF |1='''Theorem 8.4''':

Let &lt;math&gt;\hat f&lt;/math&gt; be the Fourier transform of &lt;math&gt;f \in L^1(\mathbb R^d)&lt;/math&gt;. Then the following calculation rules hold:
#&lt;math&gt;f(x)e^{-2 \pi i h \cdot x} \rightarrow \hat f(y + h)&lt;/math&gt; for arbitrary &lt;math&gt;h \in \mathbb R^d&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;f(x + h) \rightarrow \hat f(y) e^{2\pi i h \cdot y}&lt;/math&gt; for arbitrary &lt;math&gt;h \in \mathbb R^d&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;f(\delta x) \rightarrow \delta^{-d} \hat f(\delta^{-1} y)&lt;/math&gt; for arbitrary &lt;math&gt;\delta &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;
If additionally &lt;math&gt;\hat g&lt;/math&gt; is the Fourier transform of &lt;math&gt;g \in L^1(\mathbb R^d)&lt;/math&gt;, we have
:4. &lt;math&gt;\int_{\mathbb R^d} \hat g(x) f(x) dx = \int_{\mathbb R^d} g(y) \hat f(y) dy&lt;/math&gt;}}

'''Proof''': To prove the first rule, we only need one of the rules for the exponential function (and the symmetry of the standard dot product):

1.

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{\mathbb R^d} f(x) e^{-2 \pi i h \cdot x} e^{-2\pi i x \cdot y} dx = \int_{\mathbb R^d} f(x) e^{-2\pi i x \cdot (y + h)} dx&lt;/math&gt;

For the next two rules, we apply the general integration by substitution rule, using the diffeomorphisms &lt;math&gt;x \mapsto x - h&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x \mapsto \delta^{-1} x&lt;/math&gt;, which are bijections from &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R^d&lt;/math&gt; to itself.

2.

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{\mathbb R^d} f(x + h) e^{-2\pi i x \cdot y} dx = \int_{\mathbb R^d} f(x) e^{-2\pi i (x - h) \cdot y} dx = e^{2\pi i h \cdot y} \int_{\mathbb R^d} f(x) e^{-2\pi i x \cdot y} dx&lt;/math&gt;

3.

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{\mathbb R^d} f(\delta x) e^{-2\pi i x \cdot y} dx = \int_{\mathbb R^d} \delta^{-d} f(x) e^{-2\pi i(\delta^{-1} x) \cdot y} dx = \delta^{-d} \int_{\mathbb R^d} f(x) e^{-2\pi i x \cdot (\delta^{-1} y)} dx&lt;/math&gt;

4.

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\int_{\mathbb R^d} \hat g(x) f(x) dx &amp; = \int_{\mathbb R^d} \int_{\mathbb R^d} g(y) e^{2 \pi i x \cdot y} dy f(x) dx &amp; \text{Def. of the Fourier transform} \\
&amp; = \int_{\mathbb R^d} \int_{\mathbb R^d} f(x) g(y) e^{2 \pi i x \cdot y} dy dx &amp; \text{putting a constant inside the integral} \\
&amp; = \int_{\mathbb R^d} \int_{\mathbb R^d} f(x) g(y) e^{2 \pi i x \cdot y} dx dy &amp; \text{Fubini} \\
&amp; = \int_{\mathbb R^d} g(y) \int_{\mathbb R^d} f(x) e^{2 \pi i x \cdot y} dx dy &amp; \text{pulling a constant out of the integral} \\
&amp; = \int_{\mathbb R^d} g(y) \hat f(y) dy &amp; \text{Def. of the Fourier transform} \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

{{QED}}

== The Fourier Transform of Schwartz functions ==
We first note that the Fourier transform of a Schwartz function is well-defined. This is since Schwartz functions are integrable due to theorem 3.??.

{{TextBox| M=0 | W=100% | BG=#FFFFFF |1='''Theorem 8.5''':

If &lt;math&gt;\hat \phi&lt;/math&gt; is the Fourier transform of a function &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; in the Schwartz space &lt;math&gt;\mathcal S(\mathbb R^d)&lt;/math&gt;, in addition to the rules in theorem 8.4, also the following rules hold:

#&lt;math&gt;\partial_\alpha \phi (x) \rightarrow (2 \pi i y)^\alpha \hat \phi(y)&lt;/math&gt; for arbitrary &lt;math&gt;\alpha \in \mathbb N_0^d&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;(-2 \pi i x)^\alpha \phi(x) \rightarrow \partial_\alpha \hat \phi (y)&lt;/math&gt; for arbitrary &lt;math&gt;\alpha \in \mathbb N_0^d&lt;/math&gt;
If additionally &lt;math&gt;\hat \theta&lt;/math&gt; is the Fourier transform of a &lt;math&gt;\theta \in \mathcal S(\mathbb R^d)&lt;/math&gt;, then
: 3. &lt;math&gt;\widehat{\phi * \theta}(y) = \hat \phi (y) \cdot \hat \theta (y)&lt;/math&gt;}}

'''Proof''':

1.

For the first rule, we use induction over &lt;math&gt;|\alpha|&lt;/math&gt;.

It is clear that the claim is true for &lt;math&gt;|\alpha| = 0&lt;/math&gt; (then the rule states that the Fourier transform of &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is the Fourier transform of &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;).

We proceed to the induction step: Let &lt;math&gt;n \in \mathbb N_0&lt;/math&gt;, and assume that the claim is true for all &lt;math&gt;\alpha \in \mathbb N_0^d&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;|\alpha| = k&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;\beta \in \mathbb N_0^d&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;|\beta| = k+1&lt;/math&gt;. We show that the claim is also true for &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;.

Remember that we have &lt;math&gt;\partial_\beta \phi := \partial_{x_1}^{\beta_1} \cdots \partial_{x_d}^{\beta_d} \phi&lt;/math&gt;. We choose &lt;math&gt;n \in \{1, \ldots, d\}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\beta_n &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; (this is possible since otherwise &lt;math&gt;|\beta| = 0&lt;/math&gt;), and write
:&lt;math&gt;\partial_\beta \phi = \partial_{x_n} \partial_\alpha \phi&lt;/math&gt;
, where &lt;math&gt;\alpha := \beta - e_n&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;e_n&lt;/math&gt; shall be the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-th &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional unit vector (we are allowed to write &lt;math&gt;\partial_{x_n}&lt;/math&gt; at the first place because of [[w:Symmetry_of_second_derivatives#Schwarz.27_theorem|Schwarz' theorem]], which implies that one may interchange the order of partial derivation arbitrarily, see exercise ?).

Let &lt;math&gt;R \in \mathbb R_{&gt;0}&lt;/math&gt; be an arbitrary positive real number. Then the multi-dimensional integration by parts formula yields:

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{B_R(0)} \partial_{x_n} \partial_\alpha \phi (x) e^{-2 \pi i x \cdot y} dx = \int_{\partial B_R(0)} \partial_\alpha \phi(x) x_n e^{-2 \pi i x \cdot y} dx - \int_{B_R(0)}(-2 \pi i y_n) \partial_\alpha \phi(x) e^{-2 \pi i x \cdot y} dx&lt;/math&gt;

The formula &lt;math&gt;(*)&lt;/math&gt; almost looks like the calculation rule we wanted to show, but the integrals are taken over &lt;math&gt;B_R(0)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\partial B_R(0)&lt;/math&gt; and there also is a boundary term. We show that our calculation rule is true by showing that
:&lt;math&gt;\int_{B_R(0)} \partial_{x_n} \partial_\alpha \phi (x) e^{-2 \pi i x \cdot y} dx \to \int_{\mathbb R^d} \partial_{x_n} \partial_\alpha \phi (x) e^{-2 \pi i x \cdot y} dx, R \to \infty&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;\int_{\partial B_R(0)} \partial_\alpha \phi(x) x_n e^{-2 \pi i x \cdot y} dx - \int_{B_R(0)}(-2 \pi i y_n) \partial_\alpha \phi(x) e^{-2 \pi i x \cdot y} dx \to \int_{\mathbb R^d}(-2 \pi i y_n) \partial_\alpha \phi(x) e^{-2 \pi i x \cdot y} dx, R \to \infty&lt;/math&gt;
and conclude by uniqueness of limits in the real numbers that the rule is true. In order to show these convergences, we proceed as follows: First, we show that
:&lt;math&gt;\int_{\partial B_R(0)} \partial_\alpha \phi(x) x_n e^{-2 \pi i x \cdot y} dx \to 0, R \to \infty&lt;/math&gt;
and then you (in exercise ?) show by applying the dominated convergence theorem, that
:&lt;math&gt;\int_{B_R(0)} \partial_{x_n} \partial_\alpha \phi (x) e^{-2 \pi i x \cdot y} dx \to \int_{\mathbb R^d} \partial_{x_n} \partial_\alpha \phi (x) e^{-2 \pi i x \cdot y} dx, R \to \infty&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;\int_{\partial B_R(0)} \partial_\alpha \phi(x) x_n e^{-2 \pi i x \cdot y} dx \to \int_{\mathbb R^d}(-2 \pi i y_n) \partial_\alpha \phi(x) e^{-2 \pi i x \cdot y} dx, R \to \infty&lt;/math&gt;
The first convergence we will have thus shown directly, and the second convergence will follow due to the convergence theorems from elementary analysis that the sum of convergent sequences converges to the sum of the limits. From the convergences will then follow, as we remarked above, the first calculation rule.

So let's show that
:&lt;math&gt;\int_{\partial B_R(0)} \partial_\alpha \phi(x) x_n e^{-2 \pi i x \cdot y} dx \to 0, R \to \infty&lt;/math&gt;
We have
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\left| \int_{\partial B_R(0)} \partial_\alpha \phi(x) x_n e^{-2 \pi i x \cdot y} dx \right| &amp; \le \int_{\partial B_R(0)} \left| \partial_\alpha \phi(x) x_n e^{-2 \pi i x \cdot y} \right| dx &amp; \text{triangle inequality for integrals} \\
&amp; = \int_{\partial B_R(0)} \left| \partial_\alpha \phi(x) x_n \right| dx &amp; \text{since } \forall x \in \mathbb R : |e^{ix}| = 1 \\
&amp; \le \int_{\partial B_R(0)} R \max_{\|x\| = R} \left| \partial_\alpha \phi(x) \right| dx &amp; \text{monotony of integrals and } |x_n| \le \|x\|_2 = R \\
&amp; = \frac{d \sqrt{\pi}^d R^d}{\Gamma (d/2+ 1)} \cdot \max_{\|x\| = R} \left| \partial_\alpha \phi(x) \right| &amp; \text{theorem 6.9}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Since &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; was supposed to be a Schwartz function, there are boundaries &lt;math&gt;b_n &gt; 0, n \in \{1, \ldots, d\}&lt;/math&gt; such that
:&lt;math&gt;|\partial_\alpha \phi(x) x_n^{d+1}| &lt; b_n&lt;/math&gt;
By choosing &lt;math&gt;b := \max_{n \in \{1, \ldots, d\}} b_n&lt;/math&gt;, we even obtain that
:&lt;math&gt;\forall x \in \mathbb R^d, n \in \{1, \ldots, d\} : |\partial_\alpha \phi(x) x_n^{d+1}| &lt; b&lt;/math&gt;
For &lt;math&gt;x_n \neq 0&lt;/math&gt; we may divide the last equation to obtain
:&lt;math&gt;\forall x \in \mathbb R^d, n \in \{1, \ldots, d\} : x_n \neq 0 \Rightarrow |\partial_\alpha \phi(x)| &lt; \frac{b}{|x_n^{d+1}|} = \frac{b}{|x_n|^{d+1}}&lt;/math&gt;
Therefore, we obtain
:&lt;math&gt;\forall x \in \mathbb R^d \setminus \{0\}, n \in \{1, \ldots, d\} : |\partial_\alpha \phi(x)| &lt; \frac{b}{\max_{n \in \{1, \ldots, d\}} |x_n|^{d+1}} = \frac{b}{\|x\|_\infty^{d+1}} (*)&lt;/math&gt;
, where &lt;math&gt;\|x\|_\infty := \max_{n \in \{1, \ldots, d\}} |x_n|&lt;/math&gt; is the '''maximum norm of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;''' (remember that by &lt;math&gt;\|x\|&lt;/math&gt; we mean the 2-norm or euclidean norm of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;). Since in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R^d&lt;/math&gt; all norms are equivalent, there exists a constant &lt;math&gt;c &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; such that
:&lt;math&gt;\forall x \in \mathbb R^d : \|x\| \le c \|x\|_\infty (**)&lt;/math&gt;
and therefore, by our estimate of the boundary term,
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\left| \int_{\partial B_R(0)} \partial_\alpha \phi(x) x_n e^{-2 \pi i x \cdot y} dx \right| &amp; \le \frac{d \sqrt{\pi}^d R^d}{\Gamma (d/2+ 1)} \cdot \max_{\|x\| = R} \left| \partial_\alpha \phi(x) \right| &amp; \\
&amp; = \max_{\|x\| = R} \frac{d \sqrt{\pi}^d \|x\|^d}{\Gamma (d/2+ 1)} \left| \partial_\alpha \phi(x) \right| &amp; \\
&amp; \le \max_{\|x\| = R} \frac{d \sqrt{\pi}^d c\|x\|_\infty^d}{\Gamma (d/2+ 1)} \left| \partial_\alpha \phi(x) \right| &amp; (**) \\
&amp; \le \max_{\|x\| = R} \frac{d \sqrt{\pi}^d c}{\Gamma (d/2+ 1) \|x\|_\infty} b &amp; (*) \\
&amp; \le \max_{\|x\| = R} \frac{d \sqrt{\pi}^d c^2}{\Gamma (d/2+ 1) \|x\|} b &amp; (**) \\
&amp; = \frac{d \sqrt{\pi}^d c^2}{\Gamma (d/2+ 1) R} b &amp; \\
&amp; \to 0, R \to \infty
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

{{TextBox| M=0 | W=100% | BG=#FFFFFF |1='''Theorem 8.6''':

Let &lt;math&gt;\phi \in \mathcal S(\mathbb R^d)&lt;/math&gt;, and let &lt;math&gt;\hat \phi&lt;/math&gt; be the Fourier transform of &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;\hat \phi \in \mathcal S(\mathbb R^d)&lt;/math&gt;.}}

'''Proof''':

Let &lt;math&gt;\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb N_0^d&lt;/math&gt; be two arbitrary &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional multiindices, and let &lt;math&gt;\phi \in \mathcal S(\mathbb R^d)&lt;/math&gt;. By theorem 3.?a), &lt;math&gt;(-2\pi \mathrm i x)^\beta \phi&lt;/math&gt; is a Schwartz function, and by theorem 3.?b) &lt;math&gt;\partial_\alpha ((-2\pi \mathrm i x)^\beta \phi)&lt;/math&gt; is a Schwartz function as well. By theorem 8.4, we have
:&lt;math&gt;x^\alpha \partial_\beta \hat \phi = \widehat{\partial_\alpha ((-2\pi \mathrm i x)^\beta \phi)}&lt;/math&gt;
, where the hat over the term right to the equality sign should be stretched out over the whole right-hand side of the equation, but the author has unfortunately not found a working TeX command.

By theorem 8.3, &lt;math&gt;\widehat{\partial_\alpha ((-2\pi \mathrm i x)^\beta \phi)}&lt;/math&gt; is bounded. Since &lt;math&gt;\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb N_0^d&lt;/math&gt; were arbitrary, this shows that &lt;math&gt;\hat \phi \in \mathcal S(\mathbb R^d)&lt;/math&gt;.{{QED}}

'''Neurocognition of Language''' is intended to develop into a fundamental textbook on language and the brain. It will be started by the students of a seminar course with the same title, at the Departmenf of Psychology at Goethe University Frankfurt / Germany. At the moment (i.e., July 28 2014), students are working on finishing several chapters for this book, that will be uploaded within the next weeks. '''We would like to ask other users and the community to not add or change content before this has been achieved!''' We will delete this message once all chapters from the ongoing course are uploaded.

These chapters are intended as a starting point for the continuous improvement of the book by future participants in the same class, other students and interested colleagues in the field.

|+&lt;h2&gt; Grammar&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Guided Practice: Verb Conjugations - Present Tense&lt;/h2&gt;
In this section we will learn about how subject pronouns are associated with particular verb endings in Spanish&lt;br&gt;
Here, we will begin making short phrases by combining subjects and verbs in a single word.&lt;br&gt;

! &lt;h1&gt;&lt;center&gt; '''&lt;u&gt;Present Tense Practice&lt;/u&gt;''' &lt;/center&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
|-
!align =&quot;floatright&quot; width = &quot;60%&quot; | The general formula for creating verb conjugations is to replace the infinitive verb ending (-ar/-er/-ir) with the appropriate ending of the subject.&lt;br&gt;
Although there are three verb-ending categories, -er and -ir verbs tend to share most of the conjugation endings.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;

|-
!text align = &quot;left&quot; font size = &quot;14pt&quot;|
In Spanish, verbs are conjugated depending on the subject they are associated with, as well as the tense.&lt;br&gt;
For now, we will focus on Present Simple Tense&lt;br&gt;
Each subject pronoun is associated with a particular verb-ending type.

== Introduction ==

So far this book has dealt with the biological underpinnings of speech comprehension and production, as well as with the concepts of reading and writing in general. Now the focus shall be on how language develops in humans. This chapter will outline the first steps of language development; from the initial exposure to language whilst still being in the womb to the first vocalizations, words and eventually to the early processing of sentences and production of own utterances (Figure 1). Thus, the so-called ‘milestones of language development’ will build the framework of this chapter. 

[[File:fpsyg-02-00166-g001.jpg|frame|none|''Figure 1:''' Infants’ perception and production of speech during the first year (source: Simmonds AJ, Wise RJS and Leech R (2011) Two tongues, one brain: imaging bilingual speech production. Front. Psychology 2:166. doi: 10.3389/fpsyg.2011.00166)]]

First of all, what are the qualities newborns are equipped with when they are born? As everyone knows, newborns are not able to communicate their needs by talking, yet it is assumed that they are already attuned to the sound of human voices and even to speech and faces (Brooks &amp; Kempe, 2012). Nevertheless, about a year passes by until infants are able to utter their first words (Brooks &amp; Kempe, 2012). During this time, infants have to rely on other mechanisms helping them in enforcing their needs. Thus, the importance of gestures at the very beginning of an infant’s life is pointed out as well as the supportive function that social environment has on children (Brooks &amp; Kempe, 2012; Kuhl, Tsao, &amp; Liu, 2003). This section will also give an answer to the question why parents and other adults tend to talk in a very different, i.e. high pitched, voice to their children and what kind of advantages emanate from it (Purves et al., 2013). Furthermore, this chapter aims at dealing with the question whether differences in language are already noticeable within the first year of life. At that point it shall be referred to studies employing high amplitude sucking in babies indicating their ability to discriminate between languages (Mehler et al., 1988) as well as to studies on phoneme discrimination (e.g. Brooks &amp; Kempe, 2012; Mampe, Friederici, Christophe, &amp; Wermke, 2009). 

Subsequently, the mechanisms of how children start to perceive single words, and how they eventually figure out the underlying meaning of these words, are described in detail. Thereby, the role of rhythm, language-specific metrical stress and distributional information are considered (e.g. Brooks &amp; Kempe, 2012). In addition to that, it shall be dealt with sentence processing in children and the capabilities that assist them in doing so.

Until that point, the milestones of language acquisition of the first two years of children have been considered, yet we do not only want to know when children acquire which essential ability on their way to proper language acquisition, but also what makes their language processing different from adults (Brooks &amp; Kempe, 2012). Therefore, studies employing functional imaging have been conducted in order to search for differences in neural activation. These studies have confronted children with speech or simple vocalizations (e.g. Dehaene-Lambertz, Dehaene, &amp; Hertz-Pannier, 2002). Yet, on this account it shall not be disguised that scientists have discussed and questioned to some extent whether it is generally useful and reasonable to apply functional imaging techniques in children (e.g. Kuhl &amp; Rivera-Gaxiola, 2008).

At the end of this chapter, the focus shall be on the question whether the acquisition of language follows a certain sequence, which implies that learning to understand and produce speech is only possible within a limited timeframe. The underlying idea is the one of a so-called ‘critical period’. The critical period in language acquisition has been an intensely debated topic in the past and researchers have attempted to answer this question by approaching it from different angles (Brooks &amp; Kempe, 2012). On the one hand, research has investigated the effects brain injuries have in areas relevant for language comprehension and production (Bates, 1999), taking into consideration differences in age at which the injury was acquired. However, on the other hand scientists have attempted to examine the concept of a critical period for language by studying the process of how second languages are acquired, which has lead to ambiguous results (Brooks &amp; Kempe, 2012; Johnson &amp; Newport, 1989). Finally, case studies, as for instance the one of Genie, a feral child who was unfortunate to live in an impoverished environment with barely any exposure to language, have given more insight into the time frame of language acquisition and have proven to be helpful in resolving the issue of the critical period  (e.g. Purves et al., 2013).


== Prelinguist stage == 

During their first year of life, children learn “to recognize and reproduce sound patterns of their native language” (Brooks &amp; Kempe, 2012; p. 20). Since children need about a year to form their first words, the step before is often referred to as the so-called ‘pre-linguist’ or ‘pre-verbal’ stage (Brooks &amp; Kempe, 2012). The up-coming section shall focus on this very subject. 

When babies are born they already come with distinct abilities or preferences, as for instance a preference for human voices and faces (Brooks &amp; Kempe, 2012). This can be explained by the fact that the auditory system is already well developed before birth, i.e. during the third trimester of pregnancy, and the unborn is exposed to speech in the womb (Brooks &amp; Kempe, 2012; DeCasper &amp; Spence, 1986; Dehaene-Lambertz, Hertz-Pannier, &amp; Dubois 2006). However, neither are these auditory perceptual abilities completely matured, nor can sounds outside the womb be perfectly processed, due to the womb acting as a kind of filter making speech sound flat (Brooks &amp; Kempe, 2012; Conboy, Rivera-Gaxiola, Silva-Pereyra, &amp; Kuhl, 2008; Dehaene-Lambertz et al., 2006). Anyhow, studies reveal that prenatal experience with regard to language exists, as the following two studies will demonstrate.

DeCasper and Spence (1986) conducted a study demonstrating that prenatal experience has an impact on postnatal auditory preferences. In their study, pregnant women were told to read a certain passage every day to their unborn child during the last 6 weeks of pregnancy. After the babies were born they were read this familiar passage again, as well as a novel one. Infants demonstrated their preference for the familiar passage by displaying increased sucking rates during these passages. 

Another study from Mehler and his colleagues (1988) displays the influence that prenatal exposure to rhythm and intonation exerts on language discrimination. In their study, they found that newborns are able to differentiate utterances in another language from their native language, by exposing French newborn babies to French and Russian four days after birth. Since the babies were only four days old it can be inferred that prenatal instead of postnatal experience has to account for this ability. 

	So far the capabilities of newborns have been described, which include the ability of hearing by the beginning of the third trimester of pregnancy as well as the effect of prenatal experience on listening preferences and the ability to recognize the own native language already a few days after birth, due to the employment of prosodic cues. The following section shall focus on the perception of phonemes and on consequences for language acquisition emanating from it.


=== Speech perception === 

Phonological processes represent the infant’s first step into language as infants need to tune in on the phonetic peculiarities of their native language (Friederici, 2005). Therefore, the ability of infants to discriminate phonetic contrasts within the own native language, as well as within foreign languages, has been the subject of many studies. As newborns or infants are a very special group of subjects that require specific behavioral research methods, the various methods available for examining them shall be reviewed at first. Subsequently, studies of phonetic discrimination employing different methods shall be discussed and explanations for these results shall be sought. 

'''''Methods.''''' There are various methods available in order to examine infants’ language abilities (Conboy et al., 2008). First of all, many studies have employed various kinds of behavioral techniques that were developed specifically for investigating infants, such as high-amplitude sucking, visual habituation or dishabituation paradigms, or conditioned (operant) head turn paradigms (e.g. Kuhl, Tsao, &amp; Liu, 2003; Mehler et al., 1988). Many other behavioral methods require an overt response of the subject, hence being more cognitively demanding and preventing their use in infants (Conboy et al., 2008; Kuhl &amp; Rivera-Gaxiola, 2008). 

As an alternative, functional neuroimaging technologies offer the possibility of investigating underlying cognitive processes without being invasive. Yet, when it comes to conducting research on children, scientists encounter the difficulty of not being able to apply certain neurophysiological methods on children (Friederici 2005, 2006). For instance, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) or magnetoencephalography (MEG) are barely suitable for the application on infants, since these methods are very susceptible to movement, are expensive  and, in case of the fMRI, also very loud and aversive for young children (Kuhl &amp; Rivera-Gaxiola, 2008). Methods such as electroencephalography (EEG) or functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) can be used with adults as well as infants (Friederici, 2005, 2006; Kuhl &amp; Rivera-Gaxiola, 2008). However, as fNIRS also measures hemodynamic responses, like fMRI, it also suffers from the relatively low temporal resolution of the haemodynamic signal measured with these methods (Kuhl &amp; Rivera-Gaxiola, 2008). Therefore, EEG has proven to be the most adequate neurocognitive measure for language development research (Conyboy et al., 2008; Kuhl &amp; Rivera-Gaxiola, 2008).

Usually, EEG is time-locked to the beginning of the presentation of a stimulus (e.g., in language research: a phoneme, syllable, or tone) and entails a series of different waveforms within a few hundred milliseconds after stimulus onset, which can have positive and/ or negative peaks (Conboy et al., 2008). These specific waveforms are described as event-related brain potentials (ERPs) and are usually distributed over different regions of the scalp (Friederici, 2005, 2006). ERPs indicate different cognitive processes in response to a certain stimulus (Conboy et al., 2008; Friederici, 2005, 2006). As it will be seen at the end of the chapter, the analysis and comparison of ERPs between infants and adults is a crucial part of neurocognitive developmenal language research. The relevant ERP components will be introduced within the respective sections.

'''''Results.''''' At the beginning of their life, infants have the universal ability to discriminate between all of the 600 different phonemes. One of the most intuitive demonstrations of this is that Japanese infants are able to distinguish the phonemes /r/ and /l/, whereas Japanese adults are not (Kuhl, 2004; Purves et al., 2013). However, infants have to discriminate only between 30 to 40 phonemes, which make up their native language (Friederici, 2005; Kuhl, 2004). Several studies indicate that the ability of distinguishing non-native phonetic contrasts declines during the first year of life, while the same ability with regard to native contrasts increases (Conboy, Rivera-Gaxiola, Klarman, Aksoylu, &amp; Kuhl, 2005; Conboy et al., 2008; Friederici, 2006; Kuhl, 2005, 2008; Kuhl &amp; Rivera-Gaxiola, 2008). Most specifically, while the ability to discern non-native phonetic contrasts is still existent at the age of 7 months, it is not any longer present by the age of 11 months, as is demonstrated by a study of Conboy and her colleagues (2005), employing a novel version of the head turn paradigm. Furthermore, in the same study, word comprehension was negatively related to the ability of distinguishing between nonnative contrasts at the age of 11 months (i.e., the better the ability to discriminate non-native contrasts, the worse was word comprehension at the age of 11 months). Kuhl et al. (2008) were able to replicate this effect and could outline that better discrimination of native phonetic contrasts at the age of 7.5 months is associated with language growth (i.e., number of words produced, degree of sentence complexity, mean length of utterance) over the next two years – with growth being faster in children with better phoneme discrimination abilities. 

In contrast to Conboy and her colleagues (2005), Kuhl et al. (2008) employed EEG and the so-called ‘oddball paradigm’. The ‘oddball paradigm’ involves the presentation of a background or standard stimulus (here: a syllable) and the presentation of a deviant stimulus, i.e., a different syllable in comparison to the standard stimulus (cf. Conboy et al., 2008, for a description of the oddball paradigm). Both stimuli are presented in a random order, with the deviant being displayed only in about 15 per cent of cases (Conboy et al. 2008; Kuhl et al., 2008). Subsequently, the average ERP waveforms for both standard and deviant are calculated, as well as their difference (Conboy et al., 2008). The deviant-specific ERP activity is called ‘mismatch negativity’ (MMN; Figure 2; see also [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mismatch_negativity Wikipedia entry] for more details). It is represented by a negative peak at around 100-250 ms and regarded as an indicator for the (pre-attentive) discrimination of acoustically and phonetically different stimuli (Conboy et al., 2008). The larger the amplitude of the negativity, the better the discrimination (Kuhl et al., 2008). Importantly, as the MMN is elicited also in the absence of attention, this paradigm is particularly well suited to study perceptual processes already in very young children. Adults show negativities only, whereas infants show in addition positive peaks between 300-500 ms (Friederici, 2005, 2006).

[[File:Fnins-07-00265-g001.jpg||frame|none|'''Figure 2:''' Principle of the Mismatch Negativity (MMN; taken from Friederici, 2005). Event-related brain potentials (ERPs) elicited by frequent standard stimuli are subtracted from ERPs elicited by rare deviant stimuli.

Neurosci. 7:265. doi: 10.3389/fnins.2013.00265)]]

As all studies cited here point into the same direction, the reader might wonder which underlying mechanisms account for this shift from broad perceptual abilities to more selective or narrowing ones, thus favoring the patterns of the native language (Conboy et al., 2008; Kuhl &amp; Rivera-Gaxiola, 2008). Some researchers suggest that the acoustic or perceptual salience of stimuli as well as exposure to and experience with language exert an influence in that matter (Conboy et al., 2005, 2008; Kuhl &amp; Rivera-Gaxiola, 2008).
The concept of so-called 'native language neural commitment' (NLNC) is another attempt to explain this developmental shift (Conboy et al., 2005; Kuhl, 2004). It assumes that there is some kind of commitment of the brain’s speech processing systems to patterns of native-language speech (i.e., statistical and prosodic regularities) that promotes the learning of further aspects of the native language (Kuhl, 2004). In contrast, unfamiliar patterns, as for instance in case of foreign languages, are not to be identified any longer; in fact it is assumed that the acquisition of such new patterns is inhibited (Kuhl, 2004). Therefore, NLNC can give an explanation why performance on learning a second language depends on the resemblances of first and second language (Kuhl, 2004).

However, as the studies cited above show, the ability to discriminate phonemes varies between children. Thus, not every one displays this kind of neural commitment (Conboy et al., 2008; Kuhl et al., 2008) and some individuals maintain the ability to distinguish phonetic contrasts in a non-native language also beyond these initial stages of language development (Conboy et al., 2005). Put differently, the acquisition of patterns of the native language is not promoted in these individuals (Conboy et al., 2005). Consequently, it could be inferred that neural commitment entails rapid language development in comparison to individuals being less neuronally committed to patterns of their native language (Conboy et al., 2005).

=== Speech production === 

Even though infants hardly ever utter their first words before the end of the first year of life, they still produce speech earlier in their development. Already at the age of two months infants start to vocalize in form of cooing (Brooks &amp; Kempe, 2012). These vocalizations are subject to variation due to the fact that on the one hand, the infant vocal tract changes during the first year of life, which has an influence on the range of sounds that can be produced by the infant (Brooks &amp; Kempe, 2012). On the other hand, variations might be voluntarily employed by infants in order to adapt to the behavior of other people in the environment (Brooks &amp; Kempe, 2012).

As it was already shown, infants are able to recognize their own language soon after they are born (Mehler et al., 1988). On that account it was deduced that this ability relies on different rhythms and intonation structures distinct languages have. Consequently, the question arises whether infants’ vocalizations are a typical representation of their native language (Brooks &amp; Kempe, 2012). Mampe, Friederici, Christophe and Wermke (2009) attempted to address this issue. In their study they could detect that surrounding speech prosody influences newborns' cry melody, with German newborns rather crying with a falling and French newborns crying with a rising melody contour. This shows that newborns are able to memorize and produce intonation patterns typical of their native language (Mampe et al., 2009).

Babbling follows cooing and appears around the age of six months (Brooks &amp; Kempe, 2012; Kuhl, 2004). At first it consists of the repetition of syllables, which are eventually combined and represent a precursor for the formation of first words (Brooks &amp; Kempe, 2012). The benefit of cooing and babbling during the pre-linguist stage lies in the information that can be conveyed. Infants want to engage with their caretakers and employ vocalizations for that purpose, which are in turn reinforced by the caretakers and other adults (Brooks &amp; Kempe, 2012). Thus, parents apply social shaping and as a consequence language development is promoted (Brooks &amp; Kempe, 2012).  

As it can be seen, speech production has informative value for adults and helps the infant in enforcing its needs. Yet, there are also other mechanisms infants can employ in order to communicate with their environment before they actually have the linguistic ability to do so. These mechanisms shall be described in the upcoming section and their mutual influence shall be discussed.

=== Supportive mechanisms === 

'''''Gestures.''''' Facial and other gestures develop simultaneously to speech (Brooks &amp; Kempe, 2012). Since they require the same motor control systems and due to the fact that during the first two years of life infants tend to communicate with others by employing gestures next to vocalizations, i.e. by pointing at objects, one could conclude that gestures and speech complement one another (Brooks &amp; Kempe, 2012). However, not only do infants enjoy the benefits of using gestures, but also “mothers typically coordinate facial expressions and other gestures with their vocalizations in affective interactions with infants&quot;, thereby adapting to the needs of their children (Fernald &amp; Kuhl, 1987, p. 291). In this context, baby-talk (a.k.a. motherese, child-directed speech) is also important to mention and will be described next.

'''''Motherese.''''' The term motherese describes a distinct kind of speech adults and older children use in order to communicate with infants (Brooks &amp; Kempe, 2012). Fernald and Kuhn (1987) define typical aspects of motherese, including easier syntax, semantic and phonetics in comparison to adult speech. Moreover, the motherese consists of a simplified lexicon and differs in intonation and prosody from adult-directed speech (Fernald &amp; Kuhn, 1987). The function of this kind of communication is to facilitate language acquisition by emphasizing the phonetic peculiarities of the native language (Purves et al., 2013). Infants prefer this kind of speech comparison to normal, adult-directed language (Brooks &amp; Kempe, 2012). 

Fernald and Kuhl (1987) wanted to know what exactly drives the attention of infants to motherese and thus is responsible for the infants’ preference for motherese. In their study, frequency (i.e., perceived pitch) accounted for this preference, whereas no effect was found for amplitude (loudness) or duration (speech rhythm) of the speech patterns of motherese. It is assumed that pitch is related to emotional activation and positive affect (Fernald &amp; Kuhl, 1987).

'''''Social environment.''''' As the sections on speech production, gesture, and motherese have shown, language is not a concept that can be scrutinized in isolation, but in fact is an essential part of social interaction. Therefore, mutual effects of language and social interaction shall be outlined in this section.

Already when having discussed the underlying mechanisms of speech perception, the being exposed to and experiencing language was pointed out as an influential factor (Conboy et al., 2005, 2008; Kuhl &amp; Rivera-Gaxiola, 2008). In addition to exposure and experience, research has also acknowledged the importance of referential cues such as gaze following or joint-attention, when it comes to the promotion of language abilities (Brooks &amp; Kempe, 2012; Kuhl, 2004). Especially, joint-attention and interaction with others have been identified as emotionally encouraging and as helping infants to map words to objects in the environment  (Brooks &amp; Kempe, 2012). 

Yet, Kuhl, Tsao and Liu (2003) investigated the effects that different kinds of exposition to foreign languages have on language acquisition. At first, one group of 9-month-old American infants was exposed to native Mandarin speakers during 12 laboratory sessions with each of these sessions lasting 25 minutes, while another group, which functioned as control, was exposed to native English speakers for an equal amount of sessions (and time). After four weeks, both groups were tested in Mandarin speech perception, with the experimental group being significantly better than the control. However, when in a second study the lessons with the native Mandarin speaker were presented via audio- or videotape to another group of infants, this group was not significantly better at discriminating Mandarin contrasts. As a consequence, this experimental design again emphasizes the importance of social interaction in language learning, indicating that mere audible exposure is not sufficient in maintaining the ability to discern non-native phonetic contrasts (Kuhl et al., 2003).

== Word processing and word production ==

In contrast to written words, fluent speech does not have any 'spaces' or clear pauses and therefore the phyical signals of different words tend to merge (Jusczyk, Houston, &amp; Newsome, 1999; Kuhl, 2004). Yet, the ability to segment words from fluent speech is essential and influences the acquisition of a vocabulary within the native language (Jusczyk et al., 1999). 
By the age of 6 months infants already know the boundaries of familiar words (Brooks &amp; Kempe, 2012) and by the age of 7.5 months infants are even able to segment words from fluent speech (Jusczyk &amp; Aslin, 1995). The question now arising is: how do they actually succeed in this task? On this account several studies have emphasized the impact of metrical stress (Friederici, 2005, 2006; Kuhl, 2004). Not only do languages differ in the kind of phonemes they consist of but also with respect to metrical stress (Friederici, 2005). In English, for instance, the first syllable of a word tends to be stressed, whereas it is the opposite in French (e.g. Friederici, 2005). As soon as infants gain knowledge about the metrical stress of their native language, it helps them to identify the beginning and the end of words in the continuous speech stream (Friederici, 2005). Furthermore, in an experiment with 4-month old children, Friederici, Friedrich and Christophe (2007) could demonstrate that ERPs display a language-specific discrimination of stress patterns with a MMN being elicited in case the ‘wrong’ syllable was stressed, i.e. wrong in the sense of differing from what infants are used to in their native language. 

However, at the age of 7.5 months, infants tend to rely on metrical stress alone, which results in infants mis-segmenting words if they are stressed contrary to the basic rules of their native language (Jusczyk et al., 1999). Yet, by the age of 10.5 months infants have developed the ability to integrate several informative cues next to metrical stress, such as for instance distributional information on the frequency of syllables in certain contexts and probabilities of adjacent syllables (Brooks &amp; Kempe, 2012; Hay, Pelucchi, Graf Estes, &amp; Saffran, 2011; Jusczyk et al., 1999; Kuhl, 2004). 

Finally, this subchapter shall also consider some findings concerning the development of word production. As already mentioned, during the first year of life infants usually utter simple vocalizations only. Yet, by the age of 12 months they start building so-called holophrases, which are one-word sentences (Brooks &amp; Kempe, 2012; see also Chapter 1 ## LINK: Chapter 1/Evolution ##). Due to the fact that infants have the desire to communicate with their environment, they have a high incentive to learn more and more words (Brooks &amp; Kempe, 2012). All the same, mapping words to meaning is cognitively demanding during the first year of life, and thus rather difficult for infants. It therefore frequently results in classical word production errors such as under-extension and over-extension (i.e., using the word ‘dog’ either only for a very special one, e.g., the own dog, or employing the word for every living animal; Brooks &amp; Kempe, 2012; Conboy et al., 2008). However, during the second half of their second year of life, infants overcome this obstacle and a &lt;span style=&quot;color:#006400&quot;&gt; '''vocabulary spurt'''  &lt;/span&gt; begins. During the age of 17 to 24 months, infants are able to map words onto meanings very fast (‘fast mapping’) and the lexicon grows from about 50 words at the age of 17 months to about 200 words by the age of two years (Kuhl &amp; Rivera-Gaxiola, 2008).

Switch from slow increase in vocabulary to sudden fast increase.}}

== Early sentence processing ==

The just described ability to segment words from speech is a prerequisite of early sentence processing, as it helps in extracting word meanings and thereby generating a lexicon (Kuhl &amp; Rivera-Gaxiola, 2008). Nevertheless, when it comes to syntactic processing, only very few studies are available (Friederici, 2005, 2006) and accordingly, hardly any assumptions can be made on that account. EEG studies with adult participants have displayed that the violation of syntactic rules either elicits a P600 or an E/LAN ERP component, or combinations of both (Friederici, 2005).  The P600 is associated with syntactic revision and centro-parietally distributed whereas the E/LAN is a left anterior negativity elicited by violations of local syntactic rules and morphosyntactic errors (Friederici, 2005, 2006). One study (Silva-Pereyra, Rivera-Gaxiola, &amp; Kuhl, 2005) reports P600-like ERPs for 3- and 4-year-old infants, whereas another study (Silva-Pereyra, Klarman, Lin, &amp; Kuhl, 2005) fails to do so for E/LAN. 

Further studies have used EEG to evaluate infants’ abilities to process sentence-level lexical-semantics. Usually a semantically inappropriate word within or at the end of a sentence elicits an N400 ERP, which has a negative peak at around 400ms and is centro-parietally distributed (e.g., The dog chases the tree; Purves et al., 2013). Developmental studies using this paradigm revealed an N400 effect for infants aged 14 to 19 months, which appears to be significant later and lasting longer in comparison to adults (Friederici, 2005) (Figure 3). Thus, it is inferred that lexical-semantic processes in infants are slower than in adults (Friederici, 2005). Furthermore, the fact that infants engage more frontal regions could be related to infants needing more attention in order to distinguish words or to infants’ processing being more image-based (Friederici, 2005).

FIGURE 3 HERE

From these few results, it might tentatively be inferred that to some extent children have already developed higher linguistic processing abilities similar to those of adults by the age of 3 to 4 years, such as for instance the ability to discriminate detect semantic and syntactic anomalies (e.g. Friederici, 2005). Thus, these studies have been taken to indicate that the underlying mechanisms might already be present at this young age. Yet, as these components tend to occur later with relation to stimulus onset and due to the fact that no E/LAN is elicited in children in contrast to adults, it can be assumed that these underlying mechanisms still need to undergo substantial developmental change in order to be as efficient as they are in adults (Conboy et al., 2008). The upcoming section is concerned with these underlying mechanisms, i.e. the neural basis of language.

== Neural specialization == 

The issue of neural specialization can be addressed best by studies relying on fMRI. All the same, as already mentioned before, fMRI tends to be less suited in its application for young infants, as the temporal resolution is not as good as that of EEG and also because of the tendency of infants to move frequently (Kuhl &amp; Rivera-Gaxiola, 2008). Also, the fact that fMRI is loud and narrow and thus a rather challenging environment for young children should be remarked, which entails that there are only very few studies of infants using fMRI (Kuhl &amp; Rivera-Gaxiola, 2008). Thus, the studies and their results, which are described subsequently, should be considered with caution.

A study reported by Dehaene-Lambertz and colleagues (2002) intended to investigate infant brain activity while being exposed to normal and reversed speech. Therefore, they tested awake and sleeping 3-month-old infants in an fMRI design. It could be shown that regions in the left hemisphere (i.e., the superior temporal and angular gyri), corresponding to activation in adults, were already active in infants. Furthermore, awake infants displayed activation in the right prefrontal cortex when confronted with normal speech. This is in line with the assumption that normal, i.e. forward, speech would entail stronger activation than reversed speech. However, in contrast to adults, no difference between normal and reversed speech was found in the left temporal lobe in infants. Dehaene-Lambertz et al. (2002) therefore assume that the infant brain still changes after the third month when it comes to processing natural language. In a later study, Dehaene-Lambertz and her colleagues (2006) came to the conclusion that lateralization in infants is not as strong as in adults, but that there are also many functional similarities between infants and adults, which supports the assumption of a genetic bias for speech processing in certain brain areas. 

To conclude, there seems to exist an early functional specialization for certain aspects of language in infants, however full connectivity between all language areas will be achieved later during development (Brooks &amp; Kempe, 2012).

== A critical period of language ==

As already mentioned in the introduction of this chapter, the concept of a ‘critical period’ has been an intensely debated topic in the scientific community (Brooks &amp; Kempe, 2012). This concepts serves to describe the fact that language learning is only possible within a certain timeframe and cannot be fully compensated afterwards (Brooks &amp; Kempe, 2012). Thus, this closing chapter seeks to give a brief overview over some of the evidence that has been taken to support the existence of a critical period for language.

=== Age of recovery from brain injury  ===

Not only have studies on brain injuries disclosed important brain areas when it comes to language production and perception (Purves et al., 2013), but studies on the recovery of brain injuries indicate a critical age up until which complete recovery (i.e., devoid of any lasting dysfunctions) can take place (Brooks &amp; Kempe, 2012).

In 1999, Bates conducted a study on adults and infants who had experienced focal brain injuries. The results of this study were interpreted as showing  that linguistic knowledge is not innate, cannot clearly be localized, and that a high differentiation is already present at birth, which implies that some brain regions are simply biased “towards modes of information processing that are particularly useful for language“ (Bates, 1999, p. 195). In detail it says that infants make use of rapid, detailed auditory and visual perception which helps them to analyze speech. Also, infants are able to map sounds to meanings which facilitates integration.. Furthermore, the same study revealed that injuries affecting the left hemisphere do not result in aphasia if those injuries happened early in life (i.e., before the age of five). 

As the functional neuroimaging studies of Feldman (2005) demonstrate, regions of the right hemisphere that are homologous to left-hemispheric language regions are able to compensate for language functioning in case of severe injury of the left hemisphere. Thus, it can be inferred that the infant brain is highly plastic, allowing a reorganization of language in case of left hemisphere damage (Bates, 1999; Feldman, 2005). Consequently, development within a normal range can be observed in children with early focal brain injuries albeit at a somewhat delayed rate (Bates, 1999; Feldman, 2005). 
In summary, results on the influence of age on recovery from brain injuries support the idea of a critical period, as they indicate a clear age up until which damage can be compensated by other brain regeions, i.e., until five years of age.


=== Age of exposure to a second language ===

Another approach to studying the presence of critical periods for language relies on investigating whether learning a second language at young age leads to a higher proficiency than learning a second language at older age. If that were the case it would promote the idea of the critical period.

Following this approach, Johnson and Newport (1988) compared the performance of native Korean or Chinese individuals who had moved to the United States at different ages (i.e., between 3 and 39 years) and who had by the time of the study been living there for 3 to 26 years. By testing individual abilities in English grammar, Johnson and Newport (1988) report a significant correlation between age of arrival and test performance with individuals arriving earlier performing significantly better than late arrivals. Importantly, it was shown that until arrival ages of 7 years, the individuals performed at equal levels compared to native speakers. However, after puberty, the individuals rather differ increasingly due to individual variability instead of age, which is not found in young arrivals.

While this study of Johnson and Newport (1988) supports the concept of the critical period by demonstrating an age-related effect when it comes to the acquisition of a second language, researchers have not been able to replicate this study (Brooks &amp; Kempe, 2012). Rather, evidence seems to point towards a general decrease in proficiency as age of acquisition of the second language increases, which may be due to individual differences in motivation and general cognitive abilities (Brooks &amp; Kempe, 2012). Consequently, from this evidence on the acquisition of second languages, a clear-cut critical period for language which can be delimited to certain points of age cannot be derived., Rather the field currently seems to favor the assumption of a decline in neural plasticity (Brooks &amp; Kempe, 2012) that affects the ease and proficiency with which a second language can be learned.

=== Feral children ===

Before the case of Genie, a feral child, is outlined, it should be noted that feral children in general are a very rare phenomenon and also that Genie is a very unique case for that matter, since she had to suffer from social isolation and in consequence also from language deprivation for a very long time, i.e. 13 years. There are no other reports of children being held captive for such a long time (Fromkin, Krashen, Curtis, Rigler, &amp; Rigler, 1974). 

Before the report of Genie, all feral infants or children that had been investigated were somehow retarded or delayed in their development (Fromkin et al., 1974). When Genie was found, she was 13 years old, malnourished, emotionally disturbed and mute. From the age of 20 months on, her parents locked her up in a dark room and tied her to a potty chair most of the time. Not only did she have to stay in the room all day isolated from any social contact, but also did her father punish her if she made any noise. This circumstance might have accounted for her muteness when she was found by social workers. Yet, a few days after she had been taken to hospital, she started to respond to speech of others. Also, investigators could not find any evidence of brain damage or another kind of retardation (Purves et al., 2013). Furthermore, after having tested Genie's speech comprehension, it was inferred that despite the fact that she did not utter any words, she was capable of understanding single words. However, the tests also revealed that she had hardly any understanding of grammatical structures. Nevertheless, she started to acquire some knowledge in that area and made steady progress.

When it comes to speech production, it shall be noted that Genie had some physical difficulties due to lacking control over her muscles. Genie's vocabulary was larger than that of younger normally-developed  children whose speech had a comparable level of syntactic complexity as Genie’s. Yet, her competence on grammar did not exceed the developmental state of a two or two and a half year old child. Thus, she was not able to produce any truely elaborate utterances, but remained at the level of two or three word sentences (Purves et al., 2013). 

In summary, the case of Genie gives an impression of how important early experience and early exposure to language are. Although some aspects, as for instance vocabulary, can be learnt to a certain extent, grammatical features remain an obstacle, which is barely manageable for a feral child like Genie. Thus, the inability to gain grammatical knowledge provides evidence for the concept of a critical period for proper language acquisition, as do studies on the recovery fom early brain injuries (Brooks &amp; Kempe, 2012).

== Summary ==

This chapter has provided evidence for prenatal experience in infants with regards to hearing. It was pointed out that this experience is restricted to rhythmic and prosodic cues of language as the womb acts as a filter for auditory signals. Even so, prenatal exposure to prosodic cues has proven to be sufficient in order for newborns to distinguish their native language from a foreign one. By the age of 11 months, abilities in the discrimination of native phonetic contrasts significantly correlate with language abilities in the second and third year, predicting the existence a more extensive vocabulary at older age. Perception of speech signals in general seems to be the main accomplishment within the first year of life, whereas production of language apparently lags behind language processing, as first comprehensible words are hardly ever uttered before the age of one year. Furthermore, research has shown that brain activity when processing phonemes or sentences is very similar between infants and adults and that the underlying neuronal mechanisms thus seem to be alike, with the ones of infants still having to mature over the lifespan. Finally, the long-assumed existence of a critical period for language acquisition is supported by studies on the recovery of early life brain injuries and by a report on language development in a feral child.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== '''Introduction''' ==

The ability to communicate with their conspecifics is inherent in most animals at least to some extent. For example, bees have specific kinds of dances, signaling the location of flowers relative to their hive. Apes can utter warning calls to inform other members of their group about an approaching predator and wolves are able to show different social signs – like dominance or submission – thanks to a shared set of facial expressions and gestures. 

However, being able to use a complex, fully developed language seems to be an innate and unique trait to humans, as so far it could not be observed in any other known species (e.g., Fisher &amp; Marcus, 2006). Mostly, communication systems of animals are composed of a limited set of utterances or behaviors with a very specific and limited meaning. Humans, on the other hand, are able to associate abstract connotations with words; they can express complex chains of thought using a principally unlimited lexicon and - thanks to the combinatorial power of syntax - build intricate sentences in order to express specific temporal or local relations between objects. 
Thus, language on such a high level is unique and universal to the human species. While studying the neurocognition of language, one might wonder about its origins. How and under which circumstances did language develop? Did it evolve in the vein of Darwinian natural selection? If yes, why can we observe such a large number of different spoken languages nowadays, as it does not seem likely that natural pressures were responsible for all of them? Investigating the emergence of language is not an easy task. In fact, researchers are confronted with such serious difficulties that the quest for the origins of language has already provocatively been labeled as “the hardest problem in science” (Kirby &amp; Simon, 2003). The first hindrance is of a definitive kind: What is language and which specific qualities should it possess to be classified as a language? Even if researchers were to agree on a general definition, they would still have to face an even bigger issue: The lack of concrete empirical evidence. When studying the evolution of specific anatomical features or relatively simple motor tasks (e.g., walking), substantial evidence exists in the form of fossil archaeological findings from different stages of development. Contrary to that, language is a combination of complex cognitive and motor abilities and its emergence cannot be traced back to a specific point in time. As a consequence of this, researchers are left with a number of indirect measures like comparative (physiological) studies of humans and apes, the examination of the development of language in children and - to some extent - fossil evidence.

Unfortunately, using these kinds of methods to make inferences about the evolution of language does not work without using a significant amount of conjectures. In fact, an early surge of interest in this field of research after the publication of “The Origin of Species” by Darwin was extinguished by the Linguistic Society of Paris in 1866: It seems that most papers at that time relied excessively on pure speculation about possible situations that early humans had to face in the distant past. This resulted in a ban of each and every study covering language-evolution from being published by the Linguistic Society of Paris. A century later, thanks to more sophisticated methods and a better understanding of evolution, this area of research has become attractive again, leading to the participation of various fields of sciences, such as psychology, linguistics and archaeology (Jackendoff, 2002).  

Up to this date, the research of language evolution is lacking generally accepted theories. In fact, most researchers provide their own take on this problem, thus increasing the total number of differing hypotheses (Kirby &amp; Simon, 2003). The aim of the following chapter is to point out some aspects of language evolution with a relatively high degree of acceptance within the scientific community. Based on the discussed aspects, a relatively recent theory of language evolution will be portrayed, the Mirror System Hypothesis (Arbib, 2012).



== '''Three rather uncontroversial characteristics of language evolution''' ==

Although there are still only few hard facts or generally accepted theories on language evolution available up to now, some specific hypotheses on this topic can be regarded as relatively accepted. The following section is going to present three of those assumptions: First of all, it will cover the question whether or not language has been a direct target of natural selection or rather emerged as a byproduct of the evolution of some other (cognitive) mechanism. Secondly, the concept of protolanguages as intermediate steps in evolution will be presented. Finally, the significance of gestures in the evolution of language will be discussed briefly.


=== &lt;u&gt;Language and Natural Selection&lt;/u&gt; === 

As language presumably provides a beneficial adaption to many different exterior threats (e.g., communicating with each other while hunting deadly animals), it may seem plausible to assume that humans’ ability to create and acquire languages was formed by natural selection. However, many researchers favor the side-effect theory. It suggests that language is an evolutionary byproduct, probably an epiphenomenon of the brain’s increase in size and efficiency (e.g., Chomsky, 1988; Hauser, Chomsky &amp; Fitch, 2002; Piattelli-Palmarini, 1989). Chomsky himself wrote the following about the evolutionary approach:

“''We know very little about what happens when 1010 neurons are crammed into something the size of a basketball, with further conditions imposed by the specific manner in which this system developed over time. It would be a serious error to suppose that all properties, or the interesting properties of the structures that evolved, can be ‘explained’ in terms of natural selection.''” (Chomsky, 1975, as cited in Jackendoff, 2002)

Supporters of the side-effect theory argue that complex abilities like language could not have evolved in the relatively short time span since humans diverged from other primates. Moreover, according to this theory, the presence of a grammar in itself does not have any adaptive value. Grammar also is said not to be able to evolve at all, but rather that it is a dichotomous trait of language that either exists in a species or does not (Harley, 2008). Nowadays, however, the majority of researchers is convinced of the natural-selection theory, as there (i) apparently was enough time for grammar to evolve and as (ii) it is today believed by the majority of researchers that the presence of a full language actually does bring adaptive advantages. One such advantage, for example, is the fact that you can only warn other members of your species about possibly threatening events that might occur in the future when you have acquired a specific degree of grammar (Carroll, 2003; Jackendoff &amp; Pinker, 2005; Pinker, 2003; Pinker &amp; Jackendoff, 2005). Some researchers even go as far as calling theories that explain the emergence of language solely through an increasing brain size or as a fortunate accident a “retreat to mysticism” (Jackendoff, 2002).

Patel (2008) approaches this ongoing discussion more cautiously and warns about jumping to premature conclusions: It is tempting to attribute the emergence of universal and unique human abilities like language to evolution, but that is often unreasonable from a biological point of view. For example, there are no other species besides Homo sapiens that can create and control fire, thus making it a unique and universal skill. But it seems a lot more plausible that the mastery of fire developed thanks to the humans’ increasing brainpower rather than being a direct target of natural selection. To carry it to the extremes, nobody would honestly argue that the ability to play computer games arose because of natural selection. Therefore, Patel (2008) suggests as a research strategy to formulate the null-hypothesis that language has not been a direct target of natural selection. The appropriate scientific approach, then, would be to gather evidence in favor of the natural selection theory so as to be able to falsify this null-hypothesis. The following list briefly summarizes the evidence provided by Patel (2008):

•	'''Babbling''': Every healthy baby about 7 months old starts to utter repetitive syllables (Locke, 1993), even if it is deaf (Oller &amp; Eilers, 1988). If exposed to sign language, babies will “babble” with their hands (Petitto et al., 2004). This can be taken as evidence for a training mechanism - shaped by natural selection: Human babies (and songbirds, too) are thus able to “learn the relationship between oral movements and auditory outcomes, in other words, to tune the perceptual-motor skills they will use in acquiring their species’ communication system” (Patel, 2008). Deaf babies exposed to sign language, respectively, learn the relation between gestural movements and visual input.

•	'''Anatomy of the human vocal tract''': The human larynx is positioned much lower than in any other primate species (i.e., apes, Homo neanderthalensis), increasing the amount of sounds we can emit and simultaneously increasing the risk of choking to death (Lieberman, 1984). This anatomical difference might have occurred due to natural selection shaping the body, ultimately providing a biological basis for modern speech.

•	'''Vocal learning''': Humans are the only primates with an extensive use of vocal learning (Egnor &amp; Hauser, 2004), such as listening to auditory input and trying to imitate the sounds, which suggests that this characteristic is shaped by natural selection to support babies in their language acquisition.

•	'''Critical periods for language acquisition''': Humans need to be exposed to their native language during a critical period (i.e., childhood, see also chapter 8) in order to master it (Lennenberg, 1967). This may be a mechanism to allow humans a very early acquisition of socially important competencies.

•	'''Different modalities of language''': Speech is the main modality of human language, but true sign languages such as British Sign Language (BSL) cannot be considered any inferior. In fact, they are just as rich in complexity as speech, sharing most components (e.g. phonology, syntax, morphology) and neural substrates with spoken language in the left hemisphere (Emmorey, 2002; see also chapter 9). The human drive to acquire language thus seems extremely powerful as different modalities can be used interchangeably, hence probably being shaped by natural selection. 

•	'''Mental predisposition for learning and creating languages''': In 1977, a school for deaf children in Nicaragua was founded where adults tried to teach them lip reading and speaking Spanish. Before that, the children were isolated from each other, not being able to communicate. Interestingly, they started to develop their own sign language in school, completely without help from teachers or other adults. Younger students learned from older cohorts and added new grammatical elements, thus increasing its complexity from year to year (Senghas &amp; Coppola, 2001). Ultimately – over the course of approximately 25 years – this development led to the fully elaborated Nicaraguan Sign Language (ISN), demonstrating strong mental predispositions in humans to create languages.

•	'''Fixated language-related genes''': Damage to the FOXP2 gene leads to immense impairments in language related abilities like deficits in oral motor activities or weaker performances in grammatical and lexical judgments (Marcus &amp; Fisher, 2003). The impairment in nonverbal abilities does not seem to be as strong as in verbal abilities (Alcock et al., 2000a; 2000b). FOXP2 shows almost no variation within humans, but differs strongly from other species. It seems to have become fixed within the past 200,000 years after having been a target of evolution (Enard et al., 2002).

•	'''Biological cost of failure to acquire language''': A trait that has been the target of natural selection obviously bore adaptive advantages. So if a human failed to acquire language, his or her adaptive fitness most likely would drop by a huge amount, decreasing their chances for reproduction (and therefore removing people without the ability for language from the gene-pool).

Combining these different pieces of evidence, Patel (2008) regards the rejection of the null-hypothesis that language has not been a direct target of natural selection to be justified, thus accepting the natural selection hypothesis of language evolution. Fitch (2005) agrees and acknowledges natural selection as the main mechanism behind the emergence of language. However, he points out that it cannot account for every aspect of language, especially not for the more recent ones like phonology and semantics. While clearly being responsible for adaptive individual behavior, it does not seem likely for natural selection to have shaped components of language that have to be culturally shared and socially accreted over generations. Fitch (2005) thus adds a relatively newly discovered social selective force of evolution to the discussion, namely kin selection. As this mechanism favors behavior that not only increases the fitness of the individual and its offspring, but also the fitness of the whole kin, individuals with communication systems supporting their kin will be selected. Furthermore, species with a rather long lifespan will acquire many experiences and complex concepts over the course of their life. If communicated to the young offspring, it will increase the inclusive fitness of the kin.

=== &lt;u&gt;Intermediate steps of language&lt;/u&gt; ===

The idea that language went from an animal-like communication system to a rich, modern language in a single step does not seem very credible (Fitch, 2005). That is why Bickerton (1990) introduced the term “'''protolanguage'''”, stating that it took two stages for language to evolve. In his view, protolanguage first arose with the emergence of ''Homo erectus'' about 1.6 million years ago. Just like modern languages, protolanguage had vocal labels attached to different concepts, yet it is distinguished from modern language by its lack of syntax. Bickerton (1990) controversially hypothesizes a very quick and spontaneous step from protolanguage to language about 50,000 years ago, after the appearance of ''Homo sapiens''. Interestingly, there is some evidence backing up his claims, as protolanguage can still be observed today, e.g., in pidgin languages (Bickerton, 1981), in language-deprived children (“Genie”; Curtiss, 1977, see also chapter 8.6.3), in the early language of infants, or when teaching language to apes (Savage-Rumbaugh, Shanker &amp; Taylor, 1998). 

Two different types of theories on protolanguage can be distinguished, i.e., ''synthetic'' and ''analytic'' models (Hurford, 2000; Fitch, 2005). Protolanguage according to synthetic models consists of single words with specific meanings attached to them like in Bickerton’s (1990) theory. Assuming that the lexicon (i.e., the vocabulary) came first, the necessary ingredient to achieve the level of a modern language is a proper syntax in order to form complex sentences using those single words. In analytic theories, in contrast, protolanguage is made up of ''holophrases''. A holophrase is an indecomposable word with a very complex meaning (in fact representing a whole proposition) that can even change with context. For example, imagine a (hypothetical) word like “krumblak” signaling something like “beware of the lion sitting in the grass to the left of you”. There is an increasing amount of evidence favoring analytic models, as holophrases still exist today (Wray, 2002): One-word utterances of infants seem to have rather complex connotations (e.g., “ebab” may represent something like “please give me some apple juice”) and even adults are using them (e.g., “more” may mean “add even more meat to the stew” in the context of cooking food). After reviewing data from several comparative studies between humans and animals, Fitch (2005) suggests “''that it is easier to evolve complex learned structure in a vocal communications system (as evidenced by the multiple parallel evolution of such structure in birds and whales) than to evolve a system of combinatoric meaning''”. He concludes that analytic theories seem to gain the upper hand in research (see also: Arbib, 2003; Bickerton, 2003).

Taken together, protolanguage is a very plausible concept supported by a relatively wide range of evidence. Many researchers agree that language went through different intermediate manifestations (e.g., Jackendoff, 2002; Fitch, 2005), but most likely more than initially suggested by Bickerton (1990). Bickerton himself took on a more gradualist stance on protolanguage in his later works (Calvin &amp; Bickerton, 2000), distancing himself from the idea of a spontaneous huge leap from proto- to a modern language in a short period of time.


=== &lt;u&gt;Gestures as a starting point&lt;/u&gt; ===

Given the multimodality of language, it is very plausible to assume that manual gestures and signs - in addition to speech - played a rather prominent role in the evolution of language. As a matter of fact, this proposal is anything but new, as it has been suggested for the first time over 80 years ago (Paget, 1930). More recently, Corballis (2003; 2004) proposed that the first primate communication systems consisted nearly entirely of gestures and that speech evolved from that point, effectively freeing our hands from communication and thereby enabling us to wield tools while talking to conspecifics. McNeill (2012) agrees about the importance of gestures, but states that gesture-first theories cannot be correct. According to his opinion, speech and gesture are bound together very closely and that they thus are equally important. Gesticulation appears in most cases of communication, covering the same ideas as speech, so that both modalities form a single unit. As theories on the evolution of language need to explain the nature of language, gesture-first theories cannot be accurate, according to McNeill (2012) as they do not account for the speech-gesture unity that can be observed, but rather predict a clear dominance of speech and a minor, insignificant role of gesticulation.

Comparative studies do provide some evidence for the significance of gestures in the evolution of language, as the brain of apes has been shown to resemble the human brain rather closely in terms of specialization (Cantalupo &amp; Hopkins, 2001). Critically, Brodmann’s area 44 - probably participating in the orchestration of manual gestures in those species - is enlarged in the left hemisphere in chimps and gorillas and corresponds with Broca’s area in humans, one of the classic areas involved in speech. Mirror-neurons - firing when performing an action or perceiving another animal executing the same action - are located in this very region in apes (Rizzolatti, Fadiga, Goassi &amp; Gallese, 1996). Brain imaging studies showed increased activation in corresponding areas in the human brain when executing or observing a grasping-task, but not when simply looking at objects (Grafton, Arbib, Fadiga &amp; Rizzolatti, 1996). It is argued that mirror-neurons served as a ‘kick starter’ for language evolution, enabling the ability for imitation and therefore the development of the first manual signs (Stamenov &amp; Gallese, 2002; Arbib, 2005). 

Taking all this evidence into account, it appears very plausible to assume that language either evolved on its own, starting from gestures, or that both spoken language and the use of gestures as a sign language evolved together in a dynamic manner. In the following section, a modern theory of language evolution, building upon these findings, will be presented.



== '''The Mirror System Hypothesis of language evolution''' ==


=== &lt;u&gt;Introducing the main assumptions of the Mirror System Hypothesis&lt;/u&gt; ===

In the previous section we learned that language most likely evolved due to natural selection, went through several intermediate forms and that gestures probably played an important role during this transition. The Mirror System Hypothesis, as proposed by Michael Arbib (2012), offers an intriguing explanation for the emergence of language while meeting all these criteria. His main argument is that natural selection shaped the human body and brain, leading to the ''language-ready'' early ''Homo sapiens'' about 100,000 – 200,000 years ago. Beginning with this period, humans were able to use first protolanguages. The development of modern languages took place in the following 50,000 – 100,000 years via ''cultural evolution''. Arbib (2012) formulates three key hypotheses:

'''Hypothesis 1'''. ''There is no innate Universal Grammar'': Arbib (2012), distancing himself from Chomsky’s claim of a genetically coded Universal Grammar, argues that the human brain adapted via natural selection for protolanguage rather than modern languages. The genome of humans provides the readiness to learn and create languages, but does not encode any syntactic knowledge.

'''Hypothesis 2'''. ''Language-readiness is multimodal'': Sign language is in no way inferior to spoken language. Even facial expressions carry lots of information during conversation, suggesting a close link between speech and gestures. Therefore, it is assumed that different modalities - speech and gesture - evolved together, eventually providing language-readiness.

'''Hypothesis 3'''. ''The Mirror System Hypothesis'': The mechanism responsible for the rise of language evolved atop the mirror neuron system for grasping, thus providing the evolutionary basis for ''language parity'' (denoting that an utterance or gesture has the same meaning for both communication partners).

Language had to pass through several stages in evolution in order to gain the necessary properties to be considered either as protolanguage or as a modern language. Table 1 summarizes these crucial stages postulated by the Mirror Neuron Hypothesis (Arbib, 2012), while the following section will present them more detailed.

=== &lt;u&gt;Crucial stages in language evolution&lt;/u&gt; ===

As briefly mentioned above, the existence of a '''mirror system for grasping''' is the starting point of language evolution as postulated by Arbib (2012). It is inherent in monkeys and apes as well as humans. In the human brain, it can be located in Broca’s area (among other regions). While not being originally “intended” for communication, the mirror system provides the evolutionary basis for the evolution of language: By being able to both perform and recognize an action, it permits the existence of an extremely important property, i.e., language-parity. Language parity means that the signal (i.e., a gesture or an utterance) means the same for both the sender and perceiver when communicating. It is important to note that the presence of a mirror system on its own is not sufficient for the emergence as language, as proven by monkeys and apes. The human mirror system expanded its role due to natural selection shaping the brain.

One of these expansions is the ability for imitation. Both apes and humans are able to observe the behavior of other individuals and copy it. In simple tasks, like grasping and peeling a banana, this is no big deal. Trying to acquire a complex action plan with several subtasks, on the other hand, is much harder. Using long periods of observations and many trial and error efforts, apes can still manage to obtain the plan. This is the ability for '''simple imitation'''. Humans usually don’t have problems to imitate even complex behavior after a short time of monitoring the action and after only few trials. They are capable of '''complex imitation''' by having the capacity for ''complex action analysis''. When witnessing novel, complex behavior, we understand the initiator’s intentions, maybe even recognizing already familiar sub-actions. By reproducing the already known actions and practicing the novel ones, we can increase our skill and imitate the overall act in a rather short time. This ability, of course, bears a big adaptive value by enabling humans to share important skills within the community. It seems that the connectivity of the mirror system with various other regions in the human brain expanded vastly in comparison to monkeys and apes, since complex imitations require cognitive skills like joint attention that draw heavily upon distributed systems of the brain.

With the capacity for complex imitation comes the capacity for pantomime, i.e., being able “''to use reduced forms of actions to convey aspects of other actions, objects, emotions, or feelings – the artless sketching of an action to indicate either the action itself or something associated with it''” (Arbib, 2012). For example, by miming the act of eating something, I can express that I am very hungry without actually eating or even having food in my hands. The obvious advantage of pantomime is that the object or situation it references does not need to be present, enabling a community to communicate about a range of topics without actually witnessing the specific situations. Unfortunately, pantomime often proves to be very ambiguous. For example, moving your hands wavelike could suggest many things, like “water”, “snake”, “swimming” etc. This limiting downside of pantomime may have led to the development and use of a more abstract and open repertoire of signs, possessing very specific connotations, i.e., '''protosign'''.

Protosign, being the manual component of protolanguage, is claimed to provide the basis for '''protospeech''' (i.e., the vocal component of protolanguage). It is important to note that protosign did not achieve the state of a full language before protospeech first emerged. Both modalities, according to Arbib (2012), rather evolved together in an ''expanding spiral'': Once manual gestures gained advances, vocal gestures profited from them (and vice versa). Both components combined formed an analytic '''protolanguage''' based on holophrases, providing the “language-ready brain” of the first ''Homo sapiens''.

At this point, the biological evolution ends and the cultural evolution of language takes over, for it appears rather unlikely to presume natural selection to be the responsible mechanism for the huge range of different languages today. For instance, why should the German language bear a greater adaptive value in response to environmental pressures in Germany than the French language in Germany? Arbib (2012) supposes ''fractionation'' to be one of the responsible factors for the cultural evolution of language. He provides the following simplified example: A tribe using protolanguage may have had two holophrases concerning “fire”, with one syllable in each word coincidentally being the same, e.g., “reboofalik” meaning “the fire burns” and “falikiwert” meaning “the fire cooks meat” (hypothetical examples). Therefore, the tribe may agree (probably implicitly) that “falik” denotes “fire”. The community eventually regularizes the term “reboo” for “burn” and “iwert” for “cooks meat”. Because “falik” was created rather arbitrary, the placement of “falik” in the term to denote “burn” differs from its placement to denote “cooks meat”. There needs to be some kind of convention about the term’s construction in order to maintain the meaning, especially when wanting to add new protowords. That is why the tribe may settle on “reboo falik” and “iwert falik”, thus creating a first syntactic rule. In this manner – but actually of course in much more complex sequences – a '''modern language''' will eventually be established gradually.


== '''Summary''' ==

This chapter dealt with the evolution of language, a research topic with a vast array of different theories and very few “hard facts”, due to serious issues like the lack of a definition of language and - more importantly - the lack of direct empirical evidence. Nonetheless, there are some of aspects of language evolution with relatively good support within the scientific community. Three of those have been presented in this chapter. Firstly, most researchers agree about natural selection being the driving force behind the emergence of language, instead of assuming it to be a mere epiphenomenon of the brain’s increase in size. Patel (2008) provides a non-exhaustive, but rather comprehensive list with evidence for this claim. Secondly, language certainly went though several intermediate forms – amongst others, most likely a protolanguage made up of holophrases – before becoming a modern, sophisticated language. At last, given the multimodality of language, many researchers suppose that the starting point of language either were gestures or that both speech and gestures evolved altogether.  

The Mirror System Hypothesis as proposed by Arbib (2012) integrates all these aspects, thus providing an intriguing, modern approach on language evolution. Arbib (2012) assumes that the mirror system for grasping served as “scaffolding” for this process by offering the property of language parity. During a phase of biological evolution (natural selection) the mechanisms responsible for the transition of language evolved atop the mirror system and went through several different stages of evolution, according to this model. With the emergence of protolanguage, the brain of the early Homo sapiens can be seen as “language ready”, possessing all necessary properties to develop a more sophisticated, i.e., modern language. The vast array of different languages emerged as a result of cultural evolution of protolanguages. Despite taking into account the most recent research, it must however not be forgotten that the Mirror System Hypothesis still is exactly that: an unproven hypothesis like each and every take on language evolution that has been forwarded up until now.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==
This chapter will give an overview of several aspects in sign language. Besides introducing basic facts concerning the structure and production of sign language, this section provides information about the neurolinguistic bases of sign language, i.e., how sign language is processed and represented in the brain. Lastly, the acquisition and development of sign language especially in deaf children will be explained.

Human language can be expressed in two ways (besides written language), i.e., in the auditory-vocal modality of spoken language or in the visual-gestural modality of sign language. Signs are gestures produced by hands and arms, in the space in front of the torso. They are perceived by the visual system (Corina &amp; Knapp, 2008; Meier, 2012). However, despite the fact that sign language is expressed in so obviously different ways than spoken language, it is necessary to stress that sign languages are also natural languages that share many biological, cognitive and linguistic characteristics with spoken language. Strong support for this comes from the observation that sign language is comparable in grammatical complexity to spoken language (Corina &amp; Knapp, 2008).  

Before sign language will be explained in more detail, it is important to clarify some common misconceptions. First, deaf people are not automatically mute. Second, sign language is different from other gestural actions like, e.g., imitative movements. Also, the movements that make up sign language are processed in different ways than for example pantomime (Corina &amp; Knapp, 2008). Finally, it should be clear that there is not only one sign language but many different sign language all over the world, which can differ for example in their syntactic structure (Brooks &amp; Kempe, 2012).

== Structure and processing of sign language ==
Sign and spoken language are produced by different articulators. Signs are produced by hands and arms – i.e., by manual articulators – whereas speech production includes the mouth and tongue – i.e., an oral articulator. Further, they are perceived by different sensory organs. Signs are visually registered and spoken language is entirely perceived by the auditory system. In order to be able to perceive sign language, it is necessary to shift one’s attention and one’s gaze to the communication partner, whereas in spoken language it suffices to hear without seeing the person who is speaking.

The iconicity and arbitrariness of the communicative symbols also differ between signed and spoken language. It turned out that the manual gestures of sign language are more iconic in nature, which means that it is (more often) possible to infer their meaning from their morphology as is nicely demonstrated for the british sign representing the word camera. Many signs, thus, are non-arbitrary while there are fewer opportunities for imagistic representation in spoken language. Most spoken word forms are arbitrary, as their meaning is not related to the acoustic form of the spoken word. Nevertheless, arbitrary signs are also existent in sign language, as they are needed to express abstract, complex, and non-imageable concepts in communication (Meier, 2012). 

There are five elements which are distinctive features in meaning that represent the basic characteristics of sign language, subsumed under the acronym “HOLME”: '''''H'''and shape, '''O'''rientation, '''L'''ocation, '''M'''ovement,'' and ''(facial) '''E'''xpression''. Hand shape is composed of the movement of the forearm and the fingers. Orientation is related to the orientation of the palm, while location refers to the space of articulation – i.e., where in front of the torso the sign is produced. These elements help to create different signs and assist to distinguish them from each other. Thus, orientation and location can be treated as ''phonems'' because they are equivalent in function compared to the phonemes of spoken language (Brooks &amp; Kempe, 2012). When hand shape and movement are also added than they are assumed to constitute the phonology (see also below). The sign language analog of ''prosody'' in spoken language is represented by facial expressions that are produced in combination with the location of manual gestures in front of the body. 

''Morphology'' is the study of shape and forms of language. In linguistic it describes the inner structure of words including inflection and derivation for example. The HOLME elements can be described as a combinational system which represents the morphology of sign language. Interestingly, such complex combinations allow a simultaneous expression of multiple aspects of sign language, such that hand shape and orientation together can express a noun for example. In contrast to this, words of spoken language are mainly produced one after another – i.e., sequentially. Communication in sign language often has a “topic than comment”-structure, which means that background information (the topic) is given first, which is then followed by the main clause (the comment). For example, the spoken sentence [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Sign_Language_grammar &quot;I like lamb for meat.&quot;] would be sigend as “Meat, I like lamb.”, as the topic of the sentence (i.e., ‘meat’) is stated first. The word order in the main clause, called syntax, varies in different sign languages. American Sign Language (ASL) uses a ''subject – verb – object'' word order (as in the example given in the previous sentence), whereas British Sign Language (BSL) uses an ''object – subject – verb'' structure (Brooks &amp; Kempe, 2012). In BSL, the previous example, thus, would be signed as “Meat, lamb I like.”


== Representation in the brain ==
In general, neurocognitive research converges to suggest that signed and spoken language to a large degree use the same brain regions and may be seen as functionally equivalent in terms of their neurobiological bases (Campbell, MacSweeney, &amp; Walters, 2007). The hemispheric dominance in terms of language production and processing in deaf people is comparable to that of hearing people (Corina &amp; Spotswood, 2012). In contrast to this, it is observed that environmental factors – e.g., the nature of language input during development or the age of acquisition of sign language – have an impact on brain development which is reflected in individual differences for example in brain activation (Campbell, MacSweeney, &amp; Walters, 2007; Homan, Criswell, Wada, &amp; Ross, 1982).

Research on the brain bases of sign language is mainly performed by comparing and contrasting sign language to spoken language. Case studies of brain-lesioned patients helped to get information about the location and involvement of relevant brain regions in production and comprehension of sign language. However, due to some of the limitations of these approaches,  researchers in the field are cautious as it may not (yet) be possible to detect all regions that are involved (Campbell, MacSweeney, &amp; Walters, 2007). The intention of this section will be to give an overview over those brain regions that are known to be critical and important for the performance and processing of sign language. 


=== The role of the left hemisphere ===
The left hemisphere is specialized for linguistic processing of both signed and spoken language. The organization of this language-dominant part of the brain follows an anterior-posterior dichotomy for language production and comprehension. Analogous to spoken language, the production of sign language was associated with left inferior frontal cortex, i.e., Broca’s area, whereas comprehension is attributed to left posterior-temporal cortex, i.e., the classical receptive language area of Wernicke. This was demonstrated in a seminal study by Bavelier et al. (1998) who compared the cerebral organization in hearing and deaf people during sentence processing in English and ASL. Thus, the neural organization of sign language can be seen as comparable to the organization of spoken language in the brain. 

Stimulation or damage of Broca’s area has a global effect on the motor output, which means that errors involving the motor execution of signs are caused. These errors are characterized by reduced hand shapes or non-specific movements for example. This disturbance of sign production – including syntactic processing – is called ''sign paraphasia'' (Corina &amp; Spotswood, 2012).  Sign paraphasia can also include formational and semantic errors, like correct location but wrong movement of the hand. These deficits, however, can be observed when the TMS is used to interfere with neural processing in the supra-marginal gyrus (SMG). A damage in this area results in an incorrect selection of linguistic components (Corina &amp; Spotswood, 2012). ''Sign aphasia'' describes deficits in comprehension associated with lesions in Wernicke’s area. See also Chapter [[Neurocognition_of_Language/Acquired_Disorders_of_Speech_and_Language|Acquired Disorders of Speech and Language]] for a more general treatment of aphasic syndromes. 


{{TextBox|'''Sign paraphasia''' In sign language users, paraphasias are a typical aspect of acquired language dysfunction after brain damage. Sign language paraphasias involve the substitution of an unintended element in sign production, for example producing a word at the correct location of the hand but using a wrong movement or, as in the image below, producing the correct sign but at an incorrect location, thereby changing its meaning (e.g., from mother to father).}}


Further areas of the left hemisphere were identified as being involved in sign language production, that were shown to be more strongly activated during sign as compared to spoken language production. The supra-marginal gyrus (SMG), whose impairment can cause specific types of sign paraphasia as outlined above, was shown to be involved in phonological processing (Emmorey, Mehta, &amp; Grabowski, 2007). Phonology describes the smallest units of a word or a sign, called phonems. According to this a sign can be devided into hand shape, orientation of the palm, location and movement – i.e., the first four elements of HOLME that are assumed to constitute the phonology of a sign language (see also above). The superior parietal lobule (SPL) is specifically involved in monitoring the motoric output. Emmorey, Mehta and Grabowski (2007) suggest due to their database of patients with different neurological impairments of sign that “[…] proprioceptive monitoring may play a more important role in sign production because visual monitoring of signing [is different to the] auditory monitoring of speech […]” (Emmorey, Mehta, &amp; Grabowski, 2007, p.206). Speech output can be monitored by listening to the own voice, while when producing signs the perception needs to be focused on hand posture or movement for example. So the SPL – responsible for visual perception and visual attention – is in general more involved in sign language due to proprioceptive monitoring (Campbell et al., 2007; Corina &amp; Spotswood, 2012; Emmorey, Mehta, &amp; Grabowski, 2007). 


=== The role of the right hemisphere ===
The right hemisphere is known to be specialized for visual-spatial processing, both during visual perception and when processing spatial relationships in spoken language as well as sign language. Case studies of patients with acquired brain lesions who use sign language showed that damage in the right hemisphere causes no problems in linguistic processing (Campbell et al., 2007; Hickok et al., 1999). Lesions in this hemisphere caused visual-spatial deficits, but no language-specific deficits such as sign language aphasia or paraphasia (Campbell et al., 2007; Corina &amp; Spotswood, 2012). Nevertheless, there is some support for the assumption that in sign language, right brain regions are involved to a greater extent than in spoken language. The right hemisphere is dominant for detecting and interpreting visual movement, which is a principal component of  processing signed language. The right hemisphere is also specialized for discriminating shape, size, or position of visual objects. Furthermore, the right hemisphere is dominant in social communication. Superior temporal regions are sensitive to facial information which can play an important role in sign production and comprehension. Neuroimaging studies show that posteriorly located parietal and temporal regions of the right hemisphere play a special role in mediating sign language (Newman, Bavelier, Corina, Jezzard, &amp; Neville, 2002). The right hemisphere also seems to be involved when visual object components and space relations need to be translated into body-centered representations, another cognitive demand that is taxed during the  production and  processing of signed language.

In sum, neuropsychological and functional brain imaging studies of sign language suggest that classical language areas like Broca’s and Wernicke’s areas are involved in comparable ways to spoken language, when signers produce or comprehend language. Even if the left and right hemispheres have mainly different functions in each case, the available activation studies do not allow for a clear separation. For example, syntactic processing can also involve the right hemisphere in sign language (Campbell et al., 2007; Corina &amp; Spotswood, 2012). In addition, a number of brain systems related to visual-spatial processing, particularly in the right hemisphere, is additionally evoked when processing signed language (Bavelier et al., 1998). Recent research suggests that the degree of involvement of these right hemispheric system depends on the proficiency obtained in sign language usage, rather than on the age of acquisition of sign language (Campbell et al., 2007; Corina &amp; Spotswood, 2012). “Importantly, activation in right hemisphere temporalparietal regions was specific to BSL and was not observed in hearing non-signers watching audiovisual English translations of the same sentences” (Corina &amp; Spotswood, 2012, p.749). In comparison it can be said that sign language and spoken language show – modality-independent – neural activity in left inferior frontal gyrus and left temporal regions (Corina &amp; Spotswood, 2012; Emmorey et al., 2007). As mentioned before, some parts of the visual cortex are activated more in sign language, whereas the auditory cortex in the superior temporal lobe is more activated in spoken language and less active in sign language. 

A final important result that shall be mentioned here pertains to the neuroplasticity underlying the acquisition of sign language. Most specifically, MacSweeney, Campbell, Woll, Giampietro, David, and McGuire (2004) “[…] found greater activation in Deaf than hearing signers during BSL perception in regions traditionally considered to be responsible for auditory processing.” (MacSweeney et al., 2004, p. 1615). This suggests functional plasticity within regions of the auditory system, so that auditory regions can be used to process linguistic input from other (here: visual) modalities if deprived from auditory input (Campbell et al., 2007). 

=== Digression: Iconicity ===
Examinations of sign-aphasic patients showed that they are often unable to produce iconic signs (e.g., “toothbrush”), but are nevertheless able to produce the action which is associated with the respective word as a pantomimed gesture (i.e., “how to brush teeth”). These findings are of particular interest as they indicate that despite their superficial resemblance, there exists a  neurobiologically grounded dissociation between sign language and gestures (Campbell et al., 2007). The brains of deaf signers, thus, differentiate linguistic from non-linguistic actions. It was suggested that signs may rely more on top-down processing, while non-linguistic gestures might be more bottom-up (to read more about this issue: Corina &amp; Knapp, 2008).


== Acquisition and development of sign language ==
In general, deaf children of deaf or hearing parents pass through the early stages of language acquisition in comparable ways to that of hearing children, i.e., the cognitive development of deaf children is comparable to that of hearing children. Deaf babies show manual babble and produce also errors in sign articulation that are qualitatively comparable to the errors that hearing infants make in speech production (Lederberg, Schick, &amp; Spencer, 2013). Interestingly, a study about acquisition of sign language and motor development of 11 infants of deaf parents showed that deaf infants can produce signs earlier – about 2-3 month – than hearing infants produce words (Bonvillian, Orlansky, &amp; Novack, 1983). This led to the assumption that basic motor preconditions for sign production are acquired earlier in development than those needed to speak.

The acquisition of sign language depends on the age of exposure. Thus, the age at which children are first exposed to sign language can be relevant for further cognitive development. For example, age of first exposure can affect the fluency in production and comprehension of sign language. Late learners cannot produce signs as fluently as native or early learners. The effect of late exposure influences all structural levels, like prosody, morphology, or syntax, in production and comprehension. As outlined elsewhere in this Wikibook in more detail ([[Neurocognition_of_Language/Language_Development|Language Development]]), it is important to acquire a first language profoundly and early in development so that negative consequences for following stages of language learning can be prevented. This applies to sign language in the same way as to spoken language. Research found out that – just as for the development of spoken language – sign language has to be available from the environment and must be acquired in a critical period to develop the involved neural systems and the plasticity which is needed to develop ordinarily. Deficits in the ability for production and comprehension of signs can also have effects in language-related areas like, for example, causing delays in the development of ''Theory of Mind (ToM)'' or ''literacy'' (Lederberg, Schick, &amp; Spencer, 2013). Further consequences of late-signing, like greater impulsivity, less attention control or fewer working memory capacities as well as disturbances in executive functions are reported (Brook &amp; Kempe, 2012). Deaf people often show less age-appropriate skills than hearing people and the fact that most deaf children do not have representations of the (spoken) phonology of (printed) words makes reading acquisition more difficult for them (Lederberg, Schick, &amp; Spencer, 2013).


{{TextBox|'''Theory of Mind''' describes the ability to mentally take over someone else’s perspective to understand his/her point of view or feelings. This skill is seen as very important in terms of social behavior and contact with surroundings.

As mentioned before, the learning environment of the child influences its development eminently. Deaf children with deaf parents typically grow up with sign language in a deaf community. They normally acquire sign language through natural interactive experiences and are supported by their surroundings. Deaf children of hearing parents usually learn sign language due to early interventions or in special school classes. In general, efforts are taken to offer early opportunities so that deaf children can learn sign language as their first language. Bilingualism is also promoted, which means that spoken language is acquired as a second language for example. However, only a small part of deaf or hard-hearing children is successful in acquiring spoken language. One option to support deaf or hard-of-hearing children in their acquisition and development of language could be a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochlear_implant ''Cochlea Implant''], that increases the ability of deaf children to perceive sounds and thus also to acquire spoken language. Cochlear implants are implanted into the cochlea and have the capability of translating auditory signals into electronic ones that are transmitted to the auditory nerve. Children seem to benefit from early implantation even if the outcome – with respect to hearing quality and speech production – is not comparable to that of hearing children (Brooks &amp; Kempe, 2012; Lederberg, Schick, &amp; Spencer, 2013). 

In general, it can be said that deaf and hearing children do not in principle differ in their (cognitive) development, especially in relation to language production and processing. However, the development of deaf children with hearing parents differs from the development of deaf children with deaf parents. The development of deaf children with hearing parents, in contrast, can be much more critical. Due to their specific developmental environment, these children are often delayed in the development of language as the critical language input is lacking during the sensitive periods for language (Lederberg, Schick, &amp; Spencer, 2013). Also, the sign language-proficiency of hearing parents has a large impact on the development of sign language in their deaf children. A lack of fluency, which is more frequent in hearing parents than in deaf parents of deaf children, can affect the acquisition and following development negatively (e.g., Meronen &amp; Ahonen, 2008). As expected given the findings discussed above, deaf children with hearing parents often show delays in other cognitive abilities such as ToM. This delay may be related to the input from their parents, which is usually less multifaceted (Lederberg, Schick, &amp; Spencer, 2013).

Even if there is no linguistic input, deaf infants seem to be motivated to communicate just like any other child. Several surveys indicate that children possess the ability to create a communication system also when linguistic input is not available. Deaf children, isolated from an approved sign language, do not have the possibility to imitate or reproduce approved signs but they do communicate with their environment, e.g., with their parents, through manual gestures. They create a so called ''home sign'', i.e., a system of gestures that have special meanings – for example pointing may mean to pick something up – or that are associated with a specific object. It is observed that across culture, home sign systems have similarities like the consistency in construction of grammatical categories of signs. Thus, the emergence of home sign supports the idea that the structure of sign languages can emerge spontaneously. To become an accepted and used sign language (e.g., in cultures that have no established sign language system yet), it is necessary that the next generation adopts the new communication system and also modifies it to become more systematic (Brooks &amp; Kempe, 2012).


== Summary ==
In conclusion, communication can occur in two natural ways, with the obvious difference between those systems being the modality of input and output. In the auditory-oral modality, spoken language includes the production and perceptual processing of speech sounds, whereas sign language uses manual gestures and visual attention to communicate. Sign languages are – just as spoken languages – natural languages that are used to communicate between persons. Sign languages in many ways have the same quality and linguistic complexity as have spoken languages and, besides this, are also by and large represented in the same brain areas. Also in sign language, the left hemisphere seems to be the dominant neural basis of language. The right hemisphere is more involved in viso-spatial processing, which is why this hemisphere plays a more important role in sign language. 

In general, deaf babies are capable of learning sign language much in the same way as hearing infants learn to speak. Deaf children show similar cognitive development when they acquire sign language early in life. However, the environment and linguistic input from the parents have a huge impact on the development and acquisition of sign language in childhood, which is particularly critical in deaf children of hearing parents who often cannot immediately provide the necessary language input during the critical periods of language acquisition in early life. Late exposure to sign language or exposure to lower quality language input can cause enormous delays and lasting deficits in linguistic and general cognitive development of deaf children.

In sum, there is a lot of research to bring up more information about sign language and language processing in deaf people. Nevertheless the findings are not exhaustive yet – so the neural system and brain activity in deaf signers compared to hearing people needs to be explored further.

      <text xml:space="preserve">//This is a function to calculate the average of a set of numbers (such as test scores) in C++.

//If we have a set of N test scores x0, x1, x2, ..., xN-1, then the

==New Trainzer's note==
{{TL|TRS2004}} and TRS2006 shared much the same games graphical GUI screens, giving some the impression there were few advances between the release of TRS2004-SP4 and TRS2006-SP1. Taking the time to peruse the list of new feature feature improvements listed below will soon disabuse the reader of that notion. While the displayed graphics engines may well have appeared identical, TRS2006 in operation and operation features clearly eclipsed its best selling ancestor when it came to allowing longer routes, session scripting, and interactivity between software and user. The content manager ({{TL|CMP}}) and filters, user keyword searching make the release a very different and more capable offering.

It must be noted that many of the features we take today as Trainz 'Look, See, and Feel' were standards introduced or which have been modified from features introduced in TRS2006. The release, it must be understood spawned a whole family of individual game releases using the same Game Code Software&amp;mdash;differing only in the Content software bundled into such releases such as Trainz: The Complete Collection, Trainz Driver, Trainz Classics (TC1 through TC3) and TRS2007 and TRS2008 as well as various regional releases.

==TRS2006==
Trainz Railroad Simulator 2006 (TRS2006) set new standards of realism and immersion in operating a virtual railroad.
TRS2006 shipped with fully realized routes that include a wide range of activities users could immediately enjoy. Run long haul freight services, highspeed passenger runs or challenging yard operations as you serviced a huge variety of interactive stations and industries.

TRS2006 significantly enhanced the driving experience with improvements to the physics engine, adding to the challenge of keeping your train performing efficiently.

With thousands of items available for free on Auran’s Download Station including hundreds of locomotives and extra routes, TRS2006 included a new asset management utility, making it easier for users to access and organize their content.

The Trainz tools and rules system were also greatly improved to give you more flexibility than ever before in creating your own railroad experience.

==New Features from TRS2004==
===Physics update===
Major additions to the physics engine include wheelslip and coupler
breakage. Combined with several other modifications, these add to the
realism and provide a more challenging experience for the virtual driver.
Physics can be customized to affect all locos or only user defined classes of
loco. Physics can even be set to change based upon triggers placed in a
map.

'''Coupler Breakage'''

Couplers can break when too much force is applied when accelerating
(expansion); or when too much braking is applied (compression).
Careful use of the throttle and brakes is needed to prevent couplers
from breaking. Use of the Coupler Breakage HUD can allow drivers to
monitor coupler forces and take the necessary steps to prevent it from
occurring.

'''Wheelslip'''

Wheelslip occurs when too much power is applied and the train’s
driving wheels lose traction. This typically occurs on steep gradients
and in wet conditions. Gentle use of the throttle in combination with
sanding of the driving wheels is required in these difficult situations.

===iTrainz in-game Messaging===
[[iTrainz]] allows for messaging between players while playing routes with the
iTrainz Chat Rule enabled. Simply add users to your Friends list and you’ll be
informed when they are online. Once the ONLINE CHAT Rule has been
added to a session, a player can open the Contact List window and add as
many contacts as they wish.

'''iTrainz Chat feature list:'''
* List filtering – View everyone that you’ve added to your contact list or just the contacts on your “Friends List”.
* Friends List – add your buddies to your personal list.
* Block List – add contacts to this list to prevent them from contacting you.
* Multiple Windows - Supports multiple windows allowing you to speak with as many people as you want at the same time.
* Broadcast message - Send the same message to everyone in your contact list that is online.

===iPortal (Player to player gameplay)===
An iPortal is a variation on the existing portal, except instead of sending a
train within a single map, the iPortal allows players to send trains from one
iPortal enabled map to another player’s map, even if the receiving player is
offline! An iPortal is placed into a map in surveyor and it’s settings entered
through a dialog box.

'''iPortal feature list'''

* Send trains from one player to another.
* Send a train from one map to another map on the same computer.
* Trains can be sent to offline players.
* Multiple trains can be sent to the same iPortal.
* IPortal settings can be changed without restarting the session in order to send to multiple players from within the same session.

===Content Manager Plus===
[[Content Manager|Content Manager Plus]] combines the abilities of several tools into one,
making it easier for users to access and organize their content. Users now
have the ability to browse Auran’s extensive download station of over 45,000
assets without needing to be online.

*'''Extensive Search functionality''' - Powerful new abilities allow users to filter through a user’s content to create custom search filters which can then be used in Surveyor.
*'''Download New Content''' - Select the items you want from the list of content on the Download Station, then drag and drop them in to the Download Helper panel. Downloads can be paused and resumed or aborted at any time.
*'''Keywords''' - Add a keyword to one or more pieces of content and then use that same Keyword in Surveyor to locate them.
*'''Archive Maker''' - Backup your Custom or Downloaded content to archives to free up hard drive space.
*'''Upload Created Content''' - Budding content creators can use CMP to upload their content to the Download Station. Combined with the checking abilities of CMP this allows for more error-free content to be available to every TRS2006 user.
*'''Asset Details''' - View an assets detail to learn more about it. This can even be done (in a limited fashion) before you’ve download the content.
*'''User Rating''' - Give content a rating between 1 and 5 stars. These ratings can then become part of any searches.
*'''Quick View''' - View Trains in Railyard, or Routes and Sessions in Surveyor quicker through this one click process.

===Content Creator Plus===
A new tool designed to help content creators create error-free content is included with TRS2006. Using the tool, the creator is able to generate the necessary config files so that their content is able to be uploaded to the Download Station for other people to access and play with.
*'''Upgrade Content from previous Trainz products''' -  CCP assists users in upgrading config files from previous versions of Trainz to utilize the new features in TRS2006.
*'''Extensive Error Reporting''' - CCP provides extensive reports of on any issues or errors that it finds with any content.
*'''3D model previewer''' - CCP contains a rudimentary 3D Object preview window where models can be previewed.

===Paintshed===
Paintshed, the easy-to-use train re-skinning tool, has been incorporated into CMP. A user can now clone one of the Paintshed Templates, make their own creations and it will be instantly added to the game for them to use. Paintshed templates include both Loco and Wagons with multiple paint
patterns for each. Text and Logos can be placed anywhere.

===Surveyor Search Filter===
Powerful new search abilities in Surveyor expand the ways in way a user is
able to locate content, search filters include:
*'''Geographical Region''' - Over 200 countries are included
*'''Author''' – sort by name or User ID
*'''Era''' – sort by a content’s Era
*'''Keyword''' – sort by the built in, or user assigned keywords
*'''Category''' – All assets are categorized in a logical manner
*'''Save Filter Support''' – User created filters can be saved for later use

===Passenger Observation===
The in-game view camera can now be placed within passenger cars, giving
the user the experience of riding along a train as a passenger.

===User Interface Enhancements===
Several areas of the games user interface were improved upon to add
functionality and to increase the amount of information being displayed.
*'''Loading Screens''' – Loading screens now give users information about the many features of the product along with handy hints and tips.
*'''Driver Menu Improvements''' – The Driver Session and Surveyor selection screens have been
redesigned allowing for easier navigation of installed routes and sessions. Scenarios have been incorporated into the Driver Menu rather than having a separate screen.
*'''Mini-Map Functionality''' – New functionality includes the ability to give trains orders as well as query industry and train information. This provides the player with the ability to play a session from within the mini-map.

===Backdrops Assets===
Backdrops are an asset that can be placed on a map they are always rendered regardless of the view distance settings. This enables builders to set up landscaped horizons such as mountains and skyscrapers quicker and with less impact to the frame-rate.

===Cab Control Hud===
Replicating elements from the popular RailDriver controller, the Cab Control HUD is an on-screen interface which allows users to control a train via the use of levers rather than the keyboard.

===Tutorials===
A tutorial system designed towards helping new users understand how to
play the game has been incorporated. A player can learn to drive diesel and
steam trains, assign commodities to wagons, transfer drivers between trains,
issue orders to drivers, couple and decouple wagons and much more.

===Improved Session Making Support===
Several new rules were added for session makers to use including many rules designed to allow session makers to make more intuitive sessions with tighter control over player interactions. Some of the more useful rules included are:
*'''Set Junctions Rule''' – this allows you to set the state of one or more junctions
*'''Coupler Breakage HUD''' – This rule allows users to add on screen display representing the forces applied to the Couplers. This is used in conjunction with the new Physics Rules.
*'''Enable / Disable HUD Icons''' – Deactivates on screen display functionality to streamline the functionality within sessions.
*'''Online Chat''' – This is the new in-game Messaging functionality.
*'''Set Camera / Wait for Camera View''' – Add more in game cinematic camera work to a session and have rules triggered by those camera changes.
*'''Trigger Check''' – A more feature laden version of the Trigger Rule from TR2004, this allows for multiple triggers and train filtering.
*'''Vehicle Physics''' – Adjust the physics of all trains. Coupler strength, wheel slip and Cabin sway parameters can be adjusted globally, or limited to specific to train types.
*'''Other rules provide the following abilities:'''
** Couple
** Decouple
** Couple to
** Decouple From
** Monitor junctions

*'''Expanded Script Support''' - A large number of additions have been implemented that allows scripters to make deeper and more interesting sessions and to include more custom content such as different track sounds and images for interactive industries.

===Animated Turnout Support===
TRS2006 provides support for animated turnouts, giving track work a more realistic appearance. Examples are included in the game.

===TrackIR Support===
TRS2006 supports NaturalPoint’s third party device: TrackIR Pro3. Move your head and your view responds independently of the mouse.

===Expanded Schedule Functionality===
Trains can be given schedules with set tasks. These tasks include abilities such as coupling and de-coupling, with the result being that trains now have the ability to perform even more realistic operations.

===Additional Features / Functionality Additions:===
* Editable Track Sounds
* Fixed Track additional Editing capabilities
* Camera Viewing Height increased
* Scalable Junction Arrows
* Settable Trigger Radius Size
* Relative Height Readouts in Surveyor 
* Mass Importing of Content (including from TRS2004)
* Mini-map Invisible Track Support

==Included Routes==

*'''USA - Marias Pass Approach''' – Amtrak ''Empire Builder'' and BNSF freight operations between Shelby and Cutbank. Numerous industries make for many activities to keep drivers busy on the slopes of the famous Marias Pass. The full Marias Pass route is available from http://www.hp-trainz.de/, for a price. The full version travels the entire pass from Shelby to Whitefish via the pass itself, as well as the Kalispell Branchline. Locomotives include SD40-2s (in BNSF and BN colors), F40PHs (in Amtrak Phase IV and, quite bizarrely, Pacific Surfliner, a paint scheme never worn by the F40PH), and GP38-2s owned by the Columbia Falls Aluminum Company as switcher locomotives for their aluminum plant near Whitefish. Locomotives from the DLS and payware sources like Jointed Raill and RRMods can provide for a much, much more realistic experience. Rolling stock from around the DLS and web complete your experience.

*'''UK – Hawes Junction''' – a branch line off the Settle-Carlisle route that runs through some picturesque Yorkshire landscape. A range of era’s are modeled with activities that include steam and modern diesel. The full version is available in Trainz Classics 3 and as a TS2009/2010/12 expansion pack. Check out http://www.rail-sim.co.uk/ for more of this creator’s content. This demo version includes three locomotives: the LMS 4F 0-6-0, the LNER A3 Pacific, and the BR Class 37, plus a smattering of wagons and BR Mark 1 coaches with (not so detailed) interiors. The full version adds tank engines, mixed traffic engines, smaller and larger diesels, and the full route from Settle to Carlisle (including Skipton so you'll have a legitimate terminal).

*'''Canada – Toronto Yards''' – a shunter’s dream in this historical recreation of the extensive CN/CP yards in Toronto in the late 1950’s.

The time period allows both diesel and steam locomotives to ply the rails and makes for some intensive activities. Features both the ''Canadian'' and ''Super Continental'' passenger trains, plus Budd RDCs, plenty of box cars, F and E-Units, Geeps, Alco and GE switchers, and the CN U2g 4-8-4 Northern. http://www.trha.ca

*'''Australia – Wadalbavale to Karrah Bay''' – this north NSW “impressions” route goes through some typical Australian landscape.

Set in the late 1960s-early/mid 1970s, the typical activities revolve around mail and light freight deliveries as well as the famous “Silver Comet” passenger train.

*'''Germany – Dresden to Nuernberg DEMO''' – a combination of modern regional and local freight and passenger services including the famous ICE train. This is a section of the full route released by Blue Sky Interactive. http://www.bluesky-interactive.com

*'''Highland Valley Industries''' – A classic and fictional route map set in the North American Rockies used as a tutorial route and a spin-off of one of the earliest Trainz maps packing a wallop in just four map boards. An oval double-track main circles the perimeter while a single-track spur ascends in a spiral to a mountaintop 'Highland Valley' yard. Along the way various interactive industries can be serviced as shown in the demo/tutorial 5 session. Two mines, a lumber company, timberyard, steel mill and various scenery industries such as passenger stations, a railroad-ties plant and flour mill are spotted about ready for conversion to interactive, where they are not already. Converting the scenery industries to interactive versions has given many an Trainzer a fun leg up in learning surveyor skills.

*'''Australia – Razorback Classic''' – the “living railway”! Register with the Razorback website and get a constant stream of well-developed activities that track your progress. Think of it as a Driver career where your performance determines the tasks you are set! Check out more [[Razorback Railway|Razorback content here.]]

*'''Spain – Iberia Interior''' – a Spanish “impressions” route that captures the flavor of the Spanish landscape around Madrid. A wide range of passenger/freight activities utilizing 1970’s to modern day rolling stock. Check out IberTrainZ’s content here: http://www.ibertrainz.eu

*'''USA – Northbay County''' – steamers from yesteryear rumble along narrow gauge rails hauling lumber along a scenic frontier line. See more content from the Trainz Narrowgaugers here:
http://www.virtualrailroader.com/TNG.html

*'''MagLev''' – Zip along at 500 kph (350 mph) suspended above the landscape on a magnetic cushion. The train of the future!

*'''Modula City Demo''' – a light rail passenger route set in a busy fictional urban setting. This route gives you a taste of what is available from the creators at Trainzland. The full version is available in Trainz Classics 2 and is built-in to TS2009/2010. http://www.Trainzland.com

*'''USA – Tidewater''' – Utilizing iTrainz iPortal technology, send trains from one user to another using the North and South sections of the Tidewater map. Also, take on the challenge of starting the Big Boy up a steep grade and perform some shunting exercises. The full route is also built-in.

China is a cultural region, an ancient civilization, and a nation in East Asia.

Zhongguor shih wernhuah dihqu, guudaih wernmirng, Dong Yah guorjia.

----

China is situated in the east of Asia.  In narrow sense, it means the people's Republic of China, also means the Republic of China.  In broad sense, it includes the Chinese Mainland, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan.

After China's last civil war, it spitted in 2 parts:
*The People's Republic of China (PRC), commonly known as China, has control over Chinese Mainland, Hong Kong (since 1997) and Macau (since 1999).
*The Republic of China (ROC), commonly known as Taiwan, has control over the islands of Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen and Mazu.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The narrow zone between two adjacent plates is called a plate boundary.

== Three Types of Plate Boundaries ==
Let's review the three types:

{|  class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|  width=&quot;72&quot; | 
|  width=&quot;72&quot; | Constructive/convergent plate boundaries
|  width=&quot;72&quot; | Destructive/divergent plate boundaries
|  width=&quot;72&quot; | Conservative plate boundaries
|- 
| Convection currents which are
| Rising/Diverging
| Sinking/Converging
| /
|- 
| cause plates to
| Diverge from each other
| Converge/collide into each other
| Slide past each other
|- 
| and create
| Tensional force
| Compressional force
| Shear/lateral force
|}

This diagram shows the three types of boundaries (transform plate boundaries = conservative plate boundaries, but that term is not accepted in Hong Kong):

[[File:Tectonic plate boundaries.png|750px]]

== The World's Plate Boundaries ==
This diagram shows all of the earth's plate boundaries:

[[File:Tectonic plates for HKDSE Geog.svg|750px]]

You should be able to identify the boundary types by looking at the directions of the arrows, which indicate compression, tension or lateral force.

# Sediments are washed ashore on the Eurasian plate
# As the plates converge, water is squeezed out and the sediments are compacted to form sedimentary rock
# The continental crust of the Indo-Australian and Eurasian plates are equally light and neither can subduct under the other
# The sedimentary rocks are compressed to form a fold mountain range, the Himalayas.

      <text xml:space="preserve">When two oceanic crusts collide, the denser plate will be subducted under the lighter plate. The subducted plate is marked with a *.

Several new landforms are introduced here:
* '''Ocean Trenches''' are formed at destructive plate boundaries when subduction is involved. They are long, narrow and deep undersea troughs.
* '''Volcanic islands''' are formed when a submarine volcano rises above sea level.
* '''Volcanic island arcs''' are formed along a plate boundary when there is a chain of volcanic islands.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The water cycle is an important system within the hydrosphere of the earth.

== Processes ==
The major processes of the water cycle are:
* '''Evaporation''': Water on the earth's surface evaporates, becomes '''water vapour''' and rises in the air.
* '''Transpiration''': Water vapour from plants (not the earth's surface).
* '''Evapotranspiration''': Evaporation and transpiration.

* '''Condensation''': It occurs when water vapour from evapotranspiration becomes '''water droplets''' and forms clouds.
* '''Precipitation''': It occurs when clouds are too heavy to support the water droplets and the water falls down as '''rain''', snow or hail. 
** '''Interception''': Trees shield and retain raindrops as they fall.
*** ''Dripflow'': Water drips from the leaves. (less important)
*** ''Throughfall'': Water falls through the trees.(less important)
*** ''Stem flow'': Water flows down tree stems. (less important)

* '''Infiltration''': Water infiltrates into the soil.
** ''Throughflow'': Water moves horizontally in the soil after infiltration. (less important)
** '''Percolation''': Water moves down the soil and reaches the '''water table''' (i.e. '''ground water''' level)
*** ''Base flow/Ground water flow'': Water moves horizontally in the soil after percolation. (less important)
*'''Plant uptake/Absorotion''': Plants uptake water from the soil.

* '''Overland flow''': Water flows on the earth's surface.
** '''Surface run-off''': Water flows on the earth's surface, not in a channel.
** '''Channel flow''': Water flows in river channels (more below).
*** '''Channel outflow''': Water flows into the ocean.

A diagram of the whole flow can be found in AL97PIQ4.

Related concepts include '''relative humidity''' (amount of moisture in the air) and '''underground storage''' of water (amount of water stored underground).

{{Robox|theme=4|title=Precipitation vs. Rainfall}}
Rainfall is a type of precipitation in the form of liquid water droplets called '''raindrops'''. Precipitation also includes snow and hail (not included in the compulsory part). The water cycle process is always precipitation, not rainfall.
{{robox/Close}}

{{Robox|theme=4|title=Overland flow vs. Surface run-off}}
Surface run-off is a type of overland flow, which includes both run-off and channel flow. In the examination, the two terms are generally interchangeable.
{{robox/Close}}

== Important Relationships ==
Relationships between water cycle processes are important.
Infiltration and surface run-off are negatively related. This is important for later concepts as well as frequently tested in MCs and DBQs. They depend on the following factors:
* Slope gradient ↑ → Infiltration ↓, Surface run-off ↑
* Vegetation cover ↑ → Interception ↑ → Infiltration ↑, Surface run-off ↑
* Rock/soil permeability ↑ → Interception ↑ → Infiltration ↑, Surface run-off ↑

Also note that infiltration and underground storage are positively related.

Evapotranspiration and condensation are positively related.

The following factors affect evapotranspiration (CE95Q15):
* '''Temperature/Insolation''' ↑ → Evaporation ↑ → Condensation ↑
* Relative humidity → Evaporation ↑ → Condensation ↑
* '''Wind speed''' ↑ → Evaporation ↑ → Condensation ↑

Also note that evapotranspiration and relative humidity are positively related. (DSE12Q11)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Fluvial morphometry describes what rivers are shaped like. You don't have to know the word - it's just that a title was needed for this section.

== Stream order ==
The '''stream order''' is counted from streams flowing from the source.
*When two first-order streams meet, they form a second-order stream. 
*When two third-order streams meet, a fourth-order stream is formed. 
*When a second-order stream meets a third-order stream, a fourth-order stream is formed.
*etc.

== Drainage Density ==
{{Dbox|Drainage density|Total length of channels in a basin over Total area of basin}}

This may appear in map-reading questions.

== Drainage Pattern ==
A '''drainage pattern''' is the 'shape' of the river system. Usually, it suffices to be able to identify each. The formation of each pattern is included, just in case.

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are many definitions in the following chapters. You need not recite them! Simply learn what they mean, as well as the associated '''keywords'''. There are a few definitions that you ''should'' recite, and those are put in definition boxes.

There are also many processes on this page, marked with arrows like ↑ and →. You should know them flexibly apply them to MCQs and DBQs related to this topic. Remember, these processes are used throughout the whole module, so there is no excuse not to know them. You don't have to recite them like you recited the 三字經; if you are familiar with the concepts, they should become 'second nature'.

A drainage basin is, basically, a river system, including the physical land and the water inside.

These words should be recited:
* A '''drainage basin''' ('''catchment area''') is the area occupied by the river system.
* A '''watershed''' is the boundary if a drainage basin. It is determined by the ridge surrounding the system.
* A '''confluence point''' is where tributaries join together.
* Rivers flow from a point called the '''source'''.
* A '''tributary''' is a smaller stream that joins the '''main river/main stream'''.
*'''Distributaries''' where when the main river branches out.
*A '''mouth''' is where the main river flows into the ocean.


Here are the inputs, processes and outputs of a drainage basin:
{|
! Inputs
! Processes
! Outputs
|-
| Precipitation, solar energy, weathered materials
| Erosion, deposition, transportation (infiltration, channel flow)
| Channel flowing into the sea, runoff, water vapour (in evapotranspiration), sediments (CE90Q20)

      <text xml:space="preserve">This chapter discusses two things:
* Channel geometry - what the channel looks like.
* River flow - how fast a river flows and how much energy it has.

These two topics are closely related and are thus put under a single roof. 

== Definitions ==
* A '''channel''' is the path through which the river flows; it is only part of the river itself and does not include the water in the river.
* '''Velocity''' is the speed at which water flows. (m/s)
* '''Cross-sectional area''' is the area of a river's cross-section. (m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)
* '''Discharge''' is the volume of water passing a given point of a river in one second. (m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/s)
* '''Volume''' is the amount of water a river holds. (m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)
* ''Bankfull discharge'' is the maximum discharge a river can support without flooding.
* '''Capacity''' is the maximum volume of water a river can hold without flooding.

{{Robox|theme=4|title=Volume and discharge}}
Volume is the amount of water in the river. Discharge is the amount of water passing through a certain point of a river in a second.

Using a protest march as an analogy, 'volume' would be the number of people in the march, and 'discharge' the number of people passing by a certain landmark in one minute.

If you study economics, 'volume' is like a stock concept and 'discharge' a flow concept.
{{Robox/Close}}

Discharge is positively related to volume. Discharge is also positively related to velocity. The discharge is determined by factors that affect these.

== Factors Affecting Water Volume and thus Discharge ==
These are factors that affect how much water there is, the 'software' of the river channel.

River discharge is positively related to overland flow, and therefore negatively related to infiltration. 
* Slope gradient ↑ → Infiltration ↓, Surface run-off ↑ → Discharge ↑
* Vegetation cover ↑ → Interception ↑ → Infiltration ↑, Surface run-off ↑ → Discharge ↑
* '''Rock/soil permeability''' ↑ → Interception ↑ → Infiltration ↑, Surface run-off ↑ → Discharge ↓

Permeability is especially of note here. Here are just some factors that affect permeability:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Increase permeability
! Decrease permeability
|-
| 
* Well-jointed rock on the surface ('''granite''')
* '''Sand'''
| 
* Poorly-jointed rock on the surface (volcanic rocks)
*'''Clay''' or '''silt'''
* Laterite (M6)
* Trampled land (M5)
* Land covered by cement (M4)
|}

These relationships also matter:
* Drainage density ↑ → Discharge ↑
* Size of catchment area ↑ → Discharge ↑
* Stream order ↑ → Discharge ↑
The principle behind the above is that 'if there are more rivers, they can collect more.'

* Precipitation/Rainfall/Snowmelt ↑ → Discharge ↑ (take note of RH, temp., etc. relationships above)
* Evaporation ↑ → Discharge ↓ (take note of RH, temp., etc. relationships above)

== Factors Affecting Velocity and thus Discharge (Channel-Related Factors) ==
[[File:Wetted Perimeter.svg|thumb|left|The red line is the wetted perimeter.]]
These are factors that affect how fast the river flows, the 'hardware' of the river channel. It is related to the channel.

*'''Channel friction''' reduces velocity.
*The two sides of the river are '''river banks'''.
*The bottom of the river is the '''river bed'''.
*'''Wetted perimeter''' (WP) is the perimeter of the bank and bend in contact with water.
*'''Hydraulic radius''' (HR):
{{Dbox|Hydraulic radius|Cross-section area over Wetted Perimeter}}
*''Width-depth ratio'' is the ratio of the bank length to the bed length.
*A '''symmetrical river channel''' has the same bank shape on either side. If the shapes of the two banks are different, it's an '''asymmetric river channel'''.
*'''Load''' is the materials transported by the river (more below).
*'''Channel roughness''' is how rough the channel is.

The above parameters are related to discharge thus:
* WP↑ → Channel friction ↑ → Efficiency ↓ → Velocity ↓ → Discharge ↓
* HR↑ → Channel friction ↓ → Efficiency ↑ → Velocity ↑ → Discharge ↑ (this overrides the WP point!)
* Channel roughness ↑ → Channel friction ↑ → Efficiency ↓ → Velocity ↓ → Discharge ↓
* Asymmetric river channel → Channel friction ↑ → Efficiency ↓ → Velocity ↓ → Discharge ↓
* Amount of load ↑ → Internal friction ↑ → Efficiency ↓ → Velocity ↓ → Discharge ↓

== Energy ==
Only one point to be made here:
* Discharge ↑ → Energy ↑

Thus all the factors above also affect energy.

== Variation of Velocity and Energy Within a Channel ==

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Flooding''' is the condition in which the water in a river overflows.

==Hydrograph==
TODO: Need actual hydrographs

*'''Peak discharge''' is the maximum river discharge during a certain period of time.
*A hydrograph's '''rising limb''' shows the time during which discharge increases.
*A hydrograph's '''falling limb''' shows when discharge decreases.

==Factors==
All the [[HKDSE Geography/M2a/River Channels and Flow|factors]] above that affect discharge affect flooding. The greater the discharge, the greater the flood risk. In addition:
* '''Elongated drainage basin''' → Time lag ↑ → Floods ↓
* '''Circular drainage basin''' → Time lag ↓ → Floods ↑

* '''Straight river''' → Time needed for river to flow away ↑ → Floods ↓
* '''Meandering river''' → Time needed for river to flow away ↑ → Floods ↓

* '''Lakes''' ↑ → Act as a buffer during floods → Capacity ↑ → Bankfull discharge ↑ → Floods ↓

      <text xml:space="preserve">== (Interlocking spurs) ==
''Interlocking spurs'' were not included in the curriculum and assessment guide. Only study the formation process if you have spare time. If not, simply remembering the name and appearance will do.
# Water in the upper course has little energy
#　Thus it cannot remove obstacles in ikts path.
# Water flows around spurs instead of eroding them.
# This forms interlocking spurs.

== Gorges ==
Example: Wu Xia

General:
# Downcutting along the channel forms '''V-shaped valleys'''
# Lateral erosion is rare
# Therefore, narrow, steep-sided valley - gorges - are formed.

By '''waterfall recession''':
# The erosive power of waterfalls is great.
# When water erodes the backwall of a waterfall by hydraulic action and abrasion, it retreats.
# A deep valley is formed.

By '''uplift of land''' (less important):
# When land uplifts,
# vertical erosion occurs to form a V-shaped valley.
# A gorge is thus formed.

== Rapids ==
Example: Bride's Pool
# There are '''alternating layers''' of resistant and non-resistant rocks on the riverbed
# The river can vertically erode the non-resistant rocks (by hydraulic action and abrasion), but not resistant rocks. This is called '''differential erosion'''. A step-like riverbed is formed.
# The uneven bed causes turbulent currents called rapids.

== Potholes ==
Example: Near Bride's Pool
# At rapids, river flows over an uneven surface. When it meets and obstacle, it swirls and '''turbulence''' develops. An '''eddie''' is formed.
# If the riverbed is non-resistant/contains cracks, the load will drill circular hollows on the riverbed by abrasion. These are potholes. 

== Waterfalls ==
# When a river flows down a slope, there is a strip of resistant rock (vertical, horizontal or dipping upstream) which is eroded very slowly
# The resistant rock in front will be eroded, and the flow of water will become more and more vertical
# Water will eventually fall vertically to form a waterfall
# Hydraulic action and abrasion undercut the base of the waterfall
# This creates a pool called a plunge pool
Note: As there is a sudden drop in river gradient, deposition occurs at the plunge pool. Boulders can be found there.

With interal processes (less important):
# A normal fault causes tensional force / A reverse fault causes compressional force
# The land slides vertically. A waterfall forms between the upper ground and the lower ground.

'''Digital Financial Reporting Principles

'''Summary of Common Sense Principles
* Recognize that the goal is the meaningful exchange of information, readable by both humans and machines.
* Meaningful exchange requires prior existence of agreed upon syntax, semantics, and workflow/process rules.
* Recognize that even if SEC filing rules and the US GAAP XBRL Taxonomy may allow for ambiguity; approaches do exist where SEC filings rules can be followed and information is consistent, explicit and unambiguous.
* Recognize that being explicit contributes to the unambiguous interpretation of reported information.
* Strive for consistency
* Recognize the difference between presentation and representation.
* Recognize that a financial report should be a true and fair representation.
* Recognize that financial reports contain a discrete set of report elements which have specific properties and relations.
* Recognize that report elements can be categorized into common groups which have common relevant properties.
* Recognize that each category of report elements has allowed and disallowed relations.
* Recognize that financial reports contain a discrete set of financial report component which can be categorized.
* Recognize and respect relations between Level 3 [Text Block]s and Level 4 Detail disclosures.
* Recognize the existence of and properly respect and represent intersections between report components.
* Recognize and respect fundamental accounting concepts and unchangeable relations between those accounting concepts
* Recognize and respect common report component arrangement patterns.
* Recognize and respect common concept arrangement patterns which indicate how a set of Concepts are organized within a [Line Items].
* Recognize and respect common member arrangement patterns.
* Avoid mixing or run-together concept arrangement patterns.
* Avoid mixing distinct characteristics and concepts.
* Recognize need for both automated and manual verification processes.
* Recognize that concepts cannot be moved between fundamental accounting concept categories.
* Avoid unknowingly changing information representation approach midstream.
* Avoid inconsistencies in network identification.
* Recognize that characteristics apply to all reported facts within a report component.

|&lt;h1&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;
For this unit, we will begin working with adjectives.  In the following activity, try to determine the matching sentences, &lt;br&gt; and identify and translate the adjectives.

In Part 1 will learn about different kinds of adjectives and how they   &lt;br&gt;
are used with three main verbs: ser, estar, and tener. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
As language is defined as a system of symbolic representations of meaning, the term does not restrict itself to a particular means of communication but applies to speech as well as to several other forms such as writing or deaf people’s signing language, but also for example logically based computer languages. Nevertheless, the core of our everyday understanding of language is speech. It is the form in which human language evolved and even today only about 200 of the estimated 6000 to 7000 spoken languages also exist in a written form.
This chapter deals with the cognitive efforts people take each time they are engaged in a conversation: Speech production and comprehension are two complementary processes that mediate between the meaning of what is said (believed to be represented independent of language) and the acoustic signal that speakers exchange. Both ways of transformation include many steps of processing the different units of speech, like phonologic features, phonemes, syllables, words, phrases and sentences. Putting it simple, those steps are performed in top-down order in speech production and in bottom-up order in speech comprehension. In spite of scientific consensus about the overall structure of speech comprehension and production, there are many competing models. The chapter will present some of these models along with evidence from experimental psychology.
The comprehension section of this chapter starts with an account of how sound waves turn into phonemes, the smallest units of meaning, and goes on to address processing on the word level. Sentence comprehension – which follows word processing in the hierarchy of language – has not yet been addressed in this chapter and the Wiki-community is requested to add a section dealing with this issue. In the section treating speech production, the reader is introduced to the planning involved in transforming a message into a sequence of words, the problem of lexicalization (i.e., finding the right word) and the final steps up to the motor generation of the requested sounds. 


==Speech Comprehension==
There is no doubt that speech comprehension is a highly developed ability in humans because despite the high complexity of the speech signal, it happens almost automatically and notably fast: We can understand speech at the rate of 20 phonemes per second, while in a sequence of non-speech sounds, the order of sounds can only be distinguished if they are presented slower than 1,5 sounds per second (Clark &amp; Clark, 1977). This is a first hint that there must be mechanisms that utilise the additional information speech contains, compared to other sounds, in order to facilitate processing. 


===Phoneme perception===
The starting point of our way to comprehend an utterance is the acoustic sequence reaching our auditory system. As a first step, we have to separate the speech signal from other auditory input. This can be done because speech is continuous, which background noise normally is not, and because throughout our live our auditory system learns to utilise acoustic properties like frequency to assign sounds to a possible source (Cutler &amp; Clifton, 1999). Next, we have to identify as segments the individual sounds that form the sequential speech signal, so that we can relate them to meaning. This early part of speech comprehension is also referred to as &lt;span style=&quot;color:#006400&quot;&gt; '''decoding'''&lt;/span&gt;. The smallest unit of meaning is the &lt;span style=&quot;color:#006400&quot;&gt; '''phoneme'''&lt;/span&gt;, which is a distinguishable single sound that in most cases corresponds to a particular letter of the alphabet. However, letters can represent more than one phoneme like “u” does in “hut” and “put”. Linguists define phonemes by the particular way of articulation, that is, the parts of the articulatory tract and the movements involved in producing them. For example, the English phoneme /k/ is defined as a “velar voiceless stop consonant” (Harley, 2008). Phonemes that share certain articulatory and therefore phonological features appear more similar and are more often confused (like /k/ and /g/ that sound more alike than /k/ and /d/ or /e/).

'''''Categorical perception of phonemes'''''

Although we perceive speech sounds as phonemes, it is wrong to assume that the acoustic and the phonemic level of language are identical; rather, by acquisition of our first language, phonemes shape our perception. Phonemes are categories that comprise sounds with varying acoustic properties and they differ between languages. Maybe the best-known example is that Japanese native speakers initially have difficulties to tell apart the European phonemes /r/ and /l/ which constitute one phoneme in Japanese. Likewise, Hindi speakers distinguish between two sounds which Europeans both perceive as /k/. The learned pattern of distinction is applied strictly, causing categorical perception of phonemes: People usually perceive a sound as one phoneme or another, not as something in between. This effect was demonstrated when artificial syllables that varied acoustically along a continuum between two phonemes were presented to participants. At a certain point there was a “boundary” between the ranges in which either one of the two phonemes was perceived (Liberman, Harris, Hoffman &amp; Griffith, 1957). Nevertheless, it was found that if requested to do so, we are able to detect minimal differences between sounds that belong to the same phoneme category (Pisoni &amp; Tash, 1974). Accordingly it seems that categorical perception is not a necessity of an early level of processing but a habit employed to simplify comprehension. There is still controversy about how categorical perception actually happens. It seems unlikely that perceived sounds are compared with a “perfect exemplar” of the respective phoneme because a large number of “perfect exemplars” of each phoneme would be necessary to apply to speakers of different age, gender, dialect and so on (Harley, 2008).


'''''Coarticulation'''''

Anyway, theories that assume phoneme perception can rely on phonologic properties alone are confronted with two basic problems: The invariance and the segmentation problem. The invariance problem is that the same phoneme can sound differently depending on the syllable context in which it occurs. This is due to co-articulation, which means that while one sound is articulated, the vocal tract is already adapting for the position required for the next sound. It has been argued therefore that syllables are more invariant than phonemes. Maybe this can partly account for the finding that participants take longer to respond to a single phoneme than they take to respond to a syllable (Savin &amp; Bever, 1970), which lead the authors to believe syllables were processed first. Whether this is the case or not, it is without doubt that listeners make use of the information each phoneme contains about the surrounding ones, as experimentally produced mismatches in co-articulatory information (that is, phonemes were pronounced in a way that did not fit to the phoneme that came next) lead to longer reaction times for phoneme recognition (Martin &amp; Brunell, 1981). The invariance problem therefore points to syllables as units that intercede between the meaning bearing role of phonemes and their varying acoustic form.


'''''Segmentation'''''

The &lt;span style=&quot;color:#006400&quot;&gt; '''segmentation'''  &lt;/span&gt; problem refers to the necessary step of dividing the continuous speech signal into its component parts (i.e., phonemes, syllables, and words). Segmentation cannot be done by use of the signal’s physical features alone, because sounds slur together and cannot easily be separated, which is not only the case within words but also across words (Harley, 2008). If we look at the spectrographic display of an acoustic speech signal, we can hardly tell the boundaries between phonemes, syllables, or words (Figure 1).
Maybe the best starting point for segmentation we find in the speech signal is its &lt;span style=&quot;color:#006400&quot;&gt; '''prosody'''&lt;/span&gt;, especially the rhythm. It differs between languages, inducing different strategies of segmentation: French has a very regular rhythm with syllables that do not contract or expand much, which allows for syllable-based segmentation. English, in contrast, strongly distinguishes between stressed and unstressed syllables and those can be expanded or contracted to fit them to the rhythm. Therefore, rhythmic segmentation in English is stress based, yielding units also called &lt;span style=&quot;color:#006400&quot;&gt; '''phonological words'''  &lt;/span&gt; that consist of one stressed syllable and associated unstressed syllables, and that do not necessarily correspond with &lt;span style=&quot;color:#006400&quot;&gt; '''lexical words'''  &lt;/span&gt; (for example, “select us” is one phonological word; Harley, 2008). The importance of stress structure for speech recognition was shown when participants had to detect a certain string within a non-speech signal. Their reaction was faster when the target was within one phonological word than when it crossed the boundaries of phonological words (Cutler &amp; Norris, 1988). In the same task, the use of syllable knowledge could also be demonstrated because strings that corresponded to a normal syllable were detected faster than those that were shorter or longer (Mehler, Dommergues, Frauenfelder &amp; Segui, 1981). It seems to be another aim of segmentation to assign all of the perceived sounds to words. Thus, detecting words embedded into non-words was more difficult (as it happened more slowly) when the remaining sounds did not have a word-like phonological structure (like f''egg'', as opposed to maff''egg''; Norris, McQueen, Cutler &amp; Butterfield, 1997).

'''''Top-down feedback'''''

The processes just described operate on higher-level units, but there is evidence for (and yet strong controversy about) top-down feedback from those units onto phoneme identification. One line of evidence is the so-called lexical identification shift that occurs in research designs that examine categorical perception of phonemes with sounds that vary on a continuum between two phonemes. If these are presented in a word context, participants shift their judgement in favour of the phoneme that will create a meaningful word (for example towards /k/ and not /g/ within the word *iss) (Ganong, 1980). 
''Phoneme restoration'' can be observed if a phoneme of a word spoken within a sentence is cut out and replaced with a cough or a tone. Participants typically do not report that there was a phoneme missing – they perceive the phoneme expected in the word even if they are told it has been replaced. If the same word with a cough replacing a phoneme is inserted into different sentences, each giving contextual support for a different word (for example “The *eel was on the orange.” vs “The *eel was on the axle”), participants report to have perceived the phoneme needed for the contextually expected word (Warren &amp; Warren, 1970). Note that the words carrying the content information appear after the phoneme to be restored. Therefore it has been questioned whether it is actually phoneme perception or some later stage of processing that is responsible for the restoration effect. It seems that while there is truly perceptual phoneme restoration (as participants cannot distinguish between words with restored and actually heard phonemes), the context effects must be accounted for by a stage of processing after retrieval of word meaning (Samuel, 1981).
The ''dual-code-theory'' of phoneme identification (Foss and Blank, 1980) states that there are two different sources of information we can use in order to identify individual phonemes: The &lt;span style=&quot;color:#006400&quot;&gt; '''prelexical code'''&lt;/span&gt;, which is computed from the acoustic information, and the &lt;span style=&quot;color:#006400&quot;&gt; '''postlexical code'''  &lt;/span&gt; that comes from processing of higher-level units like words and creates top-down feedback. Outcomes of different study designs are interpreted as resulting from use of either one of the information sources. The recognition of a certain phoneme in a non-word is as fast as in a word, suggesting use of the prelexical code, while when presented in a sentence, the phoneme is recognized faster if it is part of a word expected from sentence context than if it is part of an unexpected word, which can be seen as a result of postlexical processing. However, evidence for use of the postlexical code is too limited to support the idea that it is a generally applied strategy.

===Word identification===
The identification of words can be seen as a turning point in speech comprehension, because it is the word level at which the semantic and syntactic information is represented which we need to decipher the meaning of the utterance. In the terminology just introduced in the last paragraph, this word-level information is the postlexical code. Here, the symbolic character of language comes into play: Contrary to the prelexical code, the postlexical code is not derived from the acoustic features of the speech signal but from the listener’s mental representation of words (including meaning, grammatical properties etc). Most models propose a mental dictionary, the &lt;span style=&quot;color:#006400&quot;&gt; '''lexicon'''&lt;/span&gt;. The point when a phonological string is successfully mapped onto an entry in the lexicon (and the postlexical code becomes available) is called lexical access (Harley, 2008; Cutler &amp; Clifton, 1999). 
It is controversial how much word identification overlaps with processing on other levels of the speech comprehension hierarchy. Phoneme identification and word recognition could take place at the same time, at least research has shown that phoneme identification does not have to be completed before word recognition can begin (Marslen-Wilson &amp; Warren, 1994). Concerning the role of context for word identification, theories can be located in between two extreme positions: The autonomous position states that context can only interact with the postlexical code, but does not influence word identification as such. Most specifically, there should be no feedback from later levels of processing (that is, phrase or sentence level) to earlier stages. Exactly this structural context, however, is used for word recognition according to the interactive view. Out of many models of word identification, two shall be introduced in some detail here: The cohort model and TRACE.


{{TextBox|'''Lexicon'''

'''''The cohort model'''''

The cohort model (original version: Marslen-Wilson &amp; Welsh, 1978; later version: Marslen-Wilson, 1990) proposes three phases of word recognition: The ''access stage'' starts once we hear the beginning of a word and draw from our lexicon a number of candidates that could match, the so-called cohort. Therefore the beginning of a word is especially important for understanding. The initial cohort is formed in a bottom-up manner unaffected by context. With more parts of the word being heard, the ''selection stage'' follows, in which the activation levels of candidates that no longer fit decay until the one best fitting word is selected. Not only phonological evidence but also syntactic and semantic context is used for this selection process, especially in its late phase. These first two phases of word recognition are prelexical. The recognition point of the word can, but often does not, coincide with its uniqueness point, which is the point at which the initial sequence is unique to one word. If context information can be utilised to dismiss candidates, the recognition point might occur before the uniqueness point, while if there is no helping context information and the acoustic signal is unclear, it might occur after the uniqueness point. With the recognition point, the third and postlexical phase, the ''integration stage'' begins, in which the semantic and syntactic properties of the chosen word are utilized, for example to integrate it into the representation of the sentence. Consistent with the model, experimentally produced mistakes are more often ignored by participants who have to repeat a phrase if they appear in the last part of the word and if there is strong contextual information, while they cause confusion if they appear in the beginning and if the context is ambiguous (Marslen-Wilson &amp; Welsh, 1978).


'''''The TRACE model'''''

TRACE (McClelland &amp; Elman, 1986) is a connectionist computer model of speech recognition, which means it consists of many connected processing units. Those units operate on different levels, representing phonological features, phonemes and words. Activation spreads bidirectionally between units, allowing for both bottom-up and top-down processing. Between units of the same processing level, there are inhibitory connections that make those units compete with each other and simulate phenomena such as the categorical perception of phonemes. Also at the word level there is evidence for competition (that is, mutual inhibition) between candidates: Words embedded in non-word strings take longer time to be detected if the non-word part bears similarity with some other existing word than if it does not. This effect was shown to co-occur with and to be independent of the influence of stress-based segmentation discussed earlier (McQueen, Norris &amp; Cutler, 1994).
TRACE is good in simulating some features of human speech perception, especially context effects, while in other points it differs from human perception, such as tolerance for mistakes: Words that have been varied in phonemic details (such as “smob” derived from “smog”) are identified as the related words by TRACE while to humans they appear as non-words (Harley, 2008). Other researchers have criticised the supposed high amount of top-down feedback as a version of TRACE that did not contain top-down-feedback simulated speech perception equally well as the original version (Clifton &amp; Cutler, 1999).


==Speech Production==
The act of speaking involves steps of processing similar to the act of listening, but those steps are performed in reverse order, from sentence meaning to phonological features. Speaking can also be seen as bringing ideas into a linear form (as a sentence is a one-dimensional sequence of words). According to Levelt (1989), speakers deal with three main issues. The first is conceptualisation, that is determining what to say and selecting relevant information to construct a preverbal message. The next is formulating this preverbal message in a linguistic form, including selection of individual words, syntactic planning and encoding of the words as sounds. The third issue is execution, which means implementing the linguistic representation on the motor articulatory system. Figure 2 gives an overview of Levelt’s model, with its particular features being addressed in the following sections.
There is evidence that speech production is an &lt;span style=&quot;color:#006400&quot;&gt; '''incremental'''  &lt;/span&gt; process, which means that planning and articulation take place at the same time and early steps of processing “run ahead” of later ones in the verbal sequence we prepare. For example, if a short sentence with two nouns shall be formed to describe a picture, an auditive distractor delays the onset of speaking if it is semantically related to either of the two nouns or if it is phonologically related to the first, but not to the second noun (Meyer, 1996). This supports the notion that before speaking starts all nouns of the sentence are prepared semantically but that only the first one is already encoded phonetically. It also seems that planning takes place in periodically returning phases, as it was found pauses occur after every five to eight words in normal conversations. Periods of fluent speech alternate with more dysfluent periods, both connected with different patterns of gestures and eye contact. This has been interpreted as ‘cognitive cycles’ that structure speaking (Henderson, Goldman-Eisler &amp; Skarbeck (1966).
There is much less literature on speech production than there is on comprehension; most research on speech production has focused on collecting speech errors (and asking the speaker what the intended utterance was) in order to find out how we organise speech production. Experimental studies, utilizing for example picture naming tasks, are a rather new field (Harley, 2008). Therefore there is a paragraph about speech errors before the steps of conceptual and syntactic planning, lexicalization and articulation are treated.


{{TextBox|'''Incremental processing'''
Sequential steps of processing take place at the same time in a fashion that while material that has already undergone step 1 is going through step 2, new material goes through step 1.}}


===Speech errors===
All kinds of linguistic units (i. e., phonological feature, phoneme, syllable, morpheme, word, phrase, sentence) can be subjects to speech errors that happen in everyday life as well as in laboratory tasks. Those errors involve different mechanisms like blend, substitution, exchange, addition or deletion of linguistic units (Harley, 2008). To give a more plastic idea of the classification of speech errors, here are some (self-created) examples:

|-

|}

The finding that speech errors involve particular linguistic units has been interpreted as an argument that those units are not only descriptive categories of linguists but also subject to actual cognitive steps of speech processing (Fromkin, 1971). Research has shown that errors do not happen at random: If people are confronted with materials that make mistakes likely (for example if they are asked to read out quickly texts that include tongue twisters), errors that form lexically correct words happen more often than errors that do not. Errors that form taboo words are less likely than other possible errors. Nevertheless materials that include the possibility to accidentally form a taboo word cause elevated galvanic skin responses, as though speakers monitor those possible errors internally (Motley, Camden &amp; Baars, 1982).


'''''Garrett´s model of speech production'''''

A general model of speech production based on speech error analysis was proposed by Garrett (1975, 1992). His basic assumption is that processing is serial, and different stages of processing do not interact with each other. Phrase planning takes place in two steps: At the ''functional level'', in which the content and main syntactic roles like subject and object are determined, and at the positional level that includes determining the final word order and phonological specification of the words used. Content words (nouns, verbs and adjectives) are selected at the first level, function words (like determiners and prepositions) only at the second level. Phonological specification of content word stems therefore takes place before phonological specification of function words or grammatical forms (like plural or past forms of verbs). According to the theory, word exchanges occur at the first level and are therefore influenced by semantic relations, but much less by the distance between the words in the completed sentence. Contrary, sound exchanges as products of phonological encoding occur at a later stage in which the word order already is determined, which makes them constrained by distance. Also in accordance with the theory, sounds typically exchange across short distances, whereas words can exchange across the whole phrase. Garret’s theory also predicts that elements should only exchange if they are part of the same processing level. This is supported by the robust finding that content words and function words almost never exchange with each other (Harley, 2008).
Other speech errors are more difficult to explain with Garret’s model: Word blends, like “quizzle” from “quiz” and “puzzle” make it seem probable that two words have been drawn from the lexicon at the same time, contrary to Garret’s idea that language production is serial and not a parallel process. Even more problematic, word blends and even blends of whole phrases seem to be facilitated by phonological similarity. That is, intruding contents and intended contents merge more often at points where they share phonemes or syllables than would be expected by chance. This should not be the case if planning at the functional level and phonological processing are indeed separated stages with no interaction between them (Harley, 1984).

===Conceptual planning===
It has already been mentioned that speaking involves linearising ideas. That is because even if what we want to say involves concepts related to each other in complex ways (for example like a network), we have to address them one by one. This is a main object of &lt;span style=&quot;color:#006400&quot;&gt; '''conceptual preparation'''&lt;/span&gt;, a step which – according to Levelt (1999) – takes place even before the ideas are transferred into words, thus yielding a preverbal message. ''Macroplanning'' is the part of conceptual preparation that can be described as management of the topic. The speaker has to ensure the listener can keep track when he leads his attention from one item to the next. When people go through a set of items in a conversation, they normally pick items directly related to the previous one; if this is not possible they go back to a central item that they can relate to the next one or they start with a simple item and advance to more difficult ones. 
Ideas that we express in sentences normally include relations between &lt;span style=&quot;color:#006400&quot;&gt; '''referents'''&lt;/span&gt;. To get those relations in the linear form required in speech, we have to assign the referents to grammatical roles like subject and object that are in most languages related to certain positions in the sentence. This is called ''microplanning''. Often it is possible to express the same relation through various syntactic constructions, resembling different angles of view and we have to choose one before we can begin to speak. For example, if a cat and a dog sit next to each other we could say “The cat sits right to the dog” as well as “The dog sits left to the cat” (Levelt, 1999).
It has been proposed that the overall structure of a sentence (like active versus passive or adverbial at the beginning or at the end) is determined somewhat independent of the content, maybe with the help of a “syntactic module”. Evidence comes from syntactic priming which occurs for example when participants have to describe a picture after reading an unrelated sentence. They choose a syntactic structure resembling the previously read sentence more often than expected by chance. Other aspects like choice of words and their grammatical forms do not interact with this priming (Bock, 1986).

{{TextBox|'''Referent'''

===Lexicalisation===
The concepts selected during conceptual planning have to be turned into words with defined grammatical and phonological features so we can construct the sentence that we finally encode phonologically for articulation. This “word selection” is called &lt;span style=&quot;color:#006400&quot;&gt; '''lexicalisation'''  &lt;/span&gt; and Levelt (1999) postulates it is a two-step process: First a semantically and syntactically specified representation of the word, the so-called &lt;span style=&quot;color:#006400&quot;&gt; '''lemma'''  &lt;/span&gt; is drawn, which does not contain phonological information, then the lemma is linked to its phonological form, the &lt;span style=&quot;color:#006400&quot;&gt; '''lexeme'''&lt;/span&gt;. The tip-of-the-tongue state could be an everyday life example for successful lemma selection but a disrupted phonological processing: The phonological form of a word can not be found, even though its meaning and even grammatical or phonological details are known to the speaker.
The model of separate semantic and phonologic processing in lexicalisation is supported by evidence from picture-naming tasks with distractors: The time window in which auditory stimuli that were phonologically related to the item had to be presented to slow down naming differed from the time window in which semantically related stimuli interfered with naming (note that both could, presented in other time windows, also speed processing). According to these findings it takes roughly 150 ms to process the picture and activate a concept, about 125 ms to select the lemma and another 250 ms for phonological processing (Levelt et al., 1991). Other researchers argue that there is overlap between these phases, allowing for ''processing in cascade'': Information from semantic processing can be utilised for phonological processing even before lemma selection is completed. Peterson and Savoy (1998) found mediated priming in picture naming tasks, which means that presentation of a phonological relative of a semantic relative of the target word (like “soda” related to the target “couch” via “sofa”) at a certain moment in time, facilitated processing. Another finding in favour of processing in cascade is that word substitution errors in which the inserted word is related both semantically and phonologically to the intended one (like catalogue to calendar) occur above chance level (Harley, 2008). Controversy goes even further, questioning the existence of lemmas. As an alternative model Caramazza (1997) proposes a lexical-semantic, a syntactic and a phonological network between which information is exchanged during lexicalisation.

===Grammatical planning===
For each word, grammatical features become accessible by lemma selection (or activation of relevant elements in the syntactic network according to Caramazza’s model), constraining opportunities of integrating it into the sentence. Each word can be conceptualised as a knot in a syntactic network, and to complete the sentence structure, a pathway that connects all those knots has to be found. Idiomatic terms are a special case as they are connected to very strong constraints. Therefore it is presumed that they are stored as separate entries (in addition to the entries for the single words they are constituted of) in our mental lexicon (Levelt, 1999).
In many languages, also the &lt;span style=&quot;color:#006400&quot;&gt; '''morphological'''  &lt;/span&gt; form of a word has to be defined to integrate it into the sentence, taking into account its syntactic relations and additional information the word contains (like tense and number). Morphological transformations can be implemented by addition of affixes to the word stem (like ‘speculat''ed''’ or ‘plant''s''’) or by changes of the word stem (like ‘swim-swam’ or ‘mouse-mice’). The amount and complexity of morphological transformations in English is moderate compared to languages like German, Russian or Arabian, while in other languages like Chinese there are no morphological transformations at all.


{{TextBox|'''Morphology'''

===Articulation===
When the phonological information about the words in their appropriate morphological form is available and word order has been determined, articulation can begin. Keep in mind that these processes are incremental so the sentence need not be prepared as a whole before its beginning is articulated. The issue is to produce the required speech sounds in the right order with the right prosody. There are different models of how this is achieved. ''Scan-copier models'' (Shattuck-Hufnagel, 1979) constitute a classic approach, proposing that a framework of syllable structure and stress pattern is prepared. Phonemes are inserted into this framework by a ‘copier’ module and the progress is instantly checked. Speech errors like phoneme exchange, phoneme deletion or perseveration can be explained by failures in certain points of the copy- and checking processes. According to the ''competitive queuing model'' (Hartley &amp; Houghton, 1996), which adopts the idea of a framework and a copier, the phonemes that are to be inserted form a queue, and the order of insertion is controlled by activating and inhibiting connections between them and particular units that mark the beginning and the end of a word. Thus, the phoneme with the strongest connection to the beginning unit will be inserted in the first position.


'''''The role of syllables for articulation'''''

WEAVER++ (Levelt, 2001) is a two-step model that assumes that by lexeme identification, a sequence of phonemes representing the whole word is drawn simultaneously. This is supported by the finding that in naming tasks, auditorily presented distractors that prime parts of the target word speed naming, no matter which position the primed part has in the target word (Meyer &amp; Schriefers, 1991). As the next step, syllables, which are not a part of the lexicon representation, are formed sequentially. Because of co-articulation, syllables are required as input for the articulatory process. The formation of syllables is believed to be facilitated by a reservoir of frequent syllables, the &lt;span style=&quot;color:#006400&quot;&gt; '''syllabary'''&lt;/span&gt;. Even in languages like English with a high number of different syllables (more than 12.000) a much smaller number accounts for most syllables in a given utterance. Those syllables (and in languages with only a few hundred different syllables, like Chinese or Japanese, maybe all syllables) form highly automatised motor sequences that could (according to Rizzolatti &amp; Gentilucci, 1988) be stored in the supplementary motor area. A finding in favour of the existence of a syllabary is that pseudo-words (constructed from normal Dutch syllables) with high-frequency syllables were processed faster than pseudo-words with low-frequency syllables in an associative learning task (Cholin, Levelt &amp; Schiller, 2006). 
Syllable forming can also depend on prosody. In stress-assigning languages like English phonological words are formed by associating unstressed syllables with neighbouring stressed syllables. These phonological words seem to be prepared before speaking begins, as for sentences including more phonological words the onset of speaking takes longer. In articulation, syllables bind together only within, but not across phonological words. For example, in the sentence “Give me a beer, if the beer is cold” the ‘r’ of beer is bound to the following ‘i’ only in the second part of the sentence (“bee-ris cold”), as the comma marks a boundary between phonological words (Harley, 2008). The example also shows that syllables are not determined by lexical words, as phonemes can change from the syllable they are part of when the lexical word stands alone to a syllable belonging to another lexical word.


{{TextBox|'''Syllabary'''

'''''Acoustic speech parameters'''''

During articulation, we not do only manipulate the phonematic properties of the sounds we produce, but also parameters like volume, pitch, and speed. Those parameters depend on the overall prosody of the utterance, respective the position of a given syllable within it. While prosody can be regulated directly in order to transport meaning independent of the words used (consider that different stress can make the same sentence sound like a statement or like a question), some acoustic parameters can give hints about the speakers emotional state: ''Key'' is the variation of pitch within a phrase and is influenced by the relevance of the phrase to the speaker and his emotional involvement. ''Register'' is the basic pitch and is influenced by the speakers current self-esteem (use of the lower chest register indicating higher self esteem than use of the head register), (Levelt, 1999).


'''''Monitoring of speech production'''''

According to the standard model of speech production (Levelt, 1999), monitoring takes place throughout all phases of speech production. Levelt assumes that for monitoring of syntactic arrangement we utilise the same ‘parsing’ mechanisms we employ to analyse the syntax of  a heard sentence. Although speech production and speech comprehension involve different brain areas (there is activation in temporal auditory regions during listening and activation in motor areas during speaking; see the chapter about the biological basis of language), monitoring of one’s own speech also seems to involve temporal areas included in listening to other persons. Therefore a ‘perceptual loop’ for phonetic monitoring has been proposed (Levelt, 1999), although it is not clear yet whether this loop processes the auditory signal we produce or some earlier phonetic representation, a kind of ‘inner’ speech.


==Summary==
Speech comprehension starts with the identification of the speech signal against an auditory background and its transformation to an abstract representation, also called decoding. Speech sounds are perceived as phonemes, which form the smallest unit of meaning. Phoneme perception is not only influenced by the acoustic features, but also by the word and sentence context. To analyse its meaning, it is necessary to segment the continuous speech signal. This is done with the help of the rhythmic pattern of speech. In the following processing step of word identification, the prelexical code that only contains phonetic information of a word is complemented with the postlexical code, that is, the semantic and syntactic properties of the word. It is proposed that a mental dictionary exists, the lexicon, from which candidates for the heard word are singled out. With the integration of the postlexical code of the single words, the meaning of the sentence can be deciphered.
The endpoint of speech comprehension – the conceptual message – is the starting point of speech production. Ideas have to be organised in a linear form, as speech is a one-dimensional sequence, and have to be expressed in syntactic relations. Words for the selected concepts have be chosen, a process called lexicalisation, which is the reverse of word identification because here the semantic and syntactic representation of the word (the lemma) is selected first and has to be linked to the phonemic representation (the lexeme). The syntactic properties of the single words can be seen as constraints for their integration into the sentence, so a syntactic structure has to be constructed that meets all constraints. Also the morphological forms of the words have to be specified before the sentence can be encoded phonologically for articulation. To plan articulation, syllables are constructed from the lexical words in tune with the phonological words that result from the sentence’s stress pattern. Generally, speech production is an incremental process, which means that articulation and different stages of preparation for the following phrases take place simultaneously.

== adding fast-convolution and TIIR filters to FIR section ==

hi everyone.

i would recommend adding to FIR filters two other realization methods besides the common '''transversal''' realization.  the other two are the frequency-domain '''fast convolution''' and the class of FIR filters known as '''truncated IIR filters''' (TIIR) of how moving-average and CIC filters are commonly realized.

so what do you think? [[User:Rbj|Rbj]] ([[User talk:Rbj|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Rbj|contribs]]) 20:51, 30 July 2014 (UTC)  (nice not to be eternally banned from here.)</text>

|}

== Important Examples ==
* Wheat-sheep farming in Australia is an example of extensive mixed farming.
* Greenhouse cultivation is an example of intensive commercial farming.
* Nomadic herding and shifting cultivation (more about that in M7) are examples of non-sedentary farming.

== Important Relationships ==
Also note these relationships:
* Arable farming is preferred in areas with favourable physical inputs like high rainfall and temperature. Irrigation farming and pastoral farming are practiced in areas with more severe conditions.
* Areas with large and low-cost labour supply generally practice intensive farming.
* Areas with favourable cultural factors are more likely to practice commercial farming. Areas far away from markets with limited technology and capital tend to practice subsistence farming.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Agriculture is defined as the cultivation of crops or rearing of livestock for food and raw materials for clothing, shelter and secondary industries. It can be regarded as a system with inputs, processes and outputs. See this table:
&lt;center&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;80%&quot;
! width=&quot;33%&quot; | Inputs
! width=&quot;33%&quot; | Processes
! width=&quot;34%&quot; | Outputs
|-
|
*'''Physical inputs''' include the weather and climate (sunlight, rainfall...), land (relief, aspect, soil...), drainage, and of course seeds and livestock.
*'''Cultural inputs''' include labour, capital, entrepreneurship, technology (machinery, equipment, agrochemicals...), management, government policy, transport, market, training, advisory services.
|
*'''For crop cultivation''': Ploughing, sowing, irrigating, weeding, fertilising, harvesting
* '''For livestock rearing''': Breeding, grazing, feeding, shearing, vaccinating, milking, slaughtering
| They include products such as crops and animal products, as well as by-products like animal excrement, waste water, weeds, stubble and so on. In commercial farming, the products will be sold to the market. The profits earned will be used on future inputs, forming a feedback loop.
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

In the sections below, we will study the factors that affect farming decisions. This includes
* Decisions on the crop types grown
* Decisions on the amount of input

[[File:Annual Average Temperature Map.jpg|Annual average temperatures around the globe|left|300px]]

=== Insolation and temperature ===
Insolation and temperature are important factors in agriculture. Firstly, insolation provides light and heat, which plants need for photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is essential for plant growth. Plants can only grow at temperatures above 6°C.

The second reason is '''frost''', a type of precipitation in which ice is formed on the earth's surface. Frost occurs at the freezing point prevents plant growth. The '''frost-free period''' is the range of days between the last frost of spring and the first frost of autumn. Its length determines the length of the '''growing season'''.

The amount of insolation is determined by the length of daylight and the intensity of the solar radiation (in turn determined by the angle of the overhead sun). Without going into details we will cover in M6, this means that lower latitudes generally have longer growing seasons than higher latitudes.

{{Robox|theme=2|title=Growing season of certain plants}}Sugar cane - 250 days ([https://sites.google.com/site/pakistannewsupdatepk/team-sponsors Source]) &lt;br/&gt; Rice - 240 days ([http://www.chacha.com/question/does-rice-grow-better-in-wet-climate%3F-*juanito-%3C-3 Source])&lt;br/&gt; Cotton - 200 days ([http://www.cotton-made-in-africa.com/en/african-cotton.html Source]) &lt;br/&gt; Wheat - 135 days ([http://waterquality.montana.edu/docs/irrigation/100bushel.shtml Source]) &lt;br/&gt;

=== Precipitation ===
Rainfall is another important factor. Raindrops will infiltrate into the soil for plants to absorb, and thus is an important water supply for plants. Without water, crops will wither and die, leading to '''crop failure'''. This is why prolonged '''drought''' leads to a decrease in yield. Rainfall beneficial to crops is known as '''effective precipitation'''. In general, crops need 250 mm of effective precipitation per year in temperate regions and 500 mm in tropical regions. Snow is also beneficial to crops as they shield the plants from extreme cold and provide moisture for plant growth when they thaw.

However, heavy, persistent rainfall and rainstorms may cause flooding and waterlogged conditions in the soils, as well as serious rainsplash erosion. Hailstorms will damage crops. This may lead to crop failure as well.

In areas with abundant rainfall and insolation throughout the year, such as South China, ''''double cropping''' and '''triple cropping''' may be carried out to increase yields. These areas generally grow '''wet crops''', or water-demanding crops like '''wet rice'''. Cotton, which has a long growing season, is also grown in tropical areas. In temperate regions with less rainfall and insolation, '''oats''', '''wheat''' and '''barley''' are grown. They have shorter growing seasons and demand less water (and are thus known as '''dry crops''').

Seasonal patterns in rainfall determine the type of crop grown. For example, maize needs large amounts of rainfall during their ripening period, whereas coffee requires a dry period.

=== Wind ===
Winds affect plant growth both positively and adversely:
*Light winds facilitate transpiration, which encourages plant growth.
*Onshore winds bring moisture to plants, increasing the water supply for plants. They may also lead to frontal rain.
*Strong winds increase the evaporation rate, reducing soil moisture content. They may also cause soil erosion as the topsoil is blown away.
*Huge winds like tornadoes and typhoons damage crops and lead to crop failure.

{{Robox|theme=2|title=Good winds, bad winds}}
* In Egypt, a dry, hot wind known as khamsin is harmful to agriculture. It carries sands to agriculture areas.
* In the south of France, cold winds called the mistral hinder cultivation.
* Foehn winds on leeward slopes increase the local temperature. (This will be discussed in E2.)
{{Robox/Close}}

== Land ==
=== Relief ===
'''Altitude''' is very important in agriculture. The temperature decreases 6°C per 1000 metres; this is known as the '''environmental lapse rate'''. Winds are also stronger at higher latitudes. '''Leaching''' is more likely at higher latitudes, and organic matter takes longer to be decomposed into '''humus'''. (These will be explaiend in M6.) Soils are less mature than in low latitudes. Therefore, it is difficult for crops to be cultivated at high latitudes. In Britain, for example, grass cannot be grown above 300 m.

'''Aspect''' is another important factor. In the Northern Hemisphere, south-facing slopes are likely to receive more solar radiation each day. These are known as ''adret slopes''. North-facing slopes in the Northern hemisphere receive less solar radiation and known as ''ubac slopes''. In the Southern Hemisphere, the same holds for north-facing slopes. Also, near the coasts '''windward slopes''', which face the coasts and receive onshore winds, are likely to receive '''relief rain''', which is favourable for agriculture. '''Leeward slopes''' face away from the coasts and are said to be in the '''rain shadow''', which hinders agriculture.

'''Slope gradient''' is another factor. On level ground, infiltration is easier and there is less surface run-off. Therefore, much of the moisture is retained, which increases soil moisture content, favouring crop cultivation. Soils are also thicker because of the higher infiltration rate, which facilitates chemical weathering. Thus the provide better support for plants. Lam Tsuen Valley in Hong Kong is an example. On sloping ground, surface run-off occurs and little moisture is retained on the slope surface. Moreover, rainsplash erosion is serious, and the topsoil is often eroded away. Thus thin and dry soils are often found on sloping grounds. '''Terracing''' is a method to reduce these problems and will be discussed later.

=== Soil ===
Various attributes of soils are key to arable farming:
* '''Soil moisture''': High soil moisture content allows absorption by plants, facilitating growth. However, if the moisture content is too high, waterlogging will occur, drowning crops. This is also related to the water retention capability of soils. Sandy soils retain less water because of their high '''porosity''' and '''permeability'''. Infiltration and percolation rates are very high. Clayey soils retain much water and are thus generally more favourable for plant growth.
* Soil nutrient content ('''soil fertility'''): High soil nutrient content is essential for plant growth. Soils high in nitrate and mineral content will give better yields.
* '''Soil depth''': Deep soils favour agriculture as they provide support for plant roots, especially in agroforestry.
* '''Soil aeration''': Aeration is closely related to soil porosity. Sandy soils have better aeration and air can be easily circulated in and out of the soil. In other words, the soil can 'breathe' better.
* '''Soil acidity''': In general, slightly acidic soils are more favourable for farming because they can maintain better soil fertility.

Soil often determines the type of crop grown.

{{Robox|theme=2|title=Soil type and crop type}}
* Clayey soils are more suited for plants like broccoli. Crops with dense roots cannot grow because of the densely-packed soil particles. They require grass cover to increase yield.
* Sandy soils are good for root vegetables like carrots and turnips.
* Silty soils are the middle ground between clayey and sandy soils, and most plants can thrive in it.

=== Drainage ===
The drainage of an area is another important factor. Rivers can transport produce from the farm, and farm equipment, seeds and workers into the farm. It also serves as an important water supply in areas where rainfall is not abundant. Thus drainage is an important factor in both pastoral and arable farming.

In '''floodplains''' and '''deltas''', sediments washed downstream provide important nutrients for farming. The soil on floodplains is fertile and known as '''alluvial soils''' as they contain alluvium. This is discussed in M2. The Nile is an important example, and served as the cradle of the Ancient Egyptian civilisation. The Ganga Delta in Bangladesh is another.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I think here we should talk about how important it is to find a partnering agency to be an in country contact. We wouldn't have been able to do anything without the WHO and Jordanian MOH. etc. Obtaining formal or informal security clearances with partnering gov't.

      <text xml:space="preserve">It is important to understand the layout of the territory for the identification and selection of data points/ interviewees.  I think we may want to talk about how complicated it was to get our data collectors all over Jordan to collect data.  We could also talk about the logistics here or have another section dedicated to logistics of that magnitude.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Importance of training! Need to invest in time to train....don't skimp. Importance of training in primary language. DO A PILOT to make sure your data collectors are doing the collection properly.

We can put the pilot study as its own heading or put it in here.

Transportation I guess could go in this section if we wanted.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Pollution is when something is added to the environment that is harmful or poisonous to living things. Smoke in the air from factories is a type of pollution as it is bad for the lungs when breathed in. Sewage in drinking water is another type of pollution, as it can make people ill because it contains germs and viruses. People living next to a building site where there is too much noise can become sick as they cannot sleep or relax.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Air pollution affects the health of living things.  

kongqih wuraan yiingxiaang shengwuh jiahnkang.  


Many of the world's large cities today have bad air quality.  

jintian shihjieh heen duo dah cherngshih de kongqih heen chah.  


Even 2,000 years ago, the Romans were complaining about the bad air in their cities (at that time, the air was thick with smoke from fires and the smell of sewers).  

2,000 niarn qiarn de Roma rern yee toursuh kongqih chah (dangshir de kongqih chongmaan dahhuoo de heiyan her gouqur de chouhweih).  


Air pollution has been a danger to human health and other living things for a long time.

charngjiuu yiilair, kongqih wuraan weihaih rernleih her qirta shengwuh de jiahnkang.

Please stop this user from continuing his [[Special:PermanentLink/2614573|stalking and harassment]] campaign against me. He has brought over many crosswiki issues and disputes and disrupted the work done here on Wikibooks for retaliation against perceived slights; he made his intentions clear over the declaration to &quot;monitor&quot; (read: stalk) my contributions and continue to purposefully annoy and harass me for his own purposes. His presence here has already done much damage, and I am apalled by the lack of administrative intervention.

: What you are describing is something that would be difficult for an administrator to observe; a highly distributed pattern of behavior is hard to reconstruct after the fact, so might be apparent to you as you experience it but not so readily apparent to someone else after the fact.  Keeping that in mind,
:* Can you give specific examples of the sort of disruption you're talking about?
:* Can you suggest how someone else, looking back after the fact, could reconstruct the overall pattern of behavior you are describing?
:* What sort of preventative adminsitrative action do you think would apply to the situation?

I've already tried that solution and he insists on attacking me on any wiki where he is allowed to with these gigantic warnings on my talkpage.

::::Ajr, I'm feeling much discomfort over his following me around. If you have it within your power, ''please'' ask one of the senior stewards or any local community admins you see us feuding on and ask for an interaction ban.

:::::Apologies actually, I forgot that the warning on your talkpage (here or on some wiki) was by him and not the other way around. My personal recommendation is that you just ignore him - if he sends you warnings, don't respond. Just don't interact to the best of your ability. Stuff like this doesn't really help, but instead continues it. @[[User:Abd|Abd]], I suggest you also look at and follow this advice.

:::Proposed solution at ''minimum'': a stern warning that he is not to carry personal disputes with other editors onto other wikis. Future behavior would likely get him a block.

:::::True up to a point.  At Wikinews, we have occasionally had good luck with contributors who had already gotten themselves into deep trouble on Wikipedia through misbehavior.  However, that sort of fresh-start approach only applies as long as the user does not bring their misbehavior from elsewhere to the local project.  If cross-wiki harassment were brought to a local project, that ought not to be tolerated.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 14:02, 6 March 2014 (UTC)
::::::Harassment of any kind isn't acceptable. The cross wiki nature is almost irrelevant - if someone turns up here with the sole purpose of harassing another editor, then the fact that they have harassed them elsewhere is almost irrelevant as the action would still be the same... [[User:QuiteUnusual|QuiteUnusual]] ([[User talk:QuiteUnusual|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/QuiteUnusual|contribs]]) 16:28, 6 March 2014 (UTC)
: What was said by the last two contributors seems right but that's the point.  It's a person's behaviour here that counts.  When you spot one mistake you assume good faith as you would with any new editor rather than analysing their edits on other wikis.  Maybe you could analyze the edits elsewhere after several problems but not straight away.  If our actions on Wikipedia directly affected our image on Wikibooks then I would likely have been blocked just as many times here as I was (many, many years ago) on Wikibooks.--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Estonia.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 19:58, 6 March 2014 (UTC)
:: Say &quot;give the benefit of the doubt&quot; rather than &quot;assume good faith&quot;.  The grey area to watch out for is when a local action is ''part of'' a larger pattern that isn't visible unless one steps back to see the wider context.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 11:21, 7 March 2014 (UTC)

== Stream of user talk page creations ==
Around an hour ago they finished with [[User:Cir00004]].  Others include [[User talk:LittleBlondeLottie‎]].  It's a stream of people adding an opening message to their talk pages or user pages.  Any idea what it might be?  There appear to be about 30 of them within 4 minutes.  Maybe some kind of class project or vandals creating talk pages so that their accounts don't appear to be as new when they later choose to vandalise?--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Estonia.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 11:14, 18 March 2014 (UTC)
:I'm guessing that the pages are related to a class project but pages like [[User_talk:GregXenon01]] seem very strange with a very active conversation including mentions of edit conflicts yet none of the editors have any significant edits.--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Estonia.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 21:29, 18 March 2014 (UTC)

::[[User:Xania]], looking at there userpage, we can tell that they are a class, doing a project on Wikibooks. At there userpages, they state &quot;student at Starling University&quot;. So they must be doing some project at Wikibooks, which the students and teachers are at Starling University. I do not object classes on Wikibooks here, but the best place to do class assignments are at Wikiversity.

::Well, on topic, they have been quite troublesome, with a few users creating userpages that are not there own. More on when this activity continues. --[[User:Goldenburg111|goldenburg111]] ([[User talk:Goldenburg111|talk]]) 21:36, 18 March 2014 (UTC)
:::Wikibooks is used extensively for class projects where the project is to write a textbook - this is a perfectly acceptable use for Wikibooks and should be here, not Wikiversity. [[User:QuiteUnusual|QuiteUnusual]] ([[User talk:QuiteUnusual|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/QuiteUnusual|contribs]]) 08:46, 19 March 2014 (UTC)
:::QuiteUnusual, I was just very confused as they appeared to be having a lively conversation about their work, edit conflicts, etc. despite not having made any edits.  --[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Estonia.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 10:52, 19 March 2014 (UTC)
::::Yes I felt the same. I suspect they've been told to create accounts ready to start a project... I'll be keeping an eye on it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In a conservative plate boundary, no plate materials are constructed or destroyed. Transform faults are found here. Vulcanicity is rare as less magma rises along lines of weakness to the earth's surface. However, earthquakes are very common.

== San Andreas Fault (Pacific + N American) ==
It is located at California.
# The Pacific Plate slides past the North American Plate in a north-westward direction.
# Sheer stress builds up along teh plate boudnary.
# Eventually, stress caused the plates to fracture, producing a transform fault along the conservative plate boundary. The plates neither subduct nor spread at the transform zone.

As the plates slide past each other, friction creates large strains along the transform zone. When the stress caused by plate movements exceeds the friction, an earthquake occurs.

== Transform Fault between African and Arabian Plates ==
# The Arabian Plate slides past the African Plate in a northward direction.
# Sheer stress builds up along the plate boudnary.
# Eventually, the stress caused the plates to fracture. producing a transform fault along the conservative plate boundary. The plates neither subduct nor spread at the transform zone.
# Several '''gulfs''' and inland seas were opened up: Sea of Galilee, Dead Sea, Gulf of Aquaba

Note: a gulf is a very large bay.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''hazard''' is a natural event that brings about great casualties and economic loss to an area.

{{Robox|theme=4|title=Is it a hazard?}}
* A small earthquake bringing no damage is not a hazard as it does not bring damage to humans.
* A major volcanic eruption in a remote region with no settlements is not a hazard as it does not bring damage to humans.
{{Robox/Close}}

There are several types of hazards:
* '''Tectonic hazards''' include earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and tsunamis.
* '''Biological hazards''' include locust swarms, epidemics, pandemics...
* '''Climatic hazards''' include tropical cyclones, tornadoes, thunderstorms, cold surges, droughts, heat waves...
* '''Geologic hazards''' include landslides, mudflows, earthflows, avalanches...

In this chapter, we shall cover tectonic hazards.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Tectonic hazards are not equally distributed over the earth's surface.

== Plate Boundary Types and Hazard Occurrence ==
Most hazards occur at plate boundaries, with some exceptions we will see in the next chapter.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! !! Earthquakes !! Volcanic Eruptions !! Tsunamis
|-
| Constructive || Somewhat rare || Common || Somewhat rare
|-
| Destructive || Common || Common* || Common*
|-
| Conservative || Common || None || None 
|}
&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;Mostly at the Circum-Pacific Belt.

Note that:
* Volcanic eruptions are common in constructive plate boundaries, but they have less destructive power because the the overlying seawater and the seabed suppresses the outpouring of magma.
* Tsunamis are most active at destructive plate boundaries and are mostly concentrated along coastal areas around the Pacific Ocean; however, they have occurred in the Atlantic and the Indian Oceans as well. The Indian Ocean tsunami in 2004 is an important example. 

== Two Belts ==
Two regions face serious tectonic hazards:
* '''Circum-Pacific Belt''': It runs around the Pacific Ocean. Most of the earth's volcanoes and sources of earthquakes and tsunamis are found here. With reference to volcanoes, it is known as the '''Pacific Ring of Fire''' because of the ring-like spatial distribution of volcanoes here.
* '''Alpine-Himalayan Belt''': It runs from the Alps to the Himalayas, and earthquakes are very active here.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Earthquakes ==
Along active faults, earthquakes cause '''fault rupture''' and '''ground deformation'''. Cracks and deformation result.

When seismic waves are released from the focus onto the ground's surface, the ground will shake. Areas around the epicentre will be seriously affected:

=== Damage to Structures and Facilities ===
* '''Collapse of structures''': Earthquakes will cause buildings, bridges and other structures to collapse. Roads may split open. Loss of life will result from collapsing buildings and falling fragments.
* '''Fires''': Underground gas pipes and power lines may break. This causes gas leaking and electrical short circuits, and hence fires, causing further casualties because of burning and the inhalation of smoke.
* '''Disruption of transport''': Road networks, railways and highways will be destroyed. If the important lifelines are damaged, economic loss will result, rescue will be blocked and normal life will take longer to resume.
* '''Disruption of communications''': Telephone and Internet cables may be damaged by the earthquake. In addition to increasing the cost of repair, this will also hinder communication inside and outside the damaged area, hindering rescue work.

=== Damage to the Natural Environment ===
* During an earthquake, loose slope materials and debris may slide down slopes. This may cause '''landslides and avalanches''', leading to more loss of life and property, especially at steep and unstable slopes.
* When dams, artificial dykes and other structures collapse because of the shaking, the water from the reservoir will '''flood''' downstream. This further leads to loss of life and property.
* Submarine earthquakes may trigger '''tsunamis''', leading to more damage (see below).
* An earthquake may result in tremors called '''aftershocks''' which bring more damage to the area for weeks or months.
* Earthquakes may increase ground water pressure. If the soil is poorly compacted, it may mix with the ground water to cause '''soil liquefaction'''. The strength of the soil supporting buildings' foundations will be weakened, so buildings may sink or collapse.  This may cause casualties and economic losses.
* If no swift action is taken to bury dead bodies and ensure clean water supplies after an earthquake, diseases and epidemics (e.g. malaria) will spread among victim, leading to further casualties.

== Volcanic Eruptions ==
=== Effects of Lava Flow ===
Molten lava is scalding hot. It has the ability to burn everything in its path. It:
* Sets hills, buildings, structures, crops and communications links on fire. 
* Causes extensive economic losses and loss of life.
* Animals are killed, habitats are destroyed and ecological restoration may take decades.

Less viscous lava can move at speeds of up to 50 km per hour on steep slopes, and spread tens of kilometres away from the volcano.

=== Effects of Pyroclastic Flow and Ash Fall ===
[[File:River valley filled in by pyroclastic flows, Mt. Pinatubo.jpg|thumb|right|A before-and-after picture of Mt. Pinatubo. The river valley experienced a serious mudflow caused by pyroclastic flow.]]
Strong eruptions eject volcanic ash and cinder, broken rock fragments and volcanic bombs (lava particles) from the volcano. These pyroclastic materials mix with hot gases and travel downhill at soaring speeds because of the force of gravity. This is called pyroclastic flow and has the following impacts:
* High temperature and large rocks cause loss of human and animal life.

In addition, ash is ejected into the atmosphere:
* Volcanic ash may blow into the atmosphere to form '''eruption clouds'''. The surrounding areas will be covered in volcanic ash as the clouds set down. This disturbs people's lives.
** If farmlands are covered by ash, crop failure occurs, leading to food shortage or even famines.
* Volcanic ash and dust in the atmosphere acts as '''condensation nuclei'''. This accelerates the condensation of water vapour into water droplets in the atmosphere. This favours the formation of heaby '''rainstorms''' and '''thunderstorms'''.
* Volcanic ash in the stratosphere reflects insolation back into space. This leads to a regional or even global '''temperature drop'''. It takes a very long time for ash to settle, so the climate may be changed for a very long time.
* Volcanic ash may mix with rainwater and flow quickly through river valleys and low-lying areas, leading to '''mudflows''' that cause great loss of life and property.

Ash in the air also causes problems: 
* Volcanic ash in the air causes breathing difficulties. People may suffocate as a result.
* Volcanic ash in the air blocks out sunlight, lowering visibility and hinder traffic.

=== Effects of Gas Ejection ===
Water vapour and gases like sulphur dioxide, carbon dioxide, hydrogen sulphide and carbon monoxide are ejected from volcanoes, with the following effects:
* Carbon dioxide drives oxygen away. Humans and animals suffocate.
* Carbon dioxide intensifies the greenhouse effect and accelerates global warming.
* Hydrogen sulphide is a toxic gas. People may be poisoned by it.
* Acid gases like sulphur dioxide attack the human respiratory system.
* Sulphur dioxide, hydrogen sulphide and carbon dioxide mix with rainwater to form acid rain, which damages natural habitats and human settlements.

=== Effects of the Force of Ejection ===
* &lt;u&gt;Landslides&lt;/u&gt; occur after a particularly violent eruption if the volcano is steep and unstable.
* The release of accumulated pressure and gases underground causes the crust to shake violently, leading to an &lt;u&gt;earthquake&lt;/u&gt;.
* The shock generated by a volcanic eruption may displace water and create big sea waves known as &lt;u&gt;tsunamis&lt;/u&gt;.

=== Other ===
If no swift action is taken to bury dead bodies and ensure clean water supplies after a volcanic eruption, diseases and epidemics will spread among victims, causing further casualties.

{{Robox|theme=4|title=Lava, mud and slope materials don't just flow anywhere}}
If you are given a map with an asymmetric hill - i.e. the contour lines on either side are of different closeness - then be careful. Lava flows, landslides, etc., are more likely to occur on the steep side.
{{Robox/Close}}

== Tsunamis ==
=== Sweep Effect ===
The '''sweep effect''' of the waves may destroy buildings and drown people.
=== Flooding ===
* A temporary '''flood''' is caused by the tsunami. It may inundate buildings and infrastructure until the tsunami waves subside.
* The coastline of the affected area may be changed permanently by submergence.

=== Other ===
* Seaside tourism is hit hard.
* Trade activities come to a halt.

{{Robox|theme=4|title=Not everything kills}}
Sometimes, you may be asked what kind of hazards threaten people's lives. Not all of these impacts do! For example, in CE07Q13, the candidate was asked about the possible threats to human life during a volcanic eruption. 'Acid rain' was one of the choices. Yes, it's a result of volcanic eruptions, but it doesn't kill! Therefore, acid rain is excluded from the correct answer.
{{Robox/Close}}

== Interpreting Pictures of Destruction ==
Very often, photo interpretation questions of the aftermath of tectonic hazards occur. Refer to this picture of an earthquake + tsunami in Chile:

[[File:2010 Chile earthquake Tsunami aftermath at San Antonio.jpg|350px]]

In this image, only collapse of buildings is shown. Therefore, poor building structure/lack of quake-proof designs is a valid reason accounting for this destruction. However, the lack of evacuation routes is NOT as no loss of human life was shown. It was possible that the area was evacuated, leaving only the buildings prone to tsunami destruction. (Example: CE07Q42)

      <comment>critique of current example, and a better one</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">===The current example is rotten===

Much better implementation

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def read_int(prompt):
    while True:
        try:
            return int(raw_input(prompt))
        except ValueError:   # could not convert input to integer
            print 'Huh?  Try again please.'
        # except EOFError: no, let caller deal with it

def epact_demo():
    try:
        year = read_int('What year is it? ')
    except EOFError:    # user hit EOF escape sequence
        print '\nOh, bye then.'
        return
    C = year/100
    epactval = (8 + (C/4) - C + ((8*C + 13)/25) + 11*(year%19)) % 30
    print &quot;The epact is&quot;, epactval

if __name__ == '__main__':
    epact_demo()
&lt;/source&gt;

Inputs on which this code performs better include:
* None
* main()
* eval(compile('import os\nos.system(&quot;rm -rf ReallyImportantDirectory&quot;)\n','/dev/null','exec'))
* ctrl-D

There are other reasons to dislike the current example:
* while (...) -- why the brackets?
* success = 0 -- should be boolean, not int
* use of &quot;success&quot; at all
* import math -- pointless
* year = 0 -- pointless
* &quot;The epact is: &quot;,epactval -- spaced wrongly
* print &quot;Program Complete&quot; -- no it isn't!

Really, that's not the way to teach Python to anyone.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== So many blocks it seems Minecraft ==
Now we will introduce a feature si fundamental i doubt there's any language without this and it's the block, but befote we know what this does let's try to understand the problem it solves.
If you look at past examples you will see we have been only giving one command for if/elif/else, so we solve it by using blocks. Blocks aren't enteryle new to us as we have seen them in the last chapter:
&lt;code&gt;
elif theresEnoughMoney():

  buyCoffee()

  makeSomeCoffee()
&lt;/code&gt;
As you may see nimrod's blocks are fairly easy as they are a new line and then add an indentation ( space preceding the code) of two spaces, tabs ( that keyboard key with two arrows ) can't be used and they will be traten as an error.

Blocks have one particularity, anything declared outside them will be availble inside them , however, anything declared inside them it's not available outside!
Check this code:
&lt;code&gt;
var firstVariable = &quot;Hello World.&quot;
if SomethingIsTrue():
  var secondVariable = &quot;Hi there.&quot;
  echo (&quot;We can access from inside the block the values of both variables&quot;)
  echo (firstVariable, secondVariable)

echo (&quot;But we can't access outside the block the variable declared inside&quot;)
echo (secondVariable)
&lt;/code&gt;

Now, if you try to execute that what you will get from the compiler is an error because it can't access secondVariable because it is inside the block.

Finally, blocks can be nested ( put one inside another ) for doing so you will only need to sum the identation to the existing one. If you want to close a block just reduce in two spaces the indentation.

Finally if we want to create our own blocks we can do this way:
&lt;code&gt;
block myBlock:
  echo (&quot;Hey this is a block!&quot;)
&lt;/code&gt;

As you can see you make a block and put a label in this case we named it myBlock, though the label is completely optional.
&lt;code&gt;
block:
  echo (&quot;Hey this is a block!&quot;)
&lt;/code&gt;

==Retrograding content==
There is a myth that newer Trainz Simulator 12 ({{TL|TS12}}) content cannot be modified to run in an earlier Trainz version. While literally true for Routes and sessions (at least until some 3rd party software engineer tackles the difference between the data models used internally in TS12 and writes a program that translates them), it is not true in the least for unscripted scenery assets and most rolling stock&amp;mdash;even most which contain scripts. A critical examination of the difference between the data elements (tags and containers which are mandatory) a v2.0 ({{TL|TRS2004|TRS2004-SP0}}) asset and v3.7 (TS12) asset have very few differences. Most of those which do occur happen in Texture.txt files using extended graphical function capabilities not present in older Trainz releases.

:''Main article: {{TL|Version And Build Numbers}}''
==Trainz versions==
;and understanding Trainz version numbers
Trainz versions is a somewhat overused, and possibly confusing term with three slightly different meanings:
# Trainz Retail Release or version &amp;mdash;these are the major releases with uniquely titled names such as TRS2006, TC3, Trainz Simulator 12 {{TL|TS2012}}, and so forth.&lt;br/&gt;
# '''Trainz version''', colloquially means to convey both the retail release, but also any subsequent software upgrades such as {{TN|P|patches}}, {{TN|H|hotfixes}} and {{TN|S|Service Packs}}, but does so if and only if the software upgrade also triggers a change in the {{TBS|trainz-build}} value, for that is the number mentioned in such references, such as v2.3, v2.8, v1.5, or v3.8 which numeric portions are identical to the trainz-build code for ''newly created assets'' under that version's {{TL|Content Creator Plus}} utility.&lt;br/&gt;
# '''Trainz code version''', '''Trainz build versions''' or ''''Code build number''' &amp;mdash; this is a formal numeric code which precisely reflects the combination of all listed in (2) above. For their exact meanings and where to find them, see the main article ''{{TL|Version And Build Numbers}}'' or the terser (but possibly more up to date {{N3V|http://online.ts2009.com/mediaWiki/index.php/Trainz_build_versions|Trainz Wiki 'Code build number'}}. If you are more interested in the timeline, our coverage here is by far more comprehensive historically.&lt;br/&gt;
This section aims to give a brief overview of the first two usages, and act as brief succinct reference to the newcomer entering Trainz 14&lt;!--Base date, Summer 2001 (August) for update calculations--&gt; year old culture.

=====Genus ''Rubus''=====

======''Rubus'' subg. ''Chamaemorus''======

The native status of &quot;Rubus chamaemorus&quot; in New York could be subject to question. It is a circumboreal bramble, native to all provinces of Canada and present in the states of Alaska, Minnesota, New Hampshire, and Maine. However, the only vouchered report of cloudberry growing outside of cultivation in New York was from Suffolk County, Long Island in 1908.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.torreybotanical.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Juncus_diffusissimus_NY.pdf Eric E. Lamont and Stephen M. Young (2005) &quot;''Juncus diffusissimus'', an addition to the flora of New York, with notes on its recent spread in the United States.&quot; ''The Journal of the Torrey Botanical Society'', '''132(4)''': 635-643. 2005.]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tribe Colurieae====
The New York members of the Colurieae tribe include about ten species of the genus '''''Geum''''' (avens) and a single species of '''''Waldsteinia''''' (barren-strawberry). Sources are mixed as to whether ''Waldsteinia'' should be placed under the ''Geum'' genus itself.  In either case, the &quot;barren strawberries&quot; of this tribe are more closely related to the ''Geums'' than to the other New York strawberries (''Fragaria'') or mock-strawberries (''Duchesnea''), which are placed in the Potentilleae tribe below.

====Tribe Gillenieae====

The genus name '''''Gillenia''''' was published in the early 1800s, but was changed to '''''Porteranthus''''' by Britton in the early 1900s to avoid confusion with a similar genus name. Recent interpretations of naming rules have caused the accepted name to be switched back to ''Gillenia''.

=====Genus ''Crataegus''=====
There are about fifty hawthorn taxa listed for New York, and all but a few are considered to be natives.

The subgeneric system used here for hawthorns is from the [http://data.canadensys.net/vascan/taxon/1047 Canadensys ''Database of Vascular Plants of Canada'' (VASCAN)].  Their data is based in part on the ''Flora of North America north of Mexico'', Vol. 9, (in prep).

== Matter. ==

 Science considers that any observable physical object,
 which has mass and volume, as matter.
 Recent discoveries, have thrown up, many new interesting questions, regarding matter.
 But to start with, we will use, the conventional definition of matter.

 
== System of Units. ==

 Measurements have to be done in a standard way.
 Standards provide a common way of understanding, for all of us.
 The International systems of units, is a modern form of the metric system.
 It is abbreviated as the S I Units.
 It is used widely, Internationally.
 The S I System uses the M K S System, for the basic measurements.
 M stands for Metre, which is used to measure length.
 K stands for Kilogram, which is used to measure mass.
 S stands for Second, which is used to measure time.

 The c g s System, is a variation of the metric system.
 This is also widely used.
 c stands for Centimetre, which is used to measure length.
 g stands for Gram, which is used to measure mass.
 s stands for second, which is used to measure time.
 The c g s system is very much compatible with the S I system.
 It just uses smaller units.
 centi metre instead of meter, for length.
 gram instead of kilo gram, for mass.
 The c g s system, is easily convertible to the S I system and vice versa.
 For example, 100 cm is equal to 1 m.
 1000 grams is equal to 1 kg.
 

 
== Mass. ==

 All matter has mass.
 The S I Unit for mass is kilo gram or K G.
 1 kg is equal to 1000 grams.
 We use then word weight, interchangeably with mass.
 If we wish to express, our weight in Newtons, we need to multiply mass by acceleration.
 The Earth exerts an attractive force, on all matter, near it.
 This is called as a force of Gravity.
 This force is uniform through out the Earth.
 The acceleration caused due to the force of gravity, is called ‘g’.
 The value of acceleration ’g’, caused by Earth’s gravity is 9.8 m/sec.
 If we have a mass of 50 kg, and wish to express the weight in Newtons, 
 it will be equal to 50 multiplied by 9.8 is equal to 491 Newtons.
 So the weight of a person, with a mass of 50 kg, on Earth will be 491 Newtons.
 Since the force of gravity is uniform through out Earth, 
 we do not use Newtons to express weight.
 We conveniently, and some what loosely express our weight as 50 kg.
 Of course, our weight would be different in the moon.
 This is because, the moon’s gravity is much less than the Earth’s gravity.
 The same person weighing 491 Newtons on Earth, will weigh only 81.5 Newtons in the moon.

 
== Volume. ==

 All matter has volume.
 Volume is a 3 dimensional space.
 The S I unit for volume is cubic metre cube.
 The litre is also a metric unit, for measuring volume.
 A litre is 10 cm cube.
 That is, a litre is is equal to 1000 cubic centimetre.
 We normally abbreviate a cubic centi metre as c c.
 So, a litre is equal to 1000 cm cube, or c c.
 Smaller volumes is measured in millilitres, or m l.
 One millimetre is equal to one thousandth of a litre.
 That is, one litre is equal to 1000 milli litres, or m l.
 One milli litre is equal to one cubic centi metre.
 One m l is equal to one c c.
 One cubic metre is equal to 1000 litres.
 Depending on how much volume we are measuring, 
 we can use cubic metre,
 or we can use litre.
 or we can use milli litres, or m l.


 
== Density. ==

 Density is mass per unit volume.
 We use the greek letter rho, to represent density.
 Density is equal to mass divided by volume.
 Is equal to M by V.
 The S I Unit for density is kilo gram per cubic metre,
 which is expressed as kg per m cube.
 The c g s unit for density, is gram per centimetre cube.
 Cubic centimetre can also be called a milli litre.

 The Density of water, at 4 degree centigrade is one gram per centimetre cube.
 The Density of Iron, is 7.8 grams per centimetre cube.
 The Density of Air, is .00198 grams per centimetre cube.


== Specific Gravity. ==

 Specific gravity is used to measure the relative density of a substance.
 The standard substance used is water.
 We measure, the density of substances, relative to the density of water.
 Specific gravity is equal to,
 Density of the substance, divided by the Density of water.
 Specific gravity is a ratio, of the same units.
 So specific gravity has no unit,or is dimensionless.
 Since the Density of water is one gram per centimetre cube,
 specific gravity, is numerically equal to Density.

 The Specific gravity of water, is 1.
 The Specific gravity of Iron, is 7.8.
 The Specific gravity of Air, is .00198 .


 
== States of Matter. ==

 Matter can exist, in one of the four possible states.
 Matter can be as a solid, liquid, gas, or plasma.
 These states of matter, can also be called the phase of the matter.
 The same substance, can change its phase, from one to another.
 For example, liquid water, can change to solid ice,
 or gaseous water vapour.


 
== Solid. ==

 A Solid is a state of matter, which is structurally rigid.
 A Solid resists changes to its shape or volume.
 The atoms in a solid, are tightly bound to each other.
 Usually the structure of binding, is geometrically symmetric.
 In some cases, the solid has  a crystalline structure. 
 Some examples of solids with a crystal structure are Diamond, salt and sugar. 
 Most inorganic solids are poly crystals.
 When many microscopic crystals fuse together, they are called polycrystals.
 Most metals have a polycrystalline structure.
 Rocks and ceramics are also examples of polycrystalline substances.
 When the solid does not have a geometrically symmetric bonding,
 it is said to have a amorphous structure.
 Glass, wax, plastics are examples of solids, which have  a amorphous structure. 


 The atoms in a solid, are not stationery.
 They keep vibrating.
 The vibrations are at an atomic level.
 Because the vibrations are at an atomic level we cannot see these vibrations.
 These vibrations have kinetic energy.
 The extent of these vibrations can change.
 When we apply heat energy, the vibrations increase.
 When more heat is applied, the state of the matter can change.
 For example, when a metal is sufficiently heated, 
 it will melt, and will become a liquid.

 
== Solid Mechanics. ==

 Engineers who work with solid structures, 
 are interested in the mechanical properties of solids.
 Some of these properties are.

 Tensile strength.
 This is the resistance of the solid, to being stretched.

 Compressive strength.
 This is the resistance of the solid, to being compressed.

 Elasticity.
 This is the tendency of the solid, to return to its original shape,
 when deformed.
 For example, when we stretch and release a rubber band, 
 it returns to its original shape.

 Fracture toughness.
 This is the resistance to crack.
 We commonly refer to it as brittleness.
 For example, glass is brittle.
 It is prone to cracking.

 Malleability.
 The ability to deform, without fracture or cracking.
 For example, gold is very malleable.
 This property makes gold amenable, to making jewellery.

 This and other mechanical properties, are very important for engineering applications.
 When designing structures, machinery and appliances. 
 Engineers make use of many of these properties.


== Thermal Properties. ==


 Solids also have thermal properties, 
 conductivity, specific heat, latent heat, etc.
 Engineers use these properties also, while designing.

== Liquid. ==

 A liquid is not structurally rigid.
 The atoms are not as closely bound, as in a solid.
 The atoms have greater freedom to move around.
 Liquids flow and take the shape of the container.

 The atoms in a liquid also vibrate.
 When heat is applied, the vibrations increase.
 Unlike solids, this causes the liquid to move around.
 For example, when water is heated, on a stove, 
 the warmer water tends to flow up.
 The cooler water tends to flow down.
 This causes, a convection current, in the boiling water.
 This convention current is visible to us.

 When more heat is applied, 
 Liquids evaporate and become gas.


== Gas. ==

 A Gas has no structural rigidity.
 The atoms are not bound to each other.
 A gas in a container will defuse, and occupy all parts of the container.
 For example, the air in the room , where you are sitting, occupies the whole room.
 The atoms in the gas have more kinetic energy.
 The individual atoms move around freely.
 For example, if we light a candle, 
 the smoke from the candle, will defuse, 
 and spread through out the room.
 When heat is applied to the gas,
 the kinetic energy of the atoms increase, 
 and the gas expands.

 
== Plasma. ==

 When a gas is ionized, the electrons separate from the atom.
 In such a state, the gas becomes a plasma.
 For example, in a neon lamp or a tube light, the gas is ionized.
 Ionized gas, allows electricity to be conducted.
 This is how a tube light works.
 Plasma state does not occur commonly in nature, in earth.
 We may not be aware of the plasma state.
 We may be surprised to know that most of the matter, 
 in the universe is in a plasma state.
 This is because, all the gases in the stars,
 are in a plasma state.
 There are an estimated 300 sextillion stars in the universe.
 Knowing this we will probably appreciate,
 that plasma is also, an important state of matter

== Phase Change. ==


 A substance, can change from one state to another.
 This is called as a phase change.
 Heat plays a primary role, in the change of state, of a substance.

 Water in its natural state, is a liquid.
 When Water is heated, to 100 degrees celsius, 
 it evaporates, to become a gas, we call as water vapour.
 When water is cooled, to 0 degree celsius, it becomes solid ice.
 So, water can exist, as a solid, liquid, or gas.

 When a substance is heated, basically the molecules in the substance, get excited.
 The molecules start vibrating.
 This vibration can happen in many dimensions,
 depending on whether, they are in a solid, liquid, or gaseous state.
 When the molecules are excited, they have more kinetic energy.
 Heat basically increases, the kinetic energy, of the molecules, of the substance.

 When a liquid is heated, it becomes a gas.
 The temperature at which, a liquid becomes a gas, is called the boiling point.
 When a liquid is cooled, it becomes a solid.
 The temperature at which, a liquid becomes a solid, is called the freezing point.
 When a solid is heated, it melts to become a liquid.
 The temperature at which, a  solid becomes a liquid, is called the melting point.
 The boiling point, melting point, and freezing point, 
 is different for different substances.

 Water in it’s natural state, is a liquid.
 It has a boiling point of 100 degree centigrade.
 It has a freezing point of 0 degree centigrade.

 Iron in it’s natural state, is a solid.
 The melting point of Iron is 1538 degrees centigrade.
 When heated to this temperature, Iron becomes a liquid.
 In a furnace, where Iron is manufactured, Iron is in a liquid state.
 It is normally cast into moulds.
 On cooling to room temperature, it becomes a Solid.
 The boiling point of Iron is 2861 degree centigrade.
 When heated to this temperature, Iron becomes a gas.
 In many stars, Iron and many metals, exists as a gas.

 Oxygen in it’s natural state, is a Gas.
 The boiling point of Oxygen, is minus 183 degree centigrade.
 When Oxygen is cooled to minus 183 degree centigrade, it becomes a liquid.
 Liquid Oxygen is used for medical purposes.
 It is also carried by climbers at high altitudes, 
 and under water divers.
 The boiling point of Oxygen is minus 219 degree centigrade.
 When Oxygen is cooled to minus 219 degree centigrade, it becomes a solid.

 The natural state of a substance, can be solid, liquid or gas.
 But it can be changed to another state, by heating or cooling.

== Heat. ==

 Heat is always understood, as a process of transfer.
 It is absorbed or produced, as an energy exchange.
 Heat always flows, from a hotter body, to a colder body. 
 For heat to flow, it needs a medium.
 The medium through which heat flows, can be a solid, liquid, or gas.
 Heat cannot flow, in a vacuum.
 In other words, there can be heat, only when there is a substance.
 When heat flows through a solid, it is called conduction.
 When heat flows through a liquid or gas, it is called convection.

 
== Temperature scales. ==

 The relative hotness, or coldness, of a body, is the temperature.
 This temperature can be measured, with a standard scale.

 The most commonly used scale, for measuring temperature, is centigrade or celsius.
 The boiling point, and the freezing point, of water, is used to define this scale.
 The freezing point of water, is defined as, 0 degree centigrade.
 The boiling point of water, is defined as, 100 degree centigrade.
 The temperature difference, between the boiling point and freezing point, 
  is divided into 100 equal degrees.
 That is why, it was called as the centigrade scale.
 Now it is called, as the ‘Celsius scale’.
 The symbol for Celsius, is ‘c’.
 For example, we can say, that the body temperature, is 37 degrees ‘c’.

 Another temperature scale, is the kelvin scale.
 Scientists have determined, the lowest temperature, that can be achieved.
 This they found out to be, as minus 273.15 degrees celsius.
 This is called the absolute 0, of temperature.
 That is temperature can never go, below minus 273.15 degrees ‘c’.
 This temperature is defined as 0 degrees kelvin, in the kelvin scale.
 All temperatures are measured, relative to 0 degree kelvin.
 The kelvin scale, is widely used by scientists.
 The symbol for kelvin is ‘k’.
 Kelvin is the S I unit, for temperature.
 One degree kelvin is the same as 1 degree celsius.

 An older temperature scale, that was used, was Fahrenheit.
 In the Fahrenheit scale, the freezing point of water, is 32 degrees Fahrenheit.
 The boiling point of water, is 212 degrees Fahrenheit.
 The difference between the boiling point and the freezing point,
  is divided into 180 degrees.
 The symbol for Fahrenheit, is ‘F’.
 Though this scale is obsolete, some countries like U S, still use it.

 
== Conversion of Scales. ==

 We can easily convert temperature, from one scale to another.
 Converting from celsius to kelvin.
 Temperature in celsius, + 273.15 is temperature in kelvin.
 So, in the kelvin scale,
 freezing point  of water, is 273.15 degree kelvin,
 boiling point of water, is 373.15 degree kelvin.

 Converting from Fahrenheit to celsius.
 Degrees celsius = open bracket, degree fahrenheit minus 32, close bracket,
 multiplied by 5 by 9.
 Examples.
 Open bracket, 32 degree fahrenheit minus 32 Close bracket, 
 multiplied by,  5 by 9 .
 = 0 degrees ‘c’.
 So, 32 degree fahrenheit = 0 degree celsius.

 Open bracket, 212 degree fahrenheit minus 32 Close bracket,
 multiplied by, 5 by 9.
 = 100 degrees ‘c’.
 So, 212 degree fahrenheit = 100 degrees celsius.

 The normal human body temperature, is 98.6 degrees fahrenheit.
 Open bracket, 98.6 degree fahrenheit minus 32 Close bracket,
  multiplied by, 5 by 9.
 = 37 degrees ‘c’.
 So, 98.6 degree fahrenheit = 37 degrees celsius.

 
== Thermometer. ==

 A thermometer, is used to measure temperature.
 A thermometer, can measure temperature, within a given range.
 A clinical thermometer, is used to measure body temperature.
 This is normally, about 37 degrees celsius, 
 or, 98.6 degrees fahrenheit.
 The clinical thermometer, has mercury enclosed in a thin glass tube.
 When the temperature increases, the mercury expands.
 The thermometer is calibrated, to show the expanded mercury level, 
 as degrees of temperature.

 
== Sample temperatures. ==

 The temperatures, on earth varies depending on location, season, etc.
 The average temperature is about 15 degrees celsius.
 One of the hottest temperature recorded, 
 was about 57 degrees celsius, in death valley California.
 The coldest temperature recorded, 
 was about minus 89 degrees celsius, in Antarctica.
 The temperature in an incandescent lamp, is about 2200 degrees celsius.
 The temperature in the sun, is many million degrees.
 Surprisingly, the temperature in outer space, is about 2.7 degrees kelvin,
 which is about, minus 270 degrees celsius.
 This is close to absolute 0.
 We are aware that  absolute 0, is the lowest temperature possible.
 When the temperature in the sun is many million degrees, 
 It may cause us to wonder, why outer space is so ultra cold.
 This is because, outer space is a vacuum. 
 It has no substances.
 The sun’s rays travel in outer space, without altering the temperature,
 because, there is no substance to heat up, in outer space.
 When the sun’s rays reach the earth, they heat up the atmosphere, the oceans,
 and the earth.
 The atmosphere, the oceans, and the earth, are substances, 
 which are amenable of getting heated.
 This is how, the heat from the sun, is transferred to earth.

 When a thermo nuclear weapon explodes, the temperature can reach, many million degrees.
 At this temperature, most substances evaporate.
 When the first nuclear bomb, was exploded over Hiroshima,
 thousands of people just evaporated.


 
== Thermal properties. ==

 Heat affects all matter, in a basic way.
 This happens at the molecular level.
 When heat is applied to a substance, the molecules get excited.
 That is, kinetic energy of the molecules increase.
 This happens to all substances.
 But the effect of heat, on a substance, varies from substance to substance.
 So scientists, have studied the effect of heat, of all commonly used substances.
 Every substance has unique thermal properties.
 The Thermal properties, of each substance, is well documented.
 We will discuss, some of the important thermal properties, of a substance.

 
== Heat Capacity. ==

 The amount of introduced heat,
 to effect a given temperature change, 
 is called the heat capacity of the material.
 If delta Q, is the increase in heat, 
 and delta T, is the increase in temperature,
 then heat capacity, C, = delta Q by delta T.
 Heat capacity is expressed, in Joules per celsius.

 
== Specific Heat. ==

 The specific heat of a substance, is the quantity of heat, 
 required to raise the temperature, of  a unit mass of the substance,
 by a unit of  temperature.
 Specific heat capacity = heat capacity of the body, divided by the mass of the body.

 Specific heat is expressed as joules per kg degree kelvin.
 For example, the specific heat of water, 
 is 4186 joules, per kg degree kelvin.
 This means, that it requires 4186 joules of heat, to raise the temperature,
 of 1 kg of water, by 1 degree kelvin or celsius.

 The specific heat of Aluminium, is 900 joules per kg degree kelvin.
 This means that Aluminium, will heat up faster than Water. 
 The specific heat of Gold, is 134 joules per kg degree kelvin.
 This means that Gold, will heat up much faster than Aluminium.

 
== Thermal conductivity. ==

 The property of a material, to conduct heat, is called thermal conductivity.
 Some such materials, are good conductors of heat.
 For example, Copper, Iron, Aluminium are  good conductors of heat.
 Some material resists conduction of heat. 
 They are also called as insulators.
 Examples are, porcelain, glass, wool, etc.
 We wear woollen clothing in winter, to help retain body warmth.

 
== Latent heat. ==

 A substance can exists as a solid, liquid, or a gas.
 For example, water can exists as ice, water, or as water vapour.
 These are called, states of matter.
 When matter changes from one state to another, it is called a phase transition.
 For example, when water becomes water vapour, it is a phase transition.
 When water becomes ice, it is a phase transition.
 This process of phase transition, always involves heat.
 But there is a interesting, and an important difference, of the effect of heat.
 Normally heat results, in a change of temperature. 
 In a phase transition,heat is transferred, without a change of temperature.
 For example, when water is boiled, to 100 degree celsius,
 water undergoes, phase transition to water vapour, at 100 degree celsius.
 There is  no change in temperature, but the water vapour carries the heat.
 This heat is called the latent heat, of vaporisation.
 Similarly, when ice at  0 degree celsius melts,
 it undergoes a phase transition to water,  at 0 degree celsius.
 There is no change of temperature, but heat is absorbed, from the  water.
 This is called the Latent heat of fusion.
 Every substance will have, a unique latent heat of vaporisation, and fusion.
 This is measured by the specific latent heat, L.
 The specific latent heat, is the amount of heat, Q.
 required to effect a phase change, 
 of a unit of mass, m, usually in kg.
 Latent heat, L = heat, Q, divided by mass,m.
 It is expressed in kilo joules, per kg.
 or, Q is = to m into L.
 Every substance will have a unique specific latent heat of fusion,
 and a specific latent heat of vaporisation.
 For example, the latent heat of water fusion, is 334 kilo joules, per kg.
 Latent heat of water vaporisation is 2260 kilo joules, per kg.
 In other words 2260 kilo joules of heat, is required, 
 to convert 1 kg of water, at 100 degree celsius, 
 to water vapour at 100 degree celsius.

 
== Thermal expansion. ==

 Thermal expansion, is the tendency of matter, to change in volume, 
 in response to change in temperature, through heat transfer.

 Thermal expansion properties, vary from substance to substance.
 Every substance will have, a unique thermal expansion property.
 This property is measured, by the coefficient of thermal expansion.
 The coefficient of thermal expansion, of a given substance, 
 is the degree of expansion, divided by the change in temperature.

 
== Thermal expansion of Solids. ==

 A solid is characterised by structural rigidity, 
 and resistance, to change of shape, or volume.
 The atoms in a solid, are tightly bound to each other.
 The atoms in the solid, vibrate.
 When a solid is heated, this vibration increases.
 Since this vibration is at the atomic level, we cannot see it.
 We can only feel the heat, of the solid.

 Solids conduct heat by thermal conduction.
 Heat  diffuses from one part of a solid, to other parts, in a linear way.
 If we heat one end, of a metal wire,
 the heat will diffuse to the other end.
 Capacity to conduct heat, is called as thermal conductivity.

 Solids expand on heating.
 When this expansion, is measured in one direction,
 it is called as, the coefficient of linear expansion.
 The coefficient of linear expansion, is the increase in length, divided by original length,
 per degree kelvin.
 If a rod, of length L1 is heated, by one degree kelvin,
 expands to length L2, the coefficient of linear expansion, 
 Alpha is =, L2 minus L1, divided by L1, per degree kelvin.
 For example, the coefficient of linear expansion of steel,
 is about 12, divided by 10 power 6, per degree kelvin.
 Let us take a railway track, 100 meters in length, and heat it, by 2 degree kelvin.
 So, the expansion will be 12 multiplied by 100, multiplied by 2, divided by 10 power 6 meters.
 To convert to millimetre, we can multiply by 1000, which will be 2.4 millimetres.
 So, a hundred meter railway track, if heated by 2 degree kelvin, will expand by 2.4 millimetres.
 This is the reason, engineers leave a small gap in the railway track, to allow for thermal expansion.
 You would have also noticed, electric wires sag in summer, due to thermal expansion.

 A solid plate has a length and breadth, and an area,
 it also expands by heating.
 If the plate expands, when heated by 1 degree kelvin, from area A1 to A2,
 coefficient of area expansion, Beta, will be A2 minus A1, divided by A1, per degree kelvin.
 Coefficient of area expansion, Beta, is always twice, 
 coefficient of linear expansion, Alpha.
 Beta is = 2 Alpha.

 A solid object has volume.
 It also expands by heating.
 If a solid object expands, when heated by one degree kelvin, from volume V1 to V2,
 the coefficient of volume expansion, Gamma, 
 Is V2 minus V1, divided by V1,   per degree kelvin.
 Coefficient of volume expansion, Gamma, is always thrice,
 coefficient of Linear expansion, Alpha.
 Gamma is = 3 Alpha.


 
== Thermal Convection. ==

 In liquid and gases, heat is conducted, through thermal convection.
 If we heat a vessel containing water, the temperature of the water,
 at the bottom of the vessel increases.
 These heated water molecules move up, and colder water on top,
 moves down.
 This process continues, till all the water reaches the same temperature.
 The process of thermal convection can be observed.
 There is a physical movement of water molecules.
 This kind of movement, is not possible in solids.

 A similar process happens in gases also.
 When a gas is heated, its volume increases.
 Its density decreases.
 It becomes lighter.
 The heated gas, moves up.
 The colder gas, moves down.

== Heat and Planet Earth. ==

 Heat plays a major role on life on Planet Earth.
 Many factors are involved in this.

== Goldilock Zone. ==

 The sun is the source of energy,
 for all the planets in the solar system.
 The Earth is one of the planets, in the solar system.
 The Earth’s orbit around the Sun, is not too close to the Sun.
 That would have made the Earth, unbearably hot.
 It is also not too far away from the Sun.
 That would have made the Earth too cold.
 The Earth is just about the right distance from the Sun.
 It is said to be in the Goldilock Zone.
 Life does not exist, in any other planet in the solar system.
 Earth being in the Goldilock Zone, is blessed with life.

 
== Sunlight. ==

 The largest source of heat, to planet earth, is sunlight.
 The earth receives, about 120 watts of solar radiation, per square meter.
 The total solar energy absorbed by the earth’s atmosphere, oceans, and land,
 is about, 385 thousand exajoules, per year.
 One exa joule is equal to 10 power 18 joules.
 More energy comes from sunlight  in one hour, 
 than the energy, used by the whole world, in one year.
 Photosynthesis captures about 3000 exajoules, per year, in bio mass.
 That is, plants and trees, absorb this energy, and convert it into biomass.
 This is a very small fraction, of the energy we receive from the sun.
 Most of the absorbed energy from the sunlight, is converted to heat energy.
 This plays a major role in life on the planet.

== Atmosphere. ==

 The atmosphere absorbs a significant portion of the sun’s energy.
 The earth rotates, on it’s axis, every 24 hours.
 So, we have day time and night time.
 During day time, we receive sunlight, or solar energy.
 During night time this is missing.
 Normally this would cause, a wild fluctuation, between day and night temperatures.
 Fortunately, the earth is surrounded, by a blanket of air, we call the atmosphere.
 The atmosphere acts as a giant temperature regulator, for earth.
 It helps in retaining the heat, that is absorbed.
 This is called the green house effect.
 Without the atmosphere, the earth will become extremely hot during the day,
 and extremely cold during the night.
 That is, without the atmosphere, we will boil during day time,
 and freeze during night time.

 
== Equator and Poles. ==

 Maximum sunlight is received at the Equator.
 The North pole and the South pole, receive very little sunlight.
 The arctic region, around the North pole, is very cold through out the year.
 The antarctic region, around the South pole, is also very cold through out the year.
 The region between 33.5 degree North latitude,
 and 33.5 degree South latitude, is called the tropics.
 The tropics are close to the equator.
 Since this region, receives a lot of sunlight, 
 It is relatively warm through out the year.
 Summer can be very warm in the tropics.

== Altitude. ==

 At higher altitudes, air pressure reduces.
 The temperature also drops, at higher altitudes.
 The temperature decreases, by about 6.4 degree centigrade,
 for every kilometre, of increase in altitude.
 That is why it is relatively cool, in hill stations.
 Mount Everest is more than 8 km in height.
 The peak of Everest is so cold, 
 that it is always snow capped, through out the year.

 
== Seasons. ==

 The Earth orbits the sun, once in a year.
 The axis of the Earth is tilted.
 Due to this, the northern and southern hemisphere, 
 receive differential sunlight, or solar energy.
 During the northern summer, the northern hemisphere,
 receives more sunlight.
 During the same time, the southern hemisphere, receives less sunlight.
 It experiences winter.
 The opposite happens, during the northern winter.
 In northern hemisphere, receives less sunlight, and experiences winter.
 During the same time, the southern hemisphere, experiences summer.


 
== Weather. ==

 The weather keeps changing, from place to place,
 and from season to season.
 Local weather conditions, depend on many factors.
 Heat plays a major role, directly or indirectly, in determining weather conditions.

 Due to the tilt in the axis of the earth, the air in the atmosphere, 
 gets differentially heated, in the northern and southern hemisphere.
 This difference in temperature, causes air currents.
 Warm air moves to cooler regions, and vice versa.
 When the Air crosses, the oceans, it picks up moisture.
 This can precipitate as rain or snow.
 The air in the atmosphere, is constantly on the move, 
 due to differences in temperature.
 These air currents have a pattern, which can be studied.

 70% of the earths surface, comprises of oceans.
 The water in the oceans, act as a vast reservoir, of heat.
 It absorbs sunlight, and solar energy.
 This warms up the water in the ocean.
 This warming up also happens differentially.
 Some parts of the oceans warm up more, and some less.
 This causes ocean currents.
 Warm water moves towards cooler areas, and vice versa.
 The water in the oceans are constantly on the move.
 These are called ocean currents, and follow a pattern.
 Ocean current influences, weather conditions.

 Weather is a resultant of many factors, which are interrelated, in a complex way.
 The study of weather, is a science by itself.
 It is called Meteorology.
 Meteorological scientists, use super computers to study weather.
 But even then, we still cannot predict weather accurately.

== Fossil Fuels. ==

 To sustain our life style, we need a lot of man made energy.
 Energy is required, by Households, and by Industry.
 We derive this energy, directly or indirectly, from fossil fuels.
 Examples of fossil fuels are coal, petroleum, and natural gas.
 Fossil fuels were created by nature, millions of years of ago.
 They are not renewable.
 They have potential thermal energy.
 When fossil fuels under go combustion, they release heat, or thermal energy.
 This thermal energy, can be converted, and used in a many ways. 
 In vehicles like trains or cars, we burn diesel or petrol, to provide locomotive energy.
 Thermal power plants use coal or natural gas.
 This is burnt to heat water, and produce steam.
 Steam is used to drive turbines.
 These turbines produce electrical energy.
 Electrical energy, is the most widely used man made energy.
 Fossil Fuels are used to produce this energy.
 More than 86% of our man made energy requirements,
 comes from fossil fuels.

 
== Global Warming. ==

 When fossil fuel is burnt, it releases polluting gases.
 Chief among this is carbon dioxide.
 Gases like carbon dioxide, and methane are called green house gases.
 The earth’s atmosphere, reflects about 30% of the energy it receives,
 back into space.
 Man made green house gases, accumulate in the atmosphere.
 These green house gases, reflect the heat, from the earth’s surface,
 back to earth.
 This effect is called as the green house phenomena.

 Since the Industrial revolution, green house gases have been accumulating,
 in the atmosphere.
 This is causing increased intension of heat, in the earth.
 This is causing the Earth, to warm up, more than normal.
 Global warming, as this called, has many negative impacts, 
 on the Earth’s environment.
 Global warming can cause extreme weather incidents.
 It can cause floods and drought.
 It can result in the rising of the sea levels of the oceans,
 which can cause Submersion of land, in coastal areas.
 Only now, countries have began to wake up, to the seriousness of the threat,
 of Global warming.
 Most countries, have now come to an informal understanding, 
 to limit emission of green house gases, by 2020,
 which will limit global warming,  to 2 degrees centigrade.

 Scientists and Engineers, in the future, not only have to be, 
 inventive and innovative, they also need to be, ecologically sensitive.
 Future development, for our own good, has to be eco friendly.

* On 10 October 2010 (10.10.10) the Netherlands Antilles dissolved with the various islands going in different political directions. The islands of Bonaire, St. Eustatius, and Saba voted to fully merge with The Netherlands and now have status as overseas municipalities. Their currency however is the U.S. dollar rather than the euro. Their stamps therefore are distinct from those of the European homeland.

* For issues prior to 10.10.10, see NETHERLANDS ANTILLES.

                                             The Two Frogs
                                                   edited by David Ashilman

Once upon a time in the country of Japan there lived two frogs, one of whom made his home in a ditch near the town of Osaka, on the sea coast, while the other dwelt in a clear little stream which ran through the city of Kyoto. At such a great distance apart, they had never even heard of each other; but, funnily enough, the idea came into both their heads at once that they should like to see a little of the world, and the frog who lived at Kyoto wanted to visit Osaka, and the frog who lived at Osaka wished to go to Kyoto, where the great Mikado had his palace.
So one fine morning in the spring they both set out along the road that led from Kyoto to Osaka, one from one end and the other from the other. The journey was more tiring than they expected, for they did not know much about traveling, and halfway between the two towns there arose a mountain which had to be climbed. It took them a long time and a great many hops to reach the top, but there they were at last, and what was the surprise of each to see another frog before him!

They looked at each other for a moment without speaking, and then fell into conversation, explaining the cause of their meeting so far from their homes. It was delightful to find that they both felt the same wish--to learn a little more of their native country--and as there was no sort of hurry they stretched themselves out in a cool, damp place, and agreed that they would have a good rest before they parted to go their ways.

&quot;What a pity we are not bigger,&quot; said the Osaka frog; &quot;for then we could see both towns from here, and tell if it is worth our while going on.&quot;

&quot;Oh, that is easily managed,&quot; returned the Kyoto frog. &quot;We have only got to stand up on our hind legs, and hold onto each other, and then we can each look at the town he is traveling to.&quot;

This idea pleased the Osaka frog so much that he at once jumped up and put his front paws on the shoulder of his friend, who had risen also. There they both stood, stretching themselves as high as they could, and holding each other tightly, so that they might not fall down. The Kyoto frog turned his nose towards Osaka, and the Osaka frog turned his nose towards Kyoto; but the foolish things forgot that when they stood up their great eyes lay in the backs of their heads, and that though their noses might point to the places to which they wanted to go, their eyes beheld the places from which they had come.

&quot;Dear me!&quot; cried the Osaka frog, &quot;Kyoto is exactly like Osaka. It is certainly not worth such a long journey. I shall go home!&quot;

&quot;If I had had any idea that Osaka was only a copy of Kyoto I should never have traveled all this way,&quot; exclaimed the frog from Kyoto, and as he spoke he took his hands from his friend's shoulders, and they both fell down on the grass. Then they took a polite farewell of each other, and set off for home again, and to the end of their lives they believed that Osaka and Kyoto, which are as different to look at as two towns can be, were as alike as two peas.&lt;/</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Reshape the book ==
I think that this book can be used to streamline the category and to absorb many of the other minor works or have some sizeable over the topic content moved to other books. It misses much information from the evolution of Hardware, the networks software and the transfer media and goes too deep in areas that are already covered in other topical works. I would like to see the TCPIP evolution discussed as the OSI model the RFCs and pertinent algorithms (like the [[w:Nagle's algorithm]]), in a way that moves the work from a collage of subjects without any flow into something better. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 22:00, 2 August 2014 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello, I initially started this wikibook to do something to help bring economics and Catholic social teaching into better communication with each other. Although my education is in economics and that's where I mainly plan to contribute to this wiki, I decided to broaden the topics out a bit for a couple reasons. Other social sciences have a lot to contribute to understanding the relationship between economics and Catholic doctrine, and I'm also just very interested in the intersection of Catholic doctrine with other sciences.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I've done a little (very little) thinking about how many potential users of this wiki there are. I think of it being of interest mainly to Catholics with some postgraduate education, especially Catholic grad students in theology or social sciences (like me). I imagine isolated Catholic students in departments with atmospheres vaguely mocking of religious belief, some of them passionate about integrating their faith with their scientific ideas and some of them only loosely connected to the Church they were raised in but occasionally curious about its teachings..

For now, I'm just having fun organizing my own thoughts on these fascinating topics. It will just be a bonus if some others feel passionate and confident enough to contribute as well.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Earthquake Formation ==
=== At Plate Boundaries ===
[[File:Epicenter_Diagram.svg|thumb|250px|right]]
# At destructive/constructive/conservative plate boundaries, plates move towards/move away from/slide past/ each other because of compressional/tensional/lateral force.
# The plates are held back by friction.
# Stress builds up in the plates.
# As the stress accumulates, it will eventually exceed the friction created.
# The land shakes and seismic waves are erupted from the '''focus''' of the earthquake.

Note that:
* The point on the earth's surface directly above the focus is called the epicentre, and receives the most damage
* When plates collide with or slide past each other, more friction is created, so destructive and conservative plate boundaries experience more frequent earthquakes.

=== Intraplate Earthquakes ===
#New magma convection currents may appear in the asthenosphere.
# This causes the plate to break up and create a new boundary.
# During this process, earthquakes may be triggered by fault rupture or displacement in fault zones.

The East African Rift Valley is sinking below the Nubian and Somalian portions of the African Plate, which are splitting along fault lines. Friction accumulates at the fault plane and causes earthquakes.

=== Other Causes ===
Other causes of earthquakes include (CE08Q16):
* Volcanic eruptions release enough energy to shake the ground.
* Underground nuclear tests release enough energy to shake the ground (e.g. North Korea).
* The construction of large-scale reservoirs will change the amount of pressure on the ground, leading to earthquakes.

== Formation of Volcanic Eruptions ==
=== Along Destructive Plate Boundaries ===
# Converging magma currents in the magma build up pressure at destructive plate boundaries by compressional force.
# At oceanic-continental or oceanic-oceanic boundaries, the melting of the subduced plate below the subduction zone intensifies the pressure.
# Cracks develop, possibly because of earthquakes, and extend downward to the magma chamber.
# The magma pressure is released.
# The magma rises through cracks to the earth's surface.

=== Along Constructive Plate Boundaries ===
# Diverging magma currents in the magma cause two plates to drift apart from one another, leaving a gap in between.
# Lava wells out of the gap to fill it, causing vulcanicity.

Note： Water pressure above the sea floor suppresses volcanic activity, so volcanic activity here is not as violent.

=== At Hot Spots ===
[[File:Hawaje-NoRedLine.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Note how the movement of the Pacific Plate is related to the shape of the Hawaiian Islands.]]
[[File:Mauna_Loa_Volcano.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Mauna Loa is the currently active Hawaiian volcano. The other four volcanoes are now extinct as they have moved away from the hot spot.]]
Certain points in the mantle experience concentrated amounts of pressure. These are called '''hot spots''' ('''mantle plumes''') and were tested in the HKDSE Practice Paper.
# When lines of weakness appear in the earth crust and extend to the hot spot below, magma pressure is released.
# Magma rises through the cracks to the earth's surface.
# Extrusive vulcanicity occurs.
Then volcanic islands are formed (materials in round brackets are related only to the Hawaiian Islands):
# Lava continuously extrudes to the earth's surface above the hot spot.
# As lava cools and solidifies, volcanoes are created and grown above sea level.
# Hot spots are fixed in location.
# When the plate moves (e.g. the Pacific Plate moves northwest), the volcano is carried away from the hot spot.
# The volcano will become extinct.
# A new volcano is formed at the hot spot (e.g. at the southeast of the original volcano). A volcanic island chain (Hawaii) is formed.

== Formation of Tsunamis ==
=== Submarine Earthquakes ===
# The plates are held back by friction.
# Stress builds up in the plates.
# As the stress accumulates, it will eventually exceed the friction created.
# The land shakes and seismic waves are erupted from the '''focus''' of the earthquake.
# If the earthquake originated close to a seabed, rocks are displaced vertically and sea floor deformation occurs.
# Water is displaced to create big waves.
Not all submarine earthquakes trigger tsunamis. Only the major ones do.

=== Submarine Volcanic Eruptions ===
Very severe submarine volcanic eruptions cause the displacement of water, causing tsunamis.
{{Robox|theme=4|title=Volcanic tsunamis are NOT common}}
CE06Q11 confirmed that tsunamis caused by submarine volcanic eruptions are NOT common.
{{Robox/Close}}

=== Submarine Landslides ===
Very severe submarine landslide cause the displacement of water, causing tsunamis.

      <text xml:space="preserve">When a continental crust collides with an oceanic crust, the denser oceanic crust always subducts into the mantle. Sedimentary rocks on the ocean floor are compressed, folded and pushed up to form a mountain belt parallel to the plate boundary, called a fold mountain range. An oceanic trench is also formed.

== Peru-Chile Trench (Nazca* + South American) ==
In a nutshell:
* A trench
* A fold mountain range
* Some volcanoes

# &lt;u&gt;Converging/sinking magma currents&lt;/u&gt; between the Nazca Plate and the South American Plate cause the two plates to &lt;u&gt;converge&lt;/u&gt; with each other under &lt;u&gt;compressional force&lt;/u&gt;. A &lt;u&gt;destructive plate boundary&lt;/u&gt; is formed.
# The Nazca Plate, which is &lt;u&gt;thinner, denser and oceanic&lt;/u&gt;, is &lt;u&gt;subducted&lt;/u&gt; under the &lt;u&gt;lighter, thicker, continental&lt;/u&gt; South American Plate into the &lt;u&gt;asthenosphere&lt;/u&gt;, where it is &lt;u&gt;melted&lt;/u&gt; and destroyed. A &lt;u&gt;subduction zone&lt;/u&gt; is formed.
# A long, narrow and deep undersea trough is formed along the subduction zone. It is an ocean trench called the '''Peru-Chile Trench'''.
# The ocean trench is filled with sediments.
# As the two plates push together, the sediments are compacted into sedimentary rock.
# The sedimentary rock is eventually compressed, bended and folded up to form the fold mountain range called the Andes.
# The subduction of the Nazca Plate causes earthquakes and leaves lines of weakness in the crust. The edge of the Nazca Plate is heated up, melted and reabsorbed into the mantle.
# At the subduction zone, magma undergoes great pressure because the melted crustal materials have lower pressure. It rises through the ocean floor or the fold mountains along the lines of weakness.
# Extrusive vulcanicity occurs. The erupted lava cools down to form volcanic rock. Over time, volcanoes form, e.g. Mt Chimborazo in Ecuador.

== Rockies (Pacific* + North American) ==
In a nutshell
* A fold mountain range
* Some volcanoes
* (These used to be a trench there, but it has now disappeared, so let's forget it.)
# &lt;u&gt;Converging/sinking magma currents&lt;/u&gt; between the Nazca Plate and the South American Plate cause the two plates to &lt;u&gt;converge&lt;/u&gt; with each other under &lt;u&gt;compressional force&lt;/u&gt;. A &lt;u&gt;destructive plate boundary&lt;/u&gt; is formed.

# The subduction of the Nazca Plate causes earthquakes and leaves lines of weakness in the crust. The edge of the Nazca Plate is heated up, melted and reabsorbed into the mantle.
# At the subduction zone, magma undergoes great pressure because magma has higher temperature and pressure than the melted crustal materials. It rises to the ocean floor or the fold mountains along the lines of weakness.
# Extrusive vulcanicity occurs.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Shanghai is China's biggest city, as well as one of the world's largest cities with the population of 23 million in 2010.  It is a directly governed city on the banks of the Chang Jiang River (also called Yangzi River).  The river flowing through Shanghai is called the Huangpu River.

Shanghai was not a major city until the 1800s, when it became a major trading port with Western countries.  It is the biggest port in the world.

Shanghai is one of China's most important cities.  Shanghai attracts many tourists each year.  Because Shanghai is so big and important and makes so much money, it is both a city and a province in China.

== Landforms ==
* Mid-oceanic ridges
* Rift valleys
* Transform faults
* Volcanoes

== Mid-Atlantic Zone (N/S American + Eurasian/African) ==
Landforms at a glance:
* Mid-oceanic ridge called the Mid-Atlantic Ridge
* Transform faults

# Diverging/Rising magma currents cause the North American, Cocos, Nazca and Antarctic Plates to move away from the Pacific Plate in the Pacific Ocean under tensional force
# A constructive plate boundary is formed. Magma wells up from the plate boundary to form a bulging zone.
# As the uprising and solidification of magma continues, newly-formed crust is gradually pushed away from the plate boundary by ridge push. This is sea-floor spreading.
# Repeated sea-floor spreading forms a mid-oceanic ridge called the '''Mid-Atlantic Ridge'''.
# When the adjacent flows of magma flow at different speeds, lateral force is exerted.
# The force breaks the mid-oceanic ridge and displaces the broken ridges relative to one another horizontally, forming '''transform faults'''.

== Southeast Pacific Zone (N American/Cocos/Nazca/Antarctic + Antarctic) ==
Landforms at a glance:
* Mid-oceanic ridge called the East Pacific Rise
* Rift valley
* Transform faults
* Volcanoes such as Easter Island (Pacific + Cocos)

# Diverging/Rising magma currents cause the N American, Cocos, Nazca and Antarctic Plates to move away from the Pacific Plate in the Pacific Ocean under tensional force
# A constructive plate boundary is formed and magma wells up from the plate boundary
# As the uprising and solidification of magma continues, old crust is gradually pushed away from the plate boundary by newly-formed crust. Parallel faults are created. This is called sea-floor spreading.
# Repeated sea-floor spreading forms a mid-oceanic ridge called the '''East Pacific Rise'''.
# When the adjacent flows of magma flow at different speeds, lateral force is created.
# The force breaks the mid-oceanic ridge and displaces the broken ridges to one another horizontally, forming '''transform faults'''.
# At the East Pacific Rise, the newly-formed ocean floor is more rigid.
# Cracks develop at the plate boundary. Tensional force causes normal faulting.
# The central block of the ridge sinks as downthrow because of gravity, forming the flat-bottomed rift valley.
# As plates move apart, cracks form. When the extend into the asthenosphere, the magma's pressure is released and magma rises to the earth's surface.
# Extrusive vulcanicity occurs. The erupted lava cools down to form volcanic rock. Over time, submarine volcanoes form.
# After repeated eruptions, some of the submarine volcanoes rise above sea level to become volcanic islands. One of them is Easter Island.

== East African Rift Valley (African + Arabian) ==
{{Robox|theme=2|title=East African Rift Valley}}
* Runs from Mozambique to the Red Sea
* 4000 km long
* 10-50 km wide
* Sides are &gt;600 m in height
{{Robox/Close}}
# Diverging magma currents in the mantle pull the African and Arabian Plates apart at the Red Sea by tensional forces.
# Faults are formed in the middle and the crust is split into huge blocks.
# As the two crusts move further apart, the central blocks sink as downthrow because of gravity, forming the rift valley. The two outer blocks become upthrow.
# Volcanoes can be found along the rift valley as magma rises up through lines of weakness, e.g. Mount Kilimanjaro.
# Lakes are found at deeper locations of the rift valley, e.g. Lake Victoria.

It occurs as follows:
# Geological phenomena are '''monitored'''.
# When '''anomalies''' are detected, scientists may '''predict''' a hazard.
# They issue '''warnings'''.
# Emergency work is carried out, e.g. '''evacuation'''

The following are some possible measures:
* '''Seismographs''' and '''satellites''' detect earth movement
* '''Foreshocks''', abnormal animal behaviour and water table change are also precursors to earthquakes
* Seismic activity, water table change and volcano characteristics (e.g. unusual gases emitted, tilting, swelling, shaking, temperature and pressure change) are precursors to volcanic eruptions
* '''Ocean-bottom tsunami gauges''' and '''buoys satellites''' monitor the heights of waves in oceans.
* International warning systems (e.g. Pacific Tsunami Warning System, Regional Tsunami Warning and Mitigation System for the Indian Ocean) detects submarine earthquakes. It issues warnings to countries around the respective oceans.

{{Robox|theme=2|title=Failures and Successes}}
Failed:
* Italian earthquake in 2012
* 2004 Boxing Day tsunami
Succeeded:
* Sumatran earthquake in 2005
* Mt Pinatubo eruption
* Mount St Helens eruption 1980
Succeeded, but still with disastrous results:
* 2011 Japanese earthquake + tsunami
{{Robox/Close}}

== Building Design ==
[[File:Snapshot of base isolation effect.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The building model on the right uses base isolation. It does not wobble during the simulated earthquake.]]

This includes
* Developing technologies and '''quake-proof designs'''
̈* Legislation that mandates such designs.

Here are some examplesː
* Sea walls in Japan can block tsunami waves.
* High platforms can be used for evacuation.
* In Hawaii, car parks are found on the ground floors of buildings to allow water to pass during tsunamis.
* In volcanic regions, walls are erected to block incoming lava.
* Roofs of houses are often covered in ash and may thus collapse during volcanic eruptions. Thus sloping roofs are used to shed ash.
* In earthquake-prone areas, using steel frames, soft storeys (i.e. more flexible materials) base isolation, vibration control and other earthquake-proof designs can increase the ability of a building to withstand earthquakes.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello, and thanks for your contribution to the catalog. I have rolled back your change to Great Britain Type HB5.5 because the stamp appears to be on tape that was cut too short to show the entire stamp which would have incuded the two columns of numbers at left of the town mark.

OK, but I have another one parcel label.
Both labels aren't cutted from envelopes, they are stickers.
[[File:PB556346 0265 Bristol 2013-04-08 HB5.5.jpg|left|Postage Meter Stamp for Parcel, Bristol, 2013]]



The stickers are too short to contain the entire stamp.

And what about the next sticker in roll? Waste?
If the columns of characters are without fail why is there the empty space at the right side of sticker?


I don't know. I do know that the machine always prints the two columns of numbers. If you want verification of this you might want to contact Alistair Nixon who is editor of the British &quot;Meter News&quot;. You can contact Alistair through his website:  http://www.meterfranking.co.uk/

Good luck.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The Tropical Rainforest Biome ==
[[File:Vegetation.png|850px]]

Tropical rainforests are a '''biome'''. A biome is an area that has similar climatic characteristics and thus gives rise to similar vegetation.

However, a place located in the tropical rainforest biome does not necessarily have tropical rainforests. This is because the area may not have been matured enough, or may have been damaged by natural disasters or human activities.

Biomes are as follows:

In this section, we will study the tropical rainforest as a biome, and look at the general characteristics of tropical rainforest. In the next section we shall study it as an ecosystem.

== Distrubution ==
Tropical rainforests are distributed in three major areas:
* East Africa. Most of the tropical rainforests are found at the '''Congo Basin'''.
* South America. Most of the tropical rainforests are found at the '''Amazon Basin'''.
* Southeast Asia.

The rest are scattered around the globe.

This diagram shows tropical rainforests in dark green (areas in light green are temperate forests):

[[File:Rain forest location map.png|750px]]

Note how the regions here are smaller than the tropical rainforest biome regions we saw above.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Most tropical rainforests have '''tropical maritime climate''' or '''equatorial climate'''. The properties are discussed below.

In this page, we discuss only the general climate of rainforests. Rainforests have a set of distinct microclimates within them, and we will discuss this later.

== Insolation and Temperature ==
Tropical rainforests have the following climatic characteristics:
* Intense '''insolation''', at least 10 hours a day
** Because they are located in equatorial regions
* High annual mean temperature: 26°C
** Because they are located in equatorial regions
* Small diurnal range of temperature - 7-8°C
** Because the dense cloud cover produces a blanket effect
* Small annual range of temperature - 2-4°C
** Because of the small annual range of insolation in equatorial areas
*** Result: Lack of seasonality - no distinct winter

As a result of high insolation, evapotranspiration rate is also high.

Detailed explanations for the above patterns can be found in M7 and E2.

== Rainfall ==
Tropical rainforests have the following rainfall patterns:
* High annual rainfall, above 2000m, and exceeds evapotranspiration
* Lack of seasonal patterns in rainfall, rainfall is evenly distributed throughout the year
** Result: Lack of seasonality - no dry season
**'''Exception''': In tropical monsoon regions, there is more rainfall in summer.

Rain usually occurs as '''showers''' or '''thunderstorms'''.

== Relative Humidity ==
Tropical rainforests have high relative humidity. We will look at exact numbers in the microclimate section.

== Winds ==
Wind is generally weak in tropical rainforests because of the dense vegetation cover.
*Exception: In monsoon areas, onshore and offshore monsoon winds are frequent.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In tropical rainforests, because of the high temperature and rainfall, infiltration is rapid, and thus '''chemical weathering''' of the bedrock occurs rapidly. For example, carbon dioxide, sulphur dioxide and humic acid are dissolved in rainwater to form solutions which wear the rock. Organic acids (from living plants) and humic acids (from dead plants) also wear the rock. As the bedrock is weathered, they turn into regolith and then soil. This process is covered in E1.

The soil characteristics of tropical rainforests are summed up in this table:

      <text xml:space="preserve">Luxuriant vegetation is found in tropical rainforests because of the luxuriant sunlight and rainfall. The characteristics of vegetation here is often tested in examinations and should be studied in detail.

== Biomass and Biodiversity ==
{{Dbox|Biomass|the total dry weight of dead organic matter in an area.}}
Biomass is a measure of the volume of organisms in an area. Imagine you take all the plants in a unit area, kill them, dry them, and weigh them. This is biomass.

Tropical rainforests have large biomass because of the abundant rainfall and sunlight.

{{Dbox|Biodiversity|the variety of plant and animal '''species''' in an areas}}
A '''species''' is a type of animal, e.g. dog, cat, cattle, sheep. The more species we can find in a unit area, the higher the biodiversity. In tropical rainforests, the biodiversity is the largest among all the biomes. There are several reasons leading to this:
* Abundant sunlight and rainfall is present.
* ''Interspecies competition'' occurs. Different organisms in tropical rainforests compete for different resources. In the end, the resources may be divided, e.g. Animal A takes Shelter A and Animal B takes Shelter B. (This is not biology, so we will not go into details.)
* The tropical rainforest provides a diverse range of habitats as the vegetation is stratified (see below).

== Stratification of Vegetation ==
[[File:Sademets%C3%A4n_rakenne.gif|right|The five layers of a tropical rainforest. Just ignore the foreign text here, and focus on the trees and the numbers.|thumb|500px]]
The tropical rainforest is divided into five '''strata''', each with its own characteristics. (Refer to the figure on the right.)
* '''Emergent layer''': The highest layer, 40-50 m above the ground. Trees are widely spaced.
* '''Canopy layer''': The second layer, 30-40 m above the ground. Trees are '''continuous'''.
* '''Understorey/Young tree layer''': The third layer, 20-30 m above the ground. Tree seedlings of the above layers are sparse.
* '''Shrub layer''': The fourth layer, 10-20 m above the ground. Shrubs and tree seedlings of the above layers are sparse.
* '''Undergrowth''': The bottom layer, on the forest floor. Ferns, fungi, etc., are sparse.

== Vegetation Characteristics ==
There are numerous vegetation characteristics to be memorised:
{| class=&quot;wikitable sortable&quot;
! Layer !! Characteristic !! Explanation 
|-
| General || '''Evergreen'''&lt;ref&gt;Some plants are '''deciduous''' and only shed leaves in autumn.&lt;/ref&gt; - no seasonal pattern in defoliation, new leaves quickly replace shed leaves; no seasonal pattern in flowering or fruiting || No seasonal pattern in insolation or rainfall
|-
| General || Low '''root-to-shoot ratio''' (1:4 to 1:5)/High '''shoot-to-root ratio'''(4:1 to 5:1) - Most of the biomass storage is in the above-ground part, little biomass in roots || Infertile soil, abundant insolation above the ground
|-
| General || '''Cauliflory''' - trunk flowers and fruits are found on the trunk and main branches || Pollination by wind is impossible, so they are made accessible to pollinators&lt;ref&gt;It refers to the process by which plants reproduce, involving the spreading of '''pollen'''&lt;/ref&gt; (insects who can pollinate the trunk) and animals which can eat the fruit
|-
| General || Broad leaves || Absorb more sunlight
|-
| General || '''Waxy''' leaves with drip-tips || Quickly shed rainwater when needed (high annual rainfall...). If the crown does not quickly shed rainwater, it may become too heavy because of the intercepted water, the leaves may be infected, and the water may inhibit sunlight penetration.
|-
| General || Thin bark || No need to protect the tree from the cold, facilitate transpiration
|-
| General || Smooth bark || Prevent lianas (see below) from climbing, shed water quickly
|-
| General || Shallow roots || All nutrients are concentrated on the topsoil, so shallow roots can absorb them more efficiently
|-
| Emergent || Wide, umbrella-shaped crowns&lt;ref&gt;Crowns are the top part of the trees with many branches and leaves. It is the defining characteristic of the five strata.&lt;/ref&gt; || Absorb more sunlight, space is abundant
|-
| Emergent || Discontinuous, widely-spaced crowns || Absorb more sunlight
|-
| Emergent, Canopy || Straight trunks || Support the plants
|-
| Emergent, Canopy || '''Buttress roots''' - roots that extend laterally, up to 4 m high || Absorb nutrients from a larger area, support the tree's great weight
|-
| Emergent, Canopy || Tall branches, appearing only on the top third of the trunk || Absorb more sunlight
|-
| Emergent, Canopy || Lighter leaves || It is easier to absorb sunlight on the emergent and canopy layers, so they have less chlorophyll
|-
| Emergent, Canopy || '''Heliophytes''' (sun-loving plants) ||More sunlight is available
|-
| Canopy || Rounded, oval-shaped crowns || Absorb more sunlight
|-
| Canopy || Continuous crowns || Absorb more sunlight
|-
| Canopy, Understorey (near rivers and streams) || Stilt roots || Support the trees
|-
| Understorey || Darker leaves || Absorb more sunlight with more chlorophyll
|-
| Understorey || Narrower crowns || Less sunlight available, so growth is hindered
|-
| Understorey || Slim trunks || Less support is needed
|-
| Understorey, shrub, undergrowth || Sparse vegetation || Insufficient sunlight for growth, relative humidity is too high and this hinders tranpiration
|-
| Shrub, undergrowth || '''Skiophytes''' (shade-loving plants) such as fungi, ferns || Less sunlight is available
|}
{{reflist}}

== Vegetation Types ==
* '''Woody plants''', including trees and woody shrubs, are found. They are '''heliophytes''' (sun-loving plants) who take advantage of the large amount of insolation.
* '''Ferns''' and '''fungi''' are '''skiophytes''' which grow well in the dark.
* Some plants rely on other plants (which are their '''hosts'''):
** '''Climbers''' grow on tall trees for physical support. They start at ground level, hook onto and climb along their hosts, and reach the canopy layer. They may spread to other trees to maximise the amount of sunlight received. '''Lianas''' are an example.
** '''Epiphytes''' are small shrubs or herbs that attach themselves on tree trunks or branches. They do not have roots in the soil, and have '''aerial roots''' that capture moisture from the air. They can then grow in the canopy layer and capture sunlight. They are harmless to their hosts.
** '''Stranglers/Strangler figs''' are the transitional species between lianas and epiphytes. They send their roots to the ground and surround the host trees. They grow rapidly and soon cover the crown of the hosts, blocking out their sunlight. The host will die so the strangler can inherit its place in the canopy.
** '''Parasites''' grow directly on their hosts, and absorb nutrients from them. Large amounts of litter in tropical rainforests provides a nutritious environment for parasites. '''Rafflesia''' is an example.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Portugal is a country in Southern Europe on the Iberian Peninsula. Portugal is the westernmost country of Europe. It is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the west and south, and by Spain to the north and east.

Portugal zaih Narn'ou de Iberia Bahndaao, shih Ouzhou zuih ximiahn de guorjia.  ximiahn her narnmiahn xiangliarn Dahxi Yarng, beeimiahn her dongmiahn jieraang Spain.

----

Three groups of islands in the Atlantic Ocean are also part of Portugal: the Azores (Açores), Madeira and the Savage Isles (Ilhas Selvagens). The Savage Isles are a small group of islands with nobody on them, controlled by Madeira. Portugal claims that Olivença is also part of its territory, but actually it is controlled by Spain.

Dahxi Yarng de Azores, Madeira her Savage qurndaao yee shih Portugal de liingtuu.  Savage Qurndaao shih yixie wurrern xiaaodaao, your Madeira guaanxiar.  Portugal shengcheng Olivença yee shih ta de liingtuu, keeshih beih Spain shirjih kohngzhih.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Various forms of natural resource extraction are performed in the tropical rainforests. 

== Hunting and Gathering ==
Hunting and gathering refers to the collection of food resources, such as wild animals, fish, and plant parts (such as shoots and roots), mainly for consumption.

{{Robox|theme=4|title=Is it agriculture?}}
Hunting and gathering is not a form of agriculture as there is no growing or grazing involved.
{{Robox/Close}}

=== Impacts ===
*Hunting and gathering is originally a sustainable practice as the indigenous tribes of the tropical rainforests are scarce in number.
*However, growing tribe populations have raised the level of destruction dealt by hunting and gathering, so their food sources are starting to thin out. 
*Some tribesmen and outsiders have begun to hunt endangered species such as the rhinoceros for commercial gain, threatening the biodiversity of the tropical rainforest in so doing.

== Hydro-Electric Power ==
Hydro-electric power can be extracted from rivers in tropical rainforests.

=== Impacts ===
*Aside from maintaining a steady supply of power, HEP has several other advantages: It facilitates navigation, prevents floods downstream, and so on.
*However, damming destroys the river's local ecosystem and the habitats of the aquatic life which originally inhabited it. 

{{Robox|theme=2|title=The Itaipu Dam}}
The Itaipu Dam is a joint venture between Brazil and Paraguay. Its power generated exceeds even the Sanxia dam. It serves 75% of Paraguay's energy, as well as 17% of Brazil's. ([http://www.itaipu.gov.br/en/energy/energy Source])
{{Robox/Close}}

== Commercial Logging/Lumbering ==
Logging has always occurred in tropical rainforests as small amounts of wood are used as firewood for heating and fuelwood for power generation. They may also be burnt into charcoal and sold in local markets. However, in recent years, corporations have massively increased the scale of logging to produce expensive exotic woods in the tropical rainforests. The wood is made into various products, including paper, furniture and construction materials. '''Teak''', '''rosewood''' and '''mahogany''' are examples of precious rainforest woods.

=== Impacts ===
The impacts of commercial logging will be discussed in the next chapter.

== Mining ==
Two types of mining are commonly practised in tropical rainforests:
* '''Alluvial mining''' refers to the extraction of minerals from alluvial deposits in rivers.
* '''Opencast mining''' refers to the extraction of minerals in a pit.

=== Impacts ===
* Alluvial mining pollutes rivers by disposing slag.
* Opencast mining destroys a large area of the tropical rainforest as all the vegetation and the topsoil of the mining site is removed. 
* On-site refining of minerals releases poisons such as '''mercury''' and '''cyanide''' into the rainforest soil, posing a public health risk.
* Mining disturbs the lives of tribespeople. Clashes between indigenous tribes and miners are frequent.

{{Robox|theme=2|title=Impacts of mining on Brazil}}
* 90% of the catch at Tapajós River have been found to be poisoned by mercury.
* The Brazilian military had to forcefully eject gold miners from the forest as they were disturbing the local tribes.
* 6100 sq. km of forest land is cleared every year in Carajas Mineral Province.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In the first sentence of the Preface, the phrase &quot;I found that there are a lot of good articles&quot; is confusing as to who &quot;I&quot; is. Since there were many contributors, if there is one person in charge (who apparently is the &quot;I&quot;), his or her name should be made clear at the beginning or end of the Preface.

This brings me to my next point, the confusion of whether to use &quot;he&quot; or &quot;she&quot; or &quot;he/she&quot; for the reader.</text>

* When a hazard appears infrequently in an area and with low intensity, people will choose to absorb losses.
* When a hazard exceeds the '''awareness threshold''', people will take notice of it. However, they will still accept the losses.
* When the frequency and magnitude of the hazard reaches the '''action threshold''', people will take measures to minimise the losses.
* When the hazard exceeds the '''intolerance threshold''', people will move away from the area.

== Other Perceptions ==
* Some believe hazards cannot occur in the same location twice, i.e. 'Lightning does not strike the same place twice.'
* Some believe that the occurence of hazard is controlled by a deity, and it is thus meaningless to attempt to evade it.
* Some may forget the possibility of a hazard after a long time, e.g. dormant volcanoes. 
* Some may believe the government provides sufficient production, and it is thus unnecessary to move out of the area.

      <comment>/* Further Reading */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== '''Introduction''' ==
Acquired speech and language disorders, i.e., aphasias, comprise varying degrees and combinations of deficits of speech production or comprehension, or even the complete loss of the ability to communicate. Besides speech, sign language (cf. Chapter 9) can also be affected by acquired language disorders. Acquired language disorders can affect phonology, syntax, lexical memory, or semantics and can also affect the ability to read and write. Most commonly, symptoms derive from neurological damage to the left hemisphere of the brain. Often (approx. 80%), this is caused by a stroke (cf. Subchapter Causes), resulting in an cerebral undersupply of blood (Schneider, Wehmeyer &amp;  Grötzbach, 2012). Complete recovery from acute states only rarely occurs without treatment, but logopedic therapy and various training methods have been proven effective in recent studies, even in chronic states or progressive forms, which had not been treated  acutely (e.g., Barthel, Meinzer, Djundja &amp; Rockstroh, 2008).
While aphasic symptoms have been reported since antiquity, e.g.,the earliest reported case of aphasia in the ancient Egyptian Edwin Smith Papyrus (Minagar, Ragheb &amp; Kelley, 2003), the discoveries of the functional speech areas and subsequent theorizing on the functional organization of the human brain in the late 19th century, mainly due to the pioneering work of Broca and Wernicke, led to the categorization and understanding of various speech disorders. Even more notable, these paved the way to modern neuroanatomy, which derived from developments of the localizationist-view (cf. Localizationist-view box) and as the American psychologist and historian Stanley Finger (2000) describes as the “[...] key turning point in the history of the brain sciences”. The initial two categories of aphasias were named after their founders, Paul Broca and Carl Wernicke. Therefore, the first section will illustrate the early historical advances in aphasiology and their taxonomy. Subsequently, the different types of aphasic syndromes and other acquired speech and language disorders will be described in detail, along with common causes, diagnostic procedures and therapeutic measures.

== '''Early Aphasiology''' ==


=== &lt;u&gt;Broca’s discoveries&lt;/u&gt; ===
[[File:xy.jpg|frame|none|''Figure 1:''' The preserved Brain of Broca’s  patient Leborgne “Tantan” located in Musée Dupuytren, Paris ]]


In 1861, Pierre Paul Broca (1824 - 1880), a French physician, surgeon, anatomist and anthropologist, visited an anthropology symposium about the localization of speech. There a colleague, Ernest Auburtin (son-in-law of Jean-Baptiste Bouillaud, a most famous and major supporter of the localizationist view) held a lecture. Afterwards, he talked to  Broca and described an interesting case concerning a patient named Leborgne. Broca was greatly interested in this case and asked Auburtin to examine Leborgne himself. Leborgne, called „Tantan“,had recovered from a left sided head injury and even though he was able to speak, yet could say nothing but the word“tan“. Although this was the only syllable he could express, it appeared as if he was still able to understand spoken words relatively well, judging from his reactions and intonation, and seemed to be irritated by the fact that he could not make himself understood. As Leborgne died, Broca made an autopsy and found a lesion of the left hemisphere in the frontolateral area (Figure 1). Broca concluded that the “centre of language” had to be localized in this specific cerebral area. This was consistent with other theories, as some of the proclaimers of the localizationist views had already suspected the area to be in the frontal lobe, albeit somewhere behind the eyes (Gibson, 1962). Modern examinations of the preserved brain of patient Leborgne showed that Broca, who decided not to make a dissection, located his “speech centre” area on the basis of the superficial lesion scars a bit too far in the frontolateral area. Modern brain mapping localizes Broca’s area more in the medial insula area, on the junction of the Rolandic and Sylvian fissure (Dronkers, Plaisant, Iba-Zizen &amp; Cabanis, 2007). Also remarkably is the fact that relatively late, based on many subsequent autopsies, Broca confirmed his suspicion concerning the left sided localization of the speech centre not until 1864.

{{TextBox|'''Localizationist-View'''

Earlier 1861,  additional publications by Broca, about the localization of speech attracted great attention as up this time two main streams of opinions dominated contemporary events. This again raised debates between the proponents of holistic concepts and the theoretists, who propagated a localization model and saw this through Broca’s results confirmed.
Before that, localizationists, supporting the Gall-Bouillaud thesis (i.e., localizaionist-view), and the disciples of the holistic view, were put in a stalemate situation, since no evidence for either theory could be found. Franz Joseph Gall (1758-1828) physician and anatomist and founder of phrenology (1809) had postulated that human characteristics can be attributed to specific regions inside the skull and could be measurable by its shape. While the latter was dismissed as quackery by most scientists, the idea, that topographical centres occupied specific functions was widely spread. Jean-Baptiste Bouillaud, a professor at the Charité in Paris was one of the most prominent supporters hereby. It has been documented that Bouillaud even offered a great amount of his own money to anyone  who could demonstrate a case with frontal lobe lesion and intact speech in order to falsify his believe of the localization of speech in the frontal lobe. Holistics on the other hand proclaimed that the brain dynamically works as a whole and cannot be defined by its parts. So although Broca himself said, he only wanted to attract attention to the phenomenon, he turned to be the central character of the localization theory adepts. This turned to be the general localizationist-view, stating a connection between the speech centre and that particular affected area of the left hemisphere. Also due to further examinations, the hypothesis of solely bilateral and symmetrical cerebral organization of the brain was largely refuted. It also marked the beginning of new concepts, such as beliefs of the „dominant” hemisphere, which spread widely and is still accepted today, as it is referred to speech or language dominance. Nevertheless a point should be conceded to the holistic critics of the localizationist. Modern examinations showed that the speech areas are not anatomically identical in all mankind and furthermore it is assumed that different neuronal and cortical structures assume a role as well. Also the lateralisation according to studies (cf. subchapter Causes) can differ, depending on the development phases, as well. Furthermore the (usually right) contra lateral hemisphere plays an minor part, but is still important in speech aspects, such as proper intonation and nuances of humor (Springer &amp; Deutsch, 1993).
.}}

Broca named the clinical pattern from the loss of speech due to a lesion in the  area he identified in his patients as „aphemie“. This name was criticized by his colleagues as „aphemie“ has a deprecatory  meaning of „disgraced“ in ancient Greek, and finally the definition „aphasia“ was agreed upon. Interestingly, a similar case was presented before, during a medical congress 1836 in Montpellier. Marc Dax, a less well-known French physician, presented a theory of a connection between stroke patients with right side paralysis and the loss of speech. At that time, little notice was taken of this report. Dax’ son accused Broca after his publications of using the reports from his father in order to claim the discovery as his own.  Broca denied any knowledge of Dax' reports and from the historical point of view, this accusation could never be finally settled. Because of the better clinical description of the resulting disorder, the asymmetric relation to the handedness, the clear distinction from purely motoric (cf. subchapter apraxia and dysarthria) language loss, and especially the more accurate hemispheric localization, however, the name of Broca remained associated with both the neuroanatomical area and the aphasic syndrome (Springer &amp; Deutsch, 1993; Obler &amp; Gjerlow, 1999).
=== &lt;u&gt;Wernicke‘s Sensory Aphasia and his Intercortical Connection Hypothesis&lt;/u&gt; ===
Whilst Broca focused on the expressive form of aphasia, he and other examiners almost completely neglected the comprehension deficits of language, that many of the individuals exhibited. These deficits often accompanied the aphatic syndromes, because in many cases the neurological impairment not only  affected Broca’s Area, but other regions in the brain, as well. In 1874, Carl Wernicke (1848-1905), a German neurologist, was the first who presented a region posterior to Broca’s area in the temporal lobe (more precisely in the posterior portion of the left superior temporal gyrus) that proved to be vital for the reception and comprehension of language. This area has since then become known as Wernicke’s area. Wernicke accepted Broca’s findings and assumed the two identified language areas to be complementary in their relevance for speech. Thus, while Broca’s area is responsible for the processing of motoric aspects of speech production, aspects of comprehension, i.e., the translation of phonemes, words, and sentences into a meaningful form, relied on an sensory area in the temporal lobe , which is linked to the motoric area.
Wernicke could demonstrate that lesions of the temporal gyrus would result in a different type of pathology, that he described as „sensory aphasia“. In contrast to Broca’s aphasia, individuals who had lesions in that area typically were fluent in speech, but had severe comprehension deficits. Additionally, these aphasics showed unique semantic characteristics, like a tendency to paraphrase, i.e., to produce so-called circumlocutions. Also, Wernicke’s aphasics exhibit phonematic or semantic substitution of phonemes, syllables, or whole words (paraphasis) and even sometimes new words (neologisms), to the extent of completely unrecognizable gibberish in extreme cases. Prosody and intonation, in contrast, appeared to be relatively intact, resulting in so-called semantic or phonematic jargon, which yielded in the expression of „logorrhea“, i.e., excessive or incoherent talkativeness. Besides the naming was not choosen coincidentally to be reminiscent of the clinical term “diarrhea”. Furthermore, Wernicke showed that anomic aphasia, postulated by Bouillaud earlier, is based on lesions in this area as well. Anomic (or amnesic) aphasia is – in brief – characterized as the inability of utilizing or “recovering“ well-known words. Symptoms of this relatively mild form of aphasia often are observable in other forms of aphasias as well. In general it is regarded as anomic aphasia, if these word finding problems occur as the major „feature“ of the aphasia, while speech production and comprehension are left relatively spared.
Wernicke not only correctly postulated an anatomical connection  between Broca’s and Wernicke‘s areas, but also notably predicted another type of aphasia. Conduction aphasia, according to Wernicke’s reasoning, should occur as a result of an intercortical disconnection, when these neural fibres, now known as arcuate fasciculus, would be impaired. This was confirmed in later studies (Murdoch, 2009). In conduction aphasia, comprehension and speech production is thought to remain relatively intact. However, a failure of transferring information from Wernicke’s to Broca’s area results in paraphasic symptoms and marked difficulties in repeating words presented by the examiner.

=== &lt;u&gt;Wernicke-Lichtheim model&lt;/u&gt; ===

[[File:xy.jpg|frame|none|''Figure 2:''' Wernicke-Lichtheim scheme: (M)Centre for expressive speech, (A)Audioverbal representation centre, (C)Concept centre, (a)Auditory input, (m)Motoric output, (1)Broca’s aphasia, (2)Wernicke’s aphasia, (3)Conduction aphasia, (4)Transkortikal-motoric  aphasia, (5)Articulatory disorder (dysarthria/speech apraxia), (6)Transkortikal-sensory aphasia, (7)Pure word deafness ]]

Based on Wernicke's publications, various models originated, mainly following localizationist theories. In this regard, the model of Lichtheim is probably the most cited of these models and therefore described here exemplarily. Ludwig Lichtheim (1845-1928), who was closely working with Wernicke (in fact, he was one of his scholars in Breslau, which Norman Geschwind called the “School of Breslau”)(Opp, 1994), postulated a scheme (1885) based on the prior findings of Broca and Wernicke with five interconnected cortical and subcortical centres involved in language, i.e., centres for expressive speech, audioverbal representation, concept, auditory input, and motoric output (see Figure 2). Importantly, Lichtheim proposed the existence of a semantic field or conceptual centre, which is represented subcortically in the left Hemisphere. In this centre, ideas and elaborated concepts, like willful expressions would emerge. The assumption of a subcortical concept centre also facilitated the prediction of additional subcortical types of aphasia, as well as the categorization and localization of these new pathologies. In this theory, an impairment of the connection between the concept centre and Broca’s area would result in poor spontaneous speech, because formulated ideas could not be sent to the motoric centre, whereas as repetition, oral reading or comprehension, would remain unaffected. Thus, strictly linguistic performance of the classical comprehension and motoric production centres (and their connections) are spared. This combination of syndromes was termed  transcortical-motoric aphasia. In contrast to Broca’s aphasia, repetition and oral reading is much less impaired in trascortical-motor aphasia,  whereas spontaneous speech would be restrained in a similar way.The relatively good ability to repeat, is therefore regarded as an important characteristic to distinct these transcortical aphasias. The same applies to the transcortical sensory type of aphasia. While the symptoms resembles Wernicke’s aphasia, repetition is typically good. Although inviduals with transcortical sensory aphasia can exhibit further phenomena like echolalia, described in transcortical aphasia subchapter below. Supplementary he included two additional centres for reading (“visuoverbal centre”) and writing connected to Wernicke’s area (not shown in the basic house-like model in Figure 2). This could also provide an explanation for rare phenomenona like alexia and agraphia (i.e., the inability to read or write), which can occur independently of the aphasias, depending on the integrity of the “neuronal pathways“ to other language and speech related centres in Lichtheim’s structural scheme (Murdoch, 2009). Lichtheim’s scheme came to be known as the Wernicke-Lichtheim model and became highly regarded as it was used to explain and categorize various and rare types of aphasias and accompanying symptoms (e.g., pure word deafness, alexia and agraphia).
=== &lt;u&gt;Wernicke-Geschwind model&lt;/u&gt; ===


[[File:xy.jpg|frame|none|''Figure 3:''' Scheme of the left Hemisphere and Arcuate Fasciculus connecting Broca’s and Wernicke’s area
(freely adopted from Norman Geschwind,1972 )
 ]]

The Wernicke-Lichtheim model was elaborated further more recently by the influential Austrian-American Neurologist Norman Geschwind, resulting in what became known as the Wernicke-Geschwind model or neurological model of language (Geschwind, 1965). In his work, Geschwind put emphasis on the neuronal transfer of language signals from Wernicke’s to Broca’s area via a defined white matter projection, i.e., the arcuate fasciculus (Figure 3). Even though Geschwind assumed that the link from Wernicke’s to Broca’s areas was unidirectional in nature, we know today that information flow along this neural pathway is – like all projections in the brain – in fact bidirectional.Through the availability of modern non-invasive structural neuroimaging methods, it is today possible to visualize the individual anatomy of the arcuate fascicle in vivo and thus to investigate its specific contribution to language in the healthy brain. First anatomical evidence for the existence of these neuronal fibres was provided by more recent workers (Catani, Jones, and Ffytche, 2005). Even if Geschwind’s model is regarded as obsolete today, his extensive research and examination of neurological structures and linguistic operations through speaking and reading from the visual parietal cortex to the angular gyrus  in Wernicke’s area, contributed greatly to aphasiology and its research, as well as in various other fields (Kolb &amp; Whishaw, 2003).
=== &lt;u&gt;Diagnostic implications&lt;/u&gt; ===
Today, several models exist to explain the various aphasic syndromes and their specific combinations of symptoms. Nevertheless, the major advance in neuroanatomy and taxonomy of language disorders was conceived by Broca and Wernicke and resulted in models, such as the Wernicke-Lichtheim Model and the Wernicke-Geschwind Model. The pioneering work of these early neurologists made it possible to categorize speech disorders and to define them more precisely. Due to their findings, the localization of lesions could be estimated based on the symptoms, which was previously only possible postmortem by autopsy. Furthermore, a prediction of the likely occurring symptoms, caused by impairment, was made possible. Also, the association between deficits and impaired brain areas was put onto more firm grounds, so that today, a more hypothesis-driven approach to clinical neurolinguistics is possible. Despite the availability of modern neuroimaging techniques, the standardized tests that emerged from the early aphasiological work still have great importance in diagnostic procedures. However, diagnostic tests often emphasize functional examination rather than anatomical localization, nowadays. Still, even at the present day, most models are not regarded as  completely accurate, as discrete areas have not been shown in modern neuroanatomy. Various cortical and subcortical structures involving the complex patterns of generating language and comprehension, are still not fully understood and objective to further examinations.

== '''Definition and Classifications of Aphasias''' ==

=== &lt;u&gt;Definition of Aphasia&lt;/u&gt; === 
Aphasia (Greek ἀφασία Aphasia, “speechlessness”) is an acquired multimodal central language disorder, after (largely) completed language development, as a result of damage to the functional language centres of the (usually) left speech dominant hemisphere. The impairment of the language system can be more or less pronounced at different representational levels of language, such as phonology, syntax, lexicon, or semantics, along with constraints of performance in language comprehension and production. The language impairment can also include non-verbal linguistic performances, such as reading, writing, or sign language. In particular the former two, however, are also treated as separate syndrome categories, i.e., alexia and agraphia. The aphasic categories are seldom clearly distinguished from each other, since in natural occurrence, the neurological damage that leads to aphasic syndromes is rarely restricted to a clearly circumscribed brain region.
=== &lt;u&gt;The 4 Standard syndromes&lt;/u&gt; ===
==== ''Broca‘s aphasia'' ====

Broca‘s, motoric or expressive aphasia is an impairment localized in the frontolateral area, around the medial insular cortex, supply area of arteria precentralis. It is characterized by slow, effortful speech and marked by pauses, stagnative utterances and therefore classified as an “non-fluent” aphasic syndrome. In addition, noticeable agrammatism occurs, so called „telegram style“ – the omission of grammatical attributes, e.g. articles, prepositions and correct declensions. Also in extreme cases, individuals cannot speak more than a few words, which are then often repeated frequently, as if in an desperate attempt to express themselves. Although, usually the articulation and intonation of these words appear to be fairly normal. Comprehension is regarded as mildly impaired, whereas complex syntactical content can arise greater difficulties.

==== ''Wernicke‘s aphasia'' ====

Wernicke‘s, sensory or receptive aphasia, derives from lesions of the dorsal parts of the gyrus temporalis superior (the first temporal gyrus in the “upper-back” of the temporal lobe), supply area of arteria temporalis posterior.
Typically comprehension is heavily disturbed, whereas speech production is fluent and prosody and articulation remain intact. It is additionally characterized by paraphasic speech, the tendency to substitute words or phonemes (paraphasy), and even creating new words (neologism). In severe cases, this can lead to an unrecognizable, but fluent gibberish (semantic or phonematic jargon), which yielded in the term “logorrhoea” (excessive talkativeness). Also these aphasics typically lack of awareness of the latter condition.

==== ''Anomic aphasia'' ====

Anomic or amnesic aphasia is commonly regarded as the mildest form. Its pathogenesis derives most commonly from temporoparietal lesions. Anomic aphasia is perceptibly marked by having extreme difficulties remembering simple words. Comprehension is only mildly affected and speech production is mostly fluent. As for Wernicke’s aphasia, paraphasy can occur. Most often these amnesic symptoms exhibit in other aphasic syndromes to some degree as well.

==== ''Global aphasia'' ====

In global aphasia large cerebral areas in the (usually) left hemisphere are impaired within the supply area of the arteria cerebri media, which is one of the three big arterials, distributing blood supply in the brain. Such large impairments ensue a broad variety of cognitive constraints, such as heavy impairments to speech production and comprehension occur. It is typically accompanied by paraphasic symptoms and neologism to the extend, that only speech automatism remain possible, recurring utterances, as constant repetition of words or syllables. 

=== &lt;u&gt;Non Standard Syndromes&lt;/u&gt; ===
==== ''Conduction aphasia'' ====

Conduction aphasia, also called associative aphasia commonly results from impairment of the fasciculus arcuatus (Latin, curved bundle), which connects Broca’s and Wernicke’s area. The natural occurrence of this kind of aphasia is relatively rare, since the fasciculus arcuatus is impaired almost precisely, while comprehension and motoric speech centres are rather spared. Its marked by poor ability to repeat auditory received speech or reading aloud, while auditory and lexical comprehension remain intact and speech is fluent, yet paraphasic and especially phonematically impaired. As an aphasic patient would try to repeat a word presented by the examiner repeatedly to correct his mistake, as he is aware of his erroneous, it could seem like he would try to successively approximate the word phonetically.

==== ''Transcortical aphasia'' ====

Transcortical aphasia can exhibit in an sensory, motor or mixed type of aphasia. Wernicke’s and Broca’s area are assumed as relatively preserved (as well as the connection between them), whereas neuronal pathways (in specific areas of the temporal lobe or respectively anterior superior frontal lobe) connecting them to subcortical structures, involving parts of the Thalamus and basal ganglia, are impaired.
Whether Wernicke’s or Broca’s area is “isolated”, defines the type of aphasia: Transcortical sensory aphasia or transcortical motor aphasia (or mixed) and respectively resembles Broca’s expressive or Wernicke’s receptive aphasia. All transcortical aphasias have a characteristically good performance in repetition in common, which differentiate them from expressive or receptive aphasia. In transcortical sensory aphasia spontaneous speech and comprehension is similar to sensory aphasia and individuals have a tendency to perseveration (“Sticking” to words or no longer relevant content). Also they can exhibit echolalia, a constant repetition of words. In transcortical motor aphasia, spontaneous speech is disordered and non-fluent as in motoric aphasia, but the ability to repeat, even repeating longer phrases fluently, is relatively good, since comprehension and the arcuate fasciculus remain unimpaired.

==== ''Pure word deafness'' ====

Pure word deafness is also referred to as auditory verbal agnosia. It is thought to be involving impairments to the Heschl‘s gyrus in the temporal lobe of the speech dominant hemisphere, interrupting fibres from the auditory receptive areas connected to the Wernicke’s area. It is regarded as a selective auditory deficit of comprehending speech and is characterized by the inability of understanding spoken language, while reading or writing, spontaneous speech and comprehension of non-verbal auditory input (e.g. music) remain unimpaired. It is therefore classified as pure “input disorder”.

=== &lt;u&gt;Non-aphasic speech and language disorders &lt;/u&gt; ===

==== ''Apraxia of speech'' ====

==== ''Dysarthria'' ====

==== ''Alexia and agraphia'' ====

== '''Causes''' ==
Approximately  80% have vascular origin, most commonly caused by a cerebrovascular accident (CVA, commonly referred to as stroke), resulting in cerebral ischemia (i.e., an undersupply of blood) in 80% or haemorrhagic infarct (i.e., bleedings, which also lead secondarily to ischemia) in 20% of all CVA’s. The second and third highest prevalence are traumatic brain injuries (10%) and cerebral tumors (7%) (Schneider et al., 2012). Hemispherical prevalence: Impairment (as the speech dominant hemisphere) is localized in 96% of right-handers and 70% of left-handers in the left cerebral hemisphere (15% left-handers exhibit bilateral speech organization).The remaining 4% of the right-handers and 15% of the left-handers exhibit a soley right hemispherical speech organization (McCarthy &amp; Warrington,1990). Most important causes are:

•	Strokes (cerebral apoplexy)*

•	Intracerebral hemorrhage, aneurysm*

•	Traumatic Brain Injury*

•	Cerebral tumor*

•	Bacterial or  viral encephalitis*

•	Brain atrophy*

•	Neurological Disorders: Alzheimer, forms of dementia*

•	Intoxication by alcohol, drugs and medicines*

!text align = &quot;left&quot; font size = &quot;14pt&quot;|
In Spanish, verbs are conjugated depending on the subject they are associated with, as well as the tense.&lt;br&gt;
Now, we will transfer our knowledge about verb endings in relation to subject pronouns and relate it to new past tense endings.&lt;br&gt;
Each subject pronoun is associated with a particular verb-ending type, that is different in the past tense.

|&lt;h2&gt;&lt;u&gt;Irregular Verb Type 1:&lt;/u&gt;Stem Changes &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here, we will discuss a few common irregular verbs, and the changes that occur in their formation.  &lt;br&gt;
First, we will discuss verbs that are irregular stem changing verbs&lt;br&gt;
! 
{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
| width: 20%|These verbs are irregular in their conjugation for all forms, although the &quot;we&quot; form typically stays the same.
&lt;br&gt;
The stem of the verbs change usually with added vowels in the root.  &lt;br&gt;
Verbs with an 'e' in the root typically change to 'ie'
&lt;br&gt;
Example: Tú: Tener = &lt;s&gt;tenes&lt;/s&gt; = t&lt;b&gt;ie&lt;/b&gt;nes

==Introduction to Error Fixing in Trainz==
 
'''Errors, Faults, Faulty assets, Bad Content, Faulty content''' are all synonyms in Trainz-speak for the same situation:
 
An asset is Bad. Most ''correctable faults'' will have become somewhat incompatible with the newer Trainz release preference for organizing model data. A small percentage were distributed with malformed components, were made to a less exacting standard earlier versions were sometimes tolerant of and other times caused crashes, or sometimes, somewhere, the asset file got corrupted. The later cases are real faults, the first is progress coupled with some carefree programming philosophies and decisions inconsiderate of the impact on the thousands of users. 
{{TrainzTip
|In point of fact most faults we see ''should have been'' (but aren't) automatically handled and updated by CM or TrainzUtil on download.
 
Those with incompatible data linkings, generally need a new mesh (Non-English/foreign language alphabet characters ''illegal in Trainz or Windows file names'' in mesh and texture names  are the culprit in those.), and corrupted data could be your hard drive, the internet, or sometimes on the DLS itself. Sometimes deleting an asset then re-downloading it cures the first two cases.
|BG=white}}&lt;br&gt;
* Many times the errors are simple errors of assumptions as a content creator did variations on a theme, in effect {{TA|Reskinning}} at least parts of her creative output without a full up test, or cutting, pasting, and quickly editing in an element or feature, alas incorrectly. These are basically typos and can happen to anyone. This sort of error happened a lot in {{TL|TRS2006|pre-T06}} assets which is why that T'06 version instituted the initial error checking into the ''before-commitment and before-uploading'' process (as well as pre-cdp generation)&amp;mdash;which has made the bleeding slow but not stop, but left the errant cdp file on the {{TL|DLS}} unchanged.
&lt;br
/&gt;
* Many times these got fixed, but for legal (copy rights) reasons, and lack of a past ability to replace a faulty {{TL|DLS}} asset, or for lack of understanding how, the fixed version has an entirely different {{TL|KUID}}. This can be confusing to veteran Trainzers much less new Trainzers, so we'll present techniques below to not run afoul of this one. The originators data base (the DLS) knows these first versions are obsoleted by a replacement by the inclusion of a {{TBS|obsolete-table}} entry; anyone with both items has no problems thereafter, but the database and we Trainzers have no easy and efficient {{TL|CM|CM tool}} to tell us the new {{TL|kuid}} is available. 
{{TextBox|We ''soon painfully learn'' when and how to check versions on a new faulty asset to compensate for a system sometimes abused or historically less capable.}}
&lt;br
&gt;
* Another and '''''the most common kind of error or fault''''' occurs when the asset needs an tweak to conform to a newer level of asset technology. These should have been handled automatically but N3V chose a different design philosophy and just didn't think of the time cost to the user community because of their methodology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forums.auran.com/trainz/showthread.php?100965-Yesterdayz-Trainz-Group&amp;p=1315365#post1315365 Case made for preprocessing], Auran forums, 2014-0805&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br
&gt;
:* These flaws in Trainz content is most often frequently something which can be 'fixed' by small 'tweaks'&amp;mdash;hand edited changes into the files in the assets defining folder(s) opened in the  operating system. This is our topic and the art and skill we hope to help you master in quick order. On the oldest content, these fix updates generally make the fixed asset broken to the software from the era it came from, because the fix requires installing new data organizing structures {{TR|C}} to make the newer software interpret the old elements that were organized a different way&amp;mdash;ways which were admittedly less robust, reliable, and safe. These are good things for the prevent the hated {{wp|BSoD}}. When they aren't persuadable by this small effort, the Trainz forums become a gold mine and recourse.
&lt;br
&gt;
:* The easiest to understand gold mine new users should bookmark ''for asset repair needs'' is the '''Content Creator's Guide''' {{N3V|http://online.ts2009.com/mediaWiki/index.php/CCG|(Online version)}}. The Trainz Wiki is authoritative relative to the newest ''data model'', but it is often too terse, written for those already familiar (high volume content creators with a say in those specifications as it happens) with the modeling needs in a {{TL|Config.txt file}}. But no worries, the prose and presentation of the CCG while dated is perfect to the fault fixing needs&amp;mdash;''after all, for a repair you just want to do the minimum change you can get away with.'' To bridge the gap, here on the Trainz Wikibook we've been upgrading and expanding the N3V presentation in the [[:category:Trainz references|reference pages]] herein with much more explanation and introductory material for people of all education and experience levels.
&lt;br
&gt;
* In the worst case, the asset is missing key data (a mesh or texture) that is unobtainable, or the one won't load despite everything you try. When all else fails, return the item for a refund. All $0.00 spent. That's a good time to ask for help on the forum, but ''please do form the habit'' to make a fix try or three ''first'', so you can tell people what you tried. Newbies who do that, ''instead of asking others to solve their problem for them'' get a far better reception and far more help&amp;mdash;not to mention learn things otherwise not easy to teach, and build self-confidence too, both good goals. In other words, ''failure teaches best'' (mastering at the least,'' 'what doesn't work', '''solidifies what does!''''') and if given the choice of helping a whiny new user, or someone trying hard, the second guy, as in life in general, is going to get better attention, and far more respect&amp;mdash;self or from others.
&lt;br
&gt;
* Four software savvy veteran Trainzer's: ''PEV, Andi06, Ianwoodmore, and Pcas1986'' are expecting a 95% asset repair rate on older-to-oldest content (Their claims, their test benchmarks and statistical evaluation &amp;mdash; all as of mid-April 2014) with the next release of {{TA|AssetX}} and {{TA|TARDIS}} which have been evolving since mid-2010; which means less than 2% of DLS content will fail their upgrade process, and that remaining older content with faults needing hand editing will be no more than 1&amp;ndash;2% of the DLS population overall, and that's steadily dropping thanks to a project called the DLS Clean Up. This, a slowly proceeding N3V DLS cleanup project which will eventually eliminate most of those.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Latitude ==
As one can see here, energy decreases with latitude:

[[File:Insolation daily mean lat by time.png|650px]]

Why? 

=== Angle of the Sun ===
As one can see from the diagram below, if the sun strikes the ground at a small angle, the solar radiation will be spread across a large area. If the sun strikes the ground at a right angle, the solar radiation will be most intense (this is known as '''overhead sun'''):

[[File:Seasons.too.png|650px]]

Therefore, higher latitudes receive less intense insolation:

[[File:Oblique_rays_04_Pengo.svg|650px]]

However, this difference in temperature varies with season because of the '''tilt''' of the earth's axis (at around 23.5°). When the earth revolves around, different areas will receive the largest angle of the sun:
* At spring equinox (21/22 Mar) and autumnal equinox (22/23 Sep), the overhead sun is at the equator. The equator is thus the hottest.
* At winter solstice (21/22 Dec), the overhead sun is on the Tropic of Capricorn. The Tropic of Capricorn is hottest. It is winter in the Northern Hemisphere and summer in the Southern Hemisphere.
* At summer solstice (21/22 Jun), the overhead sun is on the Tropic of Cancer. The Tropic of Cancer is hottest. It is summer in the Northern Hemisphere and winter in the Southern Hemisphere.

[[File:Seasons1.svg|650px]]

=== Daylight Hours ===
The longer an area is exposed to solar radiation, the more isolation on it has.
* At summer solstice, the Southern Hemisphere receives longer hours of daylight, and the Northern Hemisphere receives shorter hours. The Arctic Circle has 24 hours of daylight and the Antarctic Circle has none.
* At winter solstice, the Northern Hemisphere receives longer hours of daylight, and the Southern Hemisphere receives shorter hours. The Antarctic Circle has 24 hours of daylight and the Arctic Circle has none.
* The equator receives around 12 hours throughout the year.

== Time of the Day ==
Since the earth rotates every day, different longitudes are exposed to the sunlight at different times of the day.
* The time when an area begins to be exposed to solar radiation is called '''sunrise'''.
* At noon, the amount of solar radiation is at its peak. This is the '''midday sun'''.
* After '''sunset''', the area is no longer exposed to sunlight.

== Atmosphere ==
=== Atmosphere X Latitude ===
Let's look again at the diagram we saw above:

[[File:Oblique_rays_04_Pengo.svg|650px]]

Radiation at higher latitudes need to go through a longer distance in the atmosphere before striking the ground. Thus they lose more energy in the transfer process.

=== Cloud Cover ===
Areas with dense cloud cover have more reflection and scattering by clouds. Thus they have less insolation.

=== Aerosols ===
'''Aerosols''' are small particles in the atmosphere that reflect and scatter insolation. Areas with aerosols, which can be released by human activities or volcanic eruptions.

Hindi cardinal numbers up to 100 have no specific standardization. Up to 20, the numbers are unique. After that each tenth number (such as 30, 40 etc) is unique. The rest of the numbers take the form of prefix of incremental digit and the base of preceding tenth number. However these prefixes and bases vary slightly and random manner. Although the pattern isn't regular, don't worry too much. They're just slightly different and with some practice you'd soon get the hang of it. Here are the numbers from 21 to 100. Try to follow them and find any similar pattern.

(One) hundred (100)	(एक) सौ (१००)	(ēka) sau	
Once you have got through the numbers 1-100 the rest of the numbers are regular. For example if we need seven hundred sixty seven it will be सात सौ सड़सठ (sāta sau saṛasaṭha).

Another point to be noted in Hindi in case of cardinal numbers is that Hindi (and all other Indic languages) often use quantities like lakh and crore which are less common in English speaking countries. The opposite is true for quantities like million, billion (We are talking about the US billion which is 1 followed by 9 zeros, not the UK billion which is 1 followed by 12 zeros!), zillion etc. Let's roll on to bigger quantities now!

Ordinals[edit]
Hindi ordinals are a piece of cake once you are thorough with the cardinals. Only the first six ordinals are unique.

As you would have noticed by now that in Hindi 'वां' acts just like 'th' in English which you can add to the end of cardinal numbers to form the corresponding ordinal numbers. If you're wondering about the irregularities of the second options, then let us just tell you that they are the Sanskrit ordinal numbers that are used often in Hindi. You just have to remember ten of them (for they sometimes appear in texts/speeches). After ten, any ordinal numbers you would encounter would be most likely in the general form of ordinal number+vāṃ

Note :- As we mentioned before that the Hindi cardinal numbers are not standardized and several variants exist for the same number. For example सड़सठ and सरसठ are both correct for representing sixty seven. All of these variant forms could be considered correct, however for maintaining uniformity throughout this wikibook we'd be using the forms that are mentioned in this text which is also advocated by the Central Hindi Directorate, Government of India, Ministry of Education and Social Welfare (BGMH, pp. 64-5)

      <text xml:space="preserve">After sunlight enters the atmosphere, heat transfer processes will occur.

== Radiation ==
Radiation's role in the earth's radiation budget was discussed in the last page.

When radiation hits an object, two processes may occur: '''reflection''' and '''absorption'''. The amount absorbed depends on the '''albedo''' of the object. For example, a dark-coloured rock has low albedo, so most heat is absorbed and little heat is reflected. Ice has high albedo, so most heat is reflected and little is absorbed.

Radiation transfers '''sensible heat'''.
== Convection and Conduction ==
They also transfer '''sensible heat'''.

Conduction means heat is transferred from a hotter object to a colder object.

Convection occurs in fluids. Hot gas or liquid rises. As it rises, it cools downs and sinks again. Thus heat is transported upwards.

== Evaporation ==
Evaporation transfers '''latent heat'''. Latent heat is absorbed when water evaporates. As it rises up, the latent heat is transferred upwards and released when the water condenses.

== Advection ==
Advection is the horizontal movement of air. It transfers heat horizontally.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Taiwan is an island.

Its main language is Chinese (Traditional Chinese).

It has a variety kinds of culture, famous local products.

It is on the continental shelf. So there is seafood.

It has mountains, it has beautiful scenery.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The dose/fx collected here are to the treated organ, not the critical structures [Organs At Risk (OARs)], whilst the volume and total dose constraints are for the OARs. For OAR radiobiology calculations we need to know the dose/fx to the OAR, not the target. The best way to do this would be to list the number of fractions used in each protcol (you could then dispense with the ambiguous dose/fx column altogether). I presume this list is collated by a &quot;bot&quot; anyway, so I don't know if there is a way of automating this process to list the number of fractions?[[Special:Contributions/194.176.105.139|194.176.105.139]] ([[User talk:194.176.105.139|discuss]]) 09:38, 6 August 2014 (UTC)</text>

==Examining common asset elements==
In this page we're going to present the {{TBS|p=TrainzBaseSpec}} elements within example assets you are likely to encounter in downloading content and having to correct faults from data model evolution. Further, we're intending to present past and present forms and conventions so that you can see how to upgrade an element should you have to crack an asset open to repair. Remember, What happens in the Boxcar, stays in the Boxcar&amp;mdash;if you fix it up, dress it up pretty, and customize it on your system, so long as you don't upload it, veteran Trainzer's will applaud you.
 
''Daring Experimenters'' lead to content creation, leading to skilled new enthusiastic content creators which lead to new goodies for all. Knock yourself out experimenting &amp;mdash;it's how most of the essential parts&amp;mdash; and even the best parts (some might say)&amp;mdash;of the Trainz Experience was built! 

You might say, Trainz is set up to allow experiments, for in truth it safeguards a lot of your {{TN|I|installation}} against breakage. A backups folder system and ability to Clone (copy) a asset to alter are built-in to {{TL|Content Manager}}. Want to try something with a regular built-in asset, then use this common procedure to &quot;Safe the Asset&quot;&amp;mdash;open the asset for editing, run PEVtools and copy the folder to another directory as a manual backup&amp;mdash;then fiddle as you desire. Trainz input validation will let you know if most things are out of kilter with your experiment. 

Newer Trainz also has a'' 'Revert' and a 'Revert to Original' ''feature in the [ALT]-[E] edit drop down menu. That manual copy can then be used to re-import the asset with suitable version or name alteration or kuid changes, and both versions can be on your {{TN|I|installation}} at once.

==Our first asset==
This is a flatcar knockoff of a deepwell flatcar by the inimitable PhilC of '''''World of Trainz''''' (now sadly defunct, he's retired in 2014) and bigger fame as a diesel-electric digital modeler. (Name search in {{TL|CM}} 'L SD70' for one you likely have built-in!) When we refer to this as a knock-off we mean no denigration, only that the asset is actually a clone with new textures as opposed to a reskin asset using the alias tag to put new textures on an existing asset. {{TrainzTip|The distinction is based on where the {{TG|M|meshes}} reside on your hard drive. This 'clone' is an asset that can be ported onto a install and does not need the source asset to be present for rendering because it has a copy of the mesh. A reskin, whether manually or via the now depreciated  {{TL|Paintshed|Auran Paintshed}} application, does need the source asset or the asset is broken until the dependency is satisfied. }}

;An amusing example of the distinction: When the excellent and famous narrowgauge route'' 'Northbay County' ''was first published in TRS2006-SP0, there was a little switcher engine that had no trucks&amp;mdash;the bogeys kuid got left out of the CDROM release. ''It seemed to float on air like it was some kind of hovercraft!'' The switching engine worked, and so long as you were in the loco cab, you'd never know the difference. The truck sub-asset was clearly non-essential. 
{{TextBox|'''A wart in Trainz:''' Sometimes the company doesn't play by the same rules as we experience interacting with CM and the DLS. The anecdote is a case on point. The engine asset, route, and session all depended on that truck, but because the kuid's were in the releases' compiled data base (see {{TG|J|JA files}} and {{TN|C|CAB files}}) it was outside of normal error checking. Clone's of quite a few of Auran/N3V railcars still to this day lack (less important) data required in more recently created data, and that shortfall even applies to assets that were newly reworked for TS12! (They're ''now'' working on it&amp;mdash;but it took a user to point out the missing factors. The interaction between N3V and the Trainz forums is very important, and while not acknowledged usually, things happen and get fixed when they see the light of day in forum posts!)}}

In a reskin, the  car re-colorized is essential, or the kuid is so much useless code. In a clone or knock-off, it is self-contained--though may of course have other dependencies--common parts like trucks (bogeys) cab interiors, bells, cow catchers, and other elements which have commonality between models. Some such are found in a library&amp;mdash;this has become increasingly common, and actually simplifies things for the content creator and users alike--only one library asset needs be 'attached', found, and possessed to enable many others, and they can be used by other content creators to expand the menu of options (goodies) for us all. This even extends to the body of many traincars--Auran established a series of base model types and many rolling stock assets use those meshes. Meshes or mesh libraries, textures and texture libraries can be individual KUID assets, and once so entered in the data base, become available for others. Neat, Huh!?

Africa is the world's second largest continent.  It has about 1/5 of the world's land.  It is surrounded by seas.  

Feizhou shih shihjieh dih-2 dah de dahluh, zhahn shihjieh luhdih yue 1/5, zhouweir shih haai.  


There are 61 countries in Africa, with 14.7%, about a billion, of the world's population.  

Feizhou yoou 61 geh guorjia, rernkoou yue 10 yih, zhahn shihjieh rernkoou de 14.7%.  


It is thought that Africa is the continent having the earliest humans.

Feizhou beih rehnweih shih zuih zaao yoou rernleih de dahluh.


----


Africa's population is the youngest among all the continents; 50% of Africans are 19 years old or younger; it means Africans die early.

Feizhou de rernkoou shih geh dahzhou zuih niarnqing de, 50% shih 19 suih huoh gehng niarnqing; yeejiuhshih Feizhou rern zaao sii.

      <comment>x is a Polish letter.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">It doesn't feel right for me to edit this book myself so I'll just leave this:
&quot;x&quot; is a letter in the Polish alphabet. Every child learns a ryme with x, y, z - ź, ż at the end.

http://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/X

There are a lot of people using the names like Xavery and in Poland you can't register a name with letters outside fo the Polish alphabet.</text>

===Ankle===
The ankle is the region where the foot and the leg meet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emedicinehealth.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=8983 Ankle at eMedicine Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;
The ankle joint is composed of three joints: the talocrural (ankle) joint and the talocalcaneal (subtalar joint) and the Inferior tibiofibular joint&lt;ref&gt;Brent K. Milner, Ryan S. Fajardo (2007) Musculoskeletal Imaging, in Spencer B. Gay (editor) Radiology Recall p.294&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James G. Adams, Erik D. Barton, Jamie Collings (2008) Emergency Medicine: Expert Consult p.2660&lt;/ref&gt;. The ends of the bones in the ankle joint are covered with cartilage. The talocrural joint is formed by the articulation of the fibula and distal tibia with the trochlea of the talus. The talocalcaneal joint is formed by the articulation of the talus with the calcaneus.
====Joint Contact====
The talocrural joint contact area are various with flexion of the ankle.

====Axis of Rotation====
Joint motion of the talocrural joint has been studied to define the axes of rotation and their location according to specific anatomic landmarks.

| Parlasca et al. [1979]|| Ins. || 96% within 12 mm of a point 20 mm below the articular surface of the tibia along the long axis
|-
| Van Langelaan [1983] || Ins. || At an approximate right angle to the longitudinal direction of the foot, passing through the corpus tali, with a direction from anterolaterosuperior to posteromedioinferior
|-
| Barnett and Napier || Q-I || Dorsiflexion: down and lateral

|-
| Hicks [1953] || Q-I|| Dorsiflexion: 5 mm inferior to tip of lateral malleolus to 15 mm anterior to tip of medial malleolus
Plantarflexion: 5 mm superior to tip of lateral malleolus to 15 mm anterior, 10 mm inferior to tip of medial malleolus
|}
&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt; Fix. = fixed axis of rotation; Ins. = instantaneous axis of rotation; Q-I = quasi-instantaneous axis of rotation.

The motion axes of the talocalcaneal joint have been described by several authors.

==Joint Lubrication==
===Tribology===
Tribology comes from the Greek word, “tribos”,meaning “rubbing” or “to rub” and from the suffix, “ology” means “the study of”. Tribology is the study of rubbing, or... “the study of things that rub”.Tribology is a branch of mechanical engineering and materials science. This includes the fields of:
friction,lubrication, and wear. It was coined by the British physicist David Tabor and also by Peter Jost in 1964 and started the new discipline of tribology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Fiction of Nonfriction|journal=Popular Science|date=November 2012|volume=281|series=No. 5|issue=November 2012|accessdate=14 October 2012|author=Mitchell, Luke|editor1-first=Jacob|editor1-last=Ward|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tribology is all around us as the follows:

|}
====Surfaces in Contact====
Every application has surfaces in contact in relative motion such as sliding, rolling and impacting. The surface is not simple and not plat.All engineering surfaces have a roughness, and this roughness has an important role in tribology. Surface roughness comes from all prior history of the
part like manufacturing, handling and prior use in application.

====Friction====
[[File:Static Friction &amp; Kinetic Friction.jpeg|300 px|thumb|Static Friction &amp; Kinetic Friction]]
[[File:Laminar shear.svg|thumb|right|200px|Laminar shear of fluid between two plates. Friction between the fluid and the moving boundaries causes the fluid to shear. The force required for this action is a measure of the fluid's viscosity.]]
Friction is the resistant force to relative motion between solid surfaces, fluid layers, and material elements sliding against each other.

Static friction occurs when two or more solid objects are not moving relative to each other(like a desk on the ground). The coefficient of static friction, typically denoted as μ&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;, is usually higher than the coefficient of kinetic friction.

Kinetic (or dynamic) friction is friction between two objects are moving relative to each other and rub together (like a sled on the ground). The coefficient of kinetic friction is typically denoted as μ&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;, and is usually less than the coefficient of static friction for the same materials&lt;ref&gt;Sheppard, Sheri; Tongue, Benson H. and Anagnos, Thalia (2005). Statics: Analysis and Design of Systems in Equilibrium. Wiley and Sons. p. 618. ISBN 0-471-37299-4. &quot;In general, for given contacting surfaces, μ&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; μ&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;.

Rolling friction occurs when two objects move relative to each other and one &quot;rolls&quot; on the other (like a car's wheels on the ground). This is classified as one of static friction as the patch of the tire in contact with the ground, at any point while the tire spins, is stationary relative to the ground.

Fluid friction describes the friction between a solid object as it moves through a liquid or gas medium. The drag of air on an airplane, or that of water on a swimmer, are two examples of fluid friction. This internal resistance to flow is expressed as viscosity. Viscosity is measured with various viscometers and rheometers.

====Lubrication====
Lubrication is the process, or technique employed in order to reduce friction, to prevent wear, to transport debris away from interface and to provide cooling by interposing a substance called lubricant between the surfaces to carry or to help carry the load (pressure generated) between the surfaces. The types of lubrication may be classified according to the ratio of the squeeze film (oil film) thickness h and the surface roughness. But, full-film lubrication can be broken down into two forms: hydrodynamic and elastohydrodynamic. 
# '''Hydrodynamic lubrication'''(h&gt;Ra): It is also called fluid-film, thick-film, or flooded lubrication. The load is taken completely by the thick oil film. Hydrodynamic lubrication relies on the relative speed between the surfaces, oil viscosity, load, and clearance between the moving or sliding surfaces.  Hydrodynamic lubrication is used to delicate instruments,light machines like watches, clocks, guns, sewing machines,scientific instruments, large plain bearings like pedestal bearings, main bearing of diesel engines.The Reynolds equations can be used to describe the principles for the fluids.And when gases are used, their derivation is much more involved.
# '''Elastohydrodynamic lubrication'''(h&gt;Ra):The film elastically deforms the rolling surface to lubricate it.
# '''Transition from hydrodynamic and elastohydrodynamic lubrication to boundary lubrication'''(h~Ra):The lubrication goes from the desirable hydrodynamic condition of no contact to the less acceptable “boundary” condition, where increased contact usually leads to higher friction and wear. This regime is sometimes called as mixed lubrication.
# '''Boundary lubrication'''(also called boundary film lubrication) (h&lt;Ra): The bodies come into closer contact at their asperities.Boundary lubrication occurs when a shaft starts moving from rest,the speed is very low,the load is very high and viscosity of the lubricant is too low.factors become important in the transition from hydrodynamic to boundary lubrication. The most important factor in boundary lubrication is the chemistry of the tribological system — the contacting solids and total environment including lubricants.

In hydrodynamic lubrication, the general Reynolds equation is:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left(\frac{\rho h^3}{12\mu}\frac{\partial p}{\partial x}\right)+\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\left(\frac{\rho h^3}{12\mu}\frac{\partial p}{\partial y}\right)=\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left(\frac{\rho h \left( u_a + u_b \right)}{2}\right)+\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\left(\frac{\rho h \left( v_a + v_b \right)}{2}\right)+\rho\left(w_a-w_b\right)-\rho u_a\frac{\partial h}{\partial x} - \rho v_a \frac{\partial h}{\partial y}+h\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t}&lt;/math&gt;

Where:
*&lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is fluid film pressure.
*&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; are the bearing width and length coordinates.
*&lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; is fluid film thickness coordinate.
*&lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is fluid film thickness.
*&lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is fluid viscosity.
*&lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is fluid density.
*&lt;math&gt;u, v, w&lt;/math&gt; are the bounding body velocities in &lt;math&gt;x, y, z&lt;/math&gt; respectively.
*&lt;math&gt;a, b&lt;/math&gt; are subscripts denoting the top and bottom bounding bodies respectively.

The equation can either be used with consistent units or nondimensionalized.
The Reynolds Equation assumes:
*The fluid is Newtonian.
*Fluid viscous forces dominate over fluid inertia forces. This is the principal of the Reynolds number. 
*Fluid body forces are negligible.
*The variation of pressure across the fluid film is very small (i.e. &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial p}{\partial z} = 0&lt;/math&gt;)
*The fluid film thickness is much less than the width and length and thus curvature effects are negligible. (i.e. &lt;math&gt;h &lt;&lt; l&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;h &lt;&lt; w&lt;/math&gt;)

====Wear====
'''Wear''' is erosion or sideways displacement(or removal) of material from one body when subjected to contact and relative motion with another body. Wear is about interactions between surfaces and more specifically the removal and deformation of material on a surface as a result of mechanical action of the opposite surface.&lt;ref name =&quot;rabinowicz&quot;&gt;Rabinowicz, E. (1995). Friction and Wear of Materials. New York, John Wiley and Sons.&lt;/ref&gt; The requirement for relative motion between two surfaces and initial mechanical contact between asperities is an important difference between mechanical wear compared to other processes with similar results.&lt;ref name = &quot;Williams&quot;&gt;Williams, J. A. (2005). &quot;Wear and wear particles - Some fundamentals.&quot; Tribology International 38(10): 863-870&lt;/ref&gt;.
Under normal mechanical and practical process, the wear-rate normally changes through three stages&lt;ref&gt;Chattopadhyay, R. (2001). Surface Wear - Analysis, Treatment, and Prevention. OH, USA: ASM-International. ISBN 0-87170-702-0.&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Primary stage or early run-in period''' : surfaces adapt to each other and the wear-rate might be various(high or low).
# '''Secondary stage or mid-age process''': a steady rate of ageing is in motion. Most of the components operational life is comprised in this stage.
# '''Tertiary stage or old-age period''': the components fail rapidly due to a high rate of ageing.
Some commonly referred to wear mechanisms (or processes) contain:
# '''Abrasive Wear, Scratching''' :Abrasive wear occurs when a hard rough surface scratches a softer surface.&lt;ref name =&quot;rabinowicz&quot; /&gt;
# '''Adhesive Wear, Galling, Scuffing''':Adhesive wear can be found between surfaces during frictional contact and generally means unwanted displacement and attachment of wear debris and material compounds from one surface to another. '''Adhesive wear''' starts as “local welding”. Material “compatibility” is important for adhesive wear. Stacking fault energy,crystal structure, natural oxide formation all have an impact on adhesive wear.
# '''Fretting/Fretting Corrosion''':
# '''Erosive Wear, Cavitation, Impact, Electro-arcing'''
# '''Rolling Contact Fatigue, Spalling, Delamination''':Fatigue is a process the surface of a material is weakened by the loading. Reversing sub-surface shear each time the roller or ball passes over the surface. Accumulation of these stresses cause subsurface crack formation, usually at a microstructural inhomogeneity. Debris usually gets rolled over,creating additional damage. Cracks grow toward surface and particle spalls off.
# '''Tribo-Corrosion'''
These wear mechanisms do not act independently and wear mechanisms are not mutually exclusive.&lt;ref name = &quot;Williams&quot; /&gt;

===Biotribology===
[[File:Biotribology.jpeg|thumb|250px|Biotribology]]Biotribology has been one of the most active topics in tribology during the past 40 years. Biotribology can be expressed as the study of friction, wear and lubrication of biological systems, mainly synovial joints such as the human hip and knee.

===Synovial fluid===
[[File:Joint.png|250px|thumb|Right|A typical joint]]
Synovial fluid is a viscous, non-Newtonian fluid in the cavities of synovial joints. With its yolk-like consistency (&quot;synovial&quot; partially derives from ovum, Latin for egg), synovial fluid reduce friction between the articular cartilage of synovial joints during movement. Between shocks, the synovial fluid in diarthrotic joints becomes thick to protect the joint and then thins to normal viscosity. The fluid provides oxygen and nutrients and removes carbon dioxide and metabolic wastes from the chondrocytes within the surrounding cartilage.

The normal volume of synovial fluid obviously varies from joint to joint.

===Joint Lubrication===
====Glucosamine====
[[File:Glucosamine Structural Formulae V.1.svg|thumbnail|right|100px|Glucosamine]]
Glucosamine(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;NO&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;) is an important component of cartilage, mucous membranes, and synovial fluid. It can be manufactured in the lab or extracted from the exoskeletons of lobsters, crabs, shrimp, and other sea creatures. It can be found in various forms like glucosamine sulfate,glucosamine hydrochloride and n-acetyl glucosamine. Efficacy of glucosamine is generally considered to be good and is supported by several studies.In the United States, glucosamine is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration for medical use in humans.&lt;ref name=&quot;FDA2004&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/Food/IngredientsPackagingLabeling/LabelingNutrition/ucm073400.htm|title=Letter Regarding the Relationship Between the Consumption of Glucosamine and/or Chondroitin Sulfate and a Reduced Risk of: Osteoarthritis; Osteoarthritis-related Joint Pain, Joint Tenderness, and Joint Swelling; Joint Degeneration; and Cartilage Deterioration(Docket No. 2004P-0059)|author=Hubbard WK, Associate Commissioner of Policy and Planning|year=2004; update 2012|publisher=United States Department of Health and Human Services, Food and Drug Administration|accessdate=14 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since glucosamine is categorized as a dietary supplement in the US, safety and formulation are solely the responsibility of the manufacturer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nccam.nih.gov/news/2008/nhsr12.pdf|title=Complementary and Alternative Medicine Use Among Adults and Children: United States, 2007|date=December 10, 2008|publisher=National Center for Health Statistics|accessdate=2009-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
. In most of Europe, glucosamine is approved as a medical drug and is sold in the form of glucosamine sulfate.&lt;ref name=&quot;EULAR&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jordan KM |title=EULAR Recommendations 2003: a evidence based approach to the management of knee osteoarthritis: Report of a Task Force of the Standing Committee for International Clinical Studies Including Therapeutic Trials (ESCISIT) |journal=[[Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases]] |volume=62 |issue=12 |pages=1145–55 |date=December 2003 |pmid=14644851 |pmc=1754382 |doi= 10.1136/ard.2003.011742 |author-separator=, |author2=Arden NK |author3=Doherty M |display-authors=3 |last4=Bannwarth |first4=B |last5=Bijlsma |first5=JW |last6=Dieppe |first6=P |last7=Gunther |first7=K |last8=Hauselmann |first8=H |last9=Herrero-Beaumont |first9=G |first10=P |first11=S |first14=B |first15=E |first16=K |first17=A |first18=L |first19=U |first20=B |first21=G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Major side effects of all glucosamine salt are mild gastrointestinal problem such as constipation, diarrhea, cramping, gas, heartburn, and nausea. Glucosamine sulfate has been related to drowsiness and headache. The effects of glucosamine on nursing or pregnant women have not been studied well&lt;ref&gt;Letic-Gavrilovic A, Scandurra R, Abe K. Genetic potential of interfacial guided osteogenesis in implant devices. Dent Mater J. Jun 2000;19(2):99-132.&lt;/ref&gt;. As Glucosamine is an amino sugar and a prominent precursor for glucosaminoglycans, it  may increase blood sugar levels. As glucosamine is often made from shellfish and the source of the product does not need the label, people who are allergic to seafood are advised to exercise caution as well.

====Chondroitin====

Like glucosamine, chondroitin is another major component of cartilage. Chondroitin can be manufactured synthetically, but is usually extracted from cow and shark cartilage. Chondroitin is in dietary supplements used as an substitutive medicine to treat osteoarthritis and also approved and regulated as a symptomatic slow-acting drug for this disease (SYSADOA) in Europe and some other countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jordan2003&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1136/ard.2003.011742 | author = Jordan KM, Recommendations Arden NK.

Major side effects of chondroitin are uncommon but contains hair loss and minor gastrointestinal complaints. The effects of chondroitin on nursing or pregnant women have not been studied well. Chondroitin can decrease the blood’s ability to clot, and it is not good to take it with aspirin, antiplatelet, or anticoagulant drugs. As glucosamine and chondroitin are both components of cartilage, they are sometimes combined in one product. Chondroitin products are also sometimes combined with manganese, which may help cartilage production, but is toxic in large doses. The U.S. National Academy of Sciences has set the adult tolerable upper limit for manganese at 11 mg/day; patients should be advised not to overdose that level&lt;ref&gt;Letic-Gavrilovic A, Scandurra R, Abe K.

====MSM(Methylsulfonylmethane)====
[[File:Me2SO2.png|thumbnail|100px|left|Methylsulfonylmethane|MSM]]
'''Methylsulfonylmethane''' ('''MSM''') is an organosulfur compound with the chemical formula (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. It is also known as '''DMSO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''', '''methyl sulfone''', and '''dimethyl sulfone'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gaylordchemical.com/bulletins/Bulletin301B/Bulletin301B.pdf|title= Various Names for MSM|accessdate= June 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; MSM is sold as a dietary supplement and often combined with glucosamineand/or chondroitin sulfatefor helping to treat or prevent osteoarthritis. According to  one review, &quot;The benefits claimed for MSM far exceed the number of scientific studies. It is hard to build a strong case for its use other than for treating arthritis problems.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.natural-remedies-review.com/msm.html | title = Pharmacists review the effectiveness, benefits and side effects of MSM}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1978, the FDA approved DMSO for instillation into the bladder as a treatment for interstitial cystitis. Since DMSO is metabolized to MSM by the body, MSM could be the active ingredient in DMSO treatments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=8284850|year=1994|last1=Childs|first1=SJ|title=Dimethyl sulfone (DMSO2) in the treatment of interstitial cystitis|volume=21|issue=1|pages=85–8|journal=The Urologic clinics of North America}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In October 2000, the United States FDA warned one MSM promoter, Karl Loren, to cease from making therapeutic claims for MSM.&lt;ref name=&quot;fda&quot;&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/cder/warn/cyber/oct2000/cyber034.pdf Warning letter to Karl Loren, Vibrant Life/B&amp;B International]&quot;, FDA Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, 20 October 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

====Omega-3 fatty acid====
[[Image:ALAnumbering.svg|360px|right|thumb|Chemical structure of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), an essential omega-3 fatty acid, (18:3Δ9c,12c,15c, which means a chain of 18 carbons with 3 double bonds on carbons numbered 9, 12, and 15). Although chemists count from the carbonyl carbon (blue numbering), biologists count from the ''n'' (ω) carbon (red numbering). Note that, from the ''n'' end (diagram right), the first double bond appears as the third carbon-carbon bond (line segment), hence the name &quot;''n''-3&quot;. This is explained by the fact that the ''n'' end is almost never changed during physiological transformations in the human body, as it is more energy-stable, and other compounds can be synthesized from the other carbonyl end, for example in glycerides, or from double bonds in the middle of the chain.]]

The three types of omega-3 fatty acids related to human physiology are α-Linolenic acid(ALA, which is plantiful in plant oils), Eicosapentaenoic acid(EPA), and Docosahexaenoic acid(DHA) (both commonly found in fish oils).

====Shark cartilage====
Shark cartilage is a dietary supplement from the dried and powdered cartilage of a shark. It is the tough material that composes a shark's skeleton. There is no scientific evidence that shark cartilage is good for treating or preventing cancer or other diseases.&lt;ref name=&quot;acs&quot;&gt;{{cite web | publisher = American Cancer Society | url = http://www.cancer.org/Treatment/TreatmentsandSideEffects/ComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine/PharmacologicalandBiologicalTreatment/shark-cartilage | title = Shark Cartilage | date = November 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; But,it has also been promoted as a treatment for both rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis&lt;ref name=&quot;ncbi&quot;&gt;{{cite web | publisher = US National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health | url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9743816 | title = Efficacy and tolerability of chondroitin sulfate 1200 mg/day vs chondroitin sulfate 3 x 400 mg/day vs placebo. | date = May 6, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

However these properties can be controlled by humidity. The water will then reduce its tensile strength, but increase its elongation and tear strength.
PVA has a melting point of 230 °C and 180–190°C (356-374 degrees Fahrenheit) for the fully hydrolysed and partially hydrolysed grades, respectively. It decomposes rapidly above 200 °C as it can undergo pyrolysis at high temperatures. The Poisson's ratio is between 0.42 and 0.48.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fromageau&quot;&gt;[http://www.creatis.insa-lyon.fr/~phild/publis/From03IEEE_UFFC.pdf Characterization of PVA cryogel for intravascular ultrasound elasticity imaging], Fromageau, J.; Brusseau, E.; Vray, D.; Gimenez, G.; Delachartre, P.; IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics and Frequency Control, Volume: 50, Issue: 10. 2003, Page(s): 1318 - 1324.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gait Analysis==
[[File:Jinf15.gif|300px|left|thumb|Gait Analysis]]
'''Gait analysis''' is a method used to assess the way we walk or run to highlight biomechanical abnormalities such as overpronation, oversupination, increased Q angle, hip hiking (or hitching),ankle equinus, pelvic tilt. Gait analysis is usually performed by a professional like a podiatrist or physiotherapist. But it becomes popular and easily available with many specialist running and sports shops&lt;ref&gt;Levine DF, Richards J, Whittle M. (2012).

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are following categories of people who use or study Marathi as second language.

# People having Marathi mother-tongue but studied in English or semi-English medium
# People having Marathi mother-tongue but lost or on the verge of losing touch with Marathi language
# Such people whose family is multilingual in the sense one of the parent or family member is Marathi speaking.
# Such people whose mother-tongue is other than Marathi but studied Marathi language as first or second language.
# Pupils of Marathi speaking non resident Indians
# Pupils of Migrants to non Marathi speaking areas
# Those who want to learn Marathi language as foreign language.

If one informs us on talk page of this article, which of the above background people want to learn Marathi language, then probable we can have more customised support for the given audiance.

*The teaching approach 
:While the traditional teaching method will be available; We additionally provide here a different approach. Adult education experts say that human beings usually remember words as pictures and not as single alphabate so we support here with randomly displayed marathi words with pronounciation with few additional tips on the main page itself so every time you visit you learn new word with ease is the target. 
: Simmillerly  we are also supporting on this page with learn with pictures feature This helps to understand words with cultural context and again makes easy to understand and remember.
: We will also do an effort to explain words from Marathi songs and  rhymes 
: We will also try to highlight simillarities of Marathi and european words as indoeuropean languages , also along with latin and sanskrit info where available. 
: Marathi language has borrowed words also from arabic, parsian and other geologically neighbouring languages we will make endevour to explain those words also wherever possible.
: For advance users we will show sentense translations randomly. And also in near future for those who know Hindi already we will try to provide support from Hindi language Wikibooks project. 
: Have you understood the concepts and if you have some good ideas you also can join adding up info to this book as you learn. 
: For this book we need support also from flash 'Gif' image experts and sound experts
So we hope you will enjoy learning and contributing to knowledge with this book.</text>

      <comment>/* Category-class Tags */ slight rephrasing+expansion, links</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{FUN-top|both=s ORP-top}}
==Category-class Tags==
The '''&quot;category-class&quot; tag''' of the {{TR|KD|KIND TrainzBaseSpec|p=TrainzBaseSpec}} is ''a classification and searching parameter'' defining what or how the human content creator meant for the new asset ''to be used and thought about.'' {{TL|Content Manager}} will warn the user if the tag is not present when committing. In some cases, it's mandatory&amp;mdash;particularly in those assets further refining and defining KIND specifications, for the two work hand in hand.

When encountered in the {{TBS}} or {{TL|Config.txt}} files, this is a sometimes nebulous and confusing parameter requiring a new user to develop a degree of mental agility, for example, '''a 'house' asset''' might be classified (Coded by some asset creator) as scenery, building, industry, or even  something as wildly inappropriate as 'fauna'.&lt;br
/&gt;
* In part this oddity is sometimes driven by the Trainz Data Model, which for example defines a kind ({{TR|K|mocrossing}} which has the property of having attached track, so for the occasional need, like a harbor pier, the mocrossing kind is used to implement the creators vision. But the creator is thinking of the asset as a pier/industry asset so the category-class was born to give insights as to how the creator thought of the asset. Each Trainz asset's category-class tag helps describe the 'intent' of the Asset in the game, as opposed to the internal structure of the Asset.&lt;ref
name=&quot;TOLpage&quot;&gt;{{N3V|%22Category-class%22_tag}}, Lead paras, 2014-0807&lt;br
/&gt;&lt;small&gt;&quot;Each Trainz asset's category-class tag helps describe the 'intent' of the Asset in the game, as opposed to the internal structure of the Asset.&quot;&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; The {{Plain link|http://online.ts2009.com/mediaWiki/index.php/CCG|Content Creator's Guide}} Appendix states the tag classes represent a standardized system for referring to the various types of Locos, Rolling stock, Scenery, Spline and Industry assets.&lt;ref name=&quot;TC3CCGpdf&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;&quot;The pdf file version of the ''''''Content Creators' Guide for Trainz Classics'''''', Chapter 11, pp397, Appendix-A, said &lt;br
/&gt;&lt;small&gt;&quot;the classes represent a standardized system for referring to the various types of Locos, Rolling stock, Scenery, Spline and Industry assets.&quot;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br
/&gt;
* Another reason the assigned classification'' 'may seem less than obvious' ''is the mindset of the creator, and the overall scheme (prototyping a complex of buildings perhaps) he was working on. Then there are cases when the memory fails and two letters are transposed.&lt;br
/&gt;
* In the final analysis, this tag can be defined just about any way for scenery assets where it has little importance in affecting what other {{TL|tags}} or {{TL|containers}} might be used legally. A more thoughtful definition is important in the way CM categorizes and groups searching in filters, and is especially in rolling stock.

The {{TR|K|KIND}} specification defines which other ({{wp|data type}}) entries'' are needed'' in that particular asset's config.txt file. It is the entry which defines the asset's  type, scope, and needs and the very important parameter that tells TRAINZ how to process and render the specific asset item correctly, error check against the standard for the category-class, and render it into {{wp|Three-dimensional space|3D graphics}} models. 

Each Trainz asset's category-class tag helps describe the 'intent' of the Asset in the game, as opposed to the internal structure of the Asset. The Content Creators' Guide for Trainz Classics said these classes represent a standardized system for referring to the various types of Locos, Rolling stock, Scenery, Spline and Industry assets.  The Category-class classification codes become important to all Trainzers when searching and/or filtering for suitable assets to make into content in a session or route (layout).

;&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot; size=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Trainz Base Specification 
:(all config.txt files can contain all these entries){{TBS}}
::'''&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;u&gt;Figure: 1 TrainzBaseSpec for quick reference&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;'''
&lt;/font&gt;

==Category-class code notes==
New users should be aware that these codes listed below are not the direct ContentManager.exe category sort by classifications as a simple comparison of lists will reveal, but they do affect what is displayed within such a sort filter selection. 
:For example: Set a search filter for ''''''Location&gt;Local + Category&gt;Flora''''''. (TS12 equivalent: Instally&gt;TRUE +  Category&gt;Flora) [Sometimes you have to speak geek, returning the simple and clear 'Local' has been requested, but TS12's CM has geek thinking built into the search filters.]
: In the base installed content of TRS2006-SP0 this search will yield diverse assets such as the set of  {'''Flora''' types: SOME few trees, Betonbridge (1,2,&amp;3 tracks), crop splines, sidewalks, road types} 
:but the sort will also list a much larger type group, the set of {Scenery: retaining wall splines (Arkaden...), LOADS of trees and Shrubs including Laubbaum with birds (and sound), grasses (textures?), Logs} and so forth. 
In that search you will also find electrified railroad centenary parts and the occasional animal. The result of such a search will be no better in new Trainz versions, which means the new Trainzer needs to cultivate a certain mental agility when searching for suitable content. No one has the man-power, deep pockets, nor copyright authority to systematically fix such foibles. You as a user, can clone such items and change the classification to something more sensible to yourself. That however, is not an asset you can upload to the Download Station without a copyright clearance from the original asset creator. The Trainz community is severe in policing copyrights violations! 
{{TrainzTip|These codes when applied by the content creator were in many cases cut and pasted into a new similar asset, in others, the way he or she was using the asset in their current project. In short, they are not definitive, but are indicative... even if it is only of the mental state of the creator at the time of donation to the DLS, or as happens in many cases, a case of translation from a native tounge with a different way of thinking than that of English.}} Rejoice in the positive, they are essentially free and cost you nothing but a bit of puzzlement. Free is good! Having them is better.
 
==The Category Classes are:==

Each Category Class may have a number of subcategories as listed below. Please choose the most appropriate Category Class for your item. Select the Class from the {{TL|Content Creator Plus}} drop down menu box - only one class may be selected for an asset.

Selecting a correct Category Class is important since Trainz will allow users to use the Category Class as a sort and selection criteria.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Kamut_grain.jpg|200px|right|'''बी = Seed''' pronounced as '''B''']]
*Pronounciation as of english alphabate '''B''' same pronounciation is in Marathi as बी = In Marathi बी means '''seed''' (of any plant; for singular usage only, plural is different we will not get in to plural at this stage)
* Note pronounciation of english word &quot;Bee&quot; is also similler.
* Remember pronounciation बी is not necessarily as of other words starting with B  
* Remember pronounciation बी  consonant ब् as in ''''B'''ucket'; so just ब्  is without vowel. To make sound as in english word '''Bee''' vowel sound  ई 's is added to consonant ब् with ी sign. Hence, ब् + ी = बी 

*We learned:
*Consonant ब् 
** Serise of this consonant : प्, फ्, '''ब्''', भ् , म्
*  and vowel sign to go with consonants  ी for vowel ई ; In english many spellings with '''ee''' like Bee, See, Pee contain longer sound like  ई ( ी) also few english words with single e like 'me' have longer ई ( ी)  vowel sound. (Sounds formed with english i vowel are usually shorter like 'big', 'pig' are shown in Marathi with different vowel इ ( ि) ; To make the difference more clearer; english word 'keen' contains longer vowel pronounciation as of   ई ( ी)  and word 'kin' has shorter pronounciation as of इ ( ि) )
** Vowels in Marathi language अ, आ, इ, '''ई =  ी''' , उ, ऊ, '''ए''', ऐ, ओ, औ, ऋ,ॠ, ऌ,ॡ, ॲ, ऑ</text>

* ''Are small edits welcome?'' Yes if it's enough obvious we can be bold without using the talk page. And some robots (even [http://sourceforge.net/projects/jeters/ in Java]) can do it too.
* You can notify the authors directly on their personal talk pages, but to my mind the book talk page is the best way to gather the discussions about one topic.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Rational function is &quot;any function which can be defined by a rational fraction, i.e. an algebraic fraction such that both the numerator and the denominator are polynomials&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;wiki&quot;&gt;This section was cited from en:wikipedia [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_function Rational function]oldid=591840157&lt;/ref&gt;. 
==Definition&lt;ref&gt;This sentence was cited from en:wikipedia [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_function Rational function]oldid=591840157&lt;/ref&gt;==
A function &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is called a rational function if and only if it can be written in the form

:&lt;math&gt; f(x) = \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;P\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Q\,&lt;/math&gt; are polynomials in &lt;math&gt;x\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Q\,&lt;/math&gt; is not the zero polynomial.  The domain of a function|domain of &lt;math&gt;f\,&lt;/math&gt; is the set of all points &lt;math&gt;x\,&lt;/math&gt; for which the denominator &lt;math&gt;Q(x)\,&lt;/math&gt; is not zero. 

However, if &lt;math&gt;\textstyle P&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\textstyle Q&lt;/math&gt; have a non constant polynomial greatest common divisor &lt;math&gt;\textstyle R&lt;/math&gt;, then setting &lt;math&gt;\textstyle P=P_1R&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\textstyle Q=Q_1R&lt;/math&gt; produces a rational function
:&lt;math&gt; f_1(x) = \frac{P_1(x)}{Q_1(x)}, &lt;/math&gt;
which may have a larger domain than &lt;math&gt; f(x)&lt;/math&gt;, and is equal to &lt;math&gt; f(x)&lt;/math&gt; on the domain of &lt;math&gt; f(x).&lt;/math&gt; It is a common usage to identify &lt;math&gt; f(x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; f_1(x)&lt;/math&gt;, that is to extend &quot;by continuity&quot; the domain of &lt;math&gt; f(x)&lt;/math&gt; to that of &lt;math&gt; f_1(x).&lt;/math&gt; Indeed, one can define a rational fraction as an equivalence class of fractions of polynomials, where two fractions ''A''(''x'')/''B''(''x'') and ''C''(''x'')/''D''(''x'') are considered equivalent if ''A''(''x'')''D''(''x'')=''B''(''x'')''C''(''x''). In this case &lt;math&gt;\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to &lt;math&gt;\frac{P_1(x)}{Q_1(x)}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Examples&lt;ref name=&quot;wiki&quot;&gt;This section was cited from en:wikipedia [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_function Rational function]oldid=591840157&lt;/ref&gt;==
{{multiple image
 | header = Examples of rational functions
 | align = right
 | direction = vertical
 | width = 300
 | image1 = RationalDegree3.svg
 | alt1 = Rational function of degree 3
 | caption1 = Rational function of degree 3: &lt;math&gt;y = \frac{x^3-2x}{2(x^2-5)}&lt;/math&gt;
 | image2 = RationalDegree2byXedi.svg
 | alt2 = Rational function of degree 2
 | caption2 = Rational function of degree 2: &lt;math&gt;y = \frac{x^2-3x-2}{x^2-4}&lt;/math&gt;
}}

The rational function &lt;math&gt;f(x) = \frac{x^3-2x}{2(x^2-5)}&lt;/math&gt; is not defined at &lt;math&gt;x^2=5 \Leftrightarrow x=\pm \sqrt{5}&lt;/math&gt;. It is asymptotic to &lt;math&gt;\frac{x}{2}&lt;/math&gt; as ''x'' approaches infinity.

The rational function &lt;math&gt;f(x) = \frac{x^2 + 2}{x^2 + 1}&lt;/math&gt; is defined for all real numbers, but not for all complex numbers, since if ''x'' were a square root of &lt;math&gt;-1&lt;/math&gt; (i.e. the imaginary unit or its negative), then formal evaluation would lead to division by zero: &lt;math&gt;f(i) = \frac{i^2 + 2}{i^2 + 1} = \frac{-1 + 2}{-1 + 1} = \frac{1}{0}&lt;/math&gt;, which is undefined.

A constant function such as ''f''(''x'') = π is a rational function since constants are polynomials.  Note that the function itself is rational, even though the value (mathematics)|value of ''f''(''x'') is irrational for all ''x''.

Every polynomial function &lt;math&gt;f(x) = P(x)&lt;/math&gt; is a rational function with &lt;math&gt;Q(x) = 1&lt;/math&gt;.  A function that cannot be written in this form, such as &lt;math&gt;f(x) = \sin(x)&lt;/math&gt;, is not a rational function. The adjective &quot;irrational&quot; is not generally used for functions.

The rational function &lt;math&gt;f(x) = \frac{x}{x}&lt;/math&gt; is equal to 1 for all ''x'' except 0, where there is a removable singularity.
The sum, product, or quotient (excepting division by the zero polynomial) of two rational functions is itself a rational function. However, the process of reduction to standard form may inadvertently result in the removal of such singularities unless care is taken. Using the definition of rational functions as equivalence classes gets around this, since ''x''/''x'' is equivalent to 1/1.

==Sketch a graph of a rational function==
(1)Let's sketch the graph of &lt;math&gt;y=\frac{1}{x}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
First, we must avoid &lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt; because anything can not be divided by 0. Thus x should not be 0 in the equation. 
Now we just plug in some values of x. The result is as follows:&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! &lt;math&gt;x = 1&lt;/math&gt; !! &lt;math&gt;y = 1&lt;/math&gt;
|-
! &lt;math&gt;x = 2&lt;/math&gt; !! &lt;math&gt;y = \frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;
|- 
! &lt;math&gt;x = 3&lt;/math&gt; !! &lt;math&gt;y = \frac{1}{3}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
! &lt;math&gt;x = -3&lt;/math&gt; !! &lt;math&gt;y = -\frac{1}{3}&lt;/math&gt; 
|- 
! &lt;math&gt;x = -2&lt;/math&gt; !! &lt;math&gt;y = -\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
! &lt;math&gt;x = -1&lt;/math&gt; !! &lt;math&gt;y = -1&lt;/math&gt;
|}
As x get large the function itself gets smaller and smaller. Here is the graph of &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{x}&lt;/math&gt;.

An ocean is a large area of salt water between continents. Oceans are very big and they join smaller seas together. The oceans are like one &quot;ocean&quot;, because all the &quot;oceans&quot; are joined. Oceans cover 70% of our planet. The largest ocean is the Pacific Ocean. It covers 1/3 of the Earth's surface. The smallest ocean is the Arctic Ocean. 

海洋是大洲之间的大片咸水。多个较小的海组成大洋。由于各个海洋连在一起，看来像一个大洋。海洋占地球面积的70%， 最大的太平洋占1/3，最小的是北冰洋。

Hǎiyáng shì dàzhōu zhījiān de dàpiàn xiánshuǐ. Duō gè jiàoxiǎo de hǎi zǔchéng dàyáng. Yóuyú gège hǎiyáng lián zài yīqǐ, kànlái xiàng yīgè dàyáng. Hǎiyáng zhàn Dìqiú miànjī de 70%, zuì dà de Tàipíng Yáng zhàn 1/3, zuì xiǎo de shì Běibīng Yáng.

----

There are 5 oceans in the Earth: Arctic Ocean, Atlantic ocean, Indian Ocean, Pacific Ocean, and Southern Ocean.

地球有5大洋: 北冰洋、大西洋、 India洋、太平洋和南冰洋。

Dìqiú yǒu 5 dàyáng: Běibīng Yáng, Dàxī Yáng, India Yáng, Tàipíng Yáng hé Nánbīng Yáng.

----

Different water movements separate the Southern Ocean from the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans. It is also known as the Antarctic Ocean, because it covers the area around Antarctica. Older maps may not use the names Arctic Ocean and Southern Ocean. 

不同的水运动使南冰洋别于大西洋、太平洋、India洋。由于南冰洋围绕南极洲，因此又叫做南极洋。旧的地图可能没有用北冰洋和南冰洋的名称。

The deepest ocean is the Pacific ocean. The deepest point is the Mariana Trench, being about 11,000m deep. The deep ocean is very cold, high pressure, and completely dark. Some very unusual living things live in this part of the ocean. They do not require energy from the sun to survive, because they use chemicals from deep inside the Earth.

太平洋最深， 最深点是 Mariana 海沟，约11,000m 深。深海很冷，高压和完全黑暗。深海很特殊的生物利用地球深处的化学物，无须阳光也能生存。

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Industry ==
Production means creating value or adding value to something. For example, a piece of wood that costs $30 can be made into a chair costing $40.

An industry refers to a single sector of economic production and is divided into four types:
* '''Primary industries''', which focus on the extraction of natural raw materials;
* '''Secondary industries''', which turn raw materials and intermediate goods into intermediate goods and final goods;
* '''Tertiary industries''', which provide services to other industries and to conumers;
* '''Quartenary industries''', which deal with information.

== Industrial Location ==
The focus of this module is the factors that cause firms to move in or out an area.
* '''Push factors''' are factors that discourage firms from locating in an area.
* '''Pull factors''' are factors that encourage firms to locate in an area.

== Single-Plant Firms and Multi-Plant Firms ==
A firm that that has a single site is a single-plant firm. Its headquarters, production activities, etc., are all performed in a single plant.

Characteristics:
* It is usually in an early state of development and of small scale.
* Few inputs and few outputs.
* It serves local markets rather than international ones.

A firm that has multiple sites is called a multi-plant firm. Different production processes are located in regions with different locational factors. This mode of production is '''multi-point production'''.

Sometimes, the firm has different processes spread to different countries. This mode of production is called '''multinational production''' and such enterprises are '''multinational enterprises''' (MNEs) or '''transnational corporations''' (TNCs).

      <comment>/* Capital-Intensive vs Labour-Intensive */ 4</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">There are several ways to classify manufacturing industries. This page covers three ways. We will discuss the fourth later.

==Heavy vs Light ==
* '''Heavy industries''' use heavy and bulky inputs and produce heavy and bulky outputs.
* '''Light industries''' use light and small inputs and produce light and small outputs.

Examples of heavy: ship-building, car manufacturing

Examples of light: electronics, watches, toys, textiles

== Capital-Intensive vs Labour-Intensive ==
'''Capital-intensive industries''' mainly rely on capital. '''Labour-intensive industries''' mainly rely on labour.

{{Robox|theme=4|title=Capital is not just about money}}
There are two kinds of capital. '''Working capital''' refers to money, financial assets like bonds, inventory, etc. '''Fixed capital''' refers to machinery, tools, equipment, etc.
{{Robox/Close}}

Examples of capital-intensive: Information technology, silicon chip manufacturing

Examples of labour-intensive: Watches, toys, textiles...

== High-Technology vs Low-Technology ==
Examples of hi-tech: Silicon chips, pharmacy

Examples of lo-tech: Watches, toys

      <comment>/* Physical Attributes of the Land */ +oil refinery</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''site factor''' is a locational factor that is about the manufacturing site itself. A '''situation factor''' is a locational factor that is about the distance between the manufacturing site and other sites.

== Factors Related to Inputs ==
=== Capital ===
'''Financial capital''' (a subset of working capital) can be better obtained in large cities with great commercial development, and in more open economies with open financial markets for loans and shares. Financial capital is essential for industries with high set-up and operation costs, such as hi-technology industries like biotechnology.

'''Fixed capital''' is also important for particular industries. Fixed capital is essential for heavy industries like car manufacturing, which have a high level of '''mechanisation''' and '''automation''' as most manual production processes have been replaced by robots and machinery.

=== Labour ===
Attributes of labour include:
* '''Labour cost''' (wage rate): A labour-intensive industry requires low labour costs to maximise profits. Most often, light industries fall into this category.
* '''Labour supply''': A labour-intensive industry relies on a large labour supply to support production. Again, light industries fall into this category.
* '''Education level of labour''': Sometimes, workers with special skills (such as blacksmiths) are needed. Sometimes, workers with a high level of education are needed (e.g. the software development industry).

Note that labour cost and education level are usually negatively related.

=== Physical Attributes of the Land ===
These physical attributes are favourable for industrial development
* Extensive flat land is needed for the development of heavy industries like iron and steel, oil refinery (CE97Q36) or shipbuilding.
* A mild climate is needed for industries like opencast mining and quarrying, which take place in open spaces and may be affected by wind and rain.
* Drainage is essential for industries that require cooling or water discharge, such as dyeing.

== Factors Related to Socioeconomic Situation ==
=== Infrastructure ===
Infrastructure includes:
* Water supply. This is especially important for fabrication processes that require water for cooling.
* Electricity supply. This is especially important for industries that require great electricity input to power machinery.
* Gas supply.
* Communications, wired or wireless: Telephone, fax, Internet access. This is especially important for company headquarters, since they need to contact branch offices and other outlying plants from there. It is also important for industries that require close communication with clients or partners.

=== Transport ===
Transport is essential for:
* '''Commuting''' of workers. Sometimes, workers may not live in the same area as the industrial area, particularly in areas with good urban planning. Workers may have to commute from residential to industrial areas.
* Distribution of outputs. For example, an efficient transport network is needed for the newspaper industry to distribute newspapers in a timely manner. Warehouses should be placed near transport hubs like piers and airports for the goods to be quickly transported elsewhere.
* Delivery of inputs. Some industries require inputs to be transported from elsewhere. They thus require a good transport network.

Examples:
* Distribution centres and warehouses are close to transport hubs like ports (water), airports (air) and highways (land).

There are three types of transport: water, air and land. They are for different purposes:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Water !! Air !! Land
|-
| 
* Long distances that require crossing oceans/along rivers
* Heavy, bulky products (higher tendency than land)
|
* Perishable products (must be transported quickly) - food
* Products of high value - jewellery
* Very long distances
* Fragile goods (e.g. expensive vases)
|
* Heavy, bulky products
* Door-to-door services
* Long distances on land
|}

Examples:
* Newspaper distribution - Land
* Food - Land and air
* Jewellery - Air
* Books ordered on Amazon - Water

=== Technology Level ===
The level of technology is essential for high-technology industries such as the biotechnology, information technology and aerospace industries.

Some industries require great research and development. These are known as '''R&amp;D-intensive industries'''.

=== Government Support ===
Government support can attract firms to an area in several ways:

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Irrigation Schemes ==
'''Targets''': Scanty rainfall
=== Types ===

Irrigation schemes in Southern California include the following:
* '''Dams''' and '''reservoirs''' store water.
* '''Canals''' (e.g. All-American Canal) and '''aqueducts''' (e.g. Los Angeles Aqueduct) transport water to farms.
* '''Irrigation methods''' are used to apply irrigation water to fields.

There are several types of irrigation methods.

* The '''gravity flow system''' involves digging a series of furrows. The irrigation water runs down these furrows, increasing soil moisture. The water can be recollected and reused.
* The '''sprinkler system/centre-pivot system''' involves a series of rotating '''sprinklers''' which distribute water in a circular way.

However, these two systems have some disadvantages:
* '''Leaching''' occurs as great amounts of water infiltrate into the soil. (See the chapter about [[HKDSE Geography/M6/Soil|soil]] in TRFs)
* '''Salinisation''' is worsened. (See the [[HKDSE Geography/M5/Farming Inputs in Southern California|Farming Inputs]])
* Much water is lost by '''evaporation'''.

The '''drip irrigation system''' is a response to these negative impacts. It involves using a tube with a series of poreholes which irrigate the root zone of the crops. The amount of water is carefully controlled, so leaching, salinsation and water loss by evaporation are minimised. It also allows for the addition of small amounts of pesticides and chemical fertilisers. However, the setup and maintenance cost is very high.

=== Effectiveness ===
Irrigation increases crop yield as the possibility of crop failure by drought is reduced. Moreover, it encourages plant growth, so '''yield''' increases.

== Agrochemicals ==
'''Target''': Pest problem, infertile soil
=== Types ===
Various agrochemicals are used in Southern California:
* '''Chemical fertilisers''' contain nutrients that improve soil fertility.
* '''Pesticides''' make plants resistant to pests.
* '''Insecticides''' make plants resistant to insects. 
* '''Fungicides''' prevent fungus growth.
* '''Herbicides''' prevent weed growth.

=== Effectiveness ===
* '''Chemical fertilisers''' improve soil fertility and thus yield.
* '''Pesticides''' and '''insecticides''' reduce the chance of crop failure because of pests. Yield increases.
* '''Fungicides''' and '''herbicides''' reduce the number of plants that compete for nutrients with the crops. 

== Import of Labour ==
As Southern California is facing a labour shortage problem, workers are imported from Mexico instead.

== Biotechnology ==
This will be discussed later.

==[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrocardiography  Electrocardiography] - for the heart==
[[File:Blausen 0339 Electrocardiogram.png|thumb|Illustration depicting lead placement during electrocardiography]]
'''Electrocardiography (EKG or ECG&lt;ref&gt;Abbreviated from the German word Elektro-Kardiographie&lt;/ref&gt; )''' is a quick, simple, painless recording that checks for problems with the electrical activity of your heart. An ECG is for measuring the heart’s electrical conduction system.&lt;ref&gt;Walraven, G. (2011). Basic arrhythmias (7th ed.), pp. 1–11&lt;/ref&gt; It picks up electrical impulses generated by the polarization and depolarization of cardiac tissue and translates into a waveform. The waveform is then used to measure the rate and regularity of heartbeats, including the size and position of the chambers, the presence of any damage to the heart, and the effects of drugs or devices for controlling the heart, like a pacemaker.
===Leads===
An electrocardiogram also is called an EKG or ECG. Sometimes the test is called a 12-lead EKG or 12-lead ECG. This is as the heart's electrical activity is monitored from the leads of 12 different places on the body at the same time&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/ekg/names.html National heart, lung and blood institute, other names for electrocardiogram]&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Usually, an EKG machine consists of electrode wires with gel patches, a computer which converts the signal into a waveform and adjusts for electrical artifact, a screen to view the cardiac rhythm in real time (many incorporate a 6 second delay), a printer to produce a hard copy of the waveform. The data is collected from the patient using a total of 10 electrodes&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cvphysiology.com/Arrhythmias/A013.htm Cardiovascular physiology concept, Richarde E.Klabundle]&lt;/ref&gt;.
====Limb Leads (Bipolar)====
Leads I, II, III together form the vectors of an equilateral triangle (0, 60, 120 degrees). This is called Einthoven's triangle. Einthoven found that the sum of current of '''Lead I + Lead III = Lead II'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/medicine/educational/ecg/images/triangle.gif |title=Electrocardiogram explanation image |accessdate=28 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The limb leads measure cardiac depolarization in the frontal (coronal) plane.
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Lead !! Placement of electrode
|-
| '''Lead I''' || The negative electrode attaches to the '''right arm(RA)'''. The positive electrode attaches to the '''left arm(LA)'''.The axis is 0 degrees.
|-
| '''Lead II'''  || The negative electrode attaches to the '''right arm(RA)'''.The positive electrode attaches to the '''left leg(LL)'''. The axis is +60 degrees.
|-
| '''Lead III'''  || The negative electrode attaches to the '''left arm(LA)'''.The positive electrode attaches to the '''left leg(LL)'''. The axis is 120 degrees.
|}

====Augmented Limb Leads (Unipolar)====
There are 3 augmented limb leads. These leads provide additional vector views of cardiac depolarization in the frontal plane.
Unlike leads I, II, III, the augmented leads need a central negative terminal. This virtual &quot;electrode&quot; is calculated by the electromyogram computer to measure vectors originating roughly at the center of the heart. 
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;

|-
|'''avF''' || The negative electrode is the central termininal.The positive electrode is connected to the '''left leg(LL)'''. The axis is +90 degrees.
|}

====Chest Leads (Unipolar:Precordial lead)====
Precordial leads consist of the other 6 leads and electrodes connected during an EKG. These leads measure depolarization in the axial plane using a central terminal. These provide essental information used in localizing ischemic or infarcted tissue during a cardiac event.

The interface consists of an EEG acquisition system, data processing software for feature extraction and pattern classification, and a system to transfer commands to an external device and, thus, providing feedback to an operator.]]
Brain cells communicate with each other by producing tiny electrical signals, called impulses&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003931.htm MedlinePlus,EEG]&lt;/ref&gt;.

An EEG records the oscillations of brain electric potentials recorded from perhaps 20 to 256 electrodes attached to the human scalp.The recorded signals are transmitted to an EEG system composed of amplifiers, filters, and paper chart or computer monitor. The test is done for 20~40 mins by an EEG technologist in the doctor's office or at a hospital or laboratory&lt;ref name = &quot;Niedermeyer&quot;&gt;{{cite book| author = Niedermeyer E. and da Silva F.L. | title = Electroencephalography: Basic Principles, Clinical Applications, and Related Fields | publisher = Lippincot Williams &amp; Wilkins | year = 2004| isbn = 0-7817-5126-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The EEG is used to evaluate various brain disorders.In the case of epilepsy, seizure activity will appear as rapid spiking waves on the EEG.&lt;ref&gt;Atlas of EEG &amp; Seizure Semiology. B. Abou-Khalil; Musilus, K.E.; Elsevier, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Patients with lesions of the brain from tumors or stroke, may have unusually slow EEG waves, depending on the size and the location of the lesion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EEG|url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003931.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this use has decreased with the advent of high-resolution anatomical imaging techniques such as MRI and computed tomography. Despite limited spatial resolution, EEG is still valuable tool for research and diagnosis, especially in the case of millisecond-range temporal resolution (not possible with CT or MRI).
The test can also be useful to diagnose other brain disorders like as Alzheimer's disease, certain psychoses, and a sleep disorder called narcolepsy.
The EEG may also be good at testing the overall electrical activity of the brain, such as drug intoxication,trauma or extent of brain damage in comatose patients). The EEG may also be used to monitor blood flow in the brain during surgical procedures.

===EEG 10-20 Lead System===
The 10/20 system or International 10/20 system is an internationally recognized method to describe the location of scalp electrodes. 
[[File:21 electrodes of International 10-20 system for EEG.svg|left|thumb|300px|21 electrodes of International 10-20 system for EEG]]
This system is based on the relationship between the location of an electrode and the underlying area of cerebral cortex. The &quot;10&quot; and &quot;20&quot; refer to the fact that the actual distances between adjacent electrodes are either 10% or 20% of the total front–back or right–left distance of the skull.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trans-cranial.com/local/manuals/10_20_pos_man_v1_0_pdf.pdf,10-20 system manual]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trans-cranial.com/local/manuals/10_20_pos_man_v1_0_pdf.pdf,10-20 system manual]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;American Electroencephalographic Society. Guidelines for standard electrode position nomenclature. J Clin Neurophysiol, 8:200-202, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

Each site has a letter to identify the lobe and a number to identify the hemisphere location.The letters F, T, C, P and O define frontal, temporal, central, parietal, and occipital lobes respectively.There are no central lobes. The &quot;C&quot; letter is only for identification purposes. A &quot;z&quot; (zero) refers to an electrode placed on the midline. Even numbers (2,4,6,8) means electrode positions on the right hemisphere respectively.On the other hand, odd numbers (1,3,5,7) means those on the left hemisphere. The letter codes A, Pg and Fp identify the earlobes, nasopharyngeal and frontal polar sites respectively.

Two anatomical landmarks are used for the essential positioning of the electrodes: First, the nasion is the point between the forehead and the nose.
Second, the inion is the lowest point of the skull from the back of the head and is normally indicated by a prominent bump.

When recording a more detailed EEG with more electrodes, extra electrodes are added using ''the 10% division'', which fills in intermediate sites halfway between those of the existing 10–20 system. These new electrodes named according to the Modified Combinatorial Nomenclature (MCN). This MCN system uses 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 for the left hemisphere which refers to 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50% of the inion-to-nasion distance respectively. The introduction of extra letter codes helps the naming of intermediate electrode sites. In this case, These new letter codes do not refer to an area on the underlying cerebral cortex. The new letter codes for intermediate sites are: AF – intermediate between Fp and F, FC – between F and C, FT – between F and T, CP – between C and P, TP – between T and P, PO – between P and O.  In addition, the MCN system renames four points of the 10–20 system — T3, T4, T5 and T6 — as T7, T8, P7 and P8 respectively.This higher-resolution nomenclature has been suggested and called the &quot;5% system&quot; or the &quot;10–5 system&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

===Different types of normal brain waves===
An EEG measures patterns of brain activity. The basic waveforms are the alpha, beta, theta, and delta rhythms. During an EEG, generally about 100 pages or computer screens of activity are examined.The basic waveforms needs special attentions but brief bursts of energy and responses to stimuli, such as light, are also recorded.

[[File:EOGhjdevias.jpeg|200px|left|thumb|Electrooculargraphy:Placement of Electrode]]
An electro-oculogram (EOG) is often performed after the ERG. The EOG records the polarization potential or cornealretinal potential (CRP), which is the resting potentials between the front(cornea) and Bruch’s membrane at the back of the human eye. The potential makes a dipole field with the cornea about 5 millivolts positive in comparison to the back of the eye, in a normally illuminated room. Although the EOG is from the pigment epithelium of the retina, the light rise of the potential needs both a normal pigment epithelium and normal mid-retinal function.

EOG are performed with the same lateral canthus electrodes as for the ERG and with additional electrodes placed on the medial canthus of the eyes on the nose. The common/ground electrode remains on the forehead&lt;ref&gt;[http://iscev.orgwww.iscev.org/standards/pdfs/ISCEV-EOG-Standard-2011.pdf Michael F.

'''Electroretinography(ERG)''' tests the electrical responses of various cells in the retina which is the lining at the back of the eye including the photoreceptors (rods and cones), inner retinal cells (bipolar and amacrine cells), and the ganglion cells&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iscev.org/standards/pdfs/ISCEV-PERG-Standard-2013.pdf Michael Bach et al. ISCEV standard for clinical pattern electroretinography(PERG): 2012 update;Doc Ophthalmol (2013) 126:1–7]&lt;/ref&gt;. ERG can be carried out alone or with the cortical visually evoked potential (VEP). VEPs are usually performed to measure the function of the optic nerve which is the vision part of the brain&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gosh.nhs.uk/medical-information/procedures-and-treatments/vep-erg/ Great Ormond Street hospital for children, Visual evoked potential (VEP) and electroretinogram (ERG) tests]&lt;/ref&gt;.

ERG response to fast bright flashes (50 or 100ms in duration) is recorded with an extracellular electrode positioned either on the cornea, in the vitreous or at different levels inside the retina.  and processed using an digital system.

The recording conditions may be various in order to test the overall health of the retina and the function of specific light receptors (different retinal cells); ie the cones and rods are for day and night vision respectively.

Optimal responses are recorded through contact lens type electrodes. Other types of electrodes are proper for clinical recordings. These include filament, fibre and gold foil type electrodes. Useful results can also be done with surface electrodes on lower eye-lids. All except the latter need a local anaesthetic eye-drop to allow the electrodes comfortably. Dilation of the pupil is also needed to obtain standardized responses.

Bright flashes would bring ERGs including an a-wave (initial negative deflection) followed by a b-wave (positive deflection). The a-wave is produced by the photoreceptors, while A mixture of cells including photoreceptors, bipolar, amacrine, and Muller cells or Muller glia cause the other waves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webvision.med.utah.edu/book/electrophysiology/the-electroretinogram-erg/#The%20origin%20of%20the%20major%20ERG%20waves waves Webvision at University of Utah]&lt;/ref&gt;

==[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audiology Audiology] - for the auditory system==

'''Audiology''' is a field of science thatin identifies, diagnoses, treats and monitors disorders of the auditory and vestibular system parts of the ear. '''Audiologist''' are the health professional who treat those with hearing loss and proactively prevent related damage. 
According to the Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology Act, 1991 (ASLPA),the scope of audiology in Ontario,Canada is as follows: &quot;The practice of audiology is the assessment of auditory function and the treatment and prevention of auditory dysfunction to develop, maintain, rehabilitate or augment auditory and communicative functions. Audiologists are concerned with the prevention, identification, assessment, treatment and (re)habilitation of hearing difficulties in children and adults. Audiologists also provide education and counseling services for people experiencing hearing difficulties and vestibular problems, such as dizziness and tinnitus&lt;ref&gt;http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/statutes/english/elaws_statutes_91a19_e.htm&lt;/ref&gt;. Audiologist works in hospitals,public health units,community Health Centres,schools,private practice,hearing aid manufacturers and so on&lt;ref&gt;http://www.caslpo.com/AboutTheProfessions/Audiologists/tabid/64/Default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;.
An Audiologist usually graduates with one of the qualifications among MSc(Audiology), Au.D., STI, PhD, or ScD up to the program, and country standard.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Weather and Climate ==
Southern California has a '''Mediterranean climate''' characterised by hot and dry summers (Apr -&gt; Oct) and warm, humid winters (Nov -&gt; Mar).

=== Insolation and Temperature ===
Insolation and temperature are high in Southern California. Southern California receives an annual temperature of 12 to 32 degrees.

It is hot in summer and warm in winter. This is both because it is located in mid-latitudes with high solar radiation input, and because the lack of cloud cover allows insolation to reach the ground directly without much scattering in the atmosphere.

=== Rainfall===
Southern California receives '''scanty''' and '''unstable''' rainfall. The annual rainfall is around 200 to 500 mm. It mainly falls in winter. Annual variation of rainfall is great.

Rainfall decreases from north to south, and from east to west：
* The coastal areas receive much relief rain thanks to the Coast Ranges. However, on the leeward side, the Central Valley receives very little rainfall because it is in the rain shadow.
* The southern tip of California has a '''subtropical desert''' climate. Offshore winds remove moisture from the area throughout the year. Thus rainfall is very scarce.

== Land ==

=== Relief ===
The relief of Southern California is hilly, with the Sierra Nevada and Coast Ranges. However, extensive lowland can be found in the Central and Imperial Valleys, where much of the farming is concentrated.
=== Soil ===
The evaporation rate is very high, so soil moisture is low. Salinisation occurs:
* As the insolation and temperature are high, evaporation rate is high.
* The underground water rises to the earth's surface through '''capillary action'''.
* The underground water is evaporated, leaving a '''hardpan''' layer of '''salt crust''' on the earth's surface. Farming is thus hindered and the soil is thus '''alkaline'''.

As there is little vegetation cover in Southern California, the soil fertility is low.

=== Drainage ===
It is mainly drained by the San Joaquin River in the Central Valley and the Colorado River in the Imperial Valley.

== Economic Inputs ==

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Geological hazards''' include landslides, mudflows, earthflows, avalanches. Landslides are discussed here.

{{Robox|theme=2|title=The Twos Worst Landslides of 1972}}
The two worst landslides in Hong Kong are the Sau Mau Ping landslide (71 killed) and the Po Shan landslide (67 killed).
{{Robox/Close}}

== Distrubution ==
Landslides exhibit clear temporal and spatial distribution.
=== Temporal ===
Landslides concentrate in summmer. About 78% of Hong Kong's rainfall falls in summer. Wet southeasterly monsoons and typhoons bring rainstorms from the ocean. (See E2)

=== Spatial ===
Landslides occur more often on granite slopes than tuff slopes. Granite slopes have lower resistance. They are more prone to weathering, so they are disintegrated into smaller fragments and particles. The internal cohesion of the slope materials is weaker. Also, more granite slopes have gone through human development than tuff slopes. For example, the two sides of Victoria Harbour, an exposed granite batholith, has gone through the most urban development. This leads to more landslides, discussed on the next page.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I believe that the best way to learn a subject is to teach. Practically, it means that I can lecture on the subject or I can write a book on the subject. I have opted to do the latter and the subject of my writing in Philosophy. My aim is to write a History of World Philosophies. Earlier, I had thought about the ways to cover the subject. I sense that merely summarizing the views of the Philosophers was inadequate. So I have decided to make some amendments to my approach. A new approach will consider the socio-political context which will help the reader to understand the formulation of ideas. Secondly, I will begin the book by discussing the basic divisions of Philosophy(Epistemology, Metaphysics, Logic and so on) for I have felt that the reader finds it hard to comprehend the rest of the book it he/she is not familiar/introduced to the basic divisions in Philosophy.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Strength Factors ==
=== Rainfall ===
Rainfall is the immediate and direct cause of landslides.

Water acts as a lubricant. When a large amount rainwater seeps into soil, the soil's pore water pressure increases. The friction and internal cohesion of slope materials reduce. This reduces the strength of slopes and destabilises slopes.

{{Robox|theme=2|title=Landslide Potential Index (LPI)}}
The Landslide Potential Index measures the capability of a rainstorm to produce landslides. It is devised by the CEDD and tells the relative severity of the rainstorm in relation to the rainstorm in the past 20 years. The highest index recorded is the 2008 one, with the Cafeteria Old Beach landslide. The rainstorm causing the Kwun Lung Lau Landslide had an LPI of 10. ([http://hkss.cedd.gov.hk/hkss/eng/landslipwarn/LPI_since_85%20updated%20on%20201405_English.pdf Source])
{{Robox/Close}}

=== Geology ===
Granite and coarse-grained volcanic rocks are vulnerable to weathering in a hot, wet climate like Hong Kong's. Feldspar is weathered chemically into clay. Quartz is resistant to chemical weathering, but is loosened. Joints, like those in granite, allow water to infiltrate and weather the rock to a great depth. Rapid chemical weathering creates a thick soil profile on slopes.

=== Vegetation Cover ===
Vegetation cover reduces surface runoff during heavy rainstorms. Plant roots bind soil particles together. However, plants also release organic chemicals which worsen 

Frequent hill fires destroy the vegetation cover, leaving slopes unprotected.

=== Construction ===
[[File:Shanty_housing_in_Hong_Kong.jpeg|left|thumb|200px|Squatter areas on slopes are prone to landslides.]]
During development, concrete is used to cover the slope. Concrete is impermeable, so infiltration decreases in that area. The landslide risk is reduced. However, the overland flow will increase. Infiltration will increase downslope. Water acts as a lubricant. When a large amount rainwater seeps into soil, the soil's pore water pressure increases. The friction and internal cohesion of slope materials reduce. This reduces the strength of slopes and destabilises the slopes.

{{Robox|theme=2|title=Cut slopes in Hong Kong}}
There are around 57000 slopes of significant size in Hong Kong, of which a third of them are private property. ([http://www.cedd.gov.hk/eng/publications/information_notes/doc/in_2008_10e.pdf Source])
{{Robox/Close}}

=== Cultivation ===
Unauthorised cultivation threatens slope stability. When people cut into slopes for cultivation without applying stabilisation measures, the internal cohesion of slope materials may reduce. The cohesion is further weakened by ploughing. Moreover, the removal of vegetation induces heavy rainsplash, so soil erosion is serious. The internal cohesion of slope materials is further compromised.

=== Poor Drainage ===
Both surface and subsurface drainage can drain away water during rainstorms. Poor management of the drainage system will increase the amount of infiltration. Water acts as a lubricant. When a large amount rainwater seeps into soil, the soil's pore water pressure increases. The friction and internal cohesion of slope materials reduce. This reduces the strength of slopes and destabilises the slopes.

{{Robox|theme=2|title=Kwun Lung Lau Landslide}}
After a persistent 48-hour rain, a drainage pipe leaked. The water table rose rapidly. Water acted as a lubricant. When a large amount rainwater seeped into soil, the soil's pore water pressure increased. The friction and internal cohesion of slope materials reduced. Eventually, the weak protective masonry wall failed. The slope collapsed and killed five pedestrians.
{{Robox/Close}}

== Stress Factors ==
=== Slope Gradient ===
Slopes with steeper gradients are more vulnerable to landslides. This is because gravity has a greater influence on the slope, increasing the sliding force. In Hong Kong, the general topography favours landslides since a lot of slopes have gradients &gt;26°, which means they have a high risk of landslides.

=== Cut Slopes ===
Cutting and filling slopes increases slope gradient, sometimes increasing it to 45°. This greatly increases stress.

=== Loose Materials and Large Trees ===
Unstable materials like large boulders add to the stress of the slope. Very large trees may have the same effect. They worsen the landslide risk.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Geotechnical Engineering Office of the Civil Engineering and Development Department is responsible for slope protection in Hong Kong.

== On Natural Slopes ==

=== Blocking and Diversion of Debris ===
These include
* Protective barriers
* Check dams
* Boulder/debris fences
* Debris diversion

Effectiveness:
These measures may not work if the barriers are too weak to hold the debris, or if the amount of slope materials that collapsed is too much for these measures to handle.

=== Drainage ===
Drainage system drains away water so as to decrease infiltration. The pore water pressure will not increase as quickly during a landslide, maintaining strength.

Effectiveness:
An efficient drainage system can reduce infiltration and thus the landslide risk. However, a faulty drainage system can worsen matters, such as the leaked pipe at Kwun Lung Lau.

=== Land Use Planning ===
The GEO has records of all landslide sites. Land use planning is carried out. Areas with great landslide risk may apply appropriate stabilisation measures. Some slopes may be evacuated because the slope is very unstable and the cost of stabilisation is too high.

For example, some isolated dwellings at the foot of Queen's Hill were evacuated. ([http://hkss.cedd.gov.hk/hkss/eng/lic/Html_98/QH.aspx Source])

The Landslide Risk Assessment Framework evaluates the potential danger of landslides for development projects.

=== Land Use Restriction ===
* Hillside squatters are relocated and the huts are demolished. In the '80, there were 27 landslide-related deaths in squatter areas; there were only two in the '90s.
* Black spots of unauthorised cultivation are identified for clearance.
* Careful study and government approval are legally required before slope cutting.

== On Man-Made Slopes ==
=== Slope Maintenance ===
* The government maintains government slopes
* Private land owners are required to maintain their slopes, but the government provides free advisory services for them. This is important as 1/3 of Hong Kong's man-made slopes are private.
* The '''Catalogue of Slopes''' identifies the maintenance responsibility of slopes. This aids different parties in identifying their responsibilities.

Ensuring that the appropriate persons maintain slopes avoids unnecessary deaths.

=== Regular Checking ===
* Existing man-made slopes are inspected each year to have their risks evaluated.
** An inspector may check for: cracks, surface damage, damage to drainage channels
** If problems are found, repair work will be carried out.

On very dangerous slopes, they have instruments monitoring water pressure and ground water level. This way, in the event of high landslide risk, the area can be evacuated on time.

Qualified geotechnical engineers carry out engineer inspections at least once every five years, and may issue warnings if slopes are found to be unstable.

=== Slope Strengthening ===
By altering the landscape:
* Loose materials like unstable/overhanging boulders are removed from slopes. Thus the additional stress is removed.
* Large trees are removed from slopes. Thus the additional stress is removed. They are replaced by smaller plants with roots that are equally capable of retaining soil.
* Afforestation is carried out with technologies like '''hydroseeding'''. Specific vegetation and grass types that are good at retaining soil (i.e. have dense, long roots) are planted. Grass can create a woven map over the slope.

By geotechnical means:
* Soil nails are a technique of slope enforcement. Nails composed of a steelbar, surrounding grouted column and a nail head are called soil nails. They are inserted into slopes are regular intervals, anchoring them to the slope. This prevents slope materials from sliding down.
* Protective retaining walls can support slope surfaces.
* Impermeable layers can prevent water from infiltrating. Chunam plaster and shotcrete are examples. Shotcrete involves spraying concrete on slopes at high velocity. It is cheap and easy to adopt.

Effectiveness note:
* Walls that are too weak may fail (e.g. Kwun Lung Lau)
* Impermeable layers like shotcrete provide some surface protection, but no strong support.
* The effectiveness of hard structures wane over time.

== Others ==
=== Warnings ===
The '''Landslip Warning System''' is jointly operated by the GEO and the HKO. They provide instant announcements of the warnings and take precautionary measures.

=== Education ===
[[File:Landslide education poster.jpg|thumb|right|200px]]
The public are educated about:
* Slope maintenance
* Precautionary measures during rainstorms
* What to do during landslides
It has the added benefit of creating support in the community.

This is done in several ways: Exhibitions, talks in public schools, talks for the general public, incorporating slope protection into the Dynamic Earth module of the geography syllabus, preparing education toolkits, leaflets, booklets, handbooks, constructing the Hong Kong Slope Safety website, online courses

=== Advisory ===
The GEO also has a 24-hour service for government departments to seek advice after landslides. There is also a free advisory service for private slope maintenance.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The Least Cost Theory ==
The Least Cost Theory states that a firm will locate in an area where the labour and raw materials are cheapest. However, it makes many assumptions. In particular:
* Firms have no perfect knowledge about costs.
* Firms are affected by personal preferences, especially small, new and family-run firms. For example, a family-run firm is more likely to operate in the family's hometown, even if it is not the most profitable there.

A '''maximiser''' has perfect knowledge about costs, and will located in the least-cost area. A '''satisficer''', by contrast, is satisfied with the profits made even if it is below the maximum.

== Industrial Agglomeration ==
'''Industrial agglomeration''' refers to the clustering of a large number of firms in a related area.

=== Agglomeration economies ===
'''Agglomeration economies''' are the economic benefits brought by agglomeration:

* Infrastructure is better developed.
* Skilled labour of that particular industry is attracted to the area.

* It encourages more investment in that area.
* Firms can purchase similar inputs in bulk, and have a closer relationship with suppliers and buyers.
* Information can be exchanged between firms.
* The possiblity of joint ventures is higher.
* They can share sources of innovation.

All of the above can cut production costs and increase productivity.

=== Agglomeration diseconomies ===
However, there are also disadvantages:
* Traffic congestion
* Pollution
* ↑ Wages and land rent
* Existing facilities may become inadequate

== Industrial Inertia ==
Sometimes, even though the original locational advantage of locating a plant in an area is gone, the plant still decides to stay in that area.

There are many reasons to explain this:

Pull factors of the old site:
* Existence of large markets
* Existence of a pool of specialised labour
* Existing infrastructure is good
* Good transport network
* Agglomeration - linkages with related firms

Push factors of the new site:
* Moving incurs high costs, especially for fixed capital like machines

The personal preference of the owner is also significant, especially for small-scale firms employing single-point production. Sometimes, government policy also discourages moving away as this will lead to unemployment.

== Footloose Industries ==
A '''footloose industry''' is one that can be located in most places because locational factors are not very important.

Underlying reasons:
Non-resistant and well-jointed → Chemical weathering ↑ → Erosion ↑ → Mass Movement ↑ → Low and rounded, thick colluvium layer

Formation:
# Magma in the asthenosphere is under great pressure.
# A line of weakness develops in the crust and reaches the magma chamber below.
# The magma rises through the line of weakness and into the earth's crust.
# It cools and solidifies at a very slow rate in a dome-shaped magma reservoir. Crystallisation occurs.
# It becomes a plutonic rock called a granite batholith.
# As Hong Kong's climate is hot and wet, active chemical weathering and erosion remove the layer above.
# The batholith is exposed to the surface to produce granitic hills.

Write a variation of our program so that it first asks whether the user wants to read from a
file, write to a file, or quit.  If the user responds with &quot;quit&quot;, the program
should exit. If they respond with &quot;read&quot;, the program should ask them for a
file name and then print that file to the screen (if the file doesn't
exist, the program may crash).  If they respond with &quot;write&quot;, it should ask
them for a file name and then ask them for text to write to the file,
with &quot;.&quot;  signaling completion. All but the &quot;.&quot; should be written
to the file.

For example, running this program might produce:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
Do you want to [read] a file, [write] a file, or [quit]?
read
Enter a file name to read:
foo
...contents of foo...
Do you want to [read] a file, [write] a file, or [quit]?
write
Enter a file name to write:
foo
Enter text (dot on a line by itself to end):
this is some
text for
foo
.
Do you want to [read] a file, [write] a file, or [quit]?
read
Enter a file name to read:
foo
this is some
text for
foo
Do you want to [read] a file, [write] a file, or [quit]?
blech
I don't understand the command blech.
Do you want to [read] a file, [write] a file, or [quit]?
quit
Goodbye!
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

module Main
    where

import System.IO
import Control.Exception
