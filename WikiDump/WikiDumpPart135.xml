This page has a lot of links that are presumably left over from copying the content from Wikipedia, but don't point anywhere on Wikibooks. If somebody wants to help out, tidying these up would be good. Probably nearly all of them shouldn't be links at all; Wikibooks should be mostly self-contained, and any content from the linked-to Wikipedia pages that is directly relevant should be included inline in the book. --[[User:Fishpi|Fishpi]] ([[User talk:Fishpi|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Fishpi|contribs]]) 21:36, 9 February 2011 (UTC)</text>

=== Description ===

A set of new, multi-item measures are operationalized. The authors define and measure the salient infrastructural competencies – termed business-to-business seller competence (B2B-SC) – associated with the seller-side of Internet-enabled commerce. They find that the conceptual domain of B2B-SC comprises seven theoretically important dimensions: (1) technical skills, (2) [[Handbook of Management Scales/Change disposition|change disposition]], (3) [[Handbook of Management Scales/Conflict management|conflict management]], (4) [[Handbook of Management Scales/Market acuity|market acuity]], (5) [[Handbook of Management Scales/Coordinated logistics|coordinated logistics]], (6) [[Handbook of Management Scales/Knowledge channels|knowledge channels]], and (7) [[Handbook of Management Scales/Fluid partnering|fluid partnering]].

=== Definition ===

Technical skills competence refers to the general abilities of the seller’s employees to use advanced information and communication technologies – such as the Internet, product development software, Internet-enabled EDI, and supply chain software – in their daily work to support business objectives.

=== Items ===

*Proficient in using information and communication technologies (ICT) to get work done. (0.83)
*Mastery of workplace ICT features and functions. (0.96)
*Make use of advanced features of ICT. (0.77)

=== Comments ===

Much efforts have been made by the authors in order to ensure that the new scales exhibit sufficient psychometric properties, which make them quite useful.

=== Definition ===

Change disposition competence is defined as a general readiness for organizational change, or the willingness of the seller’s employees to alter operations in support of the business.

=== Items ===

*Middle managers thrive in pivotal change roles. (0.72)
*Managers are generally supportive of change. (0.64)
*It is easy to implement new practices and initiatives. (0.70)

=== Description ===

A set of new, multi-item measures are operationalized. The authors define and measure the salient infrastructural competencies – termed business-to-business seller competence (B2B-SC) – associated with the seller-side of Internet-enabled commerce. They find that the conceptual domain of B2B-SC comprises seven theoretically important dimensions: (1) [[Handbook of Management Scales/Technical skills|technical skills]], (2) [[Handbook of Management Scales/Change disposition|change disposition]], (3) conflict management, (4) [[Handbook of Management Scales/Market acuity|market acuity]], (5) [[Handbook of Management Scales/Coordinated logistics|coordinated logistics]], (6) [[Handbook of Management Scales/Knowledge channels|knowledge channels]], and (7) [[Handbook of Management Scales/Fluid partnering|fluid partnering]].

=== Definition ===

Conflict management is defined as a competence in which the selling firm has a systematic approach to the handling of disagreements with supply chain partners that consists of resolution strategies used to foster a mutually acceptable relationship.

=== Items ===

*Systems and procedures in place to resolve disputes with supply chain partners. (0.67)
*View differences in opinion with partners as an opportunity to improve relationship effectiveness. (0.72)
*Settling of disputes is joint responsibility of us and partners. (0.68)
*Regularly discuss with supply chain partners any differences in opinion we have with them. (0.85)

=== Comments ===

Much efforts have been made by the authors in order to ensure that the new scales exhibit sufficient psychometric properties, which make them quite useful. The items were evaluated on a Likert scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). However, the observed mean value is 3.64 rather than 3. It might therefore be recommendable to change the wording, e.g. &quot;Settling of disputes is ALWAYS joint responsibility of us and partners&quot;.

=== Description ===

A set of new, multi-item measures are operationalized. The authors define and measure the salient infrastructural competencies – termed business-to-business seller competence (B2B-SC) – associated with the seller-side of Internet-enabled commerce. They find that the conceptual domain of B2B-SC comprises seven theoretically important dimensions: (1) [[Handbook of Management Scales/Technical skills|technical skills]], (2) [[Handbook of Management Scales/Change disposition|change disposition]], (3) [[Handbook of Management Scales/Conflict management|conflict management]], (4) market acuity, (5) [[Handbook of Management Scales/Coordinated logistics|coordinated logistics]], (6) [[Handbook of Management Scales/Knowledge channels|knowledge channels]], and (7) [[Handbook of Management Scales/Fluid partnering|fluid partnering]].

=== Definition ===

Market acuity denotes the ability of the seller to see the competitive environment clearly and to anticipate customers’ needs and wants.

=== Items ===

*Have a good understanding of competitors’ strengths and strategies. (0.72)
*Foresee customers’ product or service needs. (0.82)
*Understand target markets better than competitors. (0.69)
*Able to sense shifting boundaries of industry. (0.74)

== Market acuity (composite reliability = 0.77; average variance extracted = 0.52) ==
=== Description ===

The authors report a two-stage approach for the development and validation of new multi-item measurement scales reflecting a multidimensional construct called new service development competence. It is operationalized as a multidimensional construct reflected by five complementary dimensions: [[Handbook of Management Scales/New service development process focus|new service development process focus]], market acuity, [[Handbook of Management Scales/New service development strategy|new service development strategy]], [[Handbook of Management Scales/New service development culture|new service development culture]], and [[Handbook of Management Scales/Information technology experience|information technology experience]].

=== Definition ===

New service development competence reflects an organization’s expertise in deploying resources and routines, usually in combination, to achieve a desired new service outcome. Market acuity describes the ability of the service organization to see the competitive environment clearly and to anticipate and respond to customers’ evolving needs and wants.

=== Items ===

*Our service firm actively seeks out information about our company’s business environment. (0.484)
*New offerings are designed based on information actively collected on evolving market shifts and customer demands for these offerings. (0.843)
*Our service firm uses collected information to respond quickly to changes in the competitive environment. (.793)
*Customers, both internal and external, are viewed as potential and valuable sources of new offering ideas and opportunities. (0.716)

=== Comments ===

Much efforts have been made by the authors in order to ensure that the new scales exhibit sufficient psychometric properties, which make them quite useful. The mean value of the last item is 3.55 and therefore above the expected 3. It may therefore be reworded (e.g. &quot;are ''often'' viewed&quot; instead of &quot;are viewed&quot;).

== Market acuity (composite reliability = 0.80) ==
=== Description ===

The authors follow a two-phased approach to develop multi-item scales that measure dimensions of service orientation in the context of business-to-business e-commerce. Service orientation was conceptualized as a third-order construct comprised of five combinative service competency bundles: service climate; market focus; process management; human resource policy; and metrics and standards.

One of these five second-order dimensions, market focus, consists of three first-order dimensions: market acuity, [[Handbook of Management Scales/Relationship management|relationship management]], and [[Handbook of Management Scales/New service development|new service development]].

=== Definition ===

The ability to understand the business environment, the market, the competition, the customer requirements, and to implement strategies to compete successfully.

=== Items ===

*Market information is used to implement strategies to compete effectively. (0.65)
*We identify the drivers of value on the market/market segment. (0.70)
*We understand our customers’ business needs better than our competitors do. (0.68)

=== Comments ===

The third item was dropped due to low regression weight (or lower than remaining items) and due to redundancy.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Coordinated logistics (composite reliability = 0.69) ==
=== Description ===

A set of new, multi-item measures are operationalized. The authors define and measure the salient infrastructural competencies – termed business-to-business seller competence (B2B-SC) – associated with the seller-side of Internet-enabled commerce. They find that the conceptual domain of B2B-SC comprises seven theoretically important dimensions: (1) [[Handbook of Management Scales/Technical skills|technical skills]], (2) [[Handbook of Management Scales/Change disposition|change disposition]], (3) [[Handbook of Management Scales/Conflict management|conflict management]], (4) [[Handbook of Management Scales/Market acuity|market acuity]], (5) coordinated logistics, (6) [[Handbook of Management Scales/Knowledge channels|knowledge channels]], and (7) [[Handbook of Management Scales/Fluid partnering|fluid partnering]].

=== Definition ===

Coordinated logistics competence represents the seller’s ability to effectively track and manage the flow of materials and information through a network of organizations that deliver products to customers.

=== Items ===

*Routinely provide customers with order status in real-time. (0.76)
*Able to account for inbound materials in real-time. (0.76)

=== Comments ===

Much efforts have been made by the authors in order to ensure that the new scales exhibit sufficient psychometric properties, which make them quite useful. However, as a two-item scale it needs to be supplemented by additional items. Also, the composite reliability of this scale is too low. It might be questioned, if these two items really go right to the heart of logistics.

=== Definition ===

Knowledge channels competence refers to the boundary-spanning strategies used by sellers that permit the transfer, recombination, and/or creation of knowledge among supply chain partners.

=== Items ===

*Managers regularly visit supply chain partners to enable two-way sharing of expertise. (0.85)
*Use teams that cross company boundaries. (0.81)
*Employees share expertise with partners via informal gatherings. (0.48)

=== Comments ===

Much efforts have been made by the authors in order to ensure that the new scales exhibit sufficient psychometric properties, which make them quite useful. The standardized path loading of the third item is quite low, but it might well be necessary to achieve content validity.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
To our knowledge, there is no taxonomy for VR-based medical simulators. However, there are many benefits of a taxonomy:
* Provides standardized terminology and classification;
* Helps to communicate between engineers, medical experts, educators and other important disciplines;
* Can be used after task analysis to prioritize components;
* Facilitates analysis and validation.
In summary a taxonomy supports communication and development.

The taxonomy on this page is based on &lt;ref name=&quot;Ullrich2011&quot;&gt;Ullrich S, Knott T, Kuhlen T. Dissecting in Silico: Towards a Taxonomy for Medical Simulators. Studies in health technology and informatics. Newport Beach CA, USA. 2011, February. 163:677-679. IOS Press.&lt;/ref&gt;. The intention is to make the taxonomy more accessible and dynamic to community-based extensions and changes.

== Related Work ==

In medical simulation there is an overwhelming amount of papers describing simulators and algorithms. To create a taxonomy we identified and analyzed numerous position papers &lt;ref name=&quot;Satava1996&quot;&gt;Satava RM. Medical virtual reality. The current status of the future. Studies in Health Technology and Informatics. 1996;29:100–106.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Liu2003&quot;&gt;Liu A, Tendick F, Cleary K, Kaufmann C. A survey of surgical simulation: applications, technology, and education. Presence: Teleoper Virtual Environ. 2003;12(6):599–614.&lt;/ref&gt;, surveys of existing simulators &lt;ref name=&quot;Delingette2004&quot;&gt;Delingette H, Ayache N. Soft Tissue Modeling for Surgery Simulation. In: Computational
Models for the Human Body. Elsevier; 2004. p. 453–550.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;John2008&quot;&gt;John NW. Design and implementation of medical training simulators. Virtual Reality. 2008;12(4):269–279.&lt;/ref&gt; to name a few.

Satava postulated five generations of simulators: geometric anatomy, physical dynamics modeling, physiologic characteristics, microscopic anatomy, and biochemical systems &lt;ref name=&quot;Satava1996&quot;/&gt;. Furthermore, he defined the following requirements for realism in medical simulators: visual fidelity, interactivity between objects, object physical properties, object physiologic properties, and sensory input.

Liu et al. &lt;ref name=&quot;Liu2003&quot;/&gt; discriminate between technical (deformable models, collision detection, visual and haptic displays, and tissue modeling and characterization) and cognitive components (performance and training).

Delingette &lt;ref name=&quot;Delingette2004&quot;/&gt; divided simulator components into input devices, surgery simulator (collision detection and processing, geometric modelling, physical modelling, haptic rendering, and visual rendering), and output devices.

In a recent overview by John &lt;ref name=&quot;John2008&quot;/&gt;, three areas have been defined: input data, processor, and interaction. Here, interaction has been subdivided into haptics, display technologies, other hardware components, and algorithms and software.

== Taxonomy ==

Merging the definitions and reports of the related work, we propose a taxonomy (see outline below) with three main classes: '''Datasets''', '''Hardware''', and '''Software'''. In the following we provide a brief definition of each class and give some examples, that will be discussed in the following chapters of this book in more detail.


# '''Datasets'''
#; Synthetic
#: Computed
#: Modeled
#; Subject-specific
#: In Vivo
#: Ex Vivo
# '''Hardware'''
#; Interaction devices
#: Sensor-based
#: Props
#; Processing Unit
#: Stationary
#: Mobile
#; Output
#: Visual
#: Haptic
#: Acoustic
# '''Software'''
#; Model
#: Technical
#: Content
#; Interaction
#: Tasks
#: Metaphors
#: Technical
#; Simulation
#: Static
#: Dynamic
#: Physiological
#; Rendering
#: Visual
#: Haptic
#: Acoustic

=== Datasets ===

''Synthetic datasets'' can be ''Computed'' (e.g., based on statistic models or heuristics) or ''Modeled'' (e.g., produced by digital artists with 3D modeling tools, or sourced from CAD designs of instruments). Usually, these are well-meshed surface geometries with highly detailed textures. Another approach are ''Subject-specific datasets''. Several medical imaging modalities (e.g., sonography, MRI, CT) allow the reconstruction of volume data, that can either be used directly or segmented for further processing. Furthermore, physiological parameters, tissue properties and other can either be measured ''In Vivo'' or ''Ex Vivo''.

=== Hardware ===

''Interaction devices'' can either be ''Sensor-based'' or ''Props''. Sensor-based devices can be commercial off-the-shelf products, self-constructed prototypes or hybrids and examples range from game console controllers to haptic devices and optical tracking systems. Props can replicate body-parts or instruments, that are either augmented, tracked or simply passive parts of the overall setup. The ''Processing unit'' relates to the kind of computing systems that are used for the simulator. This can be ''Stationary'' (e.g., single- or multi-core systems, clusters, or servers) or ''Mobile'' systems (e.g., handheld devices, or streaming clients). Furthermore, GPUs can be used for parallelization. Finally, the ''Output'' can be realized on several modalities, ''Visual'', ''Haptic'' and ''Acoustic'' being the three most common. The visual component can be further divided into different display types: HMD, screen or projection screen with or without stereoscopic rendering. Likewise, haptics is divided into tactile and kinesthetic feedback.

=== Software ===

The ''Model'' is the link between the datasets and the algorithms. It can be regarded from two points of view: ''Technical'' (e.g., data structure, LODs, mappings &lt;ref name=&quot;Rosse2003&quot;&gt;Rosse C, Mejino JLV. A reference ontology for biomedical informatics: the Foundational Model of Anatomy. J Biomed Inform. 2003 Dec;36(6):478–500.&lt;/ref&gt;, etc.) and ''Content'' (e.g., patient, instruments, and environment &lt;ref name=&quot;Harders2008&quot;&gt;Harders M. Surgical Scene Generation for Virtual Reality-Based Training in Medicine. Springer-Verlag; 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;). One crucial element for the acceptance of a medical simulator is the Interaction with numerous solutions from HCI and 3DUI. Here, we can distinguish between ''Tasks'' (navigation, selection, manipulation &lt;ref name=&quot;Heinrichs2004&quot;&gt;Heinrichs WL, Srivastava S, Montgomery K, Dev P. The Fundamental Manipulations of Surgery: A Structured Vocabulary for Designing Surgical Curricula and Simulators. The Journal of the American Associacion of Gynecologic Laparoscopists. 2004;11(4):450–456.&lt;/ref&gt;, session management, assessment etc.), ''Metaphors'' (direct “natural” interaction, gestures, etc. &lt;ref name=&quot;Bowman2004&quot;&gt;Bowman DA, Kruijff E, LaViola JJ, Poupyrev I. 3D User Interfaces: Theory and Practice. Addison-Wesley Professional; 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;) and ''Technical'' (e.g., GUI elements, OSDs, or annotations). ''Simulation'' is divided into different levels: ''Static'' (e.g., fixed structural anatomy, environment), ''Dynamic'' (e.g., physics-based with collision detection and handling &lt;ref name=&quot;Teschner2005&quot;&gt;Teschner M, Kimmerle S, Heidelberger B, Zachmann G, Raghupathi L, Fuhrmann A, Cani MP, Faure F, Magnenat-Thalmann N, Strasser W, Volino P. Collision Detection for Deformable Objects. Computer Graphics Forum. 2005 March;24(1):61–81.&lt;/ref&gt;, rigid body dynamics, or continuum mechanics applied to soft tissue) and ''Physiological'' (e.g., functional anatomy &lt;ref name=&quot;Ullrich2007&quot;&gt;Ullrich S, Valvoda JT, Prescher A, Kuhlen T. Comprehensive architecture for simulation of the human body based on functional anatomy. In: Proceedings Bildverarbeitung fur die Medizin 2007. Springer Verlag; 2007. p. 328–332.&lt;/ref&gt;, or the physiome project). The ''Rendering'' is tightly coupled to the results of the simulation. It can be divided into ''Visual'', ''Haptic'' or ''Acoustic'' algorithms.

'''Definition:''' A '''convex polytope''' is the convex hull of a finite number of points.  Usually, there will be at least three non-collinear points.

'''Theorem:''' A set is a convex polytope if and only if:
:# It is not the empty set
:# It is bounded
:# It is the intersection of a finite number of closed half-spaces.

A '''simplex''' in an n-dimensional vector space is the convex hull of n+1 points that do not all lie on the same hyperplane.  If n=2, a simplex is a triangle; if n=3, it is a tetrahedron.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Viviani's theorem''' is as follows:

Take any point P in an equilateral triangle.  Drop perpendiculars from P to the three sides; let their feet be D, E, F.  Then whatever the location of P, PD+PE+PF equals the altitude of the triangle.

If P is outside the triangle, this still holds provided that the perpendicular or perpendiculars lying entirely outside the triangle are treated as having negative length.

      <comment>/* GROUP PO: Special Post Office machine stamps with no counterpart among general use meter stamps */ --~~~~</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">=United States of America, Part 3=
: &lt;font size =3&gt;Part 3 covers software-generated stamps (PC stamps), those from public vending machines, and those used only in post offices and restricted to use by the military and other government agencies. Part 1 and Part 2 cover all stamps generated by stand-alone mechanical and digital meters available to the public. Click here to jump to Part 1: [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/International_Postage_Meter_Stamp_Catalog/United_States_of_America,_Part_1] and to Part 2: [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/International_Postage_Meter_Stamp_Catalog/United_States_of_America,_Part_2]


: &lt;font color=red&gt;A word of caution: Many of the type numbers used here may be changed at a later date. The specialized ''United States Postage Meter Stamp Catalog'' is undergoing revision at this time, and an effort will be made to have the type numbers in both catalogs correspond. This is likely to require changes to some type numbers in this section. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;

----
&lt;br&gt;
*&lt;font size=3&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
:'''NOTES''': 1) For specialized information about the meter stamps of the United States, see the ''United States Postage Meter Stamp Catalog'', 2nd edition, 1994, and the ''2001 Update'' by Joel Hawkins and Richard Stambaugh, privately published, Goodyear, Arizona.

: 2) The small green entries (&lt;font color=green&gt;'''''&quot;USPMSC: xxx&quot;'''''&lt;/font&gt;) located above the Type number are the corresponding ''United States Postage Meter Stamp Catalog'' type numbers. If not present, the numbers are the same in both catalogs.

: 3) Most recently issued digital stamps include a 2-dimensional barcode in the design. In the United States three types have been used so far. They are the large rectangular &quot;PDF417&quot;, square &quot;Datamatrix&quot;, and small rectangular &quot;IBI Lite&quot; barcodes. The listings use these terms in the descriptions. The Datamatrix barcode can vary in size, and the PDF417 barcode can vary in both size and proportions.

: 4) This catalog does not include self-service, public vending machine stamps that do not show a date and town name. These stamps are portable, i.e. they can be carried away and used at any future time and from any location and thus function as traditional adhesive stamps rather than meter stamps. These include “Postal Buddy” and the “Postal Mailing Center” stamps (ECA-Gard, Unisys). See the specialized catalog referenced in Note 1 for information about these issues.

&lt;font size=3&gt;
* All the stamps listed here are valid only on the date generated. PC stamps with unrestricted validity, i.e. they can be saved for future use, are more like traditional stamps than meter stamps and are not cataloged here. This eliminates Type SD1 from the original version of this catalog and excludes all photostamps.

* Group PC stamps can vary considerably in size, font styles, and color within the same stamp type depending on the users' printer settings, available fonts, etc. Size variations or colors other than black are unusual but should not be considered of great significance.

* The stamps are found on plain paper, adhesive labels of various sizes, and with or without fluorescent tagging. As with color and font, paper or label type is a user controlled variable and not of great significance.

* PC stamps are often found in a frame at the top right of large address labels. To the left of the stamp is a smaller frame containing a large letter or number representing the class of mail. Codes found are: '1' (first class), 'fcm' (first class), 'P' (priority), 'E' (express), 'M' (media), 'T' (parcel post), solid block (media, or other). Not all the codes are found with all the stamp types that use the labels.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt;* * *
&lt;font size=3&gt;'''''NOTE''': &lt;br&gt;Several stamps in Group R resemble stamps in Group PC. If you don't find what you are looking for here, check there.''&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/font&gt;

'''NOTES''':
*  The printing on these stamps has not fared well over time. Shown above is a fairly good example in natural color and at right a black and white image with the printing enhanced. Also shown is a stamp faded nearly to extinction but with a special postmark that was used to stamp mail franked by the machine.
* Most examples known are philatelic without the special postmark. Covers with the postmark are extremely rare.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Sin Wave Oscillator==
The circuit configuration of a Sin Wave Oscillation is made from connecting two components L and C in series
: &lt;math&gt;L \frac{dI}{dt} + \frac{1}{C} I dt = 0&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2I}{dt^2} + \frac{L}{C}  = 0&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;S^2 + \frac{1}{LC}  = 0&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;S = \pm j \sqrt{\frac{1}{LC}} = 0&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;I = e^(j\omega t) + e^(-j\omega t)&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;I = A Sin \omega t&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\omega = \sqrt{\frac{1}{LC}}&lt;/math&gt;

==Standing Wave Oscillator==
The circuit configuration of a Sin Wave Oscillation is made from connecting two components L and C in series operating at resonance
: &lt;math&gt;Z_L - Z_C = 0&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;V_L + Z_C = 0&lt;/math&gt;

Circuit has the capaability to generate Standing Wave oscillating at 
: &lt;math&gt;\omega = \sqrt{\frac{1}{LC}}&lt;/math&gt;
==Sin Wave with Decresing Amplitude Oscillator==
The circuit configuration of a Sin Wave Oscillation is made from connecting two components L and C in series
: &lt;math&gt;L \frac{dI}{dt} + \frac{1}{C} I dt + IR = 0&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2I}{dt^2} + \frac{R}{L} \frac{dI}{dt} + \frac{1}{LC} = 0&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;S^2 + \frac{R}{L} S + \frac{1}{LC}  = 0&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;S = -\alpha \pm \lambda = 0&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\alpha = -\frac{R}{2L}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\beta = \frac{1}{LC}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\lambda = \sqrt{\alpha^2 - \beta^2}&lt;/math&gt;

When &lt;math&gt;\alpha^2 &lt; \beta^2&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;I = e^(-\alpha t) [e^(j\omega t) + e^(-j\omega t)]&lt;/math&gt;

The circuit has the ability to generate Sin Wave with decreasing amplitude

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Number of Base Ten==
The number system in use of the ordinary real life is number in of base ten consists of digit from 0 to 9 . Any number greater than 9 can be expressed as
: &lt;math&gt;A x 10^n + B x 10^(n-1) + ... + Z x 10^1 + 10^0&lt;/math&gt;

For example
: &lt;math&gt;121 = 1x10^2 + 2x10^1 + 1x10^0 = 100 + 20 + 1&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Complex Number==
Complex Number and its Complex Conjugate is a number that has the general form
: Z = a + j b
: Z = a - j b
: [[File:Complex_conjugate_picture.svg|200px]]

==Mathematic Operations==
===Addition of 2 Complex Numbers===
: &lt;math&gt;(a+ jb) + (c+ jd) = (a+c) + j(b+d). \ &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;(a+ jb) + (a- jb) = 2a. \ &lt;/math&gt;

===Subtraction of 2 Complex Numbers===
: &lt;math&gt;(a+jb) - (c+jd) = (a-c) + j(b-d).\ &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;(a+jb) - (a-jd) = 2jb. \ &lt;/math&gt;

===Multiplication of 2 Complex Numbers===
: &lt;math&gt;(a + j b) \times (c + jd) = (ac - bd) + j (ad - bc)&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;(a+jb) \times (a-jb) = a^2 - b^2. \ &lt;/math&gt;

===Division of 2 Complex Numbers===
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{(a + j b)}{(c + jd)} = \frac{(ac - bd) + j (ad - bc)}{(c + jd)^2}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{(a + j b)}{(a - j b)} = \frac{a^2 - b^2}{(a + jb)^2 }&lt;/math&gt;

===Square root===

The square roots of ''a'' + ''bi'' (with ''b'' ≠ 0) are &lt;math&gt; \pm (\gamma + \delta i)&lt;/math&gt;, where

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma = \sqrt{\frac{a + \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}{2}}&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\delta = \frac{|b|}{b} \sqrt{\frac{-a + \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}{2}}.&lt;/math&gt;

This can be seen by squaring &lt;math&gt; \pm (\gamma + \delta i)&lt;/math&gt; to obtain ''a'' + ''bi''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; Here &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}&lt;/math&gt; is called the modulus of ''a + bi'', and the square root with non-negative real part is called the '''principal square root'''.
===Conjugation===
[[File:Complex conjugate picture.svg|right|thumb|Geometric representation of &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; and its conjugate &lt;math&gt;\bar{z}&lt;/math&gt; in the complex plane]]
The ''complex conjugate'' of the complex number {{nowrap begin}}''z'' = ''x'' + ''yi''{{nowrap end}} is defined to be ''x'' &amp;minus; ''yi''. It is denoted &lt;math&gt;\bar{z}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;z^*\,&lt;/math&gt;. Geometrically, &lt;math&gt;\bar{z}&lt;/math&gt; is the &quot;reflection&quot; of ''z'' about the real axis. In particular, conjugating twice gives the original complex number: &lt;math&gt;\bar{\bar{z}}=z&lt;/math&gt;.

The real and imaginary parts of a complex number can be extracted using the conjugate:
: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Re}\,(z) = \tfrac{1}{2}(z+\bar{z}), \,&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Im}\,(z) = \tfrac{1}{2i}(z-\bar{z}). \,&lt;/math&gt;
Moreover, a complex number is real if and only if it equals its conjugate.

Conjugation distributes over the standard arithmetic operations:
: &lt;math&gt;\overline{z+w} = \bar{z} + \bar{w}, \,&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\overline{z w} = \bar{z} \bar{w}, \,&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\overline{(z/w)} = \bar{z}/\bar{w} \,&lt;/math&gt;
The reciprocal of a nonzero complex number {{nowrap begin}}''z'' = ''x'' + ''yi''{{nowrap end}} is given by
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{z}=\frac{\bar{z}}{z \bar{z}}=\frac{\bar{z}}{x^2+y^2}.&lt;/math&gt;
This formula can be used to compute the multiplicative inverse of a complex number if it is given in rectangular coordinates. Inversive geometry, a branch of geometry studying more general reflections than ones about a line, can be expressed in terms of complex numbers, too.

==Polar form== 

[[Image:Complex_number_illustration_modarg.svg|right|thumb|Figure 2: The argument ''φ'' and modulus ''r'' locate a point on an Argand diagram; &lt;math&gt;r(\cos \phi + i \sin \phi)&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;r e^{i\phi}&lt;/math&gt; are ''polar'' expressions of the point.]]

===Absolute value and argument===
Another way of encoding points in the complex plane than using the ''x''- and ''y''-coordinates is to use the distance of a point ''P'' to ''O'', the point whose coordinates are (0, 0) (origin), and the angle of the line through ''P'' and ''O''. This idea leads to the polar form of complex numbers.

The ''absolute value'' (or ''modulus'' or ''magnitude'') of a complex number ''z'' = ''x''+''yi'' is
:&lt;math&gt;\textstyle r=|z|=\sqrt{x^2+y^2}.\,&lt;/math&gt;
If ''z'' is a real number (i.e., ''y'' = 0), then ''r'' = |''x''|. In general, by Pythagoras' theorem, ''r'' is the distance of the point ''P'' representing the complex number ''z'' to the origin.

The ''argument'' or ''phase'' of ''z'' is the angle to the real axis, and is written as &lt;math&gt;\arg(z)&lt;/math&gt;. As with the modulus, the argument can be found from the rectangular form &lt;math&gt;x+iy&lt;/math&gt;:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

The value of ''φ'' can change by any multiple of 2''π'' and still give the same angle (note that radians are being used). Hence, the arg function is sometimes considered as multivalued. Normally, as given above, the principal value in the interval &lt;math&gt;(-\pi,\pi]&lt;/math&gt; is chosen. Values in the range &lt;math&gt;[0,2\pi)&lt;/math&gt; are obtained by adding &lt;math&gt;2\pi&lt;/math&gt; if the value is negative. The polar angle of the origin is undefined but the value 0 is commonly used.

Together, ''r'' and ''φ'' give another way of representing complex numbers, the ''polar form'', as the combination of modulus and argument fully specify the position of a point on the plane. Recovering the original rectangular co-ordinates from the polar form is done by the formula called ''trigonometric form''
:&lt;math&gt; z = r(\cos \varphi + i\sin \varphi ).\,&lt;/math&gt;

Using Euler's formula this can be written as
:&lt;math&gt;z = r e^{i \varphi}.&lt;/math&gt;

Using the cis function, this is sometimes abbreviated to
:&lt;math&gt; z = r \ \operatorname{cis} \ \varphi. \,&lt;/math&gt;

In angle notation, often used in electronics to represent a phasor with amplitude ''r'' and phase ''φ'' it is written as&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Multiplication, division and exponentiation in polar form===
[[File:ComplexMultiplication.png|right|thumb|Multiplication of 2+''i'' (blue triangle) and 3+''i'' (red triangle). The red triangle is rotated to match the vertex of the blue one and stretched by √{{overline|5}}, the length of the [[hypotenuse]] of the blue triangle.]]
The relevance of representing complex numbers in polar form stems from the fact that the formulas for multiplication, division and exponentiation are simpler than the ones using Cartesian coordinates. Given two complex numbers {{nowrap begin}}''z''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(cos φ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''i''sin φ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;){{nowrap end}} and {{nowrap begin}}''z''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; =''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(cos φ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ''i''sin φ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;){{nowrap end}} the formula for multiplication is
:&lt;math&gt;z_1 z_2 = r_1 r_2 (\cos(\varphi_1 + \varphi_2) + i \sin(\varphi_1 + \varphi_2)).&lt;/math&gt;
In other words, the absolute values are multiplied and the arguments are added to yield the polar form of the product. For example, multiplying by ''i'' corresponds to a quarter-rotation counter-clockwise, which gives back ''i''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;1. The picture at the right illustrates the multiplication of
:&lt;math&gt;(2+i)(3+i)=5+5i \,&lt;/math&gt;
Since the real and imaginary part of 5+5''i'' are equal, the argument of that number is 45 degrees, or π/4 (in radian). On the other hand, it is also the sum of the angles at the origin of the red and blue triangle are arctan(1/3) and arctan(1/2), respectively. Thus, the formula
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\pi}{4} = \arctan\frac{1}{2} + \arctan\frac{1}{3} &lt;/math&gt;
holds. As the [[arctan]] function can be approximated highly efficiently, formulas like this&amp;mdash;known as Machin-like formulas&amp;mdash;are used for high-precision approximations of π.

Similarly, division is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{z_1}{ z_2} = \frac{r_1}{ r_2} \left(\cos(\varphi_1 - \varphi_2) + i \sin(\varphi_1 - \varphi_2)\right).&lt;/math&gt;
This also implies de Moivre's formula for exponentiation of complex numbers with integer exponents:
:&lt;math&gt; z^n = r^n\,(\cos n\varphi + i \sin n \varphi).&lt;/math&gt;
The ''n''-th roots of ''z'' are given by
:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt[n]{z}  = \sqrt[n]r \left( \cos \left(\frac{\varphi+2k\pi}{n}\right) + i \sin \left(\frac{\varphi+2k\pi}{n}\right)\right)&lt;/math&gt;
for any integer {{nowrap|''k'' satisfying 0 &amp;le; ''k'' &amp;le; n &amp;minus; 1}}. Here &lt;math&gt;\sqrt[n]{r}&lt;/math&gt; is the usual (positive) ''n''th root of the positive real number ''r''. While the ''n''th root of a positive real number ''r'' is chosen to be the ''positive'' real number ''c'' satisfying ''c''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; = ''x'' there is no natural way of distinguishing one particular complex ''n''th root of a complex number. Therefore, the ''n''th root of ''z'' is considered as a multivalued function (in ''z''), as opposed to a usual function ''f'', for which ''f''(''z'') is a uniquely defined number. Formulas such as
:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt[n]{z^n} = z&lt;/math&gt;
(which holds for positive real numbers), do in general not hold for complex numbers.

==de Moivre's formula==
In mathematics, '''de Moivre's formula''', named after Abraham de Moivre, states that for any complex number (and, in particular, for any real number) ''x'' and integer ''n'' it holds that

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\cos x+i\sin x\right)^n=\cos\left(nx\right)+i\sin\left(nx\right).\,&lt;/math&gt;

The formula is important because it connects complex numbers (''i'' stands for the imaginary unit) and trigonometry. The expression cos ''x'' + ''i'' sin ''x'' is sometimes abbreviated to cis ''x''.

By expanding the left hand side and then comparing the real and imaginary parts under the assumption that ''x'' is real, it is possible to derive useful expressions for cos (''nx'') and sin (''nx'') in terms of cos ''x'' and sin ''x''. Furthermore, one can use a generalization of this formula to find explicit expressions for the ''n''th roots of unity, that is, complex numbers ''z'' such that ''z&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'' = 1.

===Derivation===

Although historically proven earlier, de Moivre's formula can easily be derived from Euler's formula:

:&lt;math&gt;e^{ix} = \cos x + i\sin x\,&lt;/math&gt;

and the exponential law for integer powers

:&lt;math&gt;\left( e^{ix} \right)^n = e^{inx} .\,&lt;/math&gt;

Then, by Euler's formula, 

:&lt;math&gt;e^{i(nx)} = \cos (nx) + i\sin (nx).\,&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Swapping concept comes in terms of process scheduling. Swapping is basically implemented by Medium term scheduler.Medium term scheduler removes process from CPU for duration and reduce the degree of multiprogramming. And after some time these process can again be reintroduced into main memory. Process execution will again be resumed from the point it left CPU. This scheme is called swapping. More generally we can say swapping is removing of process from memory to secondary memory and again back to main memory. 

Example: Assume a multiprogramming environment with Round-Robin CPU scheduling algorithm. When a quantum expires, the memory manager will start to swap out the process that just finished, and swap in another piece to the memory space that has been freed. In the meantime, CPU scheduler will allocate a time slice to some other process in memory. When each process finishes its quantum it will be swapped back with another process. Ideally, memory manager can swap process fast enough so that there is always at least one process in memory, ready to execute, when the CPU scheduler wants to reschedule the CPU. The quantum must also be sufficiently large that reasonable amounts of computing are done between swaps.

Swapping can be implemented in various ways. For example, swapping can be priority based. That means if a higher priority process arrives and wants service, the memory manager can swap out the lower priority process to the secondary memory so that it higher priority process can be loaded to main memory for execution. As soon higher priority process finishes, the lower priority process will be swapped back to main memory and execution will be continued. Sometimes swapping is also called roll out, roll in. 

Address binding rules over the memory space to be allocated to process. Because process that has been swapped out need to be swapped in on same memory location from where it let off. And address binding implements it.

Swapping requires a backing store. And this backing store is as fast as disk. This backing store should be large enough to maintain copies of all memory images for all users.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Addition==
Addition is a mathematical operation of adding two quantities which can be represented by a mathematical expression
: A + B

==Rules of arithmetic and algebra==
The following laws are true for all values of a, b, and c, whether a, b, and c are numbers, variables, functions, or more complex expressions involving numbers, variable and/or functions.

===  Addition===
* Commutative Law: &lt;math&gt;a+b=b+a \,&lt;/math&gt;.
* Associative Law:  &lt;math&gt;(a+b)+c=a+(b+c)\,&lt;/math&gt;.
* Additive Identity: &lt;math&gt;a+0=a\,&lt;/math&gt;.
* Additive Inverse: &lt;math&gt;a+(-a)=0\,&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Subtraction=== 
*Definition:  &lt;math&gt;a-b = a+(-b)\,&lt;/math&gt;.
=== Multiplication=== 
*Commutative law:  &lt;math&gt;a\times b=b\times a\,&lt;/math&gt;.
*Associative law:  &lt;math&gt;(a\times b)\times c=a\times (b\times c)\,&lt;/math&gt;.
*Multiplicative identity: &lt;math&gt;a\times 1=a\,&lt;/math&gt;.
*Multiplicative inverse: &lt;math&gt;a\times \frac{1}{a}=1&lt;/math&gt;, whenever &lt;math&gt;a \neq 0\,&lt;/math&gt;
*Distributive law:  &lt;math&gt;a\times (b+c)=(a\times b)+(a\times c)\,&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Division=== 
*Definition: &lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{b}=a\times \frac{1}{b}&lt;/math&gt;, whenever &lt;math&gt;b \neq 0\,&lt;/math&gt;.

Let's look at an example to see how these rules are used in practice.

{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\frac{(x+2)(x+3)}{x+3}&lt;/math&gt;
| = &lt;math&gt;\left[(x+2)\times (x+3)\right]\times \left( \frac{1}{x+3}\right)&lt;/math&gt; (from the definition of division)
|-
|
| = &lt;math&gt;(x+2)\times \left[(x+3)\times \left(\frac{1}{x+3} \right) \right]&lt;/math&gt; (from the associative law of addition)
|-
|
| = &lt;math&gt;((x+2)\times (1)),\qquad x \neq -3 \,&lt;/math&gt; (from multiplicative inverse)
|-
|
| = &lt;math&gt;x+2, \qquad x \neq -3.&lt;/math&gt; (from multiplicative identity)
|-
|}

Of course, the above is much longer than simply cancelling &lt;math&gt;x+3&lt;/math&gt; out in both the numerator and denominator. But, when you are cancelling, you are really just doing the above steps, so it is important to know what the rules are so as to know when you are allowed to cancel.  Occasionally people do the following, for instance, which is incorrect:


:&lt;math&gt;\frac{2\times (x + 2)}{2}=\frac{2}{2}\times \frac{x+2}{2}=\frac{x+2}{2}&lt;/math&gt;.


The correct simplification is


:&lt;math&gt;\frac{2\times (x + 2)}{2}=\frac{2}{2}\times \frac{x+2}{1}=1 \times \frac{x+2}{1}=x+2&lt;/math&gt;,


where the number &lt;math&gt;2&lt;/math&gt; cancels out in both the numerator and the denominator.

==Rules==
Any number add zero is equal to the number
: a + 0 = a

Any number add to itself is doubled
: a + a = 2a

Any number add to its negative is zero
: a + (-a) = 0

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Subtraction==
Subtraction is an operation where one number is deducted from another. It can be represented by
: A - B

==Operation==
: a - b = -b + a
: a - b - c = a - (b + c) = (a - b) - c

==Rules==
Any number subtract zero is equal to the number
: a - 0 = a

Any number subtract to itself equals zero
: a - a = 0

Any number subtract its negative is doubled
: a - (-a) = 2a

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Gradient==
A gradient is the rate of change of one variable compared to another variable.

If there is a change in y 
: &lt;math&gt;\delta y = y - y_1&lt;/math&gt;

and there is a change in x 
: &lt;math&gt;\delta x = x - x_1&lt;/math&gt;

Gradient , m
: &lt;math&gt;m = \frac{\delta y}{\delta x} = \frac{y - y_1}{x - x_1}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\delta y = m \delta x = m (x - x_1)&lt;/math&gt;



==Example==
two points on a straight line (2,3), (3,4) then the gradient of the straight line is
: &lt;math&gt;m = \frac{4-3}{3-2}&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Differentiation==
Differentiation is an arithmatic operation to find the value of Slope of a Curve represented by a function f(x)

For a function f(x)
:&lt;math&gt;m = \frac{\Delta f(x)}{\Delta x} = \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}.&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;f'(a)=\lim_{h\to 0}{f(a+h)-f(a)\over h}&lt;/math&gt;

Then the Derivative of the function
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx} = Lim_{\delta x \to 0} \Sigma \frac{\delta y}{\delta x}&lt;/math&gt;

If f(x) = y Then f(x) represents a Straight Line through point (0,0) with Slope equals 1

If there is a Straight Line goes through 2 points (x&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;,y&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;) , (x,y)
: &lt;math&gt;m = \frac{y - y_o}{x - x_o} &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;y =  y_o + m (x - x_o) &lt;/math&gt;


===Straight Line goes through Two Intercept Points===
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{x}{a} + \frac{y}{b} = 1&lt;/math&gt;

When 
:: x = 0 y = b
:: y = 0 x = a

Function &lt;math&gt;f(x,y) = \frac{x}{a} + \frac{y}{b} = 1&lt;/math&gt;
of a Straight Line that cuts the x axis at (0,a) and the y axis at (0,b)

=== Usage ===
Use this template to insert links to letters. Example: {{tlx|Turkish/Letter|i}} or {{tlx|Turkish/Letter|o}} looks {{Turkish/Letter|i}} or {{Turkish/Letter|o}}. This template is not case sensitive. {{tlx|Turkish/Letter|A}} and {{tlx|Turkish/Letter|a}} both works: {{Turkish/Letter|A}} and {{Turkish/Letter|a}}, you can use both uppercase and lowercase .

* Please note that in Turkish, uppercase form of the letter &quot;i&quot; is &quot;İ&quot; not &quot;I&quot;. This template is specially coded to do that transformation.

====About====
This wiki is put together in order to aid all of those out there who may be interested in the aviation field.  More will come, but at the moment I am more concerned with putting the very basics out there to get people interested in aviation.  Sections about aerodynamics, flight maneuvers, and other resources will follow.  The idea is to eventually create a '''free''' resource for training that may reduce the great burden that falls on the shoulders of every emerging student pilot.

==What, Why?==
The two greatest questions that may dissuade people from or entice people into flying are the questions &quot;what?&quot; and &quot;why?&quot;.

===What===
A '''Private Pilot License''' permits the holder to operate an aircraft under [[w:visual flight rules|visual flight rules]]. In most countries, a private pilot possessing an [[w:instrument rating|instrument rating]] may also conduct flights under [[w:instrument flight rules|instrument flight rules]]. Passengers may be carried and flight in furtherance of a business is permitted; however, a private pilot may not be compensated in any way for services as a pilot and must pay at least the pro rata share of a flight's expenses. Neither passengers nor cargo may be carried for hire.

For more information see:
[[w:Pilot certification in the United States#Private Pilot]]

===Why?===
People become pilots for many reasons.  You may do it to have a goal to work at.  You may do it because you need a way to commute to work faster.  You may do it because it is your life long dream.  Whatever the reason, aviation will become a way of life for you if you do.  It is an extremely expensive investment, and there's no going back - so you better be sure that's what you want to do.  Or go join the military.  That's probably the best way, if you're young enough.

== Getting Started ==
It's not just as easy as jumping into the cockpit and fire-walling the throttle, there is some work for you to do first.

== What You'll Need To Do==
According to the FARs (Federal Aviation Regulations) there are some things you'll need to do to become a pilot.

1.  First you will need to be at least 17 years old at the time of certification.

2. Have a current FAA third-class medical certificate. 

3. Log at least 40 hours of flight. At least 20 hours of flight with an instructor. At least 10 hours of solo flight.

2.  You must be able to read, speak, and write in English.  This is so that pilots can communicate between each other and with the air traffic controllers.  

3.  Pass two knowledge tests.  
a) The FAA Private Pilot Airmen Knowledge written test (on which you must score at least 70%). 
b) An oral exam administered by an FAA Designated Flight Examiner during a portion of your checkride. There is no pass/fail score given, simply a session where the examiner ensures that you have the proper knowledge to safely conduct flight as a private pilot. There is no requirement as to what questions must be asked or how long it should take, it is up to the discretion of the examiner. Some have been rumored to do straight Question/Answer oral exams, while others conduct their oral exam more like a discussion.


PLEASE NOTE: There is a new FAA approved Sport Pilot category which now permits a class of aircraft to be operated by individuals with a Sport Pilot license. This license has less stringent requirements, e.g. a valid U.S. driver's license can be used as evidence of medical eligibility (provided the individual does not have an official denial or revocation of medical eligibility on file with FAA). For more info, see www.sportpilot.org

==  What to Start With ==
Before you even try to spend your money on flying, try to get an introductory lesson at a lower price, or a ride in an airplane from a neighbor.  You want to know from the beginning if this is something you want to do.  After that, get all the information in written form you can.  The ASA FAR/AIM book is an excellent resource for all the regs, though ''Jeppesen's Private Pilot Manual'' is a more readable form.  Buy both of these books, and read as much of them as you can.  Go in to the whole situation with as much knowledge as you can, and use that knowledge to supplement the practical training you will receive as a student.

== Choosing a Flight School ==
In aviation, there are two types of schools: the larger more corporate flight schools, known as a &quot;Part 141&quot; school (a reference to the section of Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) which dictates operation of said school), like Sporty's, Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, etc., and the smaller &quot;Part 61&quot; flight schools, that typically are nothing much more than an instructor that calls his flight school his home business. The FAR Part that the flight school operates under has nothing to do with the quality of instructor you will find there. Either school will get you to where you wish to be. However, Part 141 schools are normally designed for &quot;streamlined&quot; training, that is, creating a lot of pilots in not a lot of time. These types of schools are typically more beneficial for those seeking to become professional pilots, due to slightly lower minimum requirements in terms of hours, and are usually structured as an &quot;aviation immersion&quot;, where you walk, talk, eat and sleep aviation. A Part 141 school is overseen by the FAA very closely, ensuring that the pilots, instructors, aircraft, and owner/operators all meet the standards as outlined in 14CFR 141. Part 141 schools are generally much larger than a Part 61 operation, and are required to have an FAA approved curriculum.    Part 61 operations can be owned by one or two instructors, and are typically small. Keep in mind, though there are schools that operate under part 61, it does NOT have to be an official &quot;school&quot; to teach you how to fly. Your neighbor the flight instructor could instruct you under part 61 regardless of a school affiliation. However, there are regulations that pertain to the aircraft used for flight instruction, which your instructor needs to be aware of if he is using a privately owned aircraft. Both are good, but again, you must keep your goals in mind.  A Part 61 school will be fine for renting and learning to fly a [[w:The New Piper Aircraft|Supercub]], but it may not be the best choice on the road to becoming an [[w:Airline Transport Pilot License|ATP]]. However, whether you conduct your training under Part 61 or 141, you can reach the same level, and attain the same certificate without limitations. Talk to graduates from your local schools, and see who they'd recommend.  Remember, pilots want safe pilots flying with them, and if they don't think a certain instructor trains competent pilots, heed their warnings, you want to be the very safest pilot in the air.

== Flight School For Dummies==

=== Follow Through ===
Remember during your training this one thing: &quot;I CAN DO IT.&quot;  Regardless of how tough it may seem along the way, you will always regret it if you decide half-way through that you did not have what it takes.  Your own drive is probably the greatest of your allies.
===Cost===
Flight school can cost a lot.  The average flight training for a Private Pilot Certificate costs about $10,000 dollars. (2008)  Most flight schools charge by the hour. Typical rates for a training airplane is $125-$150 per hour. Typical rates for an instructor is $35-$60 per hour.  The current average student in the US will need between 50 and 70 hours to get the private pilot certificate.  Again, the quality of the training, and your own commitment are going to play a role in this.  If you cannot afford to fly every day for a month, your price is going to increase due to the extra time it will take you to get back in the habit every week when you do fly.  The best and cheapest way to get your certificate is to do it all at once.  That way, you can feel your progress, and have a more intuitive grasp on how the plane flies.  This is crucial to the training of a successful pilot. There are organizations that offer scholarships to people wishing to become pilots. As well, there are companies that specialize in loans for those interested in learning to fly, so that you can have the money available to complete your training in a timely manner. Someone at your flight school can help you with these different options.

===The Framework Of Regulations===
You are going to move in an environment where safety is the main factor: the world of aeronautics. For this reason the rules and regulations are created so that they can be adapted to the world of aeronautics today to guarantee the safety of those who, at present, take part.
The great majority of countries that take part in aeronautical activities move in a framework of regulations always for the reasons of security. We are interested in the regulations that affect the Private Pilot and the 'insight flying. (VFR Visual Flight Rules.)
The organizations that are active at different levels, [World, European, National and Regional] produce the text and carry out the regulations and controls that apply to them. All that are active in aeronautics, and in particular the users, depend on such organizations. We are going to take and look at these frameworks of regulations that you will move in to get the title of Private Pilot and In sight flight VFR.
We are interested, right away, in the aspect of the regulations that affect us closely. You are going to need to know the rules of navigation. We are talking about the license and the privileges it offers, the rules of pilot training. In particular certain qualifications and the medical condition of the trainee pilot. We will look at what is an 'aircraft'. The term is generic and designates all apparatus that can take off and move in the air: airplanes, microlights, helicopters, hang gliders, balloons, and so on.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Aeroforces.svg|520px|thumb|none|The four forces of flight.]]

==Aerodynamics==
[[w:Aerodynamics|Aerodynamics]] is a branch of dynamics concerned with studying the motion of air, particularly when it interacts with a moving object.  To be a competent pilot, you will need to know and understand aerodynamics intuitively, and also scientifically.  See [[w:lift (force)|lift]].

==Why an airplane flies==
===Lift===

Lift is the upward force exerted by the wings pushing down the air around them. 
This counteracts weight.

===Drag===

Drag is the backward force of the friction produced from the airplane moving through the air.

This slows the plane down.

===Thrust===

 Thrust is the pull that the propeller produces, pulling the airplane through the air.

This counteracts drag.

===Weight===

Weight is the downward force on the aircraft produced by the Earth's gravitational pull.

===Maneuvering===


==Axes of Flight==
An airplane moves in three dimensions, or along three axes. When driving a car or boat, it which moves in two dimensions. Adding a third dimension makes the control much more complex. A banking, climbing turn requires skill and concentration.

===Pitch===

 Pitch is the change of attitude of flight about the lateral axis of the aircraft. It simple words it is nose down or nose up of the aircraft. 
The airplane climbs or descends by changing the pitch. Pulling back the yoke or stick results in a change in the [[#elevator|elevator]] causing a downward force on it and resulting in an equal upward change in attitude of the nose about the vertical plane.

===Roll===

Roll is the longitudinal axis causing one wing tip to go up while the other goes down. 
The airplane turns about this axis from the center of the nose through the center of the tail. During a roll the airplane turn like a kabob on a rotisserie. Turning the yoke or moving the stick left or right causes one [[#aelerons|aeleron]] to rotate up while the other simultaneously rotates down.

===Yaw===

Yaw is the horizontal axis on which the airplane turns left and right. 
A left or right turn is a rotation of the airplane about an imaginary line through the center of the airplane from top to bottom. The rudder pedals are moved with the feet left and right to move the [[#rudder|rudder]] which turns the airplane about the horizontal plane.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In this segment we will cover the systems for a 1967 Cessna 150.  We chose this aircraft because it is a fairly common training aircraft, and it has fairly simple systems.  More complex aircraft require more study when it comes to systems.

==Pitot-Static==
==Powerplant==
==Electrical==
==Flight Control Surfaces==

===Elevator===
The controllable surface, usually on the back of the horizontal stabilizer, which causes the airplane to pitch up or down when changes are made to the yoke or stick by pulling back or pushing in.

===Ailerons===
The small controllable surfaces, typically on the outside of the back of each wing which causes the airplane to roll when changes are made via turning the yoke or moving the stick stick left or right. Ailerons move in opposite directions, one moving up while the other moves down, in order to create a change in the longitudinal axis.

===Rudder===
The controllable surface, usually on the back of the vertical stabilizer, which steers the airplane left and right when changes are made via the rudder pedals.

===Flaps===
About the size and shape and inboard of the ailerons are the flaps. These change the shape of the wing and increase the wing's lift but at the same time adding to the drag. They are used when landing to slow the plane down without causing change the pitch. The flaps move in the same direction unlike the ailerons.  They are in the neutral position when they are retracted or in the up position.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The basic thing to remember in the cockpit is this: &quot;THINK!&quot;  Being impulsive is only useful in a close-range dogfight, and since it is not 1916, being impulsive is useless. It can, in fact, get you killed mighty fast - know what and how to do what ever needs to be done.  If you don't, ask someone.  They will be certain to help.

==Checklists==
Aviation is very procedural.  Every action you will undertake in the aircraft will have a checklist tied to it somewhere.  Many of the checklists are simple, and can be memorized, but this is not always a good practice.  Memories can be faulty, and in aviation a faulty memory can be a death sentence.  Use your checklists.

===Preflight===
Here is an example of a checklist for a 1967 [[W:Cessna 150]Cessna 150] (which is the aircraft we will use as an example most often in this tutorial.  This checklist should not be used as a replacement for your instructor's checklist.  It should only be used as an example

'''PREFLIGHT CHECKLIST'''

'''(1)Remove Control Locks and Tiedown Ropes'''

''This is the first portion.  Here we approach the aircraft, and begin our systematic search for problems that will make the aircraft unsafe.  We unrope the aircraft, and remove the control locks so that the aircraft is free and able to move.''

'''(2)Master - - On'''

''By turning on the master switch, we have given the aircraft instruments, gyroscopes, and other electrically driven systems life.''

'''(3)Flaps - - Down'''

''We lower the flaps so that we may later inspect their integrity.''

'''(4)Fuel Gauge - - Check''' 

''The fuel gauges only work when the master is on''

'''(5)Master - - Off'''

''By turning the master off, we insure battery life.  Without it, the engine will not be able to start.''

'''(6)Ignition (MAGS) - - Off'''

''This is to make sure that the magnetos, which control the engine sparkplugs are off. If the magnetos are on and the prop is turned by accident, the engine might start up and the propeller could injure, or kill you.''

'''(7)Throttle - - Closed (Pulled Out)'''

''This is to make sure that if even if the magnetos were not grounded, and the engine were to start, it will not be able to run because there would be little or no fuel running into the engine.''

'''(8)Mixture - - Lean (Pulled Out)'''

''Similar to above, this ensures that even if the throttle has some fuel running through it, the fuel-air mixture in the cylinders will be excessively lean, and the engine will be unable to continue running.''

'''(9)Sample Fuel (Check for Water &amp; Sediment) - - Left Wing'''

''By draining fuel into a small clear container, we ensure that there is no water or debris in the fuel.  Unclean fuel could lead to engine damage, or, in a bad case, to engine failure.'' Water in the engine would cause the engine to stop because water will not combust.

'''(10)Inspect Left Side of Fuselage for Damage'''

''Here we are looking for wrinkles, or anything that might impede the integrity of the airflow.  If the aircraft is not streamlined, it will not fly very well.''

'''(11)Inspect Leading Edge of Horizontal &amp; Vertical Stabilizer for Damage'''

''Again, check for wrinkles, and any sort of damage.  If our vertical stabilizer was broken, maintaining a level attitude would be hard.''

'''(12)Inspect Skin on Tail Surfaces for Damage'''

''Smooth airflow is the key.  Rough airflow will get you killed.''

'''(13)Check Stabilizers, Elevator, and Rudder for excessive travel'''

''If they seem to go to far up or down, there is probably a problem.  The push rods that control their movement may be damaged.''

'''(14)Check that Hinge Bolts are fastened &amp; Cotter Pins are in Place on Tail''' '''Surfaces'''

''This is to make sure that the aircraft's tail is actually fastened in place, and not just hanging there.''

'''(15)Inspect Right Side of Fuselage for Damage'''

''Yet again we are looking for wrinkles, or anything that might impede the integrity of the airflow. Again, if the aircraft is not streamlined, it will not fly very well.

'''(16)Drain Fuel (Check for Water &amp; Sediment) - - Right Wing'''

''Same purpose as the above check.''

'''(17)Check Flaps for excessive travel, bolts are fastened, and Control Rod is 
'''attached and is not bent'''

''If the flaps are not properly attached, asymmetrical flap position, and or the flaps going up through the wing could result.  Those are not too favorable outcomes.''

'''(18)Check Ailerons for excessive travel, hinges are attached and not Cracked, 
'''Cotter Pins are attached to hinge ends'''

''The ailerons control roll, if they are broken, it will be more difficult to control the aircraft.  Make sure they will function.''

'''(19)Remove all Ice Formation from Aileron'''

''This is incredibly important.  Ice changes the surface of the aileron, and may make it less effective.  It may also limit the movement of the aileron.''

'''(20)Check that Lead Weights are attached to Aileron'''

''These weight the aileron in order to ensure a return to their original, &quot;neutral&quot; position.''

'''(21)Shake Right Wing Up and Down - - Check for tightness and unusual''' '''Sounds'''

'''(22)Check Wing Struts - - Check for tightness and unusual sounds''' 

'''(23)Inspect Right Wing for Damage - - Check for Wrinkles'''

'''(24)Inspect Main Landing Gear for Damage'''

'''(25)Inspect Main Landing Gear Tire for proper inflation, cuts, condition ''' '''of tread, or foreign objects (screws or nails in tire)'''

'''(26)Inspect Brake Pads for wear'''

'''(27)Inspect Brake Line for leaks '''

'''(28)Check that Wheel is fastened to Landing Gear (Cotter Pin is in Place)'''

'''(29)Check Oil Level (4 ½ Quarts Minimum to 6 Quarts Maximum)'''

'''(30)Check Oil Breather for blockage'''

'''(31)Drain Fuel from Fuel Strainer'''

'''(32)Check Inside the Cowling (Nose of Aircraft) for loose Wiring, '''
'''Oil Leaks, Fuel Leaks, All Engine Accessories are installed and installed''' '''correctly'''

'''(33)Check that Cowling is fastened correctly - - All Screws are attached '''

'''(34)Check Propeller &amp; Spinner - - Check for Damage and Security'''

'''(35)Check Engine Baffle - - Check for Damage and Security'''

'''(36)Check Engine Baffle Seals - - Check for Damage and Security'''

'''(37)Check Engine Exhaust Pipes - - Check for Damage and Security'''

'''(38)Check Carburetor Air Filter - - Clean'''

'''(39)Inspect Nose Gear for Damage and Proper Inflation (2 inch spread on Nose Strut)'''

'''(40)Inspect Nose Gear Shimmy Dampener for Damage'''

'''(41)Check that all Bolts and Nuts are attached to nose fork assembly'''

'''(42)Inspect Nose Gear Tire for proper inflation, cuts, condition of Tread,''' '''or''' 
'''foreign objects (screws or nails in tire)'''

'''(43)Check that Wheel is fastened to Nose Gear - - Bolt and Nut Attached'''

'''(44)Check Condition of Steering Rod Boots'''

'''(45)Check Static Port for Damage and Obstructions'''

'''(46)Check Radio Cooling Vent for Damage and Obstructions'''

'''(47)Check Pitot Tube for Damage and Obstructions'''

'''(48)Check Fuel Overflow Tube for Damage and Obstructions'''

'''(49)Check Stall Warning Port for Damage and Obstructions'''

'''(50)Check Wing Struts - - Check for tightness and unusual sounds'''

'''(51)Inspect Left Wing for Damage – Check for Wrinkles'''

'''(52)Shake Left Wing Up and Down - - Check for tightness and unusual sounds'''

'''(53)Check Ailerons for excessive travel, hinges are attached and not''' '''cracked,''' 
'''Cotter Pins are attached to hinge ends, Control Rod attached'''

'''(54)Remove All Ice Formation from Aileron'''

'''(55)Check that Lead Weights are attached to Aileron'''

'''(56)Check Flaps for excessive travel, bolts are fastened, and Control Rod''' '''is''' 
'''attached and is not bent'''

'''(57)Inspect Main Landing Gear for Damage '''

'''(58)Inspect Main Landing Gear Tire for Proper inflation, cuts, condition''' '''of''' 
'''tread, or foreign objects (screws or nails in tire)'''

'''(59)Inspect Brake Pads for wear'''

'''(60)Inspect Brake Line for leaks'''

'''(61)Check that Wheel is fastened to Landing Gear (Cotter Pin is in place)'''

'''(62)Check Left Fuel Tank'''

'''(63)Check Right Fuel Tank'''

'''(64)Check Top of Wings for Damage'''

'''(65)Remove all Ice Formation From the Top and Bottom of All Surfaces '''

'''(66)Check Navigation Lights, Landing Lights, Strobe Lights, Pulse Light''' '''System, and the Beacon for Damage and Proper Illumination'''

'''(67)Check Antennas for Damage'''

'''(68)Remove all Debris under Propeller (rocks etc.)'''

'''(69)Fold up Step Ladder and put it in the bed of the truck'''

As complicated as this may seem, it is barely anything.  The checklists that needed to be completed to launch the Apollo Spacecraft would take days to complete.  This only takes 45 minutes or so.

===Post-flight===
Here is an example of a post-flight checklist for the same aircraft as above.

'''After Landing''':

(1)Wing Flaps - - Up

(2)Carburetor Heat - - Cold

(3)Transponder - - Off

'''Securing Airplane''':

(1)Brake - - Set

(2)CLOSE FLIGHT PLAN

      <text xml:space="preserve">The basic point behind take off is simple.  Get the airplane in the air without crashing into anything!  There are a couple of standard ways to do this:

==Standard==
The standard way to take off is fairly simple.  Advance the throttle to full, and start off down the runway.  Once your speed has sufficiently built (this should be your Vy speed) you pull back slightly on the stick, and raise the nose gear off of the runway.  The airplane should, at this point, fly itself off the runway and into the air.  Keep the airspeed at that Vy speed until you have finished climbing.

==To Clear a Fifty Foot Obstacle==
Climb out at Vx, to clear a 50 foot obstacle at the end of the runway.

==Soft Field==
With a soft field take off, the aircraft needs to get off the ground as soon as possible. Adjust flaps to 10degree, full aft on the yoke, and advance throttle full. You will prematurely lift off due to ground effect. Stay within ground effect (about the length of your wing span), and build your speed to Vx. Climb out at Vx.

      <comment>/* Go-Arounds */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Standard==
A standard landing is just that, standard. If the runway is well light, dry, smooth, and no obstructions at either end of the runway. Your landing would be standard.

==Short Field==
With a short field landing, you have almost no room for error. Make sure you establish an approach with a low speed. For a Cessna 152, a steady 60kias will do. Sometimes it is necessary to slip your aircraft (Forward Slip), to lose altitude fast without increasing airspeed. As you cross over the threshold, reduce power to idle, after your flare, apply full brakes and back pressure.

==Soft Field==
Would be the same as a Standard landing or a Short field landing expect once you flare. To prevent your wheels to dig in to a soft runway, like grass, sometimes you must extend your flare. When you flare, you might need to add  a notch of power, to prevent your nose gear from digging in. Once all wheels are on the ground , retract flaps to 0.

==Go-Arounds==
A Go-Around happens when a pilot aborts a landing. This might be due from a obstruction on the runway, or the pilot's approach being too high or too low. A Go-Around is also called a Balked Landing. To perform a go-around in a typical flight training aircraft, like a Cessna 152 or Cessna 172: FIRST advance throttle to full open, to prevent the aircraft of touching the ground, maintaining the ground separation, slowly retract flaps, continuing with a steady rate of climb and speed. Advice the tower or CTAF.

      <comment>Added the section Background and Theory (which needs more information) and created the section heading for How to perform the Maneuver.  Added location to find manuevering speed.  Added wiki link to directional gyro</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Steep turns are fun, and the aircraft will feel 'in the groove'.  They are a great maneuver for learning coordination and getting familiar with the characteristics of any new aircraft.  This section discusses steep turns as applied to a light aircraft such as a Cessna 150 or 172.
&lt;br /&gt;
== Background and Theory ==
There are a few important concepts to be understood when learning to perform steep turns.  Among them is the concept of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load_factor_%28aeronautics%29 Load Factor].  More specifically, a pilot needs to realize that the load factor increases with the bank angle during a turn.  The load factor reaches significant levels during a steep turn and will play a role in increased stalling speeds.  

== How to perform a Steep Turn ==
'''Before you do a steep turn or any flight maneuver make sure that the area is clear of other aircraft or collision hazards.'''
&lt;br /&gt;

To perform a steep turn safely, begin at [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maneuvering_speed manuevering speed] and at a safe altitude (at least 1500 feet AGL).  Manuevering speed may be found in the pilot operating handbook (POH) and should be discussed with your instructor.  Speeds higher than manuevering speed may overstress the airframe of the aircraft and should be avoided.  Attaining maneuvering speed may require slowing the aircraft down from its normal cruising speed which could mean initially reducing the power setting.  It is helpful to pick out a visual reference point in front of you so you may determine when you have completed a 360 degree turn and time the rollout appropriately.  Alternatively or additionally you might use a reference heading on your [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directional_gyro directional gyro] if the plane is equipped.  
&lt;br /&gt;

To begin the turn, bank the aircraft smoothly over to 45 degrees. Smoothly coordinate the turn entry with appropriate rudder pressure and maintain a small amount of back pressure to keep the nose from dipping below the horizon.  As you pass 30 degrees of bank you will need to add a small amount of power (200 rpm for example) and more back pressure on the yoke. It is important to keep the aircraft from diving or climbing. Use sufficient back pressure to maintain the pitch.  At first this can seem like a lot, but you will soon appreciate this and anticipate it. The reason that you add power is because the aircraft speed will drop when back pressure is applied.  Insufficient airspeed can contribute to adverse behavior of the aircraft.  
&lt;br /&gt;

During the turn you should feel firmly planted in your seat.  Both butt cheeks should feel even seat pressure in a coordinated steep turn!  You may notice that when passing a certain bank angle the airplane will feel like it wants to continue to roll over.  This is called overbanking tendency.  To keep the airplane from rolling over, maintain control with the ailerons.  You will in fact be relaxing the pressure on both the ailerons and rudder during the heart of the turn.  Ask your instructor to explain and demonstrate for more information.
&lt;br /&gt;

Begin your rollout prior to seeing your visual reference point.  A rule of thumb for timing the rollout is to lead the rollout at half of the bank angle.  For a 30 degree turn you would start your rollout 15 degrees prior to reaching the desired heading.  When rolling out be aware that the aircraft will want to pitch up. Be ready for it; exit the maneuver nice and smoothly by keeping the nose to the horizon and reducing the power (added earlier) simultaneously.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:LiftCurve.svg|frame|none|A common curve of lift for general aviation aircraft.]]

==Maneuvering==
==Power Off Stalls==

Practicing power off stalls teaches the student to recognize and avoid stall situations that might be encountered during engine failure.  If a stall should occur, the student learns how to recover quickly.

Stalls occur when the airflow over the wing is at an excessive Angle of Attack (AOA).  An excessive angle-of -attack disrupts the smooth flow of air over the wings.  As the angle of attack, relative to the direction of movement, increases, air begins to separate from the rear of the wing and begins to swirl causing increases drag.  As the AOA increases, the flow disruption creeps towards the front of the wing until the drag caused by the airflow disruption exceeds the lift.  At this point, the aircraft begins to drop until the flow of air is corrected by reducing the angle of attack.  Since the aircraft is now headed towards the ground, the angle of attack is reduced by pushing the stick forward and pointing the nose of the aircraft towards the ground.  Since this is a power off stall, recover will take longer than a power on stall because all of your increased airspeed is generated by the effect of gravity.

Typically, stall practice is performed at high altitudes so the student will feel comfortable and have plenty of time to recover.  A power off stall is most likely to occur during landing approach, so it is a vital skill to master.  It is also very easy for most students to learn.

==Power On Stalls==

Practicing power-on stalls teaches the student to recognize and avoid stall situations, an how to properly recover should the stall occur during take off phase of the flight while full power is applied.


Since this is a power on stall, recovery is quick and easy because you have the assistance of the engine.  You simply push forward on the stick to reduce the angle of attack, and increase the power to maximum.

A power-on stall is most likely to be encountered during take-off.  Due to the low altitude, it is vital that you recover quickly.

Typically, stall practice is performed at high altitudes so the student will feel comfortable and have plenty of time to recover.  A power on stall is most likely to occur during takeoff, so it is a vital skill to master.  It is also very easy for most students to learn.

==Spins==
[[Image:ASIWarp.gif]]

Practicing spins teaches the student to recognize and avoid spin situations that might be encountered during takeoff or normal flight.  In a spin, the nose of the aircraft is pointed towards the ground and rotating.  The longer the aircraft is in a spin, the faster it rotates and the airspeed continues to increase.  If a spin should occur, the student learns how to recover quickly.

----

Typically, spin practice is performed at high altitudes [1000m or 3500' is the minimum] so the student will feel comfortable and have plenty of time to recover.  A spin is most likely to occur during the early part of the takeoff, so recognizing a spin situation and avoiding it is a vital skill to master.  Preventing a spin is as easy as reducing pressure on the pedal and pushing forward on the stick.  

To recover from an actual spin, the pilot reduces the throttle to idle (to reduce acceleration), Ailerons are placed in the straight and level position (you want them neutral to avoid aggravating the spin...), and presses the opposite rudder all the way to the floor (to counter the rotation).  Once the spin is broken (this happens quickly), the pilot pushes forward on the yoke/stick to unstall the aircraft. A spin is caused by a stall, so you want to get back into the flight regime as soon as you stop rotating. The common instinct and a recipe for death is to &quot;pull back on the stick&quot;, which will put you right back into a stall, and then into another spin and increases power until the aircraft resumes level flight.

In modern planes, Spins are not difficult to recover from, but many students find them to be quite a scary experience at first.  As you build confidence though, the nervousness will fade.

==Getting More Complex==

====Ground Reference Maneuvers====

Ground Reference Maneuvers are just that.  Maneuvers where the pilot is mainly looking at a reference point or intersection on the ground to keep the position and path of the airplane lined up with the point or intersection on the ground.  The goals of these maneuvers is to learn to keep the airplane at the same airspeed and altitude during the entire maneuver. These maneuvers are best practiced in remote areas and at 1000 feet above ground level (AGL) which is the same as the pattern altitude at most airports.  Variations of these maneuvers are sometimes called for while flying in the pattern around an airport in preparation for landing.  This is the main reason for practicing these maneuvers away from an airport.

=====S-Turns=====



=====Turns Arround A Point=====

====Navigation====
Navigating in an airplane, is a tough thing. There are many different ways of navigating. More known than others. One of the easiest ways of navigating in the air - is visual navigation. An example to this, is trying to follow a highway, seen from above - found on a map, for instance.

There are also more difficult ways to navigate (note that visual navigation was the only easy one that's mentioned). As an example, we have VOR and NDB. Both of these (as most navigation aids) sends out radio beams, what the instruments in the airplane gathers together, and shows it in an easy way for the pilots to understand, via the instruments. The NDB works the easiest, though. It's simply shown as an arrow, pointing towards the radio-beacon on a compass.
VOR works a little bit more complicated, though it is just as easy when you get into it. It works somehow like lining up to a certain bearing. No matter what angle you come from, you have to decide what bearing you want after flying trough the beacon. The instruments will help you line up on that course. Very poorly explained, but that's how it works.

Then again, if we move into the commercial world (not what you are supposed to learn, really - but just mentioned for you to try to understand all the different varieties of navigation), we have the most common thing, on high-tech airliners, something called FMS (Flight Management System) or the more known word FMC (Flight Management Computer) which is the same thing. It simply works as a &quot;computer&quot; you type in waypoints and navigational aids into, as well as altitudes and speeds (on the more complicated models only), and it will guide the airplane to it. Also, if we look back 10 years, before the FMC was in use (or in full use), there was something called INS or Inertial Navigation System. It works almost like the FMC, but instead of typing in the names of the identifiers and all the other additions; one could ONLY add coordinates on the INS. It was a very complex navigation aid of its time, but today it's out to date, and in many countries around the world, it's now forbidden to fly with a INS - as they easily drifted off course.

| align=&quot;top&quot; | The ovary [&lt;b&gt;O&lt;/b&gt;] is a paired organ, located bilaterally between the abdominal wall and the swim bladder [&lt;b&gt;SB&lt;/b&gt;]. At the level of this section, the ovary is further bounded by the liver [&lt;b&gt;L&lt;/b&gt;] and intestines [&lt;b&gt;I&lt;/b&gt;]. Part of the pancreas [&lt;b&gt;P&lt;/b&gt;] is located in the anterior peritoneal cavity, between gut, liver and swim bladder.
(Note that this is a juvenile specimen with a previtellogenic ovary.)

| border=&quot;1&quot; | Two specimen of normal adult zebrafish ovaries, in different stages of the spawning cycle. The upper specimen shows a high ratio of previtellogenic oocytes [&lt;b&gt;P&lt;/b&gt;], suggestive for an early postspawning stage, whereas the lower specimen contains predominantly vitellogenic oocytes [&lt;b&gt;V&lt;/b&gt;], indicating an intermediate stage. The postspawning condition of the upper specimen is further indicated by the high ratio of postovulatory follicles [&lt;b&gt;pof&lt;/b&gt;].&lt;br&gt;
Note, that the upper image shows a lobulated structure, with interlobular spaces [&lt;b&gt;I&lt;/b&gt;] that communicate with the lateral oviduct [&lt;b&gt;L&lt;/b&gt;]. Thus, the interlobular spaces give way to ovulated oocytes.

In a further (prespawning) stage shown here, mature oocytes have ovulated and are collected in the caudal oviduct [&lt;b&gt;C&lt;/b&gt; enclosed by dotted line]. This image is suggestive of a prespawning stage.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
The main function of the balance system, or vestibular system, is to sense head movements, especially involuntary ones, and counter them with reflexive eye movements and postural adjustments that keep the visual world stable and keep us from falling.

Together with the cochlea, the vestibular system is carried by a system of tubes called the ''membranous labyrinth''. These tubes are lodged within the cavities of the bony labyrinth located in the inner ear. A fluid called ''perilymph'' fills the space between the bone and the membranous labyrinth, while another one called ''endolymph'' fills the inside of the tubes spanned by the membranous labyrinth. These fluids have a unique ionic composition suited to their function in regulating the electrochemical potential of hair cells, which are as we will later see the transducers of the vestibular system. The electric potential of endolymph is of about 80 mV more positive than perilymph.

Since our movements consist of a combination of linear translations and rotations, the vestibular system is composed of two main parts: The otolith organs, which sense linear accelerations and thereby also give us information about the head’s position relative to gravity, and the semicircular canals, which sense angular accelerations.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Information technology experience (composite reliability = 0.85; average variance extracted = 0.56) ==
=== Description ===

The authors report a two-stage approach for the development and validation of new multi-item measurement scales reflecting a multidimensional construct called new service development competence. It is operationalized as a multidimensional construct reflected by five complementary dimensions: [[Handbook of Management Scales/New service development process focus|new service development process focus]], [[Handbook of Management Scales/Market acuity|market acuity]], [[Handbook of Management Scales/New service development strategy|new service development strategy]], [[Handbook of Management Scales/New service development culture|new service development culture]], and information technology experience.

=== Definition ===

New service development competence reflects an organization’s expertise in deploying resources and routines, usually in combination, to achieve a desired new service outcome. Information technology experience refers to the use of information technology for facilitating or improving interorganizational coordination of activities and information processing in the new service development process.

=== Items ===

*Information technologies are used to speed up the introduction of new services and products. (0.471)
*IT is used to identify and diagnose customer needs. (0.635)
*IT is used to share information that coordinates new service/product development activities. (0.858)
*Communication flow within the new service development project groups is facilitated through IT-based channels. (0.911)
*Our service firm utilizes technology to facilitate the flow of information to people participating in the new service development process. (0.819)

=== Comments ===

Much efforts have been made by the authors in order to ensure that the new scales exhibit sufficient psychometric properties, which make them quite useful.

It is operationalized as a multidimensional construct reflected by five complementary dimensions: [[Handbook of Management Scales/New service development process focus|new service development process focus]], [[Handbook of Management Scales/Market acuity|market acuity]], [[Handbook of Management Scales/New service development strategy|new service development strategy]], new service development culture, and [[Handbook of Management Scales/Information technology experience|information technology experience]].

=== Definition ===

New service development competence reflects an organization’s expertise in deploying resources and routines, usually in combination, to achieve a desired new service outcome. New service development culture captures the values and beliefs fostered by the service organization that indicate a willingness and desire to innovate.

=== Items ===

*Our firm encourages entrepreneurial efforts and is accepting of risk-taking efforts. (0.548)
*The glue that holds our organization together is a commitment to innovation and new service/product development. (0.766)
*Our firm emphasizes its human resources and places a premium on high cohesion and morale in its new service development activities. (0.486)
*Non-monetary rewards are employed in new service/product development projects as a means of recognizing employee efforts. (0.581)

=== Comments ===

Much efforts have been made by the authors in order to ensure that the new scales exhibit sufficient psychometric properties, which make them quite useful. However, the values of both composite reliability and specificially average variace extracted are too low. Thus, this scale may not be used without modifications and/or new items.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== New service development process focus (composite reliability = 0.79; average variance extracted = 0.50) ==
=== Description ===

The authors report a two-stage approach for the development and validation of new multi-item measurement scales reflecting a multidimensional construct called new service development competence. It is operationalized as a multidimensional construct reflected by five complementary dimensions: new service development process focus, [[Handbook of Management Scales/Market acuity|market acuity]], [[Handbook of Management Scales/New service development strategy|new service development strategy]], [[Handbook of Management Scales/New service development culture|new service development culture]], and [[Handbook of Management Scales/Information technology experience|information technology experience]].

=== Definition ===

New service development competence reflects an organization’s expertise in deploying resources and routines, usually in combination, to achieve a desired new service outcome. New service development process focus represents the availability and use of systematic service development practices and routines.

=== Items ===

*Our new service/product development efforts are comprised of formal stages of development activities. (0.745)
*Our service firm employs standard resources and routines in all new service development projects. (0.493)
*Our service firm employs formalized processes for all new service development projects. (0.904)
*All new service development projects are planned based on a fixed sequence of development activities. (0.476)

=== Comments ===

Much efforts have been made by the authors in order to ensure that the new scales exhibit sufficient psychometric properties, which make them quite useful. The wording may be changed, because all mean values are lower than the 3 (e.g. &quot;for ''many'' new &amp;hellip; projects&quot; rather than &quot;for ''all'' new &amp;hellip; projects&quot;). That might ensure that the data is normal distributed.

=== Definition ===

New service development competence reflects an organization’s expertise in deploying resources and routines, usually in combination, to achieve a desired new service outcome. New service development strategy defines the role of development within the overall business strategy. It integrates the overall business strategy with the new services/products strategy and service design/delivery decisions.

=== Items ===

*Current service capabilities are critical factors in determining the &quot;go/no go&quot; decision for the development of new services/products. (0.577)
*Ideas for new service/product development are largely driven by the service’s overall business strategy. (.737)
*Our firm’s new service development strategy and new offerings decisions are always formulated with the overall business strategy in mind. (0.821)
*Senior managers are always willing to commit resources to promising new service/product development projects. (0.589)

=== Comments ===

Much efforts have been made by the authors in order to ensure that the new scales exhibit sufficient psychometric properties, which make them quite useful. The mean values of all items are between 3.45 and 3.76, and therefore above the expected 3. The items may therefore be reworded to achieve normal-distributed data (e.g. &quot;are ''the most'' critical factors&quot; instead of &quot;are critical factors&quot;).

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Basic Arithmetic assumptions ==

I disagree that &quot;we created&quot; the basic arithmetic operations (who is &quot;we&quot; anyway). These basic operations are natural operations that already existed before humans discovered and labelled them.

== Reference to Number Line ==

I wouldn't assume that readers who don't know what addition and subtraction is understand the concept of a number line. I would prefer to explain this in terms of real world problems. Like you buy one apple and then another two apples, how many apples do you have?

      <text xml:space="preserve">I would like to learn a wide range of subjects, when I have time.
Evolution of Computers and the tremendous advances that influence the present day to day has changed is remarkable.
I am even looking forward to the day, when I may be dictating or interacting with this machine (instead of using the keyboard).
I am a mature medical Doctor with multinational experience and trying to understand Humanity, how much we have evolved over the period,as Homosapiens we have survived inspite of our initial inability to overpower more stronger animal and other species. Explosion of Human brain, birth of an immature baby with a almost a fully functional brain but needed the ability to get up and run unlike other animals.I believe that the Humans learnt to survive against all odds due to our development of thinking, learning , running when we can and learnt to evolve into a dominant species.The present exponential increase in power of Technology, curiosity, willingness to learn and survive in the most Hostile conditions, even in Natural disasters, compassion, willingness to exchange information for mutual benefit and see fellow Humans as a Group to instinctinly suppress the self destuct button for Global existence. It is never too late to learn, overcome our individual deficiencies and improve ourselves for sake of Humanity and survive in the Material World. We have learnt a lot by space expolration, deep sea expedition, improved our communication Technology and reaching an exciting era of Universal Open learning Access and willing to change and adapt our way of life. We live longer, fitter, try to find the mental balance to overcome our mortal ageing process and at the verge of nanotechnology in the Cosmic exploration potential. I wish I could live my life all over again and why not?

Section ''' Wikijunior ''' needs care since it not only attracts growing young children but also the parents of such youngsters. I feel the kids willing to learn should be presented with material in simplified form which inspire them to absorb in their brain to shape thir future.(' Dummies ' version in various topics has similar format.) Interesting ways to present topics needs special skills, which is not to be underestimated. I recall one of my teachers in my College days stating ' It is more difficult to teach an undergraduate than a Postgraduate student. ' I see similarity in filling a young mind with good material to learn. Each youngster has different capacity and hence a simplified format with cross reference for those willing to learn more etc. So far the Wikijunior format seem OK; let us not underestimate young brains; they are born in Multimedia, if not 3D &amp; virtual reality in the near future. The ease with which a kid learns to operate a digital camera, or enjoy Computer games are amazing. Young champions invariably have good genes, nature, nurture, inspiration, guidance, destiny, aspirations, Hero-worship and ..........Even the Politicians, the Presidents are getting younger and inspire (r)evolution. Kids tend to make the independent choice for their own needs in the family and have unique personality. They bring pride to their elders. I would welcome any corrections or editing my personal views.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Function==
Function is a mathematical expression representing the relation of one quantity with another quantity. For example 
# Function of one variable f(x) 
# Function of two variables f(x,y) 
# Function of three variables f(x,y,z)

==Basic Functions==
===Straight Line Function===
''f(x) = x''
: y = x
:  x | -2 -1 0 1 2
:  y | -2 -1 0 1 2
: ''A function of a straight line that goes through point (0,0)''
:[[File:Graphofyequals2x.png|200px]]

# [[/Slope-intercept form/]]

==Two-point form==
Two points also uniquely determine a line.  Given points &lt;math&gt;(x_1,y_1)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(x_2,y_2)&lt;/math&gt;, we have the equation
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; y - y_1 = \frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}(x-x_1). &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
This presentation is in the '''two-point form'''.  It is essentially the same as the point-slope form except we substitute the expression &lt;math&gt;\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}&lt;/math&gt; for ''m''.

===Parabola Function===
''f(x) = x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''
: y = x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
:  x | -2 -1 0 1 2
:  y | 4 -1 0 1 4
: ''A function of a parabola that goes through point (0,0)''
:[[File:Qfunction.png|200px]]

===Hyperbole Function===
''f(x) = x&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;''
: y = x&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
:  x | -2 -1 0 1 2
:  y | -8 -1 0 1 8
: ''A function of a hyperbola that goes through point (0,0)''

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Axioms===
Euclidean geometry is an axiomatic system, in which all theorems (&quot;true statements&quot;) are derived from a small number of axioms.&lt;ref name=Wolfe&gt;

The assumptions of Euclid are discussed from a modern perspective in {{cite book |title=Introduction to Non-Euclidean Geometry |author=Harold E. Wolfe |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=VPHn3MutWhQC&amp;pg=PA9 |page=9 |isbn=1406718521 |year=2007 |publisher=Mill Press}}

&lt;/ref&gt; Near the beginning of the first book of the ''Elements'', Euclid gives five postulates (axioms) for plane geometry, stated in terms of constructions (as translated by Thomas Heath):&lt;ref&gt;tr. Heath, pp. 195-202.&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;Let the following be postulated&quot;:
# &quot;To draw a straight line from any point to any point.&quot;
# &quot;To produce [extend] a finite straight line continuously in a straight line.&quot;
# &quot;To describe a circle with any centre and distance [radius].&quot;
# &quot;That all right angles are equal to one another.&quot;
# ''The parallel postulate'': &quot;That, if a straight line falling on two straight lines make the interior angles on the same side less than two right angles, the two straight lines, if produced indefinitely, meet on that side on which are the angles less than the two right angles.&quot;

Although Euclid's statement of the postulates only explicitly asserts the existence of the constructions, they are also taken to be unique.

The ''Elements'' also include the following five &quot;common notions&quot;:

# Things that equal the same thing also equal one another.
# If equals are added to equals, then the wholes are equal.
# If equals are subtracted from equals, then the remainders are equal.
# Things that coincide with one another equal one another.
# The whole is greater than the part.

Mention the абетка/алфавіт, sounds that may be foreign to English speakers, and basic grammar (sentence order, declensions, etc.). Also include links to other useful sites, at least until this Wikibook is comprehensive enough to stand on its own. I'll do this soon, but feel free to contribute ideas and additions to the textbook.

Bienvenue - Willkommen - Bienvenidos - Dobrodošli - Welcome - Добро пожаловать - 歡迎I was hoping the clever use of engaging innovations would lure the best and the brightest from around the world to gather here at en.wikibooks and there would be an invigorating renaissance of creative individuals who would actually do all that work ''for'' me...and that maybe I could smoke a pipe surrounded by the Gertrude Steins and Ernest Hemingways of my generation, marvelling at how difficult it is to get an edit in without hitting an edit conflict.

From Paulo Friere's seminal contribution, a divergent set of views have emerged with respect to silence - is it a grim wet blanket foisted by guilt and shamers, or is it a sublime vehicle for negotiating the heights of mystic intuition and the rootedness of worldly wisdom?

==Templates/userboxes this user created==

===Fully documented templates: [[Template:Welcomeback/doc]]===

===Others (needing documentation)===


[[Template:Awaiting import]] For pages that need content but for which the templator is not prepared to go so far as to put in a request for import. Needs documentation.
[[Template:Welcomeback]]
===Even Babe Ruth had Strikeouts: Rejected templates===

&lt;s&gt;[[Template:Stub outline]]&lt;/s&gt; Rejected as redundant/redirected to Template:Stub. IMO it is aesthetically more pleasing to me to distinguish drafts from outlines. But I would concur that it is a level of redundancy which might warrant redirect to Template:Stub if the real issue is simply to avoid willy-nilly proliferation of templates. I suppose maybe someday this could be re-evaluated but for now simplicity seems to be the higher virtue. 

&lt;s&gt;[[Template:Stub draft]]&lt;/s&gt; See above discussion

&lt;s&gt;[[Template:Possible high risk]]&lt;/s&gt; Redirected to Template:high risk. Intention was for use on new templates for which it was not clear whether or not they will actually become high use.

Adrignola I was wondering if you can recommend language or wording to acknowledge that the basis for this book was a wikipedia article that I wrote and no one else edited. Specifically, is it just a courtesy to acknowledge that or is it a policy imperative due to copyright, etc.? Thanks in advance you have been quite helpful, patient and considerate in the past.

Are you planning to expand the many one-page books you have created using imported material? &lt;font color=green&gt; Yes. I assume it is still OK to keep many books one page, such as http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Radioactive_Waste_Management/Spent_Nuclear_Fuel#Dry_Storage


t...otherwise, please see [[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/User:Geofferybard#Gameplan_for_Wikibooks|The Gameplan]] on my user page-Geof &lt;/font color&gt; Have you seen our help guide [[Using Wikibooks]] for developing a table of contents for linking to &quot;subpages&quot;?&lt;font color=green&gt;Well I did use that set up for my first book, [[California Public Policy and Citizen Participation]] which is of course not &quot;completed&quot;. But I thought that for some books, one page with anchor-links works better and prints out more easily? I will review the advice on structure. Please bear with me in that it seems once one commits to a TOC-subpage format, one is stuck with that format. I would rather develope content for a while, first, and see if I do attract hordes of gifted collaborators, before getting too wrapped up in TOC/subpaging any particular book. -Geof &lt;/font color&gt;[[User:Geofferybard|Geofferybard]] ([[User talk:Geofferybard|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Geofferybard|contribs]]) 23:51, 19 May 2011 (UTC)

I have an account here. Just haven't done anything at Wikibooks and I'm not really familiar with how it works. I'll have to take some time to look around. Feel free to give me any useful advice, information etc. Regards, [[User:Mattisse|Mattisse]] ([[User talk:Mattisse|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Mattisse|contribs]]) 12:22, 20 May 2011 (UTC)

== Thanks to Jomegat ==

Thank you Jim for your attention to my requests which I think were better stated as import oriented. I notice you are from New Hampshire, where I did some climbing at Fraconia Notch and Tuckerman's Ravine. I sauntered up Mt Washington on the first day of spring, up the winter route, and after climbing in the Tetons and Candadian Rockies expected something quite apart from what I encountered. Maybe some day we will see some rockclimbing mountaineering and iceclimbing guidebooks on Wikibooks which will be updated as seasonal conditions change. This could result in live-saving changes in the way guidebooks are developed.[[User:Geofferybard|Geofferybard]] ([[User talk:Geofferybard|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Geofferybard|contribs]]) 22:39, 20 May 2011 (UTC)
:I drove through the Notch today on the way home from a weekend in Maine. I'd love to see some material developed here on Rock Climbing, as then I could paste it into one of the chapters of the book I came here to work on - [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book]] - with proper attribution, of course! Be careful on Mt Washington - it has a well-deserved reputation for being a deadly place.  --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Jomegat|contribs]]) 00:11, 23 May 2011 (UTC)
::Franconia Notch - yes, I did a 5.8 climb there with a guy from the Dartmouth Mountaineering Club. I think part of the mountain broke off a few years later and the route I climbed no longer exists. I would like to see a wikibook on Clean Climbing Techniques. Maybe also guidebooks, perhaps in the Wikibooks Jr section.

==Linking==
I've just spent a while cleaning up all the redirects you created with the multiple page moves. I noticed you are using full name links rather than relative links, which is making a lot of work for you. If you link to a subpage like this &lt;nowiki&gt;[[/subpage/]] instead of [[main page/subpage|subpage]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; then you won't need to keep editing all the pages as you &quot;rename&quot; the main page. &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 23:15, 21 May 2011 (UTC)
===Oh, hmmmm, of course! ===
I should have tried that, as the new name, despite its' virtues, does seem a bit awkward. Now I can continue with substantive edits, thanks for the HeadsUp. Maybe 
[[/subpage]] rather than [[/subpage/]] createes a cleaner page because it doesn't have the superflous &quot;/&quot; displayed at the top of the page. {?)...anyway I was fixing some of the redirects guess you got to them before I did, sorry about that.

:No actually the thought was that there would be a second book in the series focused on SONGS (San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station) which is also on the California coast and shares much of the same regulatory climate. Fukushima Aftermath is envisioned as a sort of general introduction to the series itself. But I was wondering and have been asking for feedback on whether the Diablo book should be a name without the colon and question mark, and if the word Renaissance works better.
Perhaps: Fukushima Aftermath: Diablo Nuclear Renaissance or Industry Meltdown?

== edit was not saved ==

Your edit was not saved because it contains a new external link to a site registered on Wikibooks' blacklist.

    * To save your changes now, you must go back and remove the blocked link (shown below), and then save.
    * If you feel the link is needed, you can:
          o Request that the entire website be allowed, that is, removed from the local or global spam blacklists (check both lists to see which one is affecting you).
          o Request that just the specific page be allowed, without unblocking the whole website, by asking on the spam whitelist talk page. 

Blacklisting indicates past problems with the link, so any requests should clearly demonstrate how inclusion would benefit Wikibooks.

== Google problem ==

Google of &quot;fiddle+wikibooks brings up User:Fiddle in several slots .
It seems that use names that coincide with topics will do this.
Is there someway to fix this so that the search engines can distinguish mainspace accordingly?
:The only way to fix it would be to exclude user pages from search engines entirely.  That's something that can be done, but would likely deserve greater input from the community before implementation. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|discuss]]&lt;/small&gt; 00:08, 7 July 2011 (UTC)
:: Perhaps going forward, anyway, we should have a policy to disallow ''user names which search engines would confuse with topics'' or book names. It only seems like common sense. Someone could take a user name like &quot;Nuclear energy&quot; and pull search engine hits onto completely unrelated topics. Also, if search engine designers see their ouputs returning what they will regard as garbage, they themselves might downgrade WikiBooks altogether, favoring sites, perhaps non-collaborative sites, which don't have that issue. I noticed a huge shift in google policy which at one time returned WMF hits top and then suddenly down beneath dozens of &quot;professional&quot; sites. It seems that if we let this issue languish on the vine, it will hurt the long term viability of the site as increasingly sophisticated search engineering will perhaps not be nimble enough to sort User space and will simply downgrade WMF and all collaborative sites except those which specialize in topic areas.

::::: I meant to discuss the general or overall problem as you see it and possible solutions mentioned in this discussion rather than the more specific case of Fiddle that this discussion is about. Whether usernames turning up in search results for topics is even considered a problem in need of a solution is something the community should decide on. I think the solutions suggested so far are probably ones that no Administrator should be doing on their own without community consensus as they might be considered high impact.

====User:Fiddle====
The user has not had a talk page edit since 2005.

:A quick remedy is to add &lt;nowiki&gt;__NOINDEX__&lt;/nowiki&gt; to the user page, as I have done to [[User:Fiddle]].

==Mothers for Peace==

It is great to see some new editorial initiative on the book however it needs to be up to standard. Wikimedia Foundation projects generally have differing policies but across the board favor independent secondary source material and discourage essay-style writing, opinion, and self-promotional material.

Of course your recent edits were in good faith, so there have been some hopefully helpful {{Citation needed}} templates so that hopefully folks will get the idea. Hopefully you will find that the search for references will lead you to some very useful insights. 

(For instance, I discovered in the course of researching the book that there is actually more information about some aspects of Diablo on a website in Australia maintained by the Australian government, inoformation which would otherwise not be available on the web, anywhere. I was really quite shocked, and I'd bet Jane Swanson would love to know that little tid bit - it fits rather nicely into her whole pitch. Buuut....it is up to her whether or not she participates in WikiAnythingWhatsoever.

To be frank, if there are some botched up public advocacy failures with repercussions for the next 80,000 years of spent fuel storage, it won't be due to any slacker attitudes on my part. The Wikimedia community and I  built this book and it is up to the community to either keep the ball rolling or let it die on the vine. I am moving on to other projects, i.e., creating a series of music books and Wikiversity classes.

However, if you need any help, anything at all, don't hesitate to post here, on the discussion page at the articles/book pages, send me email and I will do anything humanly possible to assist in keeping the book up to date and viable. You can also pose questions to the administrators and you will find that Adrignola and QuiteUnusual are very generous with their time and willing to spend it in order to bring WikiBooks up to a higher level. They are a tremendous asset and they are available to help you at any time, for the asking. Just post a question on their talk pages and they will help.
 

It would not surprise me at all if policymaker staff persons view this book when they research DCPP. I saw Das Williams tonight at dinner and talked to him about DCPP and I have also talked to his staffperson Hilary. They are letting Sam Blakeslee take the lead but I am trying to get him to keep an eye on the issue. But it is up to the folks in the community to decide to use the book, or let it &quot;decay&quot;. The book may live, the book may &quot;decay&quot;. But the [[W:Spent nuclear fuel|spent fuel]] will continue, whether we apply our intellect and our will, or if we slack off. The fuel is still there...[[User:Geofferybard|&amp;#91;&amp;#91;User:Geof Bard गीता&amp;#93;&amp;#93;]] ([[User talk:Geofferybard|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Geofferybard|contribs]]) 02:08, 19 July 2011 (UTC)

= Needs fixin' ==

Blackberry Blossum is both Bluegrass and Old Time but I am working on tunebook companion guides for both genres. For ease of printing they probably both need to have separate pages but I could not create a unique page for Fiddler's Companion because of the ol' WP blacklist issue. Perhaps you can fix that?[[ Fiddlers Companion Volume III Bluegrass/Blackberry Blossom (tune)]] is the text which I wish to replicate. Many complex references which took a couple  few hours or so to compile into the article. It would be nice to keep the references and have individual pages for each book, if you get time perhaps you can take a look?[[User:Geofferybard|&amp;#91;&amp;#91;User:Geof Bard गीता&amp;#93;&amp;#93;]] ([[User talk:Geofferybard|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Geofferybard|contribs]]) 01:59, 22 July 2011 (UTC)
:I'm really not sure what you're asking here. You can use &lt;nowiki&gt;{{:Page Name/Subpage Name}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; to transclude a page onto another if a page needs to be a member of two books. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|discuss]]&lt;/small&gt; 03:25, 22 July 2011 (UTC)
::OK I will try that. But I am not sure that when I get to creating printable versions if the issue will reassert itself. But I don't think that people necessarily want to print a lot of references for that particular book.  I was asking for the blacklist to not block saving the edits. It seems that the blacklist is overly inclusive. It might be blogspot which is causing the problem. But edits will not save, I get an error message that says it is necessary to remove the blacklisted reference.[[User:Geofferybard|&amp;#91;&amp;#91;User:Geof Bard गीता&amp;#93;&amp;#93;]] ([[User talk:Geofferybard|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Geofferybard|contribs]]) 23:30, 22 July 2011 (UTC)

===Detail: The error message===
Spam protection filter

Your edit was not saved because it contains a new external link to a site registered on Wikibooks' blacklist.

    To save your changes now, you must go back and remove the blocked link (shown below), and then save.

    If you feel the link is needed, you can:

        Request that the entire website be allowed, that is, removed from the local or global spam blacklists (check both lists to see which one is affecting you).

        Request that just the specific page be allowed, without unblocking the whole website, by asking on the spam whitelist talk page. 

Blacklisting indicates past problems with the link, so any requests should clearly demonstrate how inclusion would benefit Wikibooks.

===Detail: How the error message is generated===
[[MediaWiki:Spam-blacklist]]. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|discuss]]&lt;/small&gt; 14:09, 23 July 2011 (UTC)

===What I wish to accomplish===

I would like to be able to create a printable HTML version of [[Bards_Old_Time_Fiddle_Tunebook_Supplement|this]] book: 
which includes the references. But [[Bards Old Time Fiddle Tunebook Supplement/Blackberry Blossom|the page in question]] resists re-creation at [[Bards Bluegrass Fiddle Tunebook Supplement/Blackberry Blossom|this]] book. The tune is used in both genres, and since I wrote the entire article there is no need to worry about edit histories. So what I would like would be for the blacklist to be eased up a bit, if possible. Alternatively, maybe there is a way to overide the block. If worse comes to worse, maybe there can be some kind of macro or bot that will isolate the blacklisted link, which is somewhat of a mystery.
:It's reference #14. Blogspot is not a reference for facts and using it as a source is as bad as using Wikipedia as a citation in one's doctorate thesis.  If you really can't live without it, it can be overridden at [[MediaWiki:Spam-whitelist]], but I strongly suggest you consider the reliability of your sources. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|discuss]]&lt;/small&gt; 14:08, 23 July 2011 (UTC)
::That's good advice but in some cases the blogger is reputable and known to the musician community; in others it is to corroborate rather than to establish something anecdotal&gt; But I will check things over. In many instances if writing about fiddle music I may want to write something I know to be true and need to corroborate, and there are no academic papers on it, so a blogger fits. This is not true however on books about, say, nuclear energy policy![[User:Geofferybard|&amp;#91;&amp;#91;User:Geof Bard गीता&amp;#93;&amp;#93;]] ([[User talk:Geofferybard|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Geofferybard|contribs]]) 02:40, 25 July 2011 (UTC)

===Summary and status report===

I am going offline until at least tommorow. I started the Print Version [[Bards Old Time Fiddle Tunebook Supplement/Print Version 1|here]] and got through the first couple of songs, Angeline the Baker and Arkansas Traverler. When I got to Blackberry Blossom, I got stuck...if you try to paste the copy from the main book into the printable version, everything is fine until you put in the references tag in curly brackets, and then you are blocked from saving. Some readers will definitely prefer having the footnotes, so maybe this can be remedied without too much trouble. If not, I can work around it. Thanks for your time and attention, I am quite pleased with this little book and look forward to upgrading it.

:You shouldn't be copying and pasting into a print version.  It won't be kept up to date with changes on the original pages themselves.  You need to use the method I showed for transcluding a page onto another.  This will also save you loads of time and you won't have to manually update the print version.  Harness the power of the wiki.  You can then use {{tag|noinclude}} tags around the references section on the page to keep them from showing up in the print version, if desired.  Please see [[Help:Print versions]] and the modifications I made to your print version page. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|discuss]]&lt;/small&gt; 14:03, 23 July 2011 (UTC)

:Note that there is a limit to the number of transclusions. It may be only possible to provide a by chapter/section print version. I also remember seeing a template/hack that permits to have all references in a print version aggregated into a single page, I think this is the page [[Annotations of The Complete Peanuts/References]] (don't know if it works).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 14:13, 23 July 2011 (UTC)
::I appreciate the suggestion, but probably it's not a matter of the quantity of references, it seems the problem is that there are certain domains listed on the WikiBooks server which are blocked because they are suspected of obtrusive commercial activity (spamm). However, the page in question is not blocked at either Wikipedia nor at Wikiversity, where I tested, and so it is probable that WB has more sites blacklisted than WP or WV.But thanks for the suggestion.

::RE: references  I thought that a curly bracket references tag at the end of the print version is all that would be needed. Perhaps if the book is kept short enough the threshold &quot;transclusions&quot; limit won't be reached? Actually I was thinking of a references-free &quot;Economy Print&quot; version which had a Bibliography at the end, anyway, because what with global warming [?] and all, I think we are supposed to be thrifty with paper. But it is important in the long run that WB books be able to go to print fully references. Cheers.

:::Well for changes to the list you should continue to talk with Adrignola (he made some changes recently [[MediaWiki:Spam-blacklist]] or you can make a post on the administrative requests/discussion area), you can probably circumvent the block by using for instance the Wayback Machine http://www.archive.org (my favorite even if the resource is up and usable) or some working redirector (use only if you must).
:::Transclusions limit doesn't have to do with size but number of pages transcluded. I never use the reference stile on Wikibooks, I chose to add the a wikilink to wikipedia's relevant article or a direct (or using the Wayback Machine) to the relevant resource. My feeling is that it is easier to maintain, better for readers and more format portable (it would be marvelous if Wikimedia could support some sort of page formating scheme, even a special markup for the generation of collections PDFs would be great).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 17:36, 23 July 2011 (UTC)

== Definition ==

The '''convex hull''', also known as the '''convex envelope''', of a set X is the smallest convex set of which X is a subset.  Formally,

'''Definition:''' The '''convex hull''' H(X) of a set X is the intersection of all convex sets of which X is a subset.

If X is convex, then obviously H(X) = X, since X is a subset of itself.  Conversely, if H(X) = X, X is obviously convex.

'''Theorem:''' If X is closed and bounded, so is H(X).

'''Theorem:''' H(X) is the union of all straight lines joining all pairs of points in X (where the line includes the end-points).

'''Proof:''' Let A, B be any two points in X.  They are also in any convex set Y containing X.  The line joining them must also lie within Y hence it must lie within the intersection of all convex sets containing X, i.e. within H(X).  Thus the union of all such straight lines is a subset of H(X).

===3. Nxe5===
White is threatening a fearsome queen check on h5, with the e5-knight ready to pounce on the g-pawn should Black advance it to g6. There's also the incidental threat of exf5. So that's the Latvian Gambit refuted then? Most top players would say &quot;yes&quot;. But there is a particularly optimistic breed of chess player that looks at the pawns on f5 and e4 and thinks that if the knight could just be driven away from e5, it's Black who will be capturing a pawn (fxe4), and possibly even defending it with ...d5. 

And so the move [[/3...Qf6/]] was invented. Yes, it's not usual to move the queen so early, but then again, following up a wild lunge like 2…f5 with solid-looking moves is a recipe for disaster.

There's also [[/3...Nc6/]], the Fraser Variation. &quot;You're threatening to win the exchange? Coward! I shall FORCE you to win the exchange!&quot;

[[/3...Nf6/]] has recently been suggested, preventing Qh5+ but allowing exf5. This may or may not be suicidal.

= Latvian Gambit =
===3...Qf6===
Black's queen has come lumbering out to poke the e5-knight in the ribs. Should White hold the line, or retreat?

[[/4. d4/]] is the (old) main line. It temporarily establishes a classical pawn centre (d4+e4) allowing easy development of the remaining White pieces. If Black now wants to shift the knight from e5, she will have to play …d6 shutting in the f8-bishop.

[[/4. Nc4/]] is the Leonhardt Variation, recommended by Latvian Gambiteer Tony Kosten and now considered a more critical test of the Latvian than d4. White knows she can't prevent …fxe4, so reserves the option of confronting that pawn with a d2-d3 advance when it arrives on e4.

Other knight retreats (to d3 or f3) allow …fxe4 with an attack on the knight, giving Black time to follow up with …d5 to great advantage.

Black remains a pawn down, but White's knight has run off, so Black may now dream of playing …d5 in one move. That pawn on e4 will have to be cleared out of the way first, with [[/4…fxe4/]]. (If Black delays, White will play exf5 and retain the extra pawn.)

Black threatens to play …d5 with beautiful development and only a slightly misplaced queen to worry about. But [[/5. Nc3/]] covers d5 and gains further time by hitting the e4-pawn. Rarely do such delicate works as Black's encounter such a robust spanner as 5. Nc3.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Right Triangle==
Right Triangle is a triangle that has one angle equal to 90&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; and the sum of the other two angles equal to 90&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;
:[[File:Sohcahtoa.svg|200px]]

== Pythagoras's Theorem ==
The three sides of the right triangle relate to each other as shown
: (Hypotenuse)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = (Adjacent)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + (Opposite)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;b^2 = a^2 + c^2&lt;/math&gt;

==Trigonometry Triangle==
[[Image:Trigonometry triangle.svg|200px]]

In right triangles, the trigonometric ratios of sine, cosine and tangent can be used to find unknown angles and the lengths of unknown sides. The sides of the triangle are known as follows:
* The ''hypotenuse'' is the side opposite the right angle, or defined as the longest side of a right-angled triangle, in this case '''h'''.
* The ''opposite side'' is the side opposite to the angle we are interested in, in this case '''a'''.
* The ''adjacent side'' is the side that is in contact with the angle we are interested in and the right angle, hence its name. In this case the adjacent side is '''b'''.

===Sine ===
The '''sine''' of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the hypotenuse. In our case
:&lt;math&gt;\sin A = \frac {\textrm{opposite}} {\textrm{hypotenuse}} = \frac {a} {h}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

===Cosine===
The '''cosine''' of an angle is the ratio of the length of the adjacent side to the length of the hypotenuse. In our case
:&lt;math&gt;\cos A = \frac {\textrm{adjacent}} {\textrm{hypotenuse}} = \frac {b} {h}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

===Tangent===
The '''tangent''' of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the adjacent side. In our case
:&lt;math&gt;\tan A = \frac {\textrm{opposite}} {\textrm{adjacent}} = \frac {a} {b}\,.&lt;/math&gt;


=== The sine, cosine and tangent rules ===
[[Image:Triangle with notations 2.svg|thumb||left|A triangle with sides of length a, b and c and angles of α, β and γ respectively.]]

The [[law of sines]], or sine rule,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clarku.edu/~djoyce/trig/laws.html|title=The Laws of Cosines and Sines|author=Prof. David E. Joyce|publisher=Clark University|accessdate=2008-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; states that the ratio of the length of a side to the sine of its corresponding opposite angle is constant, that is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{\sin \alpha} = \frac{b}{\sin \beta} = \frac{c}{\sin \gamma}.&lt;/math&gt;

This ratio is equal to the diameter of the circumscribed circle of the given triangle. Another interpretation
of this theorem is that every triangle with angles &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt;
is similar to a triangle with side lengths equal to &lt;math&gt;\sin\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\sin\beta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sin\gamma&lt;/math&gt;. This triangle can be constructed by first constructing a circle of diameter 1, and inscribing in it two of the angles of the triangle. The length of the sides of that triangle will be &lt;math&gt;\sin\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\sin\beta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sin\gamma&lt;/math&gt;. The side whose length is &lt;math&gt;\sin\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is opposite to the angle whose measure is &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, etc.

The [[law of cosines]], or cosine rule, connects the length of an unknown side of a triangle to the length of the other sides and the angle opposite to the unknown side. As per the law:

For a triangle with length of sides &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; and angles of &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; respectively, given two known lengths of a triangle &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;, and the angle between the two known sides &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; (or the angle opposite to the unknown side &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;), to calculate the third side &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;, the following formula can be used:
:&lt;math&gt;c^2\ = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab\cos(\gamma)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;b^2\ = a^2 + c^2 - 2ac\cos(\beta)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;a^2\ = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc\cos(\alpha)&lt;/math&gt;

If the lengths of all three sides of any triangle are known the three angles can be calculated:
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha=\arccos\left(\frac{b^2+c^2-a^2}{2bc}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\beta=\arccos\left(\frac{a^2+c^2-b^2}{2ac}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\gamma=\arccos\left(\frac{a^2+b^2-c^2}{2ab}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

The [[law of tangents]] or tangent rule, is less known than the other two. It states that:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{a-b}{a+b} = \frac{\tan[\frac{1}{2}(\alpha-\beta)]}{\tan[\frac{1}{2}(\alpha+\beta)]}.&lt;/math&gt;

It is not used very often, but can be used to find a side or an angle when you know two sides and an angle or two angles and a side.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Botswana, officially the Republic of Botswana (Tswana: '''Lefatshe la Botswana'''), is a country located in Southern Africa. The citizens are referred to as '''Batswana''' (singular: Motswana). Formerly the British protectorate of Bechuanaland, Botswana adopted its new name after becoming independent within the Commonwealth on 30 September 1966. It has held free and fair democratic elections since independence.

==Geography==
Geographically the country is flat and up to 70% of Botswana is covered by the Kalahari Desert. It is bordered by [[../South Africa|South Africa]] to the south and southeast, [[../Namibia|Namibia]] to the west and north, and [[../Zimbabwe|Zimbabwe]] to the northeast. It meets [[../Zambia|Zambia]] at a single point.

==History==
At the end of the 19th century conflicts occurred between Boer settlers and the native Tswana people.  The region was administered by Britain and parts of Botswana became part of South Africa.  Botswana has been '''an independent country since 1966'''.

==Economy==
A small, landlocked country of just over two million people, Botswana was one of the poorest countries in Africa at the time it gained independence from Britain in 1966, with a GDP per capita of about US$70. Botswana has transformed itself, moving into the ranks of middle-income status to become one of the fastest growing economies in the world with its average annual growth rate of about 9 percent with income per capita of about '''$14,800'''.

Botswana’s impressive track record of good governance and economic growth supported by prudent macroeconomic and fiscal management, stands in contrast to the country’s high levels of poverty and inequality and generally low human development indicators. While education expenditure is high at 10 percent of GDP and significant educational achievements have been attained, including the provision of nearly universal and free education, overall outcomes have not created the skills and workforce Botswana needs. 

The country is trying to diversify its economy, which is heavily dependent on diamonds and the beef market. Other minerals are soda ash, copper and nickel matte, gold, and coal.

==People==
There are two official languages in Botswana: [[Wikijunior:Languages/English|English]] and [[Setswana]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''Trapezoid''' (American English) or '''Trapezium''' (British English) is a quadrilateral that has two parallel sides and two non parallel sides.

Some properties of trapezoids:
* The interior angles sum to 360&amp;deg; as in any quadrilateral.
* The parallel sides are unequal.
* Each of the parallel sides is called a ''base (b)'' of the trapezoid. The two angles that join one base are called 'base angles'. 
* If the two non-parallel sides are equal, the trapezoid is called an ''isosceles trapezoid''. 
** In an isosceles trapezoid, each pair of base angles are equal.
** If one pair of base angles of a trapezoid are equal, the trapezoid is isosceles.
* A line segment connecting the midpoints of the non-parallel sides is called the ''median (m)'' of the trapeziod.
** The median of a trapezoid is equal to one half the sum of the bases (called ''b&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''b&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'').
* A line segment perpendicular to the bases is called an ''altitude (h)'' of the trapezoid. 

The ''area (A)'' of a trapezoid is equal to the product of an altitude and the median.
:&lt;math&gt; A = mh&lt;/math&gt;

Recall though that the median is half of the sum of the bases.
:&lt;math&gt; m = \frac {1}{2}(b_1+b_2) &lt;/math&gt;

Substituting for m, we get:
:&lt;math&gt; A = \frac {1}{2}(b_1+b_2) h &lt;/math&gt;

Straight Line is a line that can be drawn from any 2 points

==Straight Line Equations==
===Straight Line through 2 points===
If there are 2 points  (x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) and (x,y) a line can be drawn these two points with a slope
: &lt;math&gt;m = \frac{y-y_1}{x-x_1} &lt;/math&gt;

The equation of the line can be 
: &lt;math&gt;y = y_1 + m (x - x_1)&lt;/math&gt;

===Straight Line through point===
From above if x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; equal zero then
: y = x

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Change in Variable==
A Change in variable is a term used to express the diffeence between 2 variables . Let &lt;math&gt;{\Delta}&lt;/math&gt; represents Change in 2  variables x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and x then
: &lt;math&gt;\Delta x = x - x_o&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;x = x_o + \Delta x   &lt;/math&gt;

If there is a function  f(x) such that when x change by an amount  &lt;math&gt;{\Delta} x&lt;/math&gt; the change in function will be
: &lt;math&gt;\Delta f(x) =  f(x) -  f(x_o)   &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;f(x) =  f(x_o) + \Delta f(x)  &lt;/math&gt;

==Example==
There are 2 points (1,3) (5,7) then
: &lt;math&gt;\Delta x = x - x_o = 5 - 1 = 4&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\Delta f(x) =  7 -  3   = 4&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Rate of Change==
Rate of Change is used to describe the ratio of a change in one variable compare to a change of another variable

If there is a function f(x) = y then the rate of change of the function f(x) correspond to the rate of change of variable z is
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac {\Delta f(x)}{\Delta x}&lt;/math&gt;

==Example==

If there are two points &lt;math&gt;(1,3) and (2,7))&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac {\Delta f(x)}{\Delta x} = \frac{7-3}{2-1} = 4&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Portfolio management ==
Portfolio management (or Project Portfolio Management - PPM) is about grouping two or more programs or projects that may help business to achieve its strategic goals. Portfolio management helps in prioritization, improve resource usage by sharing them, better communication among programs/projects participants of the portfolio.

Scope for portfolios are business goals that change according to business strategic.

Example of portfolio could be to lower costs by improving some facility's services. This portfolio would have one program/project for gas, other for water, other for electricity.

== Project program management ==
Program management is about grouping two or more projects that have similar objectives and will get more benefits if managed together, instead of alone. Program management helps in resolving issues constraints and better direction alignment.

Scope for programs are larger than projects and impacts in a more significant way.

== Project management ==
A project is a temporary endeavor, having a defined beginning and end (usually constrained by date, but can be by funding or deliverables), undertaken to meet unique goals and objectives, usually to bring about beneficial change or added value. The temporary nature of projects stands in contrast to business as usual (or operations), which are repetitive, permanent or semi-permanent functional work to produce products or services. In practice, the management of these two systems is often found to be quite different, and as such requires the development of distinct technical skills and the adoption of separate management.

Scope for projects are defined and progress through project life cycle.

== Levels ==
A portfolio may be composed of other portfolios. In that case first one would be called High Level Portfolio, and former would be Low Level Portfolio.

Levels interactions are:
* From Higher level portfolio to Lower level portfolio, Higher level program or project
* From Lower level portfolio to Lower level portfolio, Higher level program or project
* From Higher level program to Lower level program or project
* From Programs to projects

Interaction from higher level to lower (e.g. what High level portfolio sends to program):
* Strategies and priorities.
* Progressive elaboration.
* Governance .
* Impacts from changes in other portfolios, programs or projects.

Interaction from lower level to higher(e.g. what projects sends back to High level portfolio sends):
* Performance reports.
* Change requests with impact on other portfolios, programs or projects.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Derivative==

A derivative is a mathematical operation to find the rate of change of a function.

--[[Special:Contributions/174.117.102.136|174.117.102.136]] ([[User talk:174.117.102.136|discuss]]) 20:19, 2 March 2012 (UTC)

==Formula==
For a non linear function f(x) = y . The rate of change of f(x) correspond to change of x is equal to the ratio of change in f(x) over change in x
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\Delta f(x)}{\Delta x} = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}  &lt;/math&gt;

Then the Derivative of the function is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx} f(x) = Lim_{\Delta x \to 0} \Sigma \frac{\Delta f(x)}{\Delta x} = Lim_{\Delta x \to 0} \Sigma \frac{y}{x}&lt;/math&gt;

but the derivative must exist uniquely at the point x. Seemingly well-behaved functions might not have derivatives at certain points. As examples, f(x)= 1/x has no derivative at x = 0; F(x) = |x| has two possible results at x = 0 (-1 for any value for which x&lt;0 and +1 for any value for which x&gt;0) On the other side, a function might have no value at x but a derivative of x, for example  f(x)= x/x at x = 0. The function is undefined at x = 0, but the derivative is 0 at
x = 0 as for any other value of x.

Practically all rules result, directly or indirectly, from a generalized treatment of the function.

==Table of Derivative==
{{wikipedia|Table_of_derivatives}}
===General Rules===
&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}(f + g)= \frac{df}{dx} + \frac{dg}{dx}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}(cf)= c\frac{df}{dx}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}(fg)= f\frac{dg}{dx} + g\frac{df}{dx}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}\left(\frac{f}{g}\right) = \frac{g\frac{df}{dx} - f\frac{dg}{dx}}{g^2}&lt;/math&gt;

===Powers and Polynomials===
*&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx} (c) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}x=1&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}x^n=nx^{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}\sqrt{x}=\frac{1}{2\sqrt x}&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}\frac{1}{x}=-\frac{1}{x^2}&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}(c_n x^n + c_{n-1} x^{n-1} + c_{n-2}x^{n-2} + \cdots +c_2x^2 +  c_1 x + c_0) = n c_n x^{n-1} + (n-1) c_{n-1} x^{n-2} + (n-2) c_{n-2}x^{n-3} + \cdots + 2c_2x+ c_1 &lt;/math&gt;

===Trigonometric Functions===
&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx} \sin (x)= \cos (x)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx} \cos (x)= -\sin (x)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx} \tan (x)= \sec^2 (x)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx} \cot (x)= -\csc^2 (x)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx} \sec (x)= \sec (x) \tan (x)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx} \csc (x) = -\csc (x) \cot (x)&lt;/math&gt;

===Exponential and Logarithmic Functions===
*&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx} e^x =e^x&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx} a^x =a^x \ln (a)\qquad\mbox{if }a&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx} \ln (x)= \frac{1}{x}&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx} \log_a (x)= \frac{1}{x\ln (a)}\qquad\mbox{if }a&gt;0, a\neq 1&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;    (f^g)' = \left(e^{g\ln f}\right)' = f^g\left(f'{g \over f} + g'\ln f\right),\qquad f &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;    (c^f)' = \left(e^{f\ln c}\right)' = f' c^f \ln c&lt;/math&gt;

===Inverse Trigonometric Functions===
*&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx} \mbox{arcsin x} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-x^2}}&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx} \mbox{arccos x} = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-x^2}}&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx} \mbox{arctan x} = \frac{1}{1+x^2}&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;    {d \over dx} \arcsec x = { 1 \over |x|\sqrt{x^2 - 1}}&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;    {d \over dx} \arccot x = {-1 \over 1 + x^2}&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;    {d \over dx} \arccsc x = {-1 \over |x|\sqrt{x^2 - 1}} &lt;/math&gt;

===Hyperbolic and Inverse Hyperbolic Functions===
:&lt;math&gt;{d \over dx} \sinh x = \cosh x&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;{d \over dx} \cosh x = \sinh x&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;{d \over dx} \tanh x = \mbox{sech}^2\,x&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;{d \over dx} \,\mbox{sech}\,x = -\tanh x\,\mbox{sech}\,x&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;{d \over dx} \,\mbox{coth}\,x = -\,\mbox{csch}^2\,x&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;{d \over dx} \,\mbox{csch}\,x = -\,\mbox{coth}\,x\,\mbox{csch}\,x&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;{d \over dx} \sinh^{-1} x = { 1 \over \sqrt{x^2 + 1}}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;{d \over dx} \cosh^{-1} x = {-1 \over \sqrt{x^2 - 1}}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;{d \over dx} \tanh^{-1} x = { 1 \over 1 - x^2}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;{d \over dx} \mbox{sech}^{-1}\,x = { 1 \over x\sqrt{1 - x^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;{d \over dx} \mbox{coth}^{-1}\,x = {-1 \over 1 - x^2}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;{d \over dx} \mbox{csch}^{-1}\,x = {-1 \over |x|\sqrt{1 + x^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Sequence==
In mathematics, a sequence is an ordered list of objects (or events). Like a set, it contains members (also called ''elements'' or ''terms''), and the number of terms (possibly infinite) is called the ''length'' of the sequence.  Unlike a set, order matters, and exactly the same elements can appear multiple times at different positions in the sequence. A sequence is a discrete function.

For example, (C, R, Y) is a sequence of letters that differs from (Y, C, R), as the ordering matters. Sequences can be ''finite'', as in this example, or ''infinite'', such as the sequence of all even positive integers (2, 4, 6,...).  Finite sequences are sometimes known as ''strings'' or ''words'' and infinite sequences as ''streams''.  The empty sequence&amp;nbsp;(&amp;nbsp;) is included in most notions of sequence, but may be excluded depending on the context.

==Examples==
# 1, 2, 3, ... , n
# 1, 3, 5, ... , 2n + 1
# 2, 4, 6, ... , 2n

      <text xml:space="preserve">Organization structures can be divided in three ways: functional, matrix and projectized.

They differ basically by allocation, supervision and coordination according to PM authority, PM allocation and  budget control.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Organization structure !! Characteristics
|-
| Functional || 
* Functional manager controls budget
* PM works as part time in projects
|-
| Matrix ||
Varies from weak matrix to strong matrix based on:
* Higher PM authority
* If functional manager or PM controls budget
* PM working as part-time or full-time in projects
|-
| Projectized|| 
* PM as authority
* PM controls budget
* PM works as full-time in projects

      <text xml:space="preserve">==List of Limit==
This is a '''list of limits''' for common functions. Note that ''a'' and ''b'' are constants with respect to ''x''.

==Limits for general functions==

:&lt;math&gt;\text{If }\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = L_1 \text{ and }\lim_{x \to c} g(x) = L_2 \text{ then:}&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to c} \, [f(x) \pm g(x)] = L_1 \pm L_2&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to c} \, [f(x)g(x)] = L_1 \times L_2&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to c} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \frac{L_1}{L_2} \qquad \text{ if } L_2 \ne 0&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to c} \, f(x)^n = L_1^n \qquad \text{ if }n \text{ is a positive integer}&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to c} \, f(x)^{1 \over n} = L_1^{1 \over n} \qquad \text{ if }n \text{ is a positive integer, and if } n \text{ is even, then } L_1 &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to c} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \lim_{x \to c} \frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)} \qquad \text{ if } \lim_{x \to c} f(x) = \lim_{x \to c} g(x) = 0 \text{ or } \lim_{x \to c} |g(x)| = +\infty&lt;/math&gt; (L'Hôpital's rule)

==Limits of general functions==

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{h\to 0}{f(x+h)-f(x)\over h}=f'(x)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{h\to0}\left(\frac{f(x+h)}{f(x)}\right)^\frac{1}{h}=\exp\left(\frac{f'(x)}{f(x)}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{h \to 0}{ \left({f(x(1+h))\over{f(x)}}\right)^{1\over{h}} }=\exp\left(\frac{x f'(x)}{f(x)}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

==Notable special limits==

: &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to+\infty} \left(1+\frac{k}{x}\right)^m=e^{mk}&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to+\infty} \left(1-\frac{1}{x}\right)^x=\frac{1}{e}&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to+\infty} \left(1+\frac{k}{x}\right)^x=e^k&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{n}{\sqrt[n]{n!}}=e&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to \infty }\, 2^{n} \underbrace{\sqrt{2-\sqrt{2+\sqrt{2+\text{...} +\sqrt{2}}}}}_n= \pi&lt;/math&gt;

==Simple functions==

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to c} a = a&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to c} x = c&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to c} ax + b = ac + b&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to c} x^r = c^r \qquad \mbox{ if } r \mbox{ is a positive integer}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to 0^+} \frac{1}{x^r} = +\infty&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to 0^-} \frac{1}{x^r} = \begin{cases} -\infty, &amp; \text{if } r \text{ is odd} \\ +\infty, &amp; \text{if } r \text{ is even}\end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;

==Logarithmic and exponential functions==
:&lt;math&gt;\mbox{For } a &gt; 1: \,&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to 0^+} \log_a x = -\infty&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to \infty} \log_a x = \infty&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to -\infty} a^x = 0&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to \infty} a^x = \infty&lt;/math&gt;

==Trigonometric functions==

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to a} \sin x = \sin a&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to a} \cos x = \cos a&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\sin x}{x} = 1&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{1-\cos x}{x} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{1-\cos x}{x^2} = \frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to n^\pm} \tan \left(\pi x + \frac{\pi}{2}\right) = \mp\infty \qquad \text{for any integer } n&lt;/math&gt;

==Near infinities==

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to\infty}N/x=0 \text{ for any real }N &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to\infty}x/N=\begin{cases} \infty, &amp; N &gt; 0 \\ \text{does not exist}, &amp; N = 0 \\ -\infty, &amp; N &lt; 0 \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to\infty}x^N=\begin{cases} \infty, &amp; N &gt; 0 \\ 1, &amp; N = 0 \\ 0, &amp; N &lt; 0 \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to\infty}N^x=\begin{cases} \infty, &amp; N &gt; 1 \\ 1, &amp; N = 1 \\ 0, &amp; -1 &lt; N &lt; 1 \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to\infty}N^{-x}=\lim_{x\to\infty}1/N^{x}=0 \text{ for any } N &gt; 1&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to\infty}\sqrt[x]{N}=\begin{cases} 1, &amp; N &gt; 0 \\ 0, &amp; N = 0 \\ \text{does not exist}, &amp; N &lt; 0 \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to\infty}\sqrt[N]{x}= \infty \text{ for any } N &gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to\infty}\log x=\infty&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to0^+}\log x=-\infty&lt;/math&gt;

= Latvian Gambit =
===3...Qf6===
Black's queen has come lumbering out to poke the e5-knight in the ribs. Should White hold the line, or retreat?

[[/4. d4/]] is the (old) main line. It temporarily establishes a classical pawn centre (d4+e4) allowing easy development of the remaining White pieces. If Black now wants to shift the knight from e5, she will have to play …d6 shutting in the f8-bishop.

[[/4. Nc4/]] is the Leonhardt Variation, recommended by Latvian Gambiteer Tony Kosten and now considered a more critical test of the Latvian than d4. White knows she can't prevent …fxe4, so reserves the option of confronting that pawn with a d2-d3 advance when it arrives on e4.

Other knight retreats (to d3 or f3) allow ...fxe4 with an attack on the knight, giving Black time to follow up with …d5 to great advantage.

Black remains a pawn down, but White's knight has run off, so Black may now dream of playing …d5 in one move. That pawn on e4 will have to be cleared out of the way first, with [[/4...fxe4/]]. (If Black delays, White will play exf5 and retain the extra pawn.)

Black threatens to play ...d5 with beautiful development and only a slightly misplaced queen to worry about. But [[/5. Nc3/]] covers d5 and gains further time by hitting the e4-pawn. Rarely do such delicate works as Black's encounter such a robust spanner as 5. Nc3.

= Latvian Gambit, Leonhardt Variation =
===5. Nc3===
White's c3-knight is threatening to capture on e4 hitting the queen on f6, and taking advantage of this diversion to retreat safely to c3. Were the queen not on f6, Black could turn the tables after Nxe4 with ...d5! picking up a knight. So the queen must move again. In the old days of the Leonhardt Variation, [[/5...Qg6/]] was the move, defending e4 and pressuring g2. The modern preference is [[/5...Qf7/]], renewing the threat of ...d5.

Black is planning ...d5 again. Now comes perhaps the only &quot;unnatural&quot; move with which a White player facing the Latvian must be familiar: [[/6. Ne3/]]. There's no other way to defend against ...d5.

= Latvian Gambit, Leonhardt Variation =
===6. Ne3===
White has seemingly thwarted ...d5 yet again, and is now asking the Black army how they're going to save Private Ryan on e4. 

There are two options for Black: abandon e4 and make another non-developing move with [[/6...c6/]] to finally establish an iron grip over d5, or continue the charge with [[/6...d5/]], the Atars Gambit, accepting the loss of the d-pawn and saddling White with only the minor inconvenience of having to come and capture it.

It should be pointed out here that, in fact, the suicidal-looking 6...d5 is one of Black's last remaining attempts to revive the Latvian Gambit. If it doesn't work, the swashbuckling old opening will likely be tucked away on a shelf with a label &quot;suitable only for unprepared opponents&quot;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Resilience in Graph Theory ==
=== Definition ===

Sudakov and Vu (2008)&lt;ref name=&quot;Sudakov and Vu 2008&quot;&gt;Sudakov and Vu 2008,&quot;Local Resilience of Graphs&quot;. http://www.math.ucla.edu/~bsudakov/resilience.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; have proposed the most concrete definition of resilience in graph theory: if graph G has property P, what is the minimum number of edges that need to be removed so that G no longer has P?&lt;ref name &quot;Sudakov 2008&quot;&gt;Sudakov 2008&lt;/ref&gt; For example, consider the graph in figure 1 and its resilience with respect to connectivity. Removing any one edge leaves a graph that is still connected. It is necessary to remove two edges to produce a graph that is not connected (figure 2).  Thus, we could say that this graph has a resilience of 2 with respect to connectivity. Note that this does not mean that removing any two edges will destroy connectivity in this graph. Figure 3 demonstrates the possibility of removing two edges while leaving the graph connected.

&lt;gallery perrow=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
File:Resilience-figure.001.png|Figure 1
File:Resilience-figure.002.png|Figure 2
File:Resilience-figure.003.png|Figure 3
&lt;/gallery&gt;

Under this definition, a given graph will have different values of resilience with respect to different properties. As a result the definition is concrete but flexible, and can be usefully applied to real-world networks where properties are of variable importance from different perspectives.

Some discussions of resilience focus on vertex removal rather than edge removal. The effect of removing a vertex on the rest of the network is equivalent to the effect of removing all edges attached to that vertex.

=== Edge Removal Methods: Random and Targeted ===
The example above highlights the difference between random edge removal and targeted edge removal. If edges are removed randomly, a property might survive the removal of many edges. Targeted edge removal implies that the graph is analyzed and edges are chosen which will achieve the minimum. &lt;ref name=&quot;Newman 2003&quot;&gt;Newman 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Resilience of Scale-Free Graphs ===
The effect on the network of either type of edge removal depends in part on degree distribution. Graphs following a power-law distribution (scale-free) tend to be highly resilient to random edge removal, because there is a very good chance that the edges removed will connect only low-degree vertices and therefore the overall graph structure will be affected only slightly. They are much more vulnerable, however, to targeted removal of edges attached to high-degree nodes, and especially to the removal of those nodes themselves. In scale-free graphs, these high-degree vertices are critical in connecting subgraphs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Newman 2003&quot;/&gt;

=== Resilience and Vulnerability ===
A graph with a low resilience with respect to a property can lose that property as a result of only a few edge removals. We can say that the graph is vulnerable with respect to that property.

But this is only part of a complete consideration of vulnerability. The other half has to do with the effect on the network’s performance if the property in question has been lost, and is discussed under [[Transportation Geography and Network Science/Reliability]].

== Resilience of Transportation Networks ==
[[File:Resilience-figure.004.png|thumb|Figure 4]]
In graph theory, resilience is a binary concept: an edge either exists or it does not; a graph either has a property or it does not. In real-world transportation networks, links have additional properties such as capacity and cost. We can apply the concepts of resilience to transportation networks by considering the effects of changes in link properties on properties of the overall network.
[[File:Resilience-figure.005.png|thumb|Figure 5]]
For example, consider the network in figure 4, where the nodes represent cities and the links represent freight rail lines. Each link has a cost representing the time required to traverse it, in hours. It is a property of the network that there exists a path from A to D whose total cost is 10 hours or less. Now imagine some event occurs which increases the cost of the A-D link by 50%, to 15. The exact nature of the event is irrelevant; it could be a snowstorm, fatigued rails, or a government-imposed speed limit. This event was sufficient to destroy the network’s property of having an A-D path of cost 10 or less.

However, it did not destroy the network’s property of connectivity; A and D are still connected (though at a higher path cost). When evaluating the resiliency of a transportation network, it is important to keep in mind that the network will have different levels of resiliency with respect to different properties.

===Improving Resilience===
Once a network’s resilience with respect to a certain property has been evaluated, it is often desirable to improve the resilience. This can be achieved in two fundamental ways: by adding redundancy or by over-provisioning existing links. (Bell 2000, Intro)

====Redundancy====
Imagine that we could reduce the cost of links A-B and C-D from 8 to 6, as shown in figure 5. This improved network has three node-independent paths from A to D of cost 10 or less. If the same event happens to this network, the property will not be destroyed. Destroying the same property in the improved network requires more changes that it did in the original network. Therefore we can say that the improved network is more resilient with respect to this property.

====Over-provisioning====
A link is over-provisioned if it has more capacity than needed to handle normal levels of traffic. This &quot;reserve capacity&quot; can help the link, and therefore the overall network, maintain adequate levels of performance when link capacity is degraded. Capacity will still be reduced, but may remain able to provide a desired level of service. In our example, we can represent over-provisioning by upgrading the A-D link so that its initial cost is 6. The same event increasing its cost by 50% will now result in a cost of 9 hours — still less than the desired service level of 10 hours.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Exercise 7 ==

Is it really a good idea to encourage readers to implement their own sorting algorithm, without a discussion of why this is a bad idea in general? If the aim is to build the reader's understanding of static arrays, rather than to teach Algorithms 101, perhaps it would be better to specify a sorting algorithm in pseudocode. --[[User:Fishpi|Fishpi]] ([[User talk:Fishpi|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Fishpi|contribs]]) 17:16, 15 February 2011 (UTC)

:Isn't it covered on the theory side of the book ? If not you can add that information, you can also like to a Wikibook on algorithms or the Wikipedia page (but I thing it may have a solution included). Probably looking into the STL implementation (add the required information on the algorithm and link to that section) this would address all your issues...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 22:57, 16 November 2011 (UTC)

== Exercise 7 mistakes==

It has been a long time without programming, and actually this is the first time I find myself programming in C++ (for teaching a friend), but I think there are some mistakes on the sorting exercise (1st selection algorithm and bubble sorting). I had to change one of the operators in the second &quot;for&quot;. I've replaced the &lt;&lt; by &lt; in order to avoid a segmentation fault. At the moment I am not 100% sure of what &lt;&lt; does, but I am quite sure that its functionality is not what is needed there.

On the other hand, there were two lines in the 2nd selection algorithm that wouldn't work with my compiler (g++ on linux). These are:

system(&quot;pause&quot;);
fflush(stdin);

Both things are lines of code stated as to be avoid in C/C++ programming as you can check easily running a quick search on any searching engine. I don't see the need of pausing the program before exiting (and not at all using a function that is not C/C++ standard but a function of the OS, so not portable). And the fflush one, as you can check on the Internet, is absolutely pointless.

Obviously I might be wrong making any of these points, but at the moment I am quite sure they are all mistakes.

What do you think?

Thanks for the wiki anyway. It is being quite helpful for me :-)

[[User:Vicisbue|Vicisbue]] ([[User talk:Vicisbue|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Vicisbue|contribs]]) 21:30, 16 November 2011 (UTC)

:The system(&quot;pause&quot;) would disqualify the proposed solution. I have to look at the example, so I'm talking without looking (I will give it a closer look as I have time) fflush(stdin) may be necessary if the code uses the stdin to read the input since the pause requires a return (it would cause issues in a loop). I would appreciate if you moved that non compilable solution to a new section to be fixed (see the top of the exercises as example). You do not need to give clues to the problems and/or you could yourself take to the job of fixing it as an exercise :) . The &lt;&lt; is explained in the theory section of the book.
:As you go through the exercises do the same for others you find that do not compile, take the right input or give the proper solution. Thanks for the help.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 22:54, 16 November 2011 (UTC)</text>

:Hi there,

*I go to [[m:Meetup/London/42|Wikipedia London Meet ups]]
*I went to [[M:Wikimania 2010|Wikimania 2010]]

I am a Russian teacher who has lived in London over 20 years. Together with family and friends [http://www.youtube.com/user/LearnRussianLanguage we make videos to help students learn Russian].

I started making my first site in January 2010 [http://www.learnrussianspeakrussian.org/ LearnRussianSpeakRussian.org]. However I realised that I need other teachers to help me and therefore I have remade the site as wiki, so other teachers can help me to teach Russian and the students can ask us their questions. I have opened the [http://www.facebook.com/home.php?sk=group_186939257983333 LearnRussianSpeakRussian.org facebook group] and we started to make translations of the site into different languages. We want to use the [[w:en:Direct_method_%28education%29|direct method of teaching]], we are teaching Russian in Russian.

I started to make [http://wikitranslate.org WikiTranslate.org] to enable language students (of any language) to make translations of folk songs, fairy-tales, cartoons and prayers, etc. from a [[w:en:Target_language|target language]] to their native language (any language as well) and other way around. I want this site to help students to learn a new language and teachers to teach thier language. I hope that in the process of this work the users of this wiki will make friends and start having conversations not only on the wiki site, but on skype, etc. I have opened [http://www.facebook.com/home.php?sk=group_161671873864536 WikiTranslate.org facebook group].

We have made translations and voiceovers for the Russian fairy-tale [http://wikitranslate.org/wiki/%D0%9A%D1%83%D1%80%D0%BE%D1%87%D0%BA%D0%B0_%D1%80%D1%8F%D0%B1%D0%B0 Курочка ряба] into [http://wikitranslate.org/wiki/%D0%9A%D1%83%D1%80%D0%BE%D1%87%D0%BA%D0%B0_%D1%80%D1%8F%D0%B1%D0%B0/en:_English English], [http://wikitranslate.org/wiki/%D0%9A%D1%83%D1%80%D0%BE%D1%87%D0%BA%D0%B0_%D1%80%D1%8F%D0%B1%D0%B0/fr:_French French], [http://wikitranslate.org/wiki/%D0%9A%D1%83%D1%80%D0%BE%D1%87%D0%BA%D0%B0_%D1%80%D1%8F%D0%B1%D0%B0/it:_Italian Italian], [http://wikitranslate.org/wiki/%D0%9A%D1%83%D1%80%D0%BE%D1%87%D0%BA%D0%B0_%D1%80%D1%8F%D0%B1%D0%B0/el:_Greek Greek], etc. We want to translate all the fairy-tales of the world!

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Wet weather driving''' is the operation of a motor vehicle in the rain, snow, sleet and fog.  It is considerably more dangerous than motor vehicle operation in dry conditions.  While driving through snow, many drivers slow down, limit distractions and drive carefully.  However, in the rain and fog, people do not take the same precautions, leading to thousands of accidents a year in the United States alone.  Most of these accidents are preventable; caused by drivers who fail to realize that wet weather driving is fundamentally different than dry weather driving.

== Road hazards ==
Road debris and other hazards contribute to potential problems.

=== Engine oil and grease build up on the roads ===
Over time, grease and engine oil can build up on road surfaces, especially roads that are frequently used such as interstate and state highways.&lt;ref name=ed&gt;{{cite web |author=Kim, Liz, and Joanne Helperin |title=Tips and Techniques for Driving in Rain |work=Edmunds.com |url=http://www.edmunds.com/ownership/safety/articles/45401/article.html |accessdate=February 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The longer the roads are dry, the longer oil and grease have to build up. When the roads are dry, this is not a problem, however, when the rain starts to fall, it brings this oil and grease up to the surface and it rises above the water coating the road.  This makes the wet conditions even more dangerous.&lt;ref name=ed/&gt;  Although this oil and grease is washed away after a few hours of rain, those first few hours are critical. The stopping distance for a car traveling at 50mph is 65m.&lt;ref name=ed/&gt;

=== Crowned roads ===
In the United States, most roads are crowned, or built so that the center of the road is slightly higher than the sides.&lt;ref name=ed/&gt;  The purpose of crowning is to allow rain to run off the roads.  However, in many cases, especially in the spring, sand from winter plowings and dead leaves build up along the sides of the roads, trapping the water and preventing natural runoff.  This creates puddles on the roadsides, which can lead to hydroplaning and spray that obstructs a driver's view.&lt;ref name=ed/&gt;

=== Puddles and cross-running water ===
[[Image:hydroplaning.svg|thumb|300px|right|A hydroplaning tire.]]

A puddle may hide a very large pothole that can damage a tire or an electrical component.&lt;ref name=ed/&gt;&lt;ref name=mob/&gt; A puddle may also splash a large quantity of water up onto the windshield and obscure vision for an extended period depending on the puddle size.   Another danger of puddles is hydroplaning, when the tires lose contact with the road and instead ride on a pocket of water. This makes the vehicle very hard to control as it loses traction with the road and prevents the vehicle from steering, braking, or accelerating.  

Running water may also be dangerous when driven through.  If the current is powerful enough, it can push the car off of the road.

== Vehicle Hazards ==
=== Window Fog ===
When it is raining, the windshield and other windows may quickly fog up, obscuring the driver’s vision. Window defoggers can eliminate the problem.&lt;ref name=ed/&gt;&lt;ref name=mob&gt;{{cite web |author=Clemens, Kevin |title=Safer Wet-Weather Driving |work=Mobil 1 |url=http://www.mobiloil.com/usa-english/motoroil/car_care/notes_from_the_road/safer_wet-weather_driving.aspx?pg=1 |accessdate=February 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many rear windshield defoggers consist of wires that run across the glass.  When the defogger is activated, these wires heat up to clear the fog from the glass.&lt;ref name=mob/&gt;

=== Balding and Improperly Inflated Tires ===
Over time, tires lose their tread in a process that is generally known as balding. Tires will all wear down over time, although aggressive driving and alignment problems can speed up the process.  The tire tread is what allows the tire to grip the road and take away water on a wet road, and a vehicle that lacks adequate tread has a greater risk of [hydroplaning] on wet surfaces.  Tires should have a tread of at least 1/16 of an inch, anything less and it is time to replace it.  A trick to see if the tire in question has enough tread is to stick a Lincoln penny into the tire tread, with Lincoln’s head pressed into the grove.  If the top of Lincoln’s head is visible it means there is not enough tread.&lt;ref name=geek&gt;{{cite web |title=What are Bald Tires? |work=Wisegeek |url=http://www.wisegeek.com/what-are-bald-tires.htm |accessdate=February 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tires that are not properly inflated are also a driving hazard that is magnified in wet road conditions, and are at risk of blowing out should the car go into a skid.&lt;ref name=geek/&gt;

=== Braking Power/Stopping Distances ===
Average Dry Stopping Distance (Assuming two-thirds of a second reaction time):&lt;ref name=dist&gt;{{cite web |author=Wren, Eddie |title=Stopping Distances |work= Drive and Stay Alive |url=http://www.driveandstayalive.com/info%20section/stopping-distances.htm |date=August 2004 |accessdate=February 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the road is wet, the average stopping distance for a five passenger automobile is twice what it is on a dry road. Coupled with poor visibility, which can lengthen the time the driver takes to react, the stopping distances may be even larger.  Therefore, drivers should position themselves twice as far away from the vehicle in front of them.

=== Water buildup on brakes === 
After driving through a puddle, brake rotors can become coated with water that can affect their ability to safely slow the car.  In order to prevent this from happening, the driver should lightly tap the brakes after each puddle; this removes the excess water and ensures that the brakes will be there when they are needed.&lt;ref name=ed/&gt;

=== Windshield wipers ===
The largest factor that affects driver visibility in the rain is the windshield wipers. Older wipers tend to become cracked and brittle after long periods of use, lasting only six months to a year in areas with frequent rain.  However, wipers do not last forever even if they do not get much use.  They can become brittle and warped by the sun, rendering them useless in heavy rain.  There are several indicators that the wipers need to be replaced including: windshield streaking, windshield smearing, rubber that flakes off when touched, wiper screeching, and frayed wipers.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The most commonly accepted definition declares reliability to be “the probability that [a] system can perform its desired function to an acceptable level of performance for some given period of time.”&lt;ref name=&quot;Cassir Bell Iida 2000&quot;&gt;Cassir, C., Bell, M., &amp; Iida, Y. (2000). Introduction. In Bell, M. G. H., &amp; Cassir, C. (Eds.), Reliability of transport networks (pp. vii-xi). Philadelphia: Research Studies Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This definition is useful but general: any specific measure of reliability will depend on the nature of the desired function and what levels of performance are acceptable. As a result, a wide range of both definitions and measures of reliability have been proposed, each designed for application to a specific type of transportation network or a specific network function.

==Measures of Reliability in Transportation Networks==

===Terminal Reliability===
Terminal reliability measures the probability that a transportation network can perform a very basic function: providing a path — any path, regardless of cost — from an origin to a destination. To determine this measure, each link in a network is assigned a functional probability x that represents the likelihood that the link will function at any given time. This will be 1 if the link always functions and 0 if it never functions; intermediate values of x denote links that function x% of the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nicholson et al 2003&quot;&gt;Nicholson, A. J., Schmöcker, J-D., Bell, M. G. H., &amp; Iida, Y. (2003). Assessing transport reliability: Malevolence and user knowledge. In Bell, M. G. H., &amp; Iida, Y. (Eds.), ''The network reliability of transport'' (pp. 1-22). Oxford: Elsevier Science.&lt;/ref&gt;

These probabilities can be combined logically. In order for any single path to function, all of the links in that path must function. Since basic probability theory shows that P(A∩B)=P(A)×P(B), the probability that a single path will function is the product of the probabilities of all links in that path. In the case where the origin and destination are connected by more than one path, the network will function as long as any one path functions. Since P(A∪B)=P(A)+P(B)-P(A∩B), the probability that the origin and destination are connected can be calculated after establishing the functional probability of each possible path.&lt;ref name=&quot;Berdica 2002&quot;&gt;Berdica, K. (2002). An introduction to road vulnerability: what has been done, is done and should be done Transport Policy, 9 (2), 117-127 DOI: 10.1016/S0967-070X(02)00011-2&lt;/ref&gt;

As an example, imagine a national rail network where each link is closed for maintenance two days out of every year. Scheduling of maintenance is handled separately by regional authorities, and a national coordinator wants to evaluate the chance that specific pairs of destinations might become disconnected at some point in a year due to maintenance closures. He assigns each link a functional probability of 363/365 = 99.45%, identifies the possible paths between the points of interest, and applies the logic above to evaluate the reliability of each path and then of the connection.

===Travel Time Reliability===
Travel time reliability refers to the probability that a trip from an origin to a destination can be made in a specific time, or within a given range of times. It is used most often on networks where travel demand fluctuations are to some degree random, such as road networks and other multi-user networks. Travel time reliability should not be confused with delays caused by predictable variations. For example, queues due to bottleneck congestion in the fixed demand case. 

Most treatments of travel time reliability establish a baseline travel time through observation and then evaluate how different sources of uncertainty will affect actual travel times. The measured reliability is the probability that the baseline travel time plus uncertainty will be less than a desired value. Uncertainty is generated by two fundamental source: demand variation and capacity variation. Most attempts at describing travel time reliability have been based on the variation of travel time under normal daily (or other cyclical) usage variations. In these studies, each link is generally assumed to offer a normally-distributed range of travel times. These link travel time distributions are combined to compute the probability distribution of travel times for an entire path.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nicholson et al 2003&quot;/&gt; &lt;ref name=&quot;Berdica 2002&quot;/&gt;

Travel time reliability is analyzed from two approaches: Scheduling Delays with uncertainty, and Mean-Variance. The first assumes travelers have a preferred arrival time, and thus variations around this time time may be classified as schedule early or late delays. The second assumes an average travel time (mean) for the travelers, and variations around this time are classified as variance. Both approaches may be equal under some circumstances &lt;ref&gt;Carrion, C. and Levinson, D. (2011), Value of Reliability: A review of current evidence&lt;/ref&gt;

===Capacity Reliability===
Capacity reliability measures the probability that the network can handle a specific amount of demand. It can also be viewed as the probability that a network use will be able to complete a trip without encountering a degraded or over-capacity link. In this sense it is a refinement of terminal reliability, which considers neither link capacity nor user demand and link selection.

Proposed calculations of capacity reliability begin estimating a network’s reserve capacity, which represents the volume of traffic the network can handle above some baseline without reaching its maximum capacity or exceeding some defined service level. Existing studies have modeled reserve capacity as a multiplier applied to the baseline traffic volume. Simulation techniques are then applied to model network users’ responses to degraded links, rerouting network flow as links begin to reach capacity. &lt;ref name=&quot;Nicholson et al 2003&quot;/&gt; &lt;ref name=&quot;Berdica 2002&quot;/&gt;

==Vulnerability==
Vulnerability has been treated with varying degrees of complexity. In its simplest treatment, vulnerability is effectively the inverse of reliability: as a network’s reliability decreases, its vulnerability increases and vice versa.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nicholson et al 2003&quot;/&gt;

A more complex theory of vulnerability connects the ideas of reliability and network resilience by considering how network structure mitigates or aggravates the effect of link degradation. Vulnerability is evaluated for each link in the network and reflects the degree to which network performance (by some chosen measure) is affected if a particular link is degraded. A link is highly vulnerable if a small degradation results in a large reduction of network performance.&lt;ref name=&quot;D'Este Taylor 2003&quot;&gt;D'Este, G. M., &amp; Taylor, M. A. P. (2003). Network vulnerability: An approach to reliability analysis at the level of national strategic transport networks. In Bell, M. G. H., &amp; Iida, Y. (Eds.), ''The network reliability of transport'' (pp. 1-22). Oxford: Elsevier Science.&lt;/ref&gt;

This approach to vulnerability could be extended to encompass whole-network vulnerability by computing the ratios of links in a network that have various values of vulnerability. A network with a high proportion of highly vulnerable links would be described as highly vulnerable.

============================== 
is that works ??? impossible to install it with Py32,33,34, and pip do not install the package on the python'www'home

Download the package at http://karrigell.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/karrigell/branches/python3k/package/?view=tar, unzip it, then open a console window and run &lt;code&gt;python setup.py install&lt;/code&gt;

The package requires Python version 3.2 or above

      <text xml:space="preserve">Create a new directory. Save this script in a file called &quot;index.py&quot;:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;def index():
    return &quot;Hello world&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

Create another script called server.py:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;import Karrigell
Karrigell.run()
&lt;/source&gt;

Save server.py in the same folder as index.py, then run it : &lt;code&gt;python server.py&lt;/code&gt;. This will launch the built-in web server.

Finally, in a web browser enter the address ''h&amp;#116;tp://localhost/index.py/index''
.
Congratulations, you just ran your first Karrigell script ! The address ''index.py/index'' requested to run the function &lt;CODE&gt;index()&lt;/CODE&gt; in the script index.py. The value returned by this function is printed in the web browser.

In fact, you could have written the url ''h&amp;#116;tp://localhost/index.py'' : if no function name is specified, the function index() is run by default, with no argument.

And you could even have called ''h&amp;#116;tp://localhost'' : if no script is specified, the server searches a script called index.py and if it finds one, it executes its function index().

      <comment>/* Raw HTML */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">There are 3 ways you can build HTML in a script

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
==== Raw HTML ====
&lt;p&gt;The first one is to return a string with HTML tags, like this :
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;def index():
    return &quot;&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;Hello world&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;&quot;&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;li&gt;

==== Templates ====
&lt;p&gt;For a document that holds mainly static HTML, with only a few dynamic values, you can use templates. For instance, create a file called page.tmpl with:

&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
Hello world
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

and save it in the same folder as index.py. Then modify index.py like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;def index():
    return Template(&quot;page.tmpl&quot;)&lt;/source&gt;

The built-in function Template is available in all the scripts managed by Karrigell. It reads the content from the file located at the relative url ''page.tmpl'' and returns it. More on the templating system later.

&lt;li&gt;
==== The HTMLTags module ====

The third way, recommended when the page is mostly made of dynamic content, is to use the HTMLTags module, included in the package :

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;def index():
    return HTML(BODY(&quot;Hello world&quot;))&lt;/source&gt;

The HTMLTags module defines classes for all valid HTML tags, in uppercase letters : the classes for tags &amp;lt;html&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;body&amp;gt; are &lt;code&gt;HTML&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;BODY&lt;/code&gt; (surprise !). These classes are available in the scripts managed by Karrigell

The function index() returns an instance of the class &lt;code&gt;HTML&lt;/code&gt;, called with an instance of the class &lt;code&gt;BODY&lt;/code&gt; ; the server returns its string representation, which is the HTML code &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;Hello world&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Edit the same script, index.py, like this :

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def index():
	form = FORM(action=&quot;show&quot;)
	form &lt;= INPUT(name=&quot;city&quot;)
	form &lt;= INPUT(Type=&quot;submit&quot;,value=&quot;Ok&quot;)
	return HTML(BODY(form))

def show(city):
	return city
&lt;/source&gt;

This script defines 2 functions, index() and show(). In index() we build an HTML form, in show() we handle the data entered in the form

In function index() we first create an HTML form with the class FORM, with the parameter &quot;action&quot; set to &quot;show&quot;, the name of the function that will handle the data entered by the user

Then we build this form with INPUT instances. For this we &quot;add a child&quot; to the FORM instance with the operator &lt;= (think of it as a left arrow, meaning &quot;add child&quot;) : first an input tag with name &quot;city&quot;, then a submit tag with value &quot;Ok&quot;. Note that the attribute &quot;type&quot; is written Type with an uppercase initial, to avoid confusion with the Python name &quot;type&quot;

When the script is called by ''h&amp;#116;tp://localhost/index.py/index'', the form is printed in the web browser. Enter a value in the input field, then click on &quot;Ok&quot; : the value in the address bar of your browser will be set to ''h&amp;#116;tp://localhost/index.py/show?city=...'', and you will see the data you entered

How does this work? The value entered in the field &quot;city&quot; is passed as the argument to the function show() - the &quot;action&quot; attribute of the form. This function just returns this value, so the browser prints it

The name of the arguments of the function that receives the HTML form must be the same as the names in the HTML form. You can also use the usual Python syntax for unspecified arguments :

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def show(**kw):
	return kw['city']
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Instead of the default GET method, form fields can be submitted with the POST method. You just have to specify it when creating the instance of FORM :

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;form = FORM(action=&quot;show&quot;,method=&quot;POST&quot;)&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Create another script called upload.py:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def index():
    form = FORM(action=&quot;upload&quot;,method=&quot;post&quot;,enctype=&quot;multipart/form-data&quot;)
    form &lt;= INPUT(Type=&quot;file&quot;,name=&quot;src&quot;)
    form &lt;= INPUT(Type=&quot;submit&quot;,value=&quot;Ok&quot;)
    return HTML(BODY(form))

def upload(src):
    import mimetypes
    gtype,encoding = mimetypes.guess_type(src.filename)
    RESPONSE_HEADERS['Content-type'] = gtype
    data = src.file.read()
    return data
&lt;/source&gt;

The function index() looks like the previous example. The changes are the `enctype` parameter of the FORM, set to &quot;multipart/form-data&quot;; and the type of the first INPUT field.

In the upload function, we receive the argument `src`. Since it was sent as a file inside a multipart/form-data form, this object has an attribute filename matching the name of the uploaded file ; it also has an attribute file, a file-like object with a method read() that returns bytes.

The Python module mimetypes can guess the type of this file by its extension ; for instance if the uploaded file was a JPEG image, with the extension `.jpg`, the result of mimetypes.guess_type(src.filename) will be &quot;image/pjpeg&quot;.

The line &lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;RESPONSE_HEADERS['Content-type'] = gtype&lt;/source&gt; introduces another name which is always available in Python scripts run by Karrigell : &lt;code&gt;RESPONSE_HEADERS&lt;/code&gt;. It is a dictionary-like object (in fact, an instance of class &lt;code&gt;email.message.Message&lt;/code&gt;, used to set the response headers that will be sent to the web browser. Here, the line sets the Content-type header to the type of the file received.

In the next line we read the binary data from the attribute &quot;file&quot; of src, and finally return this binary data. The Karrigell engine sends the response headers, then the binary data ; with this information, the browser renders the file content under the appropriate format : if the file was a JPEG picture, the browser displays it.

      <comment>/* Sum into product */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">In this section, we shall see how to convert a product of two trigonometric functions into a sum or difference of two such functions, and vice versa.

== Product into sum ==
We have already seen that

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \sin(A) \cos(B) + \cos(A) \sin(B) = \sin(A+B)&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \sin(A) \cos(B) - \cos(A) \sin(B) = \sin(A-B)&lt;/math&gt;.

Adding these two equations and dividing both sides by 2, we get

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \sin(A) \cos(B) = \frac{1}{2} (\sin(A+B) + \sin(A-B))&lt;/math&gt;

Subtracting the second from the first equation and dividing both sides by 2, we get

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \cos(A) \sin(B) = \frac{1}{2} (\sin(A+B) - \sin(A-B))&lt;/math&gt;

We also know that

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \cos(A) \cos(B) - \sin(A) \sin(B) = \cos(A+B)&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \cos(A) \cos(B) + \sin(A) \sin(B) = \cos(A-B)&lt;/math&gt;.

Adding these two equations and dividing both sides by 2, we get

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \cos(A) \cos(B) = \frac{1}{2} (\cos(A+B) + \cos(A-B))&lt;/math&gt;

Subtracting the first from the second equation and dividing both sides by 2, we get

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \sin(A) \sin(B) = \frac{1}{2} (\cos(A-B) - \cos(A+B))&lt;/math&gt;

Thus we can express:

# The product of a sine and cosine as the sum or difference of two sines;
# The product of two cosines as the sum of two cosines;
# The product of two sines as the difference of two sines.

== Sum into product ==

Let C = A+B and D = A-B.  Then

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle A = \frac{1}{2} (C+D); \,\,\,\, B = \frac{1}{2} (C-D)&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting into the above expressions and multiplying both sides by two in each of them, we have:

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \sin(C) + \sin(D) = 2 \sin(\frac{C+D}{2}) \cos(\frac{C-D}{2})&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \sin(C) - \sin(D) = 2 \cos(\frac{C+D}{2}) \sin(\frac{C-D}{2})&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \cos(C) + \cos(D) = 2 \cos(\frac{C+D}{2}) \cos(\frac{C-D}{2})&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \cos(C) - \cos(D) = -2 \sin(\frac{C+D}{2}) \sin(\frac{C-D}{2})&lt;/math&gt;

Note the negative sign in the last formula.

These formulae are sometimes expressed in words, e.g.

:cos plus cos = two cos half sum cos half diff.

      <comment>/* Clinical assessment */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Substance use disorders or SUDs encompass a spectrum of conditions varying in severity from problematic use, abuse and varying grades of  mild to more severe dependence. Over the last half century, various drug use epidemics have characterised different population groups worldwide. As the knowledge base of clinical neuroscience has expanded, the understanding of these disorders has developed from being viewed as a moral weakness to being viewed as complex biomedical disorders affecting the brain and manifesting clinically as chronic relapsing disorders. In addition, research has demonstrated equivalent rates of relapse for addictive disorders and non-compliance to treatment for medical disorders such as hypertension and diabetes.

=== Epidemiology ===

Trends in substance use vary from country to country and fluctuations occur in the prevalence rates across time periods. Epidemiology investigates the distribution and determinants of substance use disorders; as well as patterns of drug use over time and its association with age, gender and associated risk factors. Epidemiologists use various definitions for substance use and substance use disorders. Definitions of substance use can vary from substance use once in past month or year, life time use or use characterised by the fully developed syndrome of addiction. Life time prevalence refers to fulfilling the criteria for a specified pattern of use(i.e., abuse or dependence) at least once in a person’s lifetime. Depending on the nature of substance use disorders, the chronicity and the related mortality rates, prevalence and incidence rates can differ markedly. For example, due to the chronic nature of drug dependence, the prevalence rates of substance dependence can be significantly higher than incidence rates. Period prevalence measures, such as past year prevalence, records the rate of patients fulfilling diagnostic criteria over the past year form the total population at risk. 

Prevalence: 
  
&lt;u&gt;Total number of cases at time/period&lt;u&gt;

Total population at risk at time/period

Incidence measures refer to the occurrence of newly diagnosed cases over a specified time period. Cumulative incidence or the incidence proportion is usually expressed as the total number of new cases per 10 000 or 100 000 patients over a period of time i.e., over a five year period. Alternatively, incidence rates or density can also be expressed as the number of new cases occurring in the at risk population, over the total number of person years of observation.             
                                                             
Incidence:    

&lt;u&gt;Number of new cases over period of time&lt;u&gt;
              
Total population at risk (without the disease) over period of time

Most large epidemiological samples across countries have found that men are at least 2-3 times  more likely than  women to use illicit substances and develop substance use disorders such as abuse or dependence (Brady and Randall, 1999). In addition, whereas men start using drugs at a younger age and take longer to develop full blown dependency syndromes; women tend to develop problems with addiction later in life, but develop severe problems more rapidly. However, there is evidence of a trend toward lower differences in substance misuse rates, particularly alcohol abuse, in younger age cohorts; and between males and females in the context of more equal and less traditional gender roles (Grant, 1996; Seedat et al. 2009). Certain religious and ethnic groups also show differential patterns of use. In the UK Afro Caribbean’s and in the US black patients are less likely to abuse alcohol and illicit drugs.

In the National Comorbidity Replication Study (NCS-R)(Kessler et al. 2005), conducted between 2001-2003, the lifetime prevalence for alcohol abuse in the general US population was 13.2% and for alcohol dependence 5.4%. Lifetime drug abuse had a lifetime prevalence of 7.9% whereas dependence had a prevalence of 3 %. 

Within the United States certain patterns of epidemics in the use of illicit substances have emerged over the past 30 years. Whereas cannabis use peaked in the mid 1970’s, there has been a decline in the early to mid 1990’s but a rapid upsurge in the mid 1990’s. The cocaine use epidemic reached a peak in the early to mid 1980’s and has been followed by a stimulant use epidemic dawning in the late early to mid 1990’s. Since the start of the new millennium an upsurge in methamphetamine use has plagued many countries among who include the USA, Japan, Australia, South East Asia, Eastern Europe and South Africa. 

Epidemiological studies identified different developmental trends in the age of onset of first drug use to the development of dependence. Cocaine dependence follows a risk trajectory of average age of onset of use in early 20’s with a comparatively higher cumulative risk of developing dependence than other substances of up to 15-16% in the 10 years following the onset of first use. Whereas the high risk periods for development of dependence for illicit drugs after first use are confined to the late teen years for drugs such as cannabis, early twenties thorough to the early 30’s for cocaine, risk of the developing  alcohol dependence continues throughout later life (Wagner and Anthony, 2002).
Despite stringent drug legislation and law enforcement, substantive evidence that such measures are effective have not been forthcoming

=== Pathogenesis === 

==== Biological Factors ====
===== Neuroanatomy and pathophysiology =====

The syndrome of drug dependence occurs as a result of a complex interplay of a variety biological mechanisms as well as psychological and social factors. Dependence is characterised by repeated use of a substance resulting that ultimately results in state of neural adaptation in the brain. Various drugs of abuse act on different receptor subsystems with many of these systems  converging onto to the final common pathway involved in reward seeking behaviours, the mesolimbic dopamenergic pathway (Kalivas and Volkow, 2005; Koob and Volkow, 2009). Altogether a number of neuro-anatomical circuits are involved in the pathophysiology of addiction. These include:

a) The Reward-Seeking system consisting primarily mesolimbic dopamenergic pathway and its subcomponents. This pathway stretches from the cell bodies of the dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area of the brainstem (substantia nigra) which project their axons onto the nucleus accumbens in the ventral striatum. Pulsatile stimulation of these dopaminergic neurons result in highly a pleasurable sensations

b) The prefrontal cortex subcomponents are thought to be involved in impulse regulation and modulation of reward seeking behaviour. These components include the OFC orbitofrontal cortex, the DLPFC, and the ventro-medial cortex (VMC) as well as the loop circuits that stretch from the frontal cortex through the striatum to the thalamus and back to the cortex (cortico-striatal-thalamo-cortical circuits or CSTCC). These circuits that  traverse the dorsal aspects of the striatum are also implicated in the compulsive aspects of drug addiction.

c) The extended amygdala (consisting of the central nucleus of the amygdala, the Bed Nuleus of the striae terminalis and the shell of the nAcc) and its connections with the VTA and Nu Accumbens, plays an important role in learning and conditioning of behaviours related to drug use.. The extended amygdala is sensitive to stress hormones such as cortisol, and plays a potentially important role in the triggering of relapses into drug taking behaviour caused by environmental and intrapsychic stressors.

d) The basolateral cortical amygdala. This structure represents the neocortical cellular layers of the amygdala and is thought to play an important role in environmental cue detection. This structure is therefore potentially important in cue induced drug taking behaviours. People, places and objects such as drug paraphranelia that has become conditioned with drug taking can potentially lead to stimulation this anatomical area to induce relapses.

e) Memory systems in the hippocampal formation, involved in the memory consolidation of events associated with substance use. This system is interconnected among others with the extended amygdala.

===== Pathophysiology: Substance binge/intoxication phase and type 1 craving (Stage I addiction) =====

The initial use of substances, in particular psychostimulants such as cocaine and methamphetamine, is associated with a surge in dopamine release in the mesolimbic dopaminergic pathway. The principal neurotransmitter in the reward pathway is dopamine which binds to D1 and D2 receptors. Whereas drug like cocaine and amphetamines result in a direct surge of dopamine release at dopaminergic synapses (via Dopamine re-uptake-DRI- inhibition in case of cocaine and increased release in case of amphetamines) other substances such as opoids and alcohol and cannabis are thought to indirectly result in increased dopamine release after affecting brain stem mu opoid, GABA inhibitory interneurions and CB1 (cannabinoid type one) receptors. In addition to the effects mediated indirectly via the dopaminargic system on learning, conditioning and reward-motivation, non stimulant drugs such opiates, cannabis and alcohol also exert effects on the glutamatergic, serotonergic, and cannabinoid systems that have been postulated to be crticial in the pathophysiology of addictive syndromes, independent of the effects of the dopaminergic system. The basolateral and extended amygadala is associated with craving, also known as type I craving, characterised by operant conditioning in the form of positive reinforcement of drug taking behaviour paired with rewarding sensations as well as classical conditioning by the pairing of neutral stimuli with the drug of abuse.

===== Pathophysiology: Withdrawal and protracted withdrawal/type 2 craving (Stage II addiction)=====

Prolonged use of a substance results in a state of neuroadaptation. Human Imaging studies have revealed decreased dopamine uptake activity in frontal striatal areas associated with chronic drug use. This downregulation of dopaminergic function results in a dampened reward system and the clinical phenomenon of tolerance. In addition repeated use and binging activates the hypothalamic pituitary axis (HPA axis) driven stress response and hormones such as corticotrophin releasing hormone (CRF) are mobilized. Anti stress hormones such as neuropeptide Y (NPY) levels also decrease. The activation of the stress response is has also been conceptualized as an anti-reward system.   Whereas the presence of the substance is experienced as pleasurable the withdrawal is experienced as unpleasant and anhedonia frequently characterises protracted withdrawal states. In contrast to the positive emotional state of intoxication, withdrawal is associated with a negative emotional state. These negative emotional states are thought to drive increased drug taking. Increased drug use associated with stress/negative emotional states is termed type 2 craving or negative reinforcement (Koob, 2009).

===== Pathophysiology: Relapsing recurring stage (Stage III addiction)=====

In addition to neuro-adaptation at transmitter and receptor level, intracellular molecular changes also occur during the state of drug dependence. These include the activation of transcription factors such as CREB (cAMP response element binding protein) and delta Fosb. These transcription factors in turn lead to the switching on of genes that code for neurotransmitter receptors, enzymes involved in the synthesis of neurotransmitters and  to altered neurotransmitter receptor numbers (up or down regulation). Increased cAMP in the nucleus accumbens associated with opoid, cocaine and alcohol use has also been linked to increased expression of the kappa opioid receptor that bind to the dysphoria inducing hormone dynorphine. This mechanism is thought to underlie the development of tolerance and is associated with the negative emotional state characterising withdrawal of the substance of abuse (Hyman, 2005). These molecular changes establish addiction and drive the relapsing and recurrent nature of addition.

===== Pathophysiology: Genetic vulnerability =====

Research into the genetics of alcohol dependence based on family, twin, and adoption studies have revealed that the heritability of alcohol dependence can be as high as 60%-80%. Genome wide association studies have implicated a number of genes in the development of alcoholism. In particular genes involved in the metabolism of alcohol are thought to play an important role. Asian populations are known to have low rates of alcoholism in comparison to Europeans. Persons from Asian descent experience highly unpleasant reactions upon alcohol ingestion such as severe nausea, flushing and tachycardia. This reaction is due to a rapid accumulation of the toxic breakdown and accumulation of the alcohol metabolite, acetaldehyde. This clinical observation lead to a search for associations with enzymes such as alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) that converts alcohol into acetaldehyde and acetaldeyhe dehydrogenase which converts acetaldehyde to acetate. This  search has revealed that variants in the alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) genes on chromosomes 4q and 12q respectively, are implicated. A variant of the ADH gene, ADH1B on chromosome 4q that encodes for a more robust ADH enzyme leading to higher levels of the toxic metabolite acetaldehyde, has been shown to protect against alcoholism in a Chinese population, reducing the rate of alcoholism with up to 80%. In turn a variant of the ALDH2 gene on chromosome 12q that produces weaker acetaldehyde dehydrogenase enzymes have been shown to reduce alcoholism with up to 67% in heterozygous subjects. As alcohol is an agonist on GABAA receptors, a search for genes encoding for the GABA receptor has revealed a strong relationship between alcoholism and the GABRA2 subunit gene on chromosome 4p that encodes for the ?2 subunit of the GABAA receptor. The GABAA receptor plays an important role in mediating the effects of alcohol intoxication as well as withdrawal (Hartz and Bierut, 2010).

Nicotine dependence carries a heritability estimated as high as 75%. Strong associations have been found between nicotine dependence and variants of genes coding for nicotinic cholinergic receptors (nAChR’s). In particular the gene CHRNA5, coding for the ?5 subunit of the nicotinic cholinergic receptor has been implicated. This gene is located on chromosome 15q. Nicotinic cholinergic receptors are distributed in the striatum on dopaminergic neurons and interact with these neurons in the  dopaminergic reward pathways. In turn the CHRNA5 gene has also been implicated in cocaine dependence (Hartz and Bierut, 2010). 
Of recent interest has been the study of potential gene environment (GxE) interactions in the development of addictive disorders. Whereas many of these findings represent non specific risk factors for a variety of psychiatric disorders, they are also likely to play a role in addictive disorders. Gene environment interaction studies have demonstrated interactions between variants of genes such as the serotonin transporter gene (5-HTTLPR) short and long variants and childhood maltreatment and negative family relations; the monoamine oxidase (MAOA-LPR) gene and childhood maltreatment and sexual abuse, as well as the GABRA2 gene and marital status. Although the findings of GXE studies are intriguing, many of these studies await replication(van der Zwaluw and Engels, 2009).

==== Psychological Factors ====

===== Learning, conditioning and cognitive factors =====

The development of drug dependence is driven by two different types of associative learning behavioural psychologists refer to as classical and operant conditioning.

Classical (or Pavlovian conditioning-referring to Pavlov’s experiments with dogs) consists of the repeated pairing of a neutral stimulus with a particular stimulus (uncontioned stimulus) that elicits a physiological, reflexive response (unconditioned response) such as activation of salivary glands or activation of a sexual response. With repeated co-administration of the unconditioned stimulus with the neutral or conditioned stimulus the neutral stimulus becomes a conditioned stimulus (CS) and elicits a conditioned response (CR).  People, places and objects associated with the drug use can become conditioned to elicit conditioned responses such as craving before using and therefore reactivate substance seeking behaviour. 

Operant conditioning refers to a positive or negative reward that follows certain behaviour such as taking a drug. Thus the euphoriant effects of a drug will positively reinforce drug taking behaviour. Negative affective states associated with the absence of drug taking behaviour or withdrawal become a negative reinforce that also increase further substance use behaviours.

In addition to behavioural factors, cognitive styles of persons with addictions can also perpetuate addictive behaviours. Dysfunctional and irrational beliefs about drug taking, triggered by environmental cues or intrapsychic stressors, can also lead to craving and consequent relapses into drug taking cycles. These beliefs may include thoughts such as &quot;I cannot socialize without drinking,&quot; &quot;I need some drugs to enjoy myself,&quot; &quot;I am able to control my drinking,&quot; &quot;there is  no life for me without drugs, as I am essentially a bad person.&quot;

===== Cycle of change and motivation =====

Prochaska and Diclemente have forwarded the cycle of change model of addiction (DiClemente et al. 2004). This model forms a useful framework of understanding motivation to change and forms the basis for motivational enhancement therapy. According to this model patients cycle through a number of stages throughout a recovery process. Patients can enter or exit at any stage of this cycle. These stages are:

a) Precontemplation stage: a stage where drugs are not considered problematic and dependence on the substance is denied.

b) Contemplation stage: Ambivalence is developed where the negative impacts of substances are weighed up against the perceived benefits, and change is contemplated.

c) Preparation: During this phase the person devises a plan for implementing change and strengthens their motivation to commit to such a plan
c) Determination: The client is determined to seek help

d) Action: Advice is followed and a rehabilitation plan is followed

e) Maintenance phase: triggers for use are identified and new coping strategies are learnt, leading to a new lifestyle.

f) Relapse: Relapse into substance taking behaviour are viewed not in a negative light but as positive learning experiences for the future.
Clients can cycle back and forth through these stages and recycle through these stages until a level of completion is reached that allows for a sustained change. Researchers also differentiate between readiness for change and readiness to engage in treatment. Whereas a client may show behaviours indicating a readiness to change, this does not necessarily translate into a willingness to follow a specific treatment program. Self-efficacy, the degree of confidence a client has in their ability to effect changes, plays an important role in shaping motivation and low self-efficacy can be an important predictor of relapse.

===== Understanding the psychodynamics of addiction =====

Although unmodified psychodynamic techniques play a limited direct role the treatment of most persons with addictions, psychodynamic  theory is useful in understanding the behaviour and family interactions that characterise the lives of people with addiction. Psychodynamic understanding is also useful in informing other therapeutic modalities such as CBT, MET, and group therapy. Comorbidity with various personality disorders is common in patients with addictions, with as many as 73% of addicts receiving a diagnosis of a co-occuring personality disorder, a prevalence rate several times that in psychiatric patients or persons without any psychiatric disorder. The most common personality disorders are borderline and antisocial personality disorders with the later particularly prevalent in individuals with alcohol use disorders (Verheul, 2001).

The self medication hypothesis advanced by Khantzian has been put forward to explain substance taking behaviour (Khantzian, 1997). According to these theory patient abuse substances to aid in the regulation of strong affects and painful emotions that the person may experience as overwhelming. Furthermore the good, euphoriant effects of substances are used as a substitute for deficient positive affirmation of the self by significant others in the person’s past, leading to low self esteem and deficits in self care.

During the early stages of precontemplation and contemplation where substance dependence may not be considered problematic by the client, primitive ego defences characterise the defensive style of the individual. These defences include denial of the addiction, splitting objects, family members and loved ones into all good or bad and projective identification whereby family members often unconsciously identify with distressing internal self-representations that have been projected onto others by the client and therefore either become the good, &quot;benevolent rescuer” or the &quot;punitive, bad family member.&quot;

A subjective sense of overwhelming powerlessness characterises persons with addictions. Together with the roles of benevolent rescuer and malevolent punisher, feelings of helplessness are often projected onto family members who unconsciously identify with this sense of loss of control and power and may defensively insist on unhelpful, inappropriately restrictive and even punitive measures. Important distinction therefore need to be made between setting limits (a desirable therapeutic measure) and punishment (undesirable and may worsen the addiction) as well as rescuing behaviour which will take away the effects of the substance use on the lies of the addicted individual and absolve them of responsibility and therefore further enable substance taking behaviour. 
In addition to more primitive defences, more mature, neurotic defences such as rationalization and intellectualization also characterise certain individuals with addictive disorders. With substance use disorders, particularly higher are functioning personalities with more mature and neurotic defensive personality structures.

=== Phenomenology ===

==== Symptoms and classification ====

The term addiction is not formally endorsed by the DSM-IV-TR or ICD-10 diagnostic classifications. A proposed revision to the DSM-IV-TR is that this term be reintroduced to differentiate benign dependence states on medication such as antidepressants and beta blockers from malignant and dysfunctional states that characterise drug and alcohol dependence. The term &quot;addiction&quot; is sometimes used interchangeably with the category described in diagnostic systems as substance dependence. The syndrome of substance dependence or addiction develops over time with repeated use of the substance and is accompanied by neuro-adaptive changes in the brain. The diagnosis of a substance use disorder is made clinically through patient and collateral interview and is based on a clustering together of various symptoms. The most used diagnostic systems used to diagnose addiction are the DSM-IV (American Psychiatric Association, 2005) and the ICD-10 (World Health Organization Geneva, 1992). See table X for the ICD-10 diagnostic criteria. These systems of disease classification sets out specified operational criteria that need to be present before a diagnosis can be made of drug abuse or dependence. Laboratory tests for substance use disorders can be used as confirmatory tool where the reliability of self report or collateral sources of information is questionable. 

Substance abuse (as it is referred to in the DSM-IV) or harmful use (as referred to in the ICD-10) consists of the presence of behaviour whilst under the influence of the effects of a substance that result in adverse social,  psychological, legal or physical consequences to the person involved. (See table 2 for ICD-10 Diagnostic Research Criteria) The ICD-10 differs from the DSM-IV in that abuse is termed &quot;harmful use&quot; and the criteria is less specific than the DSM-IV  and requires symptoms to be present for at least one month or repeatedly within a twelve month period. The DSM-IV-TR specifies certain criteria to be present relating to failure to fulfil social and occupational responsibilities, using substances in circumstances that are physically hazardous such as driving under the influence, negative consequences in interpersonal relationships and being frequently in trouble with the law as a result of substance use.

Substance dependence
|}

Substance dependence is a syndrome that is characterised by compulsive use of the substance and loss of control over substance using behaviour. It can be accompanied by the phenomenon of tolerance to the effects of the substance and substance specific withdrawal syndrome. Tolerance is characterised by the need for increased amounts of the substance to achieve the same desired effect or by the same dose not resulting in the desired effects. Withdrawal is characterised by a characteristic cluster of symptoms on cessation or reduction of the substance. If either tolerance or withdrawal is present ICD-10 and DSM-IV allow the subtype specification of physiological or physical dependence to be noted.  Substance dependent individuals also spent increasing durations of time engaging in substance taking behaviour and may give up other activities previously enjoyed in order to use the substance. Substance use continues compulsively despite adverse consequences to the person’s psychological or physical health. 

Table 3 sets out the key similarities and differences in ICD-10 and DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for substance dependence.

As noted the term &quot;addiction&quot; is often used interchangeably with substance dependence.  Addiction can be defined as a chronic relapsing medical disorder characterised by

a) loss of control over substance intake

b) and compulsive drug use associated

c) with the development of neuro-adaptations that result in the presence of

d) negative affective states when the substance is withdrawn.


'''Table 3. ICD-10 criteria for harmful use and dependence'''
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
| '''Harmful use:''' 

Mental or physical harm that may be associated with impaired judgement clearly caused by use of a substance within a 12 month period.

A) There must be clear evidence that the substance use was responsible for (or substantially contributed to) physical or psychological harm, including impaired judgement or dysfunctional behaviour.

B) The nature of the harm should be clearly identifiable (and specified).

C) The pattern of use has persisted for at least 1 month or has occurred repeatedly within a 12-month period.

D) The disorder does not meet criteria for any other mental or behavioural disorder related to the same drug in the same time period (except for acute intoxication).
|-
| '''Dependence syndrome:''' 

Three or more of the following manifestations should have occurred together for at least one month or, if persisting for periods of less than 1 month, should have occurred repeatedly within a 12 month period:

1) A strong desire or sense of compulsion to take the substance.

2) Impaired capacity to control substance taking behaviour in terms of its onset, termination, or levels of use, as evidenced by the substance being often taken in larger amount s over a longer period than intended, or by a persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to reduce or control substance use.

3) A physiological withdrawal state when substance use is reduced or ceased, as evidenced by the characteristic withdrawal syndrome for the substance or by use of the same (or closely related) substance with the intention of relieving or avoiding withdrawal symptoms.

4) Evidence of tolerance to the effects of the substance, such as that there is a need for significantly increased amounts of the substance to achieve intoxication or the desired effect, or a markedly diminished effect with continued use of the same amount of the substance.

5) Preoccupation with substance use, as manifested by important alternative pleasures or interests being given up or reduced because of substance use; or a great deal of time spent in activities necessary to obtain, take or recover from the effects of the substance.

6) Persistent use of substance despite clear evidence of harmful consequences, as evidenced by continued use when the individual is actually aware, or may be expected to be aware, of the nature and extent of harm.

Substance intoxication syndromes:

Syndromes of intoxication that are specific to the substance of abuse characterise use of each substance. Intoxication is usually defined as a substance specific syndrome that develops during or immediately after the ingestion of a substance and is characterised by maladaptive behavioural or psychological changes as a result of the effect of the substance on the central nervous system. Drugs of abuse can broadly be classified into &quot;uppers&quot; and &quot;downers&quot; and often persons addicted to drugs of abuse use a combination of both stimulant and depressant substances. Classified within the &quot;downer&quot; group are substances such as alcohol, cannabis, heroin and sedative hypnotics. Uppers consist of stimulants such as amphetamines, methamphetamines, and cocaine and club drugs such as ecstasy. A third designated class of substances include the hallucinogens and consist of substances such as LSD, mescaline and psylopsiben.
The specific features of each syndrome is determined by the  unique effects of each substance on the receptor systems of the brain as well as the half life of the substance which determines the duration of the substance related effects. 

Table 5 contains the details of various substance intoxication syndromes.

'''Table 5. Substance intoxication syndromes'''

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;

|-

==== Substance withdrawal syndromes ==== 

===== Alcohol withdrawal =====
Depending on the severity of the dependency syndrome alcohol withdrawal can range from mild and spontaneously resolving states to severe, potentially life threatening states. Mild withdrawal is characterised by gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, retching and vomiting, sympathetic hyperactivity as manifested by sweatiness, tachycardia, tremor and insomnia. In the majority of cases mild to moderate withdrawal states can be managed with outpatient detoxification regimes. Less than 5-10% of patients with alcohol dependence will develop complicated withdrawal also termed delirium tremens. Risk factors for complicated withdrawal include:

a) Previous history of complicated withdrawal
b) History of withdrawal seizures
c) Severe nutritional deficiencies (Vit B and thiamine)
d) Underlying medical complications such as pancreatitis, liver damage, peptic ulceration or oesophageal varices.

Delirium tremens typically develops 48 to 72 hours following cessation of drinking and is characterised by clouding of consciousness, severe tremor, visual and tactile hallucinations often in the form of small animal figures or insects, agitation and fidgetiness as well as nausea and vomiting.
Withdrawal seizures can also develop 48 to 72 hours following the last drink. Delirium tremens is considered a medical emergency and treatment in a facility geared towards the management of medical ill patients is essential.

Wernicke’s encephalopathy is a further potential complication of alcohol withdrawal. This condition can arise due to nutritional depletion of thiamine leading to a cluster of neurological symptoms on the background of a delirium. Physical signs of Wernicke’s encephalopathy include opthalmoplegia with cranial nerve III and VI palsies as well as ataxia. Only 10% of patients with Wernicke's will have the classical triad of confusion, ataxia, and nystagmus. Cranial nerve signs also only occur in about 25% of patients. Therefore, a diagnosis of Wernicke's should always be considered in patients’ who present with alterations in level of consciousness in the context of alcohol withdrawal. Untreated Wernicke's can result in death in up to 20%, and as many as 20% of patients go on to develop  neuronal damage in the diencaephalic brain regions such as the mediodorsal thalamus, periaquadauctal grey and mammilary bodies of the hypothalamus. Damage in these neuroanatomical regions can result in anterograde amnesia, characterised by the inability to learn new information. Also known as diencephalic amnesia, this form of memory loss is characteristic of Korsakoff’s psychosis, which is diagnosed according to the DSM-IV as &quot;Alcohol induced persistent amnestic disorder.&quot;

===== Opioid withdrawal =====

Discontinuation of heroin and other opioid derivatives is characterised by a pronounced withdrawal syndrome. Although highly unpleasant, unlike alcohol withdrawal heroin withdrawal is rarely associated with life threatening complications. The syndrome of withdrawal is characterised by severe dysphoria, craving for heroin, agitation, yawning, diaphoresis, lacrimation, piloerection (goose bumps) pupil dilatation, muscle and abdominal cramps as well as diarrhoea. For drugs such as heroin with a short duration of action, the acute withdrawal syndrome usually reaches a peak after 48 to 72 hours and subsides after 7 to 10 days.
 
'''Stimulant withdrawal (cocaine and methamphetamine)'''

Characteristic withdrawal syndromes have been described for stimulants such as cocaine, amphetamines and methamphetamine. The acute withdrawal syndrome usually has its onset within 12 to 24 hours of the last dose. The acute withdrawal syndrome is sometimes described as a &quot;crash&quot; after the period of a high. This syndrome is characterised by feelings of intense sadness and depression, severe fatigue and a tendency to oversleep and eat. The acute withdrawal syndrome typically subsides after 10 to 14 days. This is followed by a period from week 2 to week 8 post cessation that is characterised by renewed energy and a newfound confidence in abstinence. This period has also been described as the &quot;honeymoon period&quot; where persons typically feel confident that they are able to quit using stimulants on their own. In the treatment setting this can often be characterised by treatment drop-outs. By 2 months post drug cessation a third phase sometimes described as &quot;the wall&quot; is described. This phase is characterised by severe fatigue and a loss of the ability to experience pleasure (anhedonia). Usual routes to experience pleasure are often drug associated. Recovering addicts often experiences this stage is profoundly isolating.

===== Comorbidity =====

Rates of substance use disorder have been reported as high as 75% in the treatment settings for patients with severe mental illness such as schizophrenia. The odds ratio for bipolar mood disorder in patients with substance use disorders in the NCS study has been reported to be as high as 6.8.  Similarly major depressive disorder occurs in up to half of treatment seeking individuals with substance use disorders whereas the rates of substance use disorders in persons diagnosed with major depression is 2-3 times that of the general population (Kessler et al. 1996). Patients with anxiety disorders in particular panic disorder OCD and PTSD are also more likely to have a co-occurring substance or alcohol use disorder than persons from the general population. Whereas women with  alcohol dependence are more likely to have co-occurring anxiety and mood disorders as compared to men, men are in turn more likely to have co-morbid ADHD, conduct disorder and antisocial personality disorder (Brady and Randall, 1999).

===== Clinical assessment =====

''Substance use history and mental status examination:''

In the routine clinical setting a thorough substance history should include the following:

a)  The various different substances used including the substance of preference.

b) Age at first use, the frequency and amount of use over time.

c) Date of last use.

d)  The amount of money spent on substances.

e) The amount of time spent daily on drug taking.

f) Attempts at trying to quit, as well as the duration of abstinent periods.

g) History of medical/physical complications including overdoses. This includes a history of risk taking behaviour placing the individual at risk of contracting transmissible conditions such as HIV or Hepatitis B.

h) An assessment of the social and relationship consequences of the substance.

i) Screening for mood, anxiety, psychotic and other psychological symptoms that may co-occur with drug use.

j) Family history of drug dependence and abuse.

k) A thorough forensic history and history of any legal involvement.

l) A detailed personal history and quality of relationship with important attachment figures as well as important developmental tasks.

'''Diagnostic and screening instruments:'''

The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test or AUDIT (Saunders et al. 1993) is a brief (2-3 minute) 10-item screening tool of particular use in primary care, general practice settings. It includes both a self report and clinician administered version that rate items relating to different aspects of drinking patterns, harmful use and dependency on a 4-point Likert-type scale (&quot;never&quot; to &quot;daily or almost daily&quot;). A total score of more than 8 on this scale is indicative of alcohol related problems that calls for further in-depth diagnostic interviewing. Lower cut-off scores than 8 are suggested for female populations.  This instrument has demonstrated good sensitivities varying from 0.76 to 0.92 and specificities from 0.70 to 0.92 in various populations including psychiatric patients with severe mental illness and primary are patients (Reinert and Allen, 2002). 

The Michigan Alcoholism Screening Test (MAST)(Selzer, 1971) is a slightly more comprehensive instrument that in addition to current alcohol use also assesses use over the subject’s entire lifetime. This self report screening instrument consists of 25 yes or no items and is available in two shorter 13 and 10 item versions. It is suitable for a variety of clinical and non-clinical settings. In addition to assessing alcohol use it also enquires about a number of related consequences of alcohol abuse such as medical, psychological, psychiatric, social, interpersonal, and occupational complications (Selzer, 2008). Despite its strength as regards comprehensiveness it is less likely to be suitable in busy time pressured clinical settings.

The Drug Abuse Screening Test (DAST)(Skinner, 1982) is a self report instrument based on the MAST but specific to illicit drug use. Similar to the MAST it assesses the presence of a variety of social, occupational, interpersonal and medical consequences relating to illicit non-medical drug use. Depending on the cut-off scores, the 20, 28 and 10- item versions of the DAST have a high sensitivity and specificity values for the detection of DSM-III-R diagnoses of substance use disorders diagnoses across a variety of settings including in patients with severe mental illness.  This instrument is suitable for patients who are non-treatment seeking and assesses overall consequences of all, including polydrug use and does not specify which drugs are more likely to cause particular consequences. The test requires less than 10 minutes completing and scoring. 

A brief and clinically useful tool to identify alcohol related disorders is the CAGE questionnaire (Ewing, 1984). This very brief instrument takes less than 1 minute to complete and consists of 4 brief questions as contained in the acronym &quot;CAGE.&quot;  Cut down- refers to the need to cut down or decrease drinking; Annoyed refers to feeling annoyed at criticism from others about drinking too much; Guilt refers to feeling bad or guilty about drinking; Eye opener refers to the need to have a drink first thing in the morning. The total score of the test is out of 4. A cut-off of 1 out of 4 has a high sensitivity varying from 0.86 to 0,90 but lower specificity (and hence higher false positive rate) ranging from as low as 0.52 to 0.53 to detect alcohol use disorders of clinical threshold (abuse and dependence as identified by DSM or ICD-10 criteria). Consequently some have recommended that a cut-off of ?2/4 be used to identify abuse or dependence as a result of the higher specificity and hence lower false positive rates. Clinicians also need to be aware of its limitations in certain populations as studies have shown to be a less accurate instrument in white women, pregnant women and college students who tend to binge drink (Dhalla and Kopec, 2007).

A similar test to the CAGE is the TWEAK test (Russell et al. 1991). This brief 5-item self or clinician rated instrument has been designed for and specifically validated in samples of females including pregnant women. The name of the scale is an acronym derived from the letters that represent the main constructs that are measured. In the TWEAK-HOLD version designed for the binge drinking population Tolerance refers to the amount of drinks a person can hold.  In the TWEAK-HIGH version the question is phrased &quot;does it take three or more drinks to feel high?&quot; Worried refers to complaints or worries expressed by friends or close relatives about the patients drinking in the past year.  Eye-openers refer to having a drink first thing in the morning. Amnesia refers to reports from others of blackouts where events or conversations are forgotten while drinking. The K refers to cut down or the need to cut down on drinking.  The first two items are allocated a score of 2 if rate positive and the remaining items are all scored one to give a total for the entire test of 7 points. Cut–off scores of 2 or higher have been demonstrated to be associated with harmful drinking in pregnancy complicated by significantly lower birth weight, head circumference, APGAR scores and cognitive deficits by age 6 years. Cut-offs of 3 or higher are characterised by good levels of sensitivity and specificity to detect alcohol dependence in women in general population and emergency room settings (Russell et al. 2008). The TWEAK performs less well in primary care settings to detect harmful drinking where the AUDIT may be a more valid test (Bush et al. 2003).

In addition to non-structured clinical diagnostic classification systems such as the ICD-10 and DSM-IV, more structured instruments exist to aid in the diagnosis of substance abuse and dependence. The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV or  SCID-I (First et al. 1994) is a semi-structured clinical interview designed to generate categorical diagnoses based on DSM-IV diagnostic criteria. This interview is available in a clinician and research version and takes on average 90-120 minutes to complete depending on patient factors and clinician experience. Formal training is required and experience and background in clinical work is advantageous although not essential to conduct this interview successfully. The instrument consist of several modules that assess various mental  disorders in addition to substance use disorders and depending on the needs and research designs or clinical need these modules included or excluded with the module assessing substance use disorders.

The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI)(Sheehan et al. 1998) is a briefer diagnostic instrument in comparison to the SCID-I and that generates a wide variety of diagnoses including substance and alcohol use disorder categories. The MINI is available in variety of languages including English and takes approximately 15 to 20 minutes to complete. Three versions the MINI, MINI-plus and MINI kid are available. The MINI evaluates the presence of 17 axis I disorders, with 8 additional disorders included in the MINI plus. The interviewers are required to have some training in its administration (2-3 hour training) with non clinicians requiring more extensive training. The MINI questions are structured to be delivered verbatim and have a yes no outcome. This instrument has been designed to maximise sensitivity introducing the possibility of false positives and therefore necessitating more in depth probing by clinicians in cases where positive predictive values need to be maximized (the likelihood that a positive screen represents a true positive).
The most widely used scale in the measurement of addiction severity within addiction treatment settings is the addiction severity index or ASI (McLellan et al. 1992). This multidimensional instrument measures the consequences of drug use across 7 domains. These domains include the assessment of drug and alcohol use, medical consequences, psychiatric complications, impacts on employment and support, family history, family and social support and legal status. This scale requires training in its administration and takes 40-60 minutes to complete. Severity can be calculated by calculating composite scores and by means of clinician rated severity scale for each measured domain. It can be used to track treatment progress over time. Its limitations include low test retest reliability in some populations such as in dual disorder, severely mentally ill and homeless individuals, and lower inter-rater reliabilities among interviewers with less training. The calculation of composite scores  has been recommended in follow up studies as opposed clinician rated severity scales (McLellan et al. 2008; Makela, 2004). 

'''Laboratory tests:'''

In the clinical setting it is important to realize that laboratory tests merely detect recent use of substances and are not diagnostic of abuse, dependence or addiction. During the diagnostic work-up laboratory tests should only be used when the reliability of the patient’s account of use is in doubt. In turn routine random, unannounced testing does from an important part in treatment settings, where rewards or limit setting may be contingent upon urine test results. 

Laboratory tests are routinely based on urine samples but hair, blood, saliva and sweat samples can also be used. The availability of inexpensive on-site, point of collection rapid urine drug tests has made routine testing much more practically useful to many treatment facilities. Urine immune-essay tests typically a have shorter detection range, varying from 1-3 days with all the typical drugs of abuse usually eliminated from the body within 48 hours. One exception is in chronic heavy users of cannabis where detection in the urine can be present for up to 1 month.  Hair analysis by means of gas chromatography, mass spectrometry (GCMS) has a much wider detection range vary from 7-90+ days. Hair analysis, although prone to false positives in cases of passive ingestion of substances, can also quantify severity of drug use as the length of hair containing drugs of abuse correlates with frequency of use. In addition hair testing may be useful in opiate addicts in patients claiming false positive urine test due to poppy seeds, or in patients who are cheating or evading urine drug testing (Dolan et al. 2004).

Blood tests are also useful in the treatment of patients with alcohol dependence. The most sensitive and specific tests are serum gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT) and carbohydrate deficient transferrin (CDT). Although the most sensitive of markers, GGT is also influenced by age and obesity and can be false positive as a result of a number of chronic illnesses such as liver disease and medication treatments .CDT, although less reliable in female patients, is specific to high levels of alcohol intake and when done in combination with GGT increases sensitivity and specificity. These markers will remain positive for up to 2-3 weeks following cessation of alcohol use.  Mean corpuscular volume of red blood cells (MCV) is another sensitive marker, particularly in female patients and remains positive for up to 2-4 months following the start of abstinence (Niemela, 2007).

=== Treatment === 

==== Treatment setting and level of care ==== 

The consequences of addictive disorders span across a wide array of potential biopsychosocial complications. Consequently the treatment needs of individuals with addictions span across medical, psychiatric, psychological, legal, social occupational and financial domains. Due to this multidimensional nature of treatment needs many health providers are likely to be involved in the treatment process. Treatment providers can include medical services, specialized psychiatric services, social services, the criminal justice system and psychological services. As the treatment needs of patients are highly heterogeneous, treatment intensity and treatment modalities needs to be matched to the individual patients needs. This requires frequent and effective interaction between various role players in the addiction treatment process. A standardized intake assessment procedure that determines the level and intensity of the required treatment needed is essential to ensure integrated and appropriate treatments. Research has demonstrated that patients who are not appropriately matched in terms of the intensity of treatment are more likely to drop out of treatment and relapse earlier (Deck et al. 2003). One such standardized assessment procedure is the revised version of Patient Placement Criteria (PPC-2R) for the treatment of substance related conditions endorsed by the American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM)(Mee-Lee et al. 2001). This system allows for placement in five main levels of care with further specifications in the revised system. These levels consist of an early intervention level (level 0.5), outpatient based care (level I), intensive outpatient or partial hospitalization care (level II), inpatients residential care (level III) and medically managed inpatients services (level IV). In addition the type of care is further determined along six dimensions: acute intoxication or withdrawal potential; biomedical conditions or complications; emotional, behavioural or cognitive conditions and complications; readiness to change; relapse, continued use or continued problem potential and recovery environment.

==== Stages of treatment ==== 

Treatment can be conceptualized in phases according to the stage of readiness of a client. However, these stages should not be regarded as rigid as therapeutic interventions may be applicable across different stages of motivation. Both psychological and pharmacological interventions differ across the various stages of change. 

'''a) Precontemplative, contemplative and early determination stages:''' 

''Psychological interventions''

During the early phases the dependence syndrome, denial of the fact that drug use is problematic may be the rule rather than the exception. Interventions such as motivational enhancement therapy and its related interventions such as brief interventions are particularly effective in patients who display high levels of resistance to change and manifest denial of drug and alcohol problems. During this early phase two techniques are useful to motivate patients towards recovery:

Brief motivational interventions:

This is a suitable intervention for primary care and emergency room practitioners who often can only spend a few minutes with a client. Key principles in counselling patients with addiction problems are non-judgementality and empathy.  Described by Bien at.al (Bien et al. 1993), it is summarized by the mnemonic &quot;FRAMES&quot; which entail the following:

F- Feedback: The practitioner provides feedback regarding the negative effects the substance has had on the physical health, interpersonal relations and occupational roles of the client.

R- Responsibility: It is emphasised that the responsibility to stop using remains that of the client.

A-Advice- Advice is given that the cause for many problems relate to drug use and that abstinence or cutting down is advised. Possible options that will facilitate recovery are explored and practical advice is given.

M-Menu for change: Interest is expressed to aid the recovery of the patient and the various options and pathways are discussed such as referral to specialist centres for recovery.

E-Empathy: The counselling style is characterised by a warm and caring style that is empathic and non-judgemental.

S-Self-Efficacy: Hope is instilled by encouragement and emphasising that the patient has the ability and power to change.

Motivational Enhancement Therapy (MET):

This is a counselling intervention that requires a greater deal of skill and training than brief interventions. It is primarily a client-centred approach that emphasizes a non-judgemental empathic style of interviewing and communicating. In this respect it differs from more confrontational techniques such as Minnesota model and 12-step facilitation, although should not be seen as incompatible with such techniques but in fact complementary. The role of the therapist in addiction treatments may vary according to the stage of readiness for change, treatment setting and context and therapists need to be comfortable in adapting this role within the network of role players in addiction treatment that may include the therapist but also family members, employers and other professionals. Motivational enhancement therapies are aimed particularly at persons with high levels of denial and resistance to change. Although client centred, motivational enhancement therapy is not passive but in fact subtly directive in its selective attention to particulars in the clients’ communication. Practitioners trained within the medical model often find this approach difficult in the beginning as medical model interviewing often requires more closed ended questioning and more active information gathering exercises. 

The following are principles of this technique:

a) Expressing empathy

b) Avoiding argumentation

c) Developing discrepancy

d) Rolling with resistance

e) Enhancing self-efficacy

The aim of this interview technique or communication style is to reflect empathically on the consequences drug taking behaviour has had on the person’s life and to develop and point out discrepancies between what the person’s life is currently like and what the person  aspires to be like. The ultimate goal is to increase the client’s ambivalence and develop a sense of discrepancy and cognitive dissonance that in turn will drive motivation to change. A cardinal principal in this communication style is the avoidance of argumentation (i.e., when patients deny or rationalize their drug taking behaviour). Instead resistance to change is met with reflective and empathic listening. Various techniques of reflective listening are used to mobilise initial resistance and thus transforming resistance via self reflection into motivation to change. Self motivating statements are elicited and the therapist empathises with both the part of the client that wants to change and the resistant part, whilst at the same time pointing out discrepancies in the between the clients goals and actual behaviour. It is important to instil hope as self efficacy or the confidence the client has in their ability to effect change, is an important factor in successful recovery.

'''b) Precontemplative, contemplative and early determination stages:''' 

''Pharmacotherapy''

The cessation of drug use is accompanied by substance specific withdrawal syndromes. These syndromes typically consist of highly unpleasant symptoms. For certain substances such as alcohol, benzodiazepines, sedative-hypnotics and opioids these syndrome are often more pronounced and requires pharmacological treatment within an inpatient or, in less severe cases, outpatient settings. Most withdrawal regimes consists of substituting the drug of abuse with a agonist medications that act on similar receptor sites as the drug of abuse but that does not have the typical euphoriant side effect profiles.
Although several withdrawal regimes exist it is important to measure the presence of a withdrawal syndrome objectively with rating scales and to titrate the dosages of the replacement therapy according to the symptom severity of the withdrawal.

Alcohol withdrawal: Uncomplicated, mild alcohol withdrawal:

Most patients (75-85%) will only experience milder forms of alcohol withdrawal. Symptoms typically consist of nausea, tremors, sweating and tachycardia. Uncomplicated, mild withdrawal can be managed without medication and may only require as needed benzodiazepine treatment on an outpatient basis. Medication should be limited to 5-7 day course of decreasing dose regime. Long acting benzodiazepines are preferable such as chlordiazepoxide or diazepam, with shorter acting agents such as lorazepam and oxazepam reserved only for patients with impaired liver functions. Thiamine replacement therapy should always accompany withdrawal treatment.

Alcohol withdrawal: moderate, severe and complicated alcohol withdrawal.
Of all patients with alcohol dependence as many as 25 % of patients may experience symptomatically severe withdrawal syndromes, whilst 5-15% of all alcohol dependence patients may experience complicated withdrawal syndromes. A past history of withdrawal seizures, physical illness such as liver, cardiac or pancreatic disease, hallucinations and psychotic symptoms or delirium tremens should be regarded as indicators of potential complicated withdrawal. Complicated alcohol withdrawal carries a high mortality, is potentially dangerous and is best managed in an inpatient setting equipped and staffed to monitor patients physically on a regular basis. Three approaches on the initiation of benzodiazepine withdrawal regimes are described in the literature (Saitz and O'Malley, 1997). The frontloading approach involves starting the patient on high initial doses (20mg of diazepam) repeated every 2 hours in order to prevent withdrawal. A second approach, the fixed dose regime, involves the prescription of 6hly benzodiazepines (usually 20mg of diazepam), with as needed doses for breakthrough symptoms in between. Alternatively a third approach the &quot;symptom trigger&quot; method involves the regular monitoring for withdrawal symptoms and the administration of benzodiazepines when clinical symptoms reach a threshold above 8 on the CIWA-Ar scale. There is some evidence that initiation of pharmacotherapy after the emergence of symptoms (symptoms trigger approach) produces superior (yet non-significant) outcomes in terms of symptoms relief (Ntais et al.  2005). Practitioners should however be flexible and treat patients according to the severity of symptoms. Under or over treatment with benzodiazepines should be avoided. Intravenous or intramuscular thiamine replacement with additional vitamin B complex should always accompany withdrawal prior to administration of glucose as the administration of glucose prior to thiamine can precipitate a rapid depletion of neuronal thiamine and lead to Wernicke’s encephalopathy. Intravenous thiamine administration should be monitored due to the rare potential complication of an anaphylactic reaction. Antipsychotics should be avoided during the acute withdrawal stage as they can precipitate withdrawal seizures by lowering seizure threshold. In certain circumstances such as delirium tremens antipsychotics can be used cautiously for severe agitation and hallucinations, but care should be taken not to use lower potency agents as these are more likely to precipitate seizures.

Opiate withdrawal and detoxification:

Cessation of opioid use in individuals dependent on opioids is characterised by a highly unpleasant withdrawal  syndrome consisting of anxiety, increased sweating,  dysphoria, restlessness, craving, irritability, pupillary dilation, lacrimation, rhinorhea, muscle cramps, abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, raised blood pressure and increased heart rate (American Psychiatric Association, 2005). Whereas less severe withdrawal syndromes can occur with opioids other than heroin, the following discussion will focus on the detoxification of heroin. In contrast to alcohol withdrawal that represents a condition with considerable morbidity and mortality, opioid withdrawal is rarely ever dangerous. The acute syndrome reaches a peak 48-72 hours after the last dose of opioids and resolves within 7 to 10 days (Mattick and Hall, 1996)
The aim of medically assisted opoid withdrawal should always be to prepare patients for ongoing inpatient or outpatient psychosocial rehabilitation. Detoxification of opioids without concomitant rehabilitation serves little purpose. Medications used in the detoxification of opioids are full or partial agonists at the mu opioid receptor site. The most commonly used medications with a good evidence base to support its efficacy are buprenorphine and methadone. Whereas buprenorphine is a partial agonist at mu opioid receptor sites, methadone acts as a full agonist. Both these drugs are long acting and ameliorate the unpleasant withdrawal symptoms associated with cessation of opioid use. Buphrenorphine has a long duration of action making once or even alternate day dosing possible. In contrast to methadone buprenorphine is less sedative and interferes little with QTc interval and cardiac conduction at higher doses. This property together with its ceiling effect at higher dosages (due to lower intrinsic activity as a result of its partial agonist activities) renders this drug safer in overdose and makes it an attractive medication for outpatient, office based detoxification treatment. As buprenorphine can precipitate withdrawal due to its partial agonist actions it is important that this medication be initiated only after symptoms of withdrawal have manifested, usually 12 hours after the last use of heroin.

'''c) Determination, action and maintenance stages:''' 

''Psychological interventions''

Twelve-Step Facilitation (TSF):

Twelve step facilitation is a manual based therapy that is aimed at facilitating and encouraging the involvement of patients into community based self-help twelve step programmes such as alcoholics anonymous and narcotics anonymous.  Twelve-step facilitation can be delivered in a time limited manner on a weekly basis over 12 weeks or, as in many cases as an ongoing intervention over months to years. The twelve step facilitator therapists are required to have an excellent working knowledge of the twelve step manual as well as the principles that underlie twelve step programs such as AA and NA. This entails reading the AA handbook, twelve step manuals as well as attending several 12 step meetings as a professional guest (in cases where  therapists are not recovering addicts). Therapists function as educators that introduce patients to the 12 step principles, elucidating the structure and functioning of 12-step meetings, the importance of regular attendance and the role of sponsors. Therapists should be actively encouraging participation in 12-step meetings and explore patient’s views of 12-step principles such as the pertinent role of spirituality and the notion of a higher power. Central to twelve step facilitation is the notion that addiction is a disease with a physical, emotional as well as spiritual component. In the 12-step model cure from addiction is not viewed as a realistic option but rather management of an ongoing chronic illness, with abstinence from drugs and alcohol viewed as a central treatment goal. Surrender to a higher power, which may be symbolized by treatment principles, structures and philosophy or more spiritual notions such as God, is viewed as a critical step in treatment. Patients are required to keep a diary of their attendance of meetings and the issues discussed at meetings. In turn therapists confront patients in a non-judgemental manner should there be signs of resistance or denial of drug and alcohol related problems. Denial may manifest in non attendance of meetings and rationalizations as to why attendance is not possible. It is important for therapist to explore patient’s experiences of 12-step meetings in order to identify each patient’s unique views and beliefs about twelve step programs. This will enable therapists to explore problems relating to denial or irrational or erroneous beliefs about 12-step programs and make suggestions as to how this can be addressed. Twelve step programs have been found to be as effective as cognitive behavioural and motivational enhancement treatments in reducing alcohol intake at 1 and 3 years follow up in the large multisite randomized controlled trial, project MATCH. In turn twelve step facilitation has shown somewhat superior outcomes in promoting abstinence and higher AA and NA attendance rates in aftercare settings (Humphreys, 1999).  

CBT for relapse prevention:

Cognitive behavioural therapy is based on the principles of learning theory and has as one of its main targets to promote cognitions and behaviour that disrupt the cycle of learned drug taking behaviours that is encoded via the mechanisms of classical and operant conditioning. It is a highly structured; time limited (12-24 weeks) therapy in characterised by a collaborative client therapist relationship. It forms part of the active treatment and maintenance phases of the treatment cycle, with the principal objective being that of acquiring the necessary skills to prevent relapses into drug taking behaviour. Sessions are highly structured in that time is devoted first on feedback and homework assignments, then on didactic discussion of skills and behaviour followed by setting goals and targets. An important tool in therapy is functional analysis of behaviour that is associated with drug taking. In this analysis internal (emotional and cognitive) and external (environmental) triggers are identified and skills and techniques are then acquired on how to manage and deal with these triggers. Aspects of the functional analysis include identifying thoughts and feelings associated with internal triggers such as craving as well as environmental triggers that may drive dysfunctional beliefs about drug use. Skills training involve the learning of techniques to cope with craving and social pressures and may include distraction techniques and assertiveness training. CBT has been demonstrated to be effective as a relapse prevention treatment across a wide variety of substance use disorders including cocaine, alcohol, cannabis, nicotine and heroin addictions (Magill and Ray, 2009). CBT has also been shown to offer additional benefits for patients with co-occurring psychiatric disorders such as depression. Findings from Project Match, a large multicentre randomised controlled trail in patients with alcohol dependence investigating the efficacy of twelve step facilitation (TSF), cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) and motivational enhancement therapy (MET), demonstrated CBT to be efficacious in reducing drinking (Project MATCH Research Group, 1998a; Project MATCH Research Group, 1998b). An important effect demonstrated by earlier studies of CBT for drug addiction is the lingering effect after therapy has been terminated (Carroll et al. 1994). This effect is particularly useful when CBT is used in combination with behavioural treatments such as contingency management that often show potent effects early on in treatment, which subsides wanes as treatment is discontinued (Rawson et al. 2006). In addition recent research has demonstrated superior outcomes for CBT in comparison to interpersonal therapy (IPT) in patient with cocaine dependence (Carroll et al. 2004). An important potential active ingredient for CBT efficacy has been shown to be high compliance with additional session and homework assignments. Thus patients who comply more diligently with home work assignments have been shown to have superior outcome in CBT (Carroll et al.  1994; Carroll et al.  2005). Although treatment programs may be eager to roll out manualized forms of CBT treatment, therapist training associated with active session to session direct personal supervision has been demonstrated to be associated significantly higher fidelity to CBT criterion standards.

Combined psychosocial modalities: matrix model

The matrix model of treatment is an intensive, manualized, outpatient based treatment model for addictive disorders. Although it originated during the cocaine epidemic during the 1980’s in the United States, it has been developed as a treatment for methamphetamine addiction as well as other non-stimulant addictions (Obert et al. 2000; Rawson et al. 1995). This eclectic treatment model incorporates various evidence based psychosocial interventions such as motivational enhancement therapy, 12-step facilitation, cognitive behavioural therapy, contingency management and family therapy. A typical treatment program consists of a highly structured 4 month, 3 times per week intensive outpatient based program followed by somewhat less structured 8 month continuing care program. Treatments are structured according to the stage of recovery and include early recovery groups in the early recovery stages and relapse prevention and social support groups in the more advanced stages. Information about the nature of addiction and the recovery process is also given early on in the treatment and a family psycho-education group forms a critical part of treatment. Early recovery groups focus on ways patients can attain abstinence early on in treatment. Relapse prevention groups focus on identifying external and internal triggers for relapse as well as methods to cope with such triggers. Social support groups are aimed at helping clients develop of social and interpersonal supports that are non drug users. An important part of the program involves facilitation into 12-step self help groups. Individual counselling and support is also received in parallel with group therapy. In contrast to more confrontational inpatient based models, the therapist style is non-confrontational and firmly based on motivational interviewing principles. Therapists are however not passive and actively pursue non-compliant patients in a non-confrontational caring manner. Weekly urine tests are conducted and negative tests are positively re-inforced with rewards. Some programs also make use of structures contingency management schedules of reward (Obert et al.  2002).

'''d) Determination, action and maintenance stages:''' 

''Pharmacological interventions''

Alcohol dependence

Disulfiram:

Disulfiram is an irreversible inhibitor of the enzyme acetaldehyde dehydrogenase. Administration of disulfiram causes an accumulation of acetaldehyde, a toxic breakdown product of in the metabolism of alcohol. This results in a highly unpleasant reaction characterised by facial flushing, severe nausea and vomiting, hypotension and headaches. This reaction is thought to be a powerful negative reinforcer promoting abstinence. Studies have however shown that the efficacy of this medication is highly dependent on compliance with this drug, which can be very poor (Fuller et al. 1986). More recent research has shown that supervised consumption of disulfiram by family members of addicts has improved outcomes (De Sousa et al. 2008; Laaksonen et al. 2008). Therapy with disulfiram has to be initiated cautiously as this medication is contraindicated in alcohol dependent individuals with liver, kidney and cardiac conditions. Disulfiram treatment has also been reported to be associated with the development of psychotic symptoms. 

Naltrexone:

One postulated mechanism whereby alcohol produces its reinforcing effects is via the increased release of endogenous opioids. Endogenous opioid  secretion  increases the release of dopamine directly via stimulation of the nucleus accumbens or indirectly by inhibiting the tonically inhibitory effect of GABA neurons on dopamine neurons within the nucleus accumbens (Gianoulakis, 2009). Evidence from randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses has supported the use of naltrexone a mu opiate receptor antagonist in the maintenance treatment of alcohol dependence (Srisurapanont and Jarusuraisin, 2005). There is also evidence that naltrexone can help to prevent a lapse into drinking from turning into a full blown relapse.  As an antagonist of mu opiate receptors naltrexone blocks the stimulation of opiate receptors by beta endorphins which in turn is postulated to result in less dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens. Via this mechanism the positive reinforcing euphoriant effects of alcohol is attenuated and type I craving is diminished.   Naltrexone is well tolerated in the majority of patients. Contraindications include abnormalities in liver function and the comorbid presence of opioid dependence. Monitoring requirements include baseline and follow up liver enzymes. Concurrent use of medications that are potentially hepatotoxic should be avoided (such as disulfiram). Use with opioid containing analgesics is contraindicated. Naltrexone is also available in long acting depot formulation (XR-NLX) for once monthly administration.

Acamprosate:

Acamprosate is related to the amino acid taurine. Acamprosate modulates hyperglutamatergic states characteristic of acute and protracted alcohol withdrawal via its inhibitory action on excitatory NMDA receptors and facilatatory action on GABA function. The prolonged withdrawal stage is characterised by increased excitatatory glutamatergic neurotransmission due to  NMDA receptor upregulation that takes place during the intoxication phases in the presence of high alchohol levels. Via its inhibitory action on NMDA receptors acamprosate curbs negative or   type 2 craving associated with unpleasant withdrawal symptoms. Studies have demonstrated that acamprosate is effective in preventing relapse into heavy drinking. This effect may be more pronounced in patients who are more motivated to remain abstinent (Johnson et al. 2007; Johnson et al. 2008).

Topiramate:

Other candidate drugs in the maintenance treatment of alcohol dependence include topiramate, a drug that is thought to both enhance GABAA inhibitory activity over the positive reinforcing effects of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens (type I craving) and at the same time attenuates glutamatergic hyperactivity via its action on AMPA glutamatergic receptors (type 2 craving). In turn it is thought that the decrease of glutamatergic activity results in decreased dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens (Kenna et al.  2009). Two randomized controlled trials, one of which is a multisite trial, have demonstrated the superior efficacy of topiramate over placebo on a number of outcome measures such as time abstinent from drinking, level of self reported drinking, compulsive cravings for alcohol and improved physical and psychosocial wellbeing (Johnson et al.  2003; Johnson et al.  2007; Johnson et al.  2008).

Baclofen:

In recent years baclofen, a GABAB receptor agonist, has received increasing attention in pharmacotherapy trials for alcohol maintenance (Addolorato et al. 2009). Due to the fact that it is not metabolized in the liver makes it an attractive alternative for patients with alcohol dependence and existing liver damage (Garbutt and Flannery, 2007). Three randomized controlled trails have been conducted to date with two showing significant superiority over placebo in reducing alcohol intake and prolonging periods of abstinence from alcohol (Addolorato et al. 2002; Addolorato et al. 2007; Garbutt et al.  2007). A third trial conducted in the US failed to replicate these findings and further research is necessary to clarify the role of baclofen in the treatment of alcohol dependence (Garbutt et al. 2007).

Opioid dependence:

Prospective cohort studies have demonstrated that long term abstinence based community residential rehabilitation programmes can be successful for opioid dependent patients with up to 50% achieving abstinence at 5 year follow up (Gossop et al. 2003). Nevertheless a subgroup of patients with severe heroin dependence is unlikely to succeed with traditional abstinence based approaches and may require harm reduction approaches that consist of opioid substitution maintenance prescribing. The primary aim of substitution maintenance treatment is to reduce the use of illicit heroin and in turn the associated morbidity and criminal behaviours that often accompany heroin addiction. Table 6 summarizes some of the goals of opioid substitution therapies.

'''Table 6. Aims of opioid substitution prescribing'''

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
| 1. Reduction of illicit heroin use
|-
| 2. Reduction of criminal behaviour accompanying heroin use
|-
| 3. Reduction of morbidity associated with heroin use such as risky sexual practices and needle sharing (HIV, Hepatitis B and C transmission)
|-
| 4. Reduction of mortality associated with heroin overdoses
|-
| 5. Creation of a environment conducive to addressing social and occupational problems
|}

During substitution maintenance treatment patients are given the opportunity to reconstruct their lives and improve their psychosocial and occupational functioning in order to obtain greater stability. Maintenance treatments can be time limited over 12 to 24 months but may be a treatment option over many years.

The main medications used in substitution maintenance programs are methadone, a full mu receptor agonist and buprenorphine, a partial mu receptor agonist. Research has shown that methadone, in particular high dose methadone maintenance is somewhat superior to buprenorphine in reducing illicit heroin use. Nevertheless as the side effect profile of methadone includes mild oversedation and somnolence; both agents are recommended as treatment options in maintenance programs. Substitution maintenance programs have to adhere to certain standards to be effective. These standards include staff trained and experienced in prescribing substitution medications. Daily supervised consumption including a full pre-treatment medical workup (including HIV and Hepatitis testing) is mandatory for all patients initiated on substitution therapies. Daily supervised consumption is less critical in patients treated with burprenorphine or buprenorphine-naloxone combinations, however still recommended in the early stabilization phase of treatment. Random urine tests testing for heroin is also mandatory. A pre-treatment contract between the treating doctor and patients stipulating the consequences of a positive urine tests is also important. 
One particular clinical problem is the injection of substitution medicines to obtain a high or the selling of these medicines (called diversion) to raise funds for illicit heroin. In some countries electronic methadone prescription monitoring services have been launched to prevent patients from obtaining prescriptions more than once at different pharmacies. Another strategy to counter diversion and injection practice is the use of Suboxone, a combination of buprenorphine (opioid agonist) and naloxone (opioid antagonist) in a 4:1 ratio. When taken sublingually the bioavailability of naloxone is not sufficient to lead to any clinical effect. However in the context of diversion practices and intravenous abuse of substitution medicines, naloxone has a high bioavailability leading to the induction of unpleasant withdrawal reactions and therefore acts as a discouragement for injection practices.

Patients on maintenance treatment may prematurely want to discontinue their opioid substitution medication in order to become drug free and independent. Each individual case needs to be carefully reviewed in terms of the particular clients’ strengths and ongoing risks of relapse. Factors that can contribute to relapse such as instability in interpersonal, occupational or living circumstances need to borne in mind when considering suitability to wean patients from opioid substitution medications.

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;

=== Usage ===
Insert as an edit notice for a user page as &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{editnotice userpage}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.

===To insert===
To insert, go to your userpage. Click the 'edit this page' button at the top. When the editing screen comes up, there should be some small words on top of the edit box that read 'Page notice'. Click on this, then create a page called User:YourName/Editnotice. Paste &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{editnotice userpage}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; into it and save. Then, whenever somebody clicks to edit your userpage, there should be a box reminding them.

This is the {{tl|editnotice pagename}} meta-template.

It returns the full pagename for the editnotice of the current page. It works both for subject pages such as books and for their discussion pages.

=== Usage ===
This template takes no parameters and automatically outputs a proper formatted editnotice page address. Like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{editnotice pagename}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Which outputs the pagename of the editnotice for this page itself:

:{{editnotice pagename}}

This can for instance be used to produce a link to the editnotice for the current page. Like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
[[{{editnotice pagename}}]]
&lt;/pre&gt;

:[[{{editnotice pagename}}]]

This template works for all editnotices.

=== See also ===
* [[Help:Editnotices]] – More about editnotices.
* {{tl|editnotice}} – A template for making editnotice message boxes.
* {{tl|editnotice talkpagename}} - Returns the full talkpage name for the editnotice for the current page.
* {{tl|editnotice userpage}} – A premade editnotice for user pages.

Returns the namespace ID of page given, or of the current page.
{{Namespaces}}

=== Usage ===
* {{tlx|NAMESPACEID}} → {{NAMESPACEID}}
* {{tlx|NAMESPACEID|&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;}} → {{NAMESPACEID|}} &lt;small&gt;(''Main namespace'')&lt;/small&gt;
* {{tlx|NAMESPACEID|&lt;nowiki&gt;{{ns:0}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}} → {{NAMESPACEID|{{ns:0}}}} &lt;small&gt;(''Main namespace'')&lt;/small&gt;
* {{tlx|NAMESPACEID|Talk}} → {{NAMESPACEID|Talk}}

Namespace aliases are accepted, too:
* {{tlx|NAMESPACEID|Image}} → {{NAMESPACEID|Image}}
* {{tlx|NAMESPACEID|File}} → {{NAMESPACEID|File}}
* {{tlx|NAMESPACEID|WB}} → {{NAMESPACEID|WB}}
* {{tlx|NAMESPACEID|Project}} → {{NAMESPACEID|Project}}
* {{tlx|NAMESPACEID|Wikibooks}} → {{NAMESPACEID|Wikibooks}}

Invalid input returns an error, which can be caught with the [[mw:Help:Extension:ParserFunctions##iferror:|#iferror parser function]]:
* {{tlx|NAMESPACEID|Foo}} → {{NAMESPACEID|Foo}}

The template returns a ''state of error'' (recognized as such by a wiki parser function), and optionally an ''error-message text'' in red (visible for the user).

=== Usage ===
* {{tlx|error|An exemplary error}} → {{error|An exemplary error}}
* Compare, used in a Parser Function: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{#expr:Foo}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; → {{#expr:Foo}}

===Tag option===
The tag to contain the error message can be given through the &lt;code&gt;tag&lt;/code&gt; parameter, but it will only accept &lt;code&gt;span&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;div&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;strong&lt;/code&gt;, since those are the only tags recognized by the &lt;code&gt;#iferror&lt;/code&gt; parser function. It defaults to &lt;code&gt;strong&lt;/code&gt;, the tag generated e.g. by &lt;code&gt;#expre&lt;/code&gt;. To prevent &lt;code&gt;strong&lt;/code&gt; message, use one of the other tags, e.g. &lt;code&gt;tag=span&lt;/code&gt;.

* ABC {{tlx|error|An exemplary error demo no tag (default)}} XYZ → ABC {{error|An exemplary error demo no tag (default)}} XYZ 
* ABC &lt;nowiki&gt;{{error|An exemplary error demo span|tag=span}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; XYZ → ABC {{error|An exemplary error demo span|tag=span}} XYZ
* ABC &lt;nowiki&gt;{{error|An exemplary error demo div|tag=div}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; XYZ → ABC {{error|An exemplary error demo div|tag=div}} XYZ
* ABC &lt;nowiki&gt;{{error|An exemplary error demo p|tag=p}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; XYZ → ABC {{error|An exemplary error demo p|tag=p}} XYZ
* ABC &lt;nowiki&gt;{{error|An exemplary error demo strong|tag=strong}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; XYZ → ABC {{error|An exemplary error demo strong|tag=strong}} XYZ

* {{tlx|ns has subpages|Template}} → {{ns has subpages|Template}}
* {{tlx|ns has subpages|Category}} → {{ns has subpages|Category}}
* {{tlx|ns has subpages|&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;}} &lt;small&gt;(''main space'')&lt;/small&gt; → {{ns has subpages|}}
* {{tlx|ns has subpages|&lt;nowiki&gt;{{ns:0}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}} &lt;small&gt;(''main space'')&lt;/small&gt; → {{ns has subpages|{{ns:0}}}}
* {{tlx|ns has subpages|:}} &lt;small&gt;(''main space'')&lt;/small&gt; → {{ns has subpages|:}}
* {{tlx|ns has subpages|&lt;nowiki&gt;{{ns:Talk}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}} → {{ns has subpages|{{ns:Talk}}}}

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;

This is the {{tl|editnotice load}} template.

This template is normally only used by the system, it is the [[Help:Editnotices|editnotice]] loader used in Wikibooks. It displays the editnotices and the links to them, at the top of pages when editing pages.

=== Technical details ===

This template loads and displays the namespace notice. It also calls the sub-template {{tl|editnotice load/core}}. That sub-template handles the loading of the group and page notices and the links to them. This template does parameter preprocessing, thus simplifying the code.

This template is placed in the main MediaWiki namespace notices named [[MediaWiki:Editnotice-0]], [[MediaWiki:Editnotice-1]] and so on. See [[WB:NS]] for the full list of namespace numbers. Therefore this template needs no parameter.

==== The links ====

When a page is edited this template often displays red or blue links at the top of the edit page looking like this:

&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both; float: right; margin: 0px 0.8em; padding: 0; line-height: 1em;&quot;&gt; &lt;small&gt;[[This page should not exist|Page notice]]&lt;/small&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
{{clear}}

Or like this:

&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both; float: right; margin: 0px 0.8em; padding: 0; line-height: 1em;&quot;&gt; &lt;small&gt;[[Example|Book/group notice]] &amp;nbsp; [[This page should not exist|Page notice]]&lt;/small&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
{{clear}}

Those links are to the book/group and page editnotices of the page. Admins always see both links, even if the notices have not yet been created, since they can create and edit the editnotices. Normal users only see the red &quot;Page notice&quot; link on their own user and user talk basepage, since they can create and edit such notices. Normal users also see blue links to book/group and page notices if they already have been created, so they can find and view the source code of the notice. But normal users still can't edit those notices, except the ones in userspace.

==== View source or edit ====
The editnotices are also displayed when a user &quot;views the source&quot; of a protected page. (When a non-admin tries to edit a fully protected page, or when an IP-user tries to edit a semi or fully protected page.) The group and page notices are displayed, but not the namespace notices. 

Most editnotices have useful information even when just viewing the source of a protected page, but in some cases we want to display different information to users who are just viewing the source of the page. This template feeds &quot;&lt;code&gt;notice action = view&lt;/code&gt;&quot; to the editnotices it loads when in view mode. This can be used inside the editnotices like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{#ifeq: {{{notice action|}}} | view
| &lt;!--A non-admin is &quot;viewing the source&quot; of a protected page--&gt;
| &lt;!--A user with sufficient rights is editing the page--&gt;
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

This is the {{tl|editnotice load/core}} sub-template.

Do not use this template directly, use {{tl|editnotice load}} instead.

This template is called from {{tl|editnotice load}}. It holds parts of the code for {{tl|editnotice load}}, while {{tl|editnotice load}}  does parameter preprocessing, thus simplifying the code.

This template is used by the [[Help:Editnotices|editnotice]] system.

=== Technical details ===

This sub-template handles the loading of the group and page notices, and the links to them. This template currently expects these parameters:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{editnotice load/core
| notice action = {{{notice action|}}}   &lt;!--&quot;view&quot; or empty string--&gt;
| group allowed = {{ns has subpages}}   &lt;!--&quot;yes&quot; or empty string--&gt;
| groupnotice =  &lt;!--The possible group notice pagename--&gt;
| pagenotice =  &lt;!--The possible page notice pagename--&gt;
| userpage =   &lt;!--&quot;yes&quot; if a user editable userpage notice, else empty string--&gt;
| ownuserpage =   &lt;!--&quot;yes&quot; if the user is on his own 
                  user or user talk rootpage, else empty string--&gt;
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

I'm a graduate student in pure mathematics at the University of New Hampshire. My interests are a bit too diverse for my own good, but seem to be settling down; my ''major'' interests include foundations (particularly approached through categorical model theory) and algebraic topology. I like to do things categorically when I can get away with it.

My interest here is mostly in hacking on the math books, and getting them to the point where I can in good conscience suggest them in place of traditional textbooks for the courses I teach.</text>

'''Editnotices''' are message boxes shown above the edit window when a user edits a page. All users can create editnotices for their user and talk pages, but editnotices for other namespaces can be created and edited only by [[Wikibooks:Administrators|administrators]].

To use editnotices, you should have a basic understanding of the concept of Wikibooks [[WB:NS|namespaces]]; that is, a set of Wikibooks pages whose names begin with a prefix recognized by the [[MediaWiki]] software, followed by a colon, or in the case of the main namespace, with no prefix.

Some of the message boxes you see when editing a page (or viewing the source of a protected page) are not editnotices; instead, they are [[Special:AllMessages|MediaWiki interface messages]].

== Editnotice links ==

When a page is edited red or blue links are often displayed at the top of the page looking like this:

&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both; float: right; margin: 0px 0.8em; padding: 0; line-height: 1em;&quot;&gt; &lt;small&gt;[[This page should not exist|Page notice]]&lt;/small&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
{{clear}}

Or like this:

&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both; float: right; margin: 0px 0.8em; padding: 0; line-height: 1em;&quot;&gt; &lt;small&gt;[[Example|Book/group notice]] &amp;nbsp; [[This page should not exist|Page notice]]&lt;/small&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
{{clear}}

They are links to the group and page editnotices of the page. Administrators always see both links, even if the notices have not yet been created, since they can create and edit the editnotices. Normal users only see the red &quot;Page notice&quot; link on their own user and user talk basepage, since they can create and edit such notices. Normal users also see blue links to group and page notices if they already have been created, so they can find and view the source of the notice. But normal users still can't edit those notices, except the ones in userspace.

See also the section [[#Hiding the red links|Hiding the red links]] below.

== Editnotices ==

When creating editnotices, the template {{tl|editnotice}} can be used for formatting; see its template page for how to use it. See  [[:Category:Editnotice templates]] for specialized editnotices.

=== User and user discussion ===

Insert as an [[Template:Editnotice userpage|edit notice for a user page]] as &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Editnotice userpage}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.

For example:
{{editnotice
| id =
| header =ExampleUser's User Page
| headerstyle =font-size: 150%;
| text = Hello. You're editing the userpage of ExampleUser. Please make your edits friendly as this is a userpage and is only supposed to be edited by the user!
| textstyle =font-size: 120%;
| image =[[File:Wikibooks-logo.svg|80px|link=|alt=]]
}}

This appears on top of the editing box screen when people would like to edit your page. The '''ExampleUser''' part will automatically change to your username.

Anyone can create an editnotice for a user or user talk page. (But editnotices for user subpages can only be created by administrator.) User page editnotice names take one of these forms:
:&lt;code&gt;User:Example/Editnotice&lt;/code&gt;
:&lt;code&gt;User talk:Example/Editnotice&lt;/code&gt;

You can create an editnotice for your own user or talk page with a preloaded {{tl|editnotice}} template by using these links:
:{{preload|Special:MyPage/Editnotice|Create your user page notice|Template:Editnotice/preload}}
:{{preload|Special:MyTalk/Editnotice|Create your user discussion page notice|Template:Editnotice/preload}}

=== Other namespaces ===

Editnotices for other namespaces and for user subpages can be created and edited only by administrators. There are three main types of editnotices:
:Namespace notices&amp;nbsp;– Displays on all pages within a namespace.
:Group notices&amp;nbsp;– Displays on a page and all its subpages.  Useful for having a notice for an entire book.
:Page notices&amp;nbsp;– Displays only on the page it belongs to.

Editnotice names take one of these forms:

:Namespace notices&amp;nbsp;– See below.
:Group notices&amp;nbsp;– &lt;code&gt;Template:Editnotices/Group/''&lt;Full page name of the root page or book name&gt;''&lt;/code&gt;
:Page notices&amp;nbsp;– &lt;code&gt;Template:Editnotices/Page/''&lt;Full page name&gt;''&lt;/code&gt;

=== Creating editnotices ===
To edit a namespace-wide editnotice, click on the respective link below. To create an editnotice for a page, enter the page name after the slash or colon and click &quot;Create&quot;. For your own User: and User talk: pages, you don't need to type anything, just click &quot;Create&quot;.

Page names are case sensitive— if the page shows the first character as capitalized, then it ''must'' be capitalized when entered here.

To request the creation of an editnotice if you are not an admin:
* Open the edit window of the page where you want to create an editnotice
* Place this request on the page: {{tl|editnotice talkpagename}}
* Preview the page and follow the link to the editnotice's talkpage.
* On the editnotice's talkpage write up the exact markup you want for the editnotice, then place an {{tl|editprotected}} request above it

Another way to find the link for an editnotice is to:
* Open the edit window of the page where you want to create an editnotice
* Place this code on the page: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[{{editnotice pagename}}]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
* Preview the page and follow the link to the editnotice

=== Batch of identical editnotices ===
If you need to display a batch of identical editnotices, please create a single template which you then transclude in each editnotice, to allow easier modification and maintenance. You can place such templates in [[:Category:Editnotice templates]].

== When displayed ==

Editnotices are displayed when editing a page, but their content can also be useful when just viewing a page so they are also displayed in these cases:

* Page notices are displayed on top of .css and .js pages in MediaWiki space. See for instance the notice at the top of [[MediaWiki:Common.css]] that begins &quot;''This is the CSS for all skins''&quot;. The namespace notice is not displayed and MediaWiki space doesn't have group notices.

* In any namespace, when a non-admin &quot;views the source&quot; of a protected page, or an IP-user views the source of a semi-protected page. The group and page notices are displayed, but not the namespace notices.

When the editnotices are shown in &quot;view mode&quot; the loading system feeds them &quot;&lt;code&gt;notice action = view&lt;/code&gt;&quot;. This can be used inside the editnotices like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{#ifeq: {{{notice action|}}} | view
| &lt;!--A non-admin is &quot;viewing the source&quot; of a protected page--&gt;
| &lt;!--A user with sufficient rights is editing the page--&gt;
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Hiding the red links ==

If you don't want to see the red &quot;Group notice&quot; and &quot;Page notice&quot; links, then add the below markup to your [[Special:MyPage/skin.css|personal CSS]], then wait a minute, then [[MediaWiki:Clearyourcache|bypass]] your browser cache.

&lt;source lang=&quot;css&quot;&gt;
/* Hide the red &quot;Group notice&quot; and &quot;Page notice&quot; links. */
.editnotice-area .editnotice-redlink { 
  display: none !important;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

If you don't want to see any of the &quot;Group notice&quot; and &quot;Page notice links, then use this markup instead:

&lt;source lang=&quot;css&quot;&gt;
/* Hide all the &quot;Group notice&quot; and &quot;Page notice&quot; links. */
.editnotice-area .editnotice-link { 
  display: none !important;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

== Listing editnotices ==
* [[Special:PrefixIndex/MediaWiki:Editnotice]]&amp;nbsp;– The main MediaWiki namespace notices, and any lingering MediaWiki page notices.
* [[Special:PrefixIndex/Template:Editnotices]]&amp;nbsp;– All templates and sub-templates with names beginning with &quot;Template:Editnotices...&quot;.
* [[Special:WhatLinksHere/Template:Editnotice]]&amp;nbsp;– Pages that use the {{tl|editnotice}} template.

== Technical details ==
{{namespaces}}
Anything put on the pages [[MediaWiki:Editnotice-0]] through [[MediaWiki:Editnotice-15]], [[MediaWiki:Editnotice-102]], [[MediaWiki:Editnotice-103]], and [[MediaWiki:Editnotice-108]] through [[MediaWiki:Editnotice-113]] will appear as an editnotice for ''every'' page in an entire namespace.  Editnotice-0 is for mainspace pages, Editnotice-1 for the talk space pages, Editnotice-2 for user space pages, etcetera.

The template {{tl|editnotice load}} has been put on each of those MediaWiki namespace pages.  The template causes each article to use a subpage specific to it as its editnotice rather than using a namespace-wide editnotice.

The editnotice load system uses two methods of storing the editnotices:

* For User and User talk space the editnotice is stored as a subpage of the user or talk page named /Editnotice. This method allows users to edit these notices.
* For all other namespaces and for user sub-pages the editnotice is stored as a subpage of [[Template:Editnotices]]. Template:Editnotices and its subpages are protected by the [[MediaWiki:Titleblacklist]] so that only administrators can create and edit them.

Although all of the namespaces could initially store editnotices directly as MediaWiki messages, this was found to cause performance issues as the MediaWiki namespace grew. The display of MediaWiki editnotices for namespaces that have the MediaWiki subpage feature has been disabled; even though an editnotice can be created as a MediaWiki message for these namespaces, it will not show. For consistency, and to keep the MediaWiki namespace clean, all editnotices are now stored as subpages of Template:Editnotices. This means we again can create editnotices for all namespaces.

Group notices stored as &lt;code&gt;Template:Editnotices/Group/...&lt;/code&gt; can be created for pages in all namespaces except File (image), MediaWiki, Subject, and Transwiki. The reason is that those namespaces don't have the MediaWiki subpage feature, thus group notices would not be meaningful in those namespaces. The talk spaces of those namespaces understand subpages and can use group notices, although group notices are usually not meaningful there either.

== Emailnotice ==
Emailnotices allow registered users with a confirmed email to display a custom message at [[Special:EmailUser]] for their username. Emailnotices are located at [[Special:MyPage/Emailnotice]] (&lt;span class=&quot;plainlinks&quot;&gt;[{{fullurl:Special:Search|redirs=1&amp;search=%2Femailnotice&amp;fulltext=Search&amp;ns2=1&amp;title=Special%3ASearch&amp;advanced=1&amp;fulltext=Advanced+search}} uses]&lt;/span&gt;). The system was implemented in [[MediaWiki:Emailpagetext]].

== Related templates ==
* {{tl|editnotice}}&amp;nbsp;– A template for making editnotices.
* {{tl|editnotice pagename}}&amp;nbsp;– Returns the pagename for the editnotice for the current page.
* {{tl|editnotice talkpagename}}&amp;nbsp;- Returns the talkpage name for the editnotice for the current page.
* {{tl|editnotice explanation}}&amp;nbsp;– For editnotice talk pages. Explains how editnotices are protected, and optionally shows a CSS customization parameter.
* {{tl|editnotice load}}&amp;nbsp;– The template that is doing most of the editnotice loading and also displays the small &quot;Group notice&quot; and &quot;Page notice&quot; links.
* {{tl|editnotice userpage}}&amp;nbsp;– For use on userpages.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi there. This is the person who edited the dates- my name's Mike- on February 16, 2011.  I actually made the edits, then realized that I'd have to do it again if I wanted to create an account. Basically, I put the edits in because I am a practicing attorney, only in my third year, and I have had confusion in my own practice about the computation of time, as apparently, between my 2005 Civil Procedure appendix book that I still have from law school, and 2008 when I began really practicing civil litigation on the federal level, they changed the computation of time requirements and many of the deadlines. This led to consternation in my own practice, and I hope to save others the trouble.  If you go to Westlaw, Lexis, or the free version of the FRCP that Cornell Law puts on the internet via the LII, you'll see that the &quot;20 day&quot; time period is no longer good law; it's now 21 calendar days. Same with the time to answer following the court's ruling or an order continuing a Rule 12 motion. These are the changes I made. Also: this is a great, great article/book that you made. I am emailing myself the link and am going to print it out and keep it for a quick &quot;cheat sheet.&quot; Great work!

Best,
Mike</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">In this section, we present alternative ways of solving triangles by using '''half-angle formulae'''.

Given a triangle with sides ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'', define

:''s'' = {{frac|1|2}}(''a''+''b''+''c'').

Note that

:''a''+''b''-''c'' = 2''s''-2''c'' = 2(''s''-''c'')

and similarly for ''a'' and ''b''.

We have from the cosine theorem

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \cos(A) = {{b^2+c^2-a^2} \over {2bc}}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle 2\sin^2\left(\frac{A}{2}\right) = 1 - \cos(A) = 1 - {{b^2+c^2-a^2} \over {2bc}} = {{(a+b-c)(a-b+c)} \over {2bc}} = {{2(s-b)(s-c)} \over {bc}}&lt;/math&gt;

So

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \sin\left(\frac{A}{2}\right) = \sqrt{{(s-b)(s-c)} \over {bc}}&lt;/math&gt;.

By symmetry, there are similar expressions involving the angles B and C.

Note that in this expression and all the others for half angles, the positive square root is always taken.  This is because a half-angle of a triangle must always be less than a right angle.

== Cos(A/2) and tan(A/2) ==
:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle 2\cos^2\left(\frac{A}{2}\right) = 1 + \cos(A) = 1 + {{b^2+c^2-a^2} \over {2bc}} = {{(a+b+c)(b+c-a)} \over {2bc}} = {{2s(s-a)} \over {bc}}&lt;/math&gt;

So

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \cos\left(\frac{A}{2}\right) = \sqrt{{s(s-a)} \over {bc}}&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \tan\left(\frac{A}{2}\right) = {\sin(\frac{A}{2}) \over \cos(\frac{A}{2})} = \sqrt{{(s-b)(s-c)} \over {s(s-a)}}&lt;/math&gt;.

Again, by symmetry there are similar expressions involving the angles B and C.

== Sin(A) and Heron's formula ==
A formula for sin(A) can be found using either of the following identities:

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \sin(A) = 2 \sin\left(\frac{A}{2}\right)\cos\left(\frac{A}{2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \sin(A) = \sqrt{(1+\cos(A))(1-\cos(A))}&lt;/math&gt;

These both lead to

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \sin(A) = \frac{2}{bc} \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}&lt;/math&gt;

The positive square root is always used, since A cannot exceed 180º.  Again, by symmetry there are similar expressions involving the angles B and C.  These expressions provide an alternative proof of the sine theorem.

Since the area of a triangle

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \Delta = \frac{1}{2} bc \sin(A)&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \Delta = \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}&lt;/math&gt;

which is Heron's formula.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The [http://www.openssh.org/ OpenSSH] suite provides secure remote access and file transfer.  Since its initial release, it has grown to become the most widely used implementation of the SSH protocol.  During the first ten years of its existence, ssh has largely replaced older corresponding unencrypted tools and protocols.  
The OpenSSH client is included by default in most operating system distributions, including OS X, Linux, BSD and Solaris.  Any day you use the Internet, you are using and relying on dozens if not hundreds of machines operated and maintained using OpenSSH.  A survey in 2008 showed that of the SSH servers found running, just over 80% were OpenSSH.  &lt;ref name=&quot;OpenSSH_marketshare_2008&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.openssh.com/usage/ssh-stats.html
 |title=Statistics from the current scan results |publisher=OpenSSH.org |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

OpenSSH was first released towards the end of 1999.  It is the latest step in a very long and useful history of networked computing, remote access and telecommuting.

This book is for fellow users of OpenSSH to help them save effort and time through using OpenSSH, and especially SFTP, where it makes sense to use it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Encryption has been a hot topic in computing for a long time.  It became a high priority item in national and international politics in 1991 when Dr. Phil Zimmermann at MIT first published Pretty Good Privacy (PGP).  Encryption went from a specialty to a requirement with the arrival the first web shops and increasing volumes of money changed hands online.  By 1996 encryption became essential for e-business.  By 2000 it became recognized as a general, essential prerequisite in electronic communication.  Currently, 2010, there is almost no chance of maintaining control over or integrity of any networked machine for more than a few minutes without the help of encryption.  

Currently much communication over computer networks is still done without encryption.  That would be most communication, if inadequate encryption is also taken into account.  This is despite years of warnings, government recommendations, best practice guidelines and incidents.  As a result, any machine connected to the network can intercept communication that passes over that network.  The eavesdroppers are many and varied.  They include administrators, staff, employers, criminals, corporate spies, and even governments.  Corporate espionage alone has become an enormous burden and barrier.  

Businesses are well aware of dumpster diving and take precautions to shred all paper documents.  But what about electronic information?  Contracts and negotiations, trade secrets, patent applications, decisions and minutes, customer data and invoicing, personnel data, financial and tax records, calendars and schedules, product designs and production notes, training materials, and even regular correspondence go over the net daily.  Archived materials, even if they are not accessed directly, are usually on machines that are available and accessed for other reasons.  

Many company managers and executives are still unaware that their communications and documents are so easily intercepted, in spite of apparent and expensive access restrictions.  In many cases these can be show to be ineffectual and at best purely cosmetic.  Security Theater is one aspect and in the field of security it is more common to find snake oil than authentic solutions.  Still, there is little public demonstration of awareness of the magnitude of corporate espionage nowadays or the cost of failure.  Even failure to act has its costs.  
Not only is sensitive data available if left unencrypted, but also trends in less sensitive data can be spotted with a large enough sampling.  A very large amount of information can be inferred even from lesser communications.  Data mining is now a well-known concept as is the so-called wireless wiretap.  With the increase in online material and activity, encryption is more relevant than ever even if many years have passed since the issues were first brought into the limelight.

==Excerpt of ssh-1.0.0  README from July 12, 1995==

Tatu Ylönen, then at the Helsinki University of Technology, wrote the README&lt;ref name=&quot;SSH-1.0.0-README&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/mirrors/ftp.cs.hut.fi/pub/ssh/old/
 |title=SSH 1.0.0 README |publisher=FUNET |year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; accompanying the early versions of his Open Source software, SSH.  The following is an excerpt about why encryption is important.

...

WHY TO USE SECURE SHELL

Currently, almost all communications in computer networks are done
without encryption.  As a consequence, anyone who has access to any
machine connected to the network can listen in on any communication.
This is being done by hackers, curious administrators, employers,
criminals, industrial spies, and governments.  Some networks leak off
enough electromagnetic radiation that data may be captured even from a
distance.

When you log in, your password goes in the network in plain
text.  Thus, any listener can then use your account to do any evil he
likes.  Many incidents have been encountered worldwide where crackers
have started programs on workstations without the owners knowledge
just to listen to the network and collect passwords.  Programs for
doing this are available on the Internet, or can be built by a
competent programmer in a few days.

Any information that you type or is printed on your screen can be
monitored, recorded, and analyzed.  For example, an intruder who has
penetrated a host connected to a major network can start a program
that listens to all data flowing in the network, and whenever it
encounters a 16-digit string, it checks if it is a valid credit card
number (using the check digit), and saves the number plus any
surrounding text (to catch expiration date and holder) in a file.
When the intruder has collected a few thousand credit card numbers, he
makes smallish mail-order purchases from a few thousand stores around
the world, and disappears when the goods arrive but before anyone
suspects anything.

Businesses have trade secrets, patent applications in preparation,
pricing information, subcontractor information, client data, personnel
data, financial information, etc.  Currently, anyone with access to
the network (any machine on the network) can listen to anything that
goes in the network, without any regard to normal access restrictions.

Many companies are not aware that information can so easily be
recovered from the network.  They trust that their data is safe
since nobody is supposed to know that there is sensitive information
in the network, or because so much other data is transferred in the
network.  This is not a safe policy.

Individual persons also have confidential information, such as
diaries, love letters, health care documents, information about their
personal interests and habits, professional data, job applications,
tax reports, political documents, unpublished manuscripts, etc.


There is also another frightening aspect about the poor security of
communications.  Computer storage and analysis capability has
increased so much that it is feasible for governments, major
companies, and criminal organizations to automatically analyze,
identify, classify, and file information about millions of people over
the years.  Because most of the work can be automated, the cost of
collecting this information is getting very low.  

Government agencies may be able to monitor major communication
systems, telephones, fax, computer networks, etc., and passively
collect huge amounts of information about all people with any
significant position in the society.  Most of this information is not
sensitive, and many people would say there is no harm in someone
getting that information.  However, the information starts to get
sensitive when someone has enough of it.  You may not mind someone
knowing what you bought from the shop one random day, but you might
not like someone knowing every small thing you have bought in the last
ten years.

If the government some day starts to move into a more totalitarian
direction, there is considerable danger of an ultimate totalitarian
state.  With enough information (the automatically collected records
of an individual can be manually analyzed when the person becomes
interesting), one can form a very detailed picture of the individual's
interests, opinions, beliefs, habits, friends, lovers, weaknesses,
etc.  This information can be used to 1) locate any persons who might
oppose the new system 2) use deception to disturb any organizations
which might rise against the government 3) eliminate difficult
individuals without anyone understanding what happened.  Additionally,
if the government can monitor communications too effectively, it
becomes too easy to locate and eliminate any persons distributing
information contrary to the official truth.

Fighting crime and terrorism are often used as grounds for domestic
surveillance and restricting encryption.  These are good goals, but
there is considerable danger that the surveillance data starts to get
used for questionable purposes.  I find that it is better to tolerate
a small amount of crime in the society than to let the society become
fully controlled.  I am in favor of a fairly strong state, but the
state must never get so strong that people become unable to spread
contra-offical information and unable to overturn the government if it
is bad.  The danger is that when you notice that the government is
too powerful, it is too late.  Also, the real power may not be where
the official government is. 

For these reasons (privacy, protecting trade secrets, and making it
more difficult to create a totalitarian state), I think that strong
cryptography should be integrated to the tools we use every day.
Using it causes no harm (except for those who wish to monitor
everything), but not using it can cause huge problems.  If the society
changes in undesirable ways, then it will be to late to start
encrypting.

Encryption has had a &quot;military&quot; or &quot;classified&quot; flavor to it.  There
are no longer any grounds for this.  The military can and will use its
own encryption; that is no excuse to prevent the civilians from
protecting their privacy and secrets.  Information on strong
encryption is available in every major bookstore, scientific library,
and patent office around the world, and strong encryption software is
available in every country on the Internet.

Some people would like to make it illegal to use encryption, or to
force people to use encryption that governments can break.  This
approach offers no protection if the government turns bad.  Also, the
&quot;bad guys&quot; will be using true strong encryption anyway.  Thus, any
&quot;key escrow encryption&quot; or whatever it might be called only serves to
help monitor the ordinary people and petty criminals; it does not help
against powerful criminals, terrorists, or espionage, because they
will know how to use strong encryption anyway.

...

Thanks also go to Philip Zimmermann, whose PGP software and the
associated legal battle provided inspiration, motivation, and many
useful techniques, and to Bruce Schneier whose book Applied
Cryptography has done a great service in widely distributing knowledge
about cryptographic methods.

==Phil Zimmermann on encryption and privacy, from 1991, updated 1999==

Phil Zimmermann wrote the encryption tool Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) in 1991 to promote privacy and to help keep encryption, and thus privacy, legal around the world.  Considerable difficulty occurred in the United States until PGP was published outside and re-imported in a very visible, public manner.   

{{quote|
'''Why I Wrote PGP'''&lt;br /&gt;
''Part of the Original 1991 PGP User's Guide (updated in 1999)''

&quot;Whatever you do will be insignificant, but it is very important that you do it.&quot;

–Mahatma Gandhi.

It's personal. It's private. And it's no one's business but yours. You may be planning a political campaign, discussing your taxes, or having a secret romance. Or you may be communicating with a political dissident in a repressive country. Whatever it is, you don't want your private electronic mail (email) or confidential documents read by anyone else. There's nothing wrong with asserting your privacy. Privacy is as apple-pie as the Constitution.

The right to privacy is spread implicitly throughout the Bill of Rights. But when the United States Constitution was framed, the Founding Fathers saw no need to explicitly spell out the right to a private conversation. That would have been silly. Two hundred years ago, all conversations were private. If someone else was within earshot, you could just go out behind the barn and have your conversation there. No one could listen in without your knowledge. The right to a private conversation was a natural right, not just in a philosophical sense, but in a law-of-physics sense, given the technology of the time.

But with the coming of the information age, starting with the invention of the telephone, all that has changed. Now most of our conversations are conducted electronically. This allows our most intimate conversations to be exposed without our knowledge. Cellular phone calls may be monitored by anyone with a radio. Electronic mail, sent across the Internet, is no more secure than cellular phone calls. Email is rapidly replacing postal mail, becoming the norm for everyone, not the novelty it was in the past.

Until recently, if the government wanted to violate the privacy of ordinary citizens, they had to expend a certain amount of expense and labor to intercept and steam open and read paper mail. Or they had to listen to and possibly transcribe spoken telephone conversation, at least before automatic voice recognition technology became available. This kind of labor-intensive monitoring was not practical on a large scale. It was only done in important cases when it seemed worthwhile. This is like catching one fish at a time, with a hook and line. Today, email can be routinely and automatically scanned for interesting keywords, on a vast scale, without detection. This is like driftnet fishing. And exponential growth in computer power is making the same thing possible with voice traffic.

Perhaps you think your email is legitimate enough that encryption is unwarranted. If you really are a law-abiding citizen with nothing to hide, then why don't you always send your paper mail on postcards? Why not submit to drug testing on demand? Why require a warrant for police searches of your house? Are you trying to hide something? If you hide your mail inside envelopes, does that mean you must be a subversive or a drug dealer, or maybe a paranoid nut? Do law-abiding citizens have any need to encrypt their email?

What if everyone believed that law-abiding citizens should use postcards for their mail? If a nonconformist tried to assert his privacy by using an envelope for his mail, it would draw suspicion. Perhaps the authorities would open his mail to see what he's hiding. Fortunately, we don't live in that kind of world, because everyone protects most of their mail with envelopes. So no one draws suspicion by asserting their privacy with an envelope. There's safety in numbers. Analogously, it would be nice if everyone routinely used encryption for all their email, innocent or not, so that no one drew suspicion by asserting their email privacy with encryption. Think of it as a form of solidarity.

Senate Bill 266, a 1991 omnibus anticrime bill, had an unsettling measure buried in it. If this non-binding resolution had become real law, it would have forced manufacturers of secure communications equipment to insert special &quot;trap doors&quot; in their products, so that the government could read anyone's encrypted messages. It reads, &quot;It is the sense of Congress that providers of electronic communications services and manufacturers of electronic communications service equipment shall ensure that communications systems permit the government to obtain the plain text contents of voice, data, and other communications when appropriately authorized by law.&quot; It was this bill that led me to publish PGP electronically for free that year, shortly before the measure was defeated after vigorous protest by civil libertarians and industry groups.

The 1994 Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA) mandated that phone companies install remote wiretapping ports into their central office digital switches, creating a new technology infrastructure for &quot;point-and-click&quot; wiretapping, so that federal agents no longer have to go out and attach alligator clips to phone lines. Now they will be able to sit in their headquarters in Washington and listen in on your phone calls. Of course, the law still requires a court order for a wiretap. But while technology infrastructures can persist for generations, laws and policies can change overnight. Once a communications infrastructure optimized for surveillance becomes entrenched, a shift in political conditions may lead to abuse of this new-found power. Political conditions may shift with the election of a new government, or perhaps more abruptly from the bombing of a federal building.

A year after the CALEA passed, the FBI disclosed plans to require the phone companies to build into their infrastructure the capacity to simultaneously wiretap 1 percent of all phone calls in all major U.S. cities. This would represent more than a thousandfold increase over previous levels in the number of phones that could be wiretapped. In previous years, there were only about a thousand court-ordered wiretaps in the United States per year, at the federal, state, and local levels combined. It's hard to see how the government could even employ enough judges to sign enough wiretap orders to wiretap 1 percent of all our phone calls, much less hire enough federal agents to sit and listen to all that traffic in real time. The only plausible way of processing that amount of traffic is a massive Orwellian application of automated voice recognition technology to sift through it all, searching for interesting keywords or searching for a particular speaker's voice. If the government doesn't find the target in the first 1 percent sample, the wiretaps can be shifted over to a different 1 percent until the target is found, or until everyone's phone line has been checked for subversive traffic. The FBI said they need this capacity to plan for the future. This plan sparked such outrage that it was defeated in Congress. But the mere fact that the FBI even asked for these broad powers is revealing of their agenda.

Advances in technology will not permit the maintenance of the status quo, as far as privacy is concerned. The status quo is unstable. If we do nothing, new technologies will give the government new automatic surveillance capabilities that Stalin could never have dreamed of. The only way to hold the line on privacy in the information age is strong cryptography.

You don't have to distrust the government to want to use cryptography. Your business can be wiretapped by business rivals, organized crime, or foreign governments. Several foreign governments, for example, admit to using their signals intelligence against companies from other countries to give their own corporations a competitive edge. Ironically, the United States government's restrictions on cryptography in the 1990's have weakened U.S. corporate defenses against foreign intelligence and organized crime.

The government knows what a pivotal role cryptography is destined to play in the power relationship with its people. In April 1993, the Clinton administration unveiled a bold new encryption policy initiative, which had been under development at the National Security Agency (NSA) since the start of the Bush administration. The centerpiece of this initiative was a government-built encryption device, called the Clipper chip, containing a new classified NSA encryption algorithm. The government tried to encourage private industry to design it into all their secure communication products, such as secure phones, secure faxes, and so on. AT&amp;T put Clipper into its secure voice products. The catch: At the time of manufacture, each Clipper chip is loaded with its own unique key, and the government gets to keep a copy, placed in escrow. Not to worry, though–the government promises that they will use these keys to read your traffic only &quot;when duly authorized by law.&quot; Of course, to make Clipper completely effective, the next logical step would be to outlaw other forms of cryptography.

The government initially claimed that using Clipper would be voluntary, that no one would be forced to use it instead of other types of cryptography. But the public reaction against the Clipper chip was strong, stronger than the government anticipated. The computer industry monolithically proclaimed its opposition to using Clipper. FBI director Louis Freeh responded to a question in a press conference in 1994 by saying that if Clipper failed to gain public support, and FBI wiretaps were shut out by non-government-controlled cryptography, his office would have no choice but to seek legislative relief. Later, in the aftermath of the Oklahoma City tragedy, Mr. Freeh testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee that public availability of strong cryptography must be curtailed by the government (although no one had suggested that cryptography was used by the bombers).

The government has a track record that does not inspire confidence that they will never abuse our civil liberties. The FBI's COINTELPRO program targeted groups that opposed government policies. They spied on the antiwar movement and the civil rights movement. They wiretapped the phone of Martin Luther King. Nixon had his enemies list. Then there was the Watergate mess. More recently, Congress has either attempted to or succeeded in passing laws curtailing our civil liberties on the Internet. Some elements of the Clinton White House collected confidential FBI files on Republican civil servants, conceivably for political exploitation. And some overzealous prosecutors have shown a willingness to go to the ends of the Earth in pursuit of exposing sexual indiscretions of political enemies. At no time in the past century has public distrust of the government been so broadly distributed across the political spectrum, as it is today.

Throughout the 1990s, I figured that if we want to resist this unsettling trend in the government to outlaw cryptography, one measure we can apply is to use cryptography as much as we can now while it's still legal. When use of strong cryptography becomes popular, it's harder for the government to criminalize it. Therefore, using PGP is good for preserving democracy. If privacy is outlawed, only outlaws will have privacy.

It appears that the deployment of PGP must have worked, along with years of steady public outcry and industry pressure to relax the export controls. In the closing months of 1999, the Clinton administration announced a radical shift in export policy for crypto technology. They essentially threw out the whole export control regime. Now, we are finally able to export strong cryptography, with no upper limits on strength. It has been a long struggle, but we have finally won, at least on the export control front in the US. Now we must continue our efforts to deploy strong crypto, to blunt the effects increasing surveillance efforts on the Internet by various governments. And we still need to entrench our right to use it domestically over the objections of the FBI.

PGP empowers people to take their privacy into their own hands. There has been a growing social need for it. That's why I wrote it.

OpenSSH: Secure Shell integrated into OpenBSD
Secure communications package no longer third-party add-on

[October 25, 1999: Calgary, Canada] -- The OpenBSD developers are
pleased to announce the release of OpenSSH, a free implementation
of the popular Secure Shell encrypted communications package. 
OpenSSH, to be released with OpenBSD 2.6, is compatible with
both SSH 1.3 and 1.5 protocols and dodges most restrictions on the 
free distribution of strong cryptography.

OpenSSH is based on a free release of SSH by Tatu Ylonen, with major
changes to remove proprietary code and bring it up to current
security and functionality standards.  Secure Shell operates like the
popular TELNET remote terminal package but with an encrypted link
between the user and the remote server.  SSH also allows &quot;tunnelling&quot;
of network services through the scrambled connection for added
privacy. OpenSSH has been tested to interoperate with ssh-1.2.27 from 
SSH Communications, and the TTSSH and SecureCRT Windows clients.

&quot;Network sessions involving strong cryptographic security are a
requirement in the modern world,&quot; says lead developer Theo de Raadt.
&quot;Everyone needs this.  People using the telnet or rlogin protocols are
not aware of the extreme danger posed by password sniffing and session
hijacking.&quot;

In previous releases of OpenBSD, users were urged to download SSH as
soon as possible after installing the OS. Without SSH, terminal
sessions transmitted in clear text allow eavesdroppers on the Internet
to capture user names and password combinations and thus bypass the
security measures in the operating system.

&quot;I asked everyone `what is the first thing you do after installing
OpenBSD?' Everyone gave me the same answer:  they installed ssh,&quot; says
de Raadt.  &quot;That's a pain, so we've made it much easier.&quot;

All proprietary code in the original distribution was replaced, along
with some libraries burdened with the restrictive GNU Public License
(GPL). Much of of the actual cryptographic code was replaced by calls
to the crypto libraries built into OpenBSD. The source code is now
completely freely re-useable, and vendors are encouraged to re-use it
if they need ssh functionality.

OpenSSH relies on the Secure Sockets Layer library (libssl) which
incorporates the RSA public-key cryptography system. RSA is patented
in the US and OpenBSD developers must work around the patent
restrictions. Users outside the US may download a libssl file based
on the patent-free OpenSSL implementation. For US non-commercial
users, OpenBSD is preparing a libssl based on the patented RSAREF
code. Unfortunately, the US legal framework effectively bans US
commercial users from using OpenSSH, and curtails freedom of choice
in that market.

OpenSSH was developed and integrated into OpenBSD by Niels Provos,
Theo de Raadt, Markus Friedl for cryptographic work; Dug Song, Aaron
Campbell, and others for various non-crypto contributions; and Bob
Beck for helping with the openssl library issues. The original SSH
was written by Tatu Ylonen. Bjoern Groenvall and Holger Trapp did the
initial work to free the distribution.

OpenBSD is an Internet-based volunteer effort to produce a secure
multi-platform operating system with built-in support for
cryptography. It has been described in the press as the world's most
secure operating system. For more information about OpenSSH and 
OpenBSD, see the project Web pages at http://www.OpenBSD.org/.

==The European Union (EU) on Encryption==

During 2000, the European Commission investigated the state of international and industrial electronic espionage.  Counter-measures and solutions were investigated as well as the risks.  The result was a resolution containing a summary of the findings and a series of recommended actions for Member States to carry out and goals to meet.  
Recommendations to EU Member States from 
the European Parliament resolution ECHELON, A5-0264/2001 (emphasis added):

: &quot;29.	Urges the Commission and Member States to devise appropriate measures to promote, develop and manufacture European encryption technology and software and above all to support projects at developing user-friendly '''open-source encryption''' software;&quot;
: . . .
: &quot;33.	Calls on the Community institutions and the public administrations of the Member States to provide training for their staff and make their staff familiar with new '''encryption technologies and techniques''' by means of the necessary practical training and courses;&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;EchelonReport&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=TA&amp;reference=P5-TA-2001-0441&amp;format=XML&amp;language=EN |title=European Parliament resolution on the existence of a global system for the interception of private and commercial communications (ECHELON interception system) (2001/2098(INI))|id=ECHELON  A5-0264 2001  |publisher=European Parliament|year=2001|accessdate=2011-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was found during the investigation that businesses were the most at risk and the most vulnerable and that widespread use of open source encryption technology is to be encouraged.  The same can be said even today.

      <comment>rfc 4251</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The current set of Secure Shell protocols is SSH2.  It is a rewrite of the old, deprecated SSH1 protocol.   It contains significant improvements in security, performance, and portability.  The default is now SSH2.  OpenSSH uses the SSH protocol, connecting over TCP.   Normally, one SSH session per TCP connection is made, but multiple sessions can be multiplexed over a single TCP connection if planned that way.  

The Secure Shell protocol is an open standard.  As such, it is vendor-neutral and maintained by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).  The current protocol is described in RFC 4250 through RFC 4256 and standardized by the IETF secsh working group.  The overall structure of SSH2 is described in RFC 4251, The Secure Shell (SSH) Protocol Architecture.  

The SSH protocol is composed of three layers: the transport layer, the authentication layer, and the connection layer.

:'''SSH-CONNECT''' – The connection layer runs over the user authentication protocol.  It multiplexes many different concurrent encrypted channels into logical channels over the authenticated connection.  It allows for tunneling of login sessions and TCP-forwarding.  It provides a flow control service for these channels.  Additionally, various channel-specific options can be negotiated.  This layer manages the SSH session, session multiplexing, X11 forwarding, TCP forwarding, shell, remote program execution, invoking SFTP subsystem.    

:'''SSH-USERAUTH''' – The user authentication layer authenticates the client-side to the server.  It uses the established connection and runs on top of the   transport layer. It provides several mechanisms for user authentication.  These include password authentication, public-key or host-based authentication mechanisms, challenge-response, pluggable authentication modules (PAM), Generic Security Services API (GSSAPI) and even dongles.  

:'''SSH-TRANS''' – The transport layer provides server authentication, confidentiality and data integrity over TCP.  It does this through algorithm negotiation and a key exchange. The key exchange includes server authentication and results in a cryptographically secured connection: it provides integrity, confidentiality and optional compression. &lt;ref name=&quot;OpenSSH-Manual&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.openssh.com/manual.html |title=OpenSSH Manual Pages |publisher=OpenSSH| accessdate=2011-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the differences between the current protocol, SSH2, and the deprecated protocol, SSH1, are that SSH2 uses host keys for authentication.  Whereas SSH1 used both server and host keys to authenticate.  There's not much which can be added about the protocols which is not already covered with more detail and authority in RFC 4251 &lt;ref name=&quot;RFC42511&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4251 | title=RFC 4251:  The Secure Shell (SSH) Protocol Architecture | date=2006-01 |accessdate=2013-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  

==SSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP)==

The SSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) is a binary protocol to provide secure file transfer, access and management.  

SFTP on the server side was added by Markus Friedl in time for the 2.3.0 release of OpenSSH in November 2000.  Damien Miller added support for SFTP to the client side in time for 2.5.0.  Since then, many have added to both the client and the server.

===SFTP is not FTPS===

For basic file transfer, nothing more is needed than an account on the machine with the OpenSSH server.  SFTP support is built into the OpenSSH server package.  The SFTP protocol, in contrast to old FTP, has been designed from the ground up to be as secure as possible for both login and data transfer.  

Unless the use-case calls for publicly available, read-only, downloads, don't worry about trying to fiddle with FTP.  It is the protocol FTP itself that is inherently insecure.  It's great for read-only, public data transfer.  The programs vsftpd and proftpd, for example, are secure insofar as the  server software itself goes, although the protocol is insecure.  In other words the program itself is more or less fine and if you need to provide read-only, publicly available downloads then FTP maybe the right tool.  Otherwise forget about FTP.  
Nearly always when users ask for &quot;FTP&quot; they don't mean specifically the old file transfer protocol from 1971 as described in RFC 114, but a generic means of file transfer and there are many ways to solve that problem.  This is especially true since the next part of their request is usually how to make it secure.  The name &quot;FTP&quot; is frequently mis-used generically to mean any file transfer utility, much the same way as the term &quot;Coke&quot; is used in some of the Southern States to mean any carbonated soft drink, not just Coca-Cola.  Consider SFTP or, for larger groups, even SSHFS, Samba or AFS.  While old FTP succeeded very well in achieving its main goal to promote use of networked computers by allowing users at any host on the network to use the file system of any cooperating host, it cannot be made secure.  There's nothing to be done about that, so it is time to get over it.  

Again, it is the protocol itself, FTP, which is the problem.&lt;ref name=&quot;StopUsingFTP1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.jdpfu.com/2011/07/10/why-you-need-to-stop-using-ftp |title=Why You Need To Stop Using FTP  |publisher=JDPFu.com| date=2011-07-10 | accessdate=2012-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With FTP, the data, passwords and user name are all sent back and forth unencrypted.&lt;ref name=&quot;StopUsingFTP2&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://olex.openlogic.com/wazi/2011/stop-using-ftp-how-to-transfer-files-securely/ |title=Stop Using FTP! How to Transfer Files Securely | author=Manolis Tzanidakis | publisher=Wazi| date=2011-09-09 | accessdate=2012-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Anyone on the client's subnet, the server's subnet or any subnet in between can 'sniff' the passwords and data when FTP is used.  With extra effort it is possible to wrap FTP inside SSL or TLS, thus creating FTPS.  However, tunneling FTP over SSL/TLS is complex to do and far from an optimum solution.  

Unfortunately name confusion combined with the large number of posts and discussions created by complex, nit-picky tasks like wrapping FTP in SSL to provide FTPS, the wrong way still turns up commonly in web searches regarding file transfer.  In contrast, easy, relatively painless solutions vanish because it is rarely necessary to post how to do those.  Also, an easy solution can be summed up in very few lines and maybe a single answer.  Thus, there is still a lot of talk online about 'securing' FTP and very little mention of using SFTP.  It's a vicious cycle that this book hopes to help break:  Difficult task means lots of discussion and noise, lots of discussion and noise means strong web presence, strong web presence means high Google ranking.  

SFTP tools are very common, but might be taken for granted and thus overlooked.  SFTP tools are just as easy to use and more functional than old FTP clients.  In fact a lot of improvements have been made in usability.  There is no shortage of common, GUI-based SFTP clients to transfer files:  Filezilla,  Konqueror, Dolphin, Nautilus, Cyberduck, Fugu, and Fetch top the list but there are many more.  Most are Free Software.
These SFTP clients are very easy to use.  For example, in Konqueror, just type in the URL to the sftp server,  where the server name or address is xx.yy.zz.aa.  
&lt;pre&gt;
sftp://xx.yy.zz.aa
&lt;/pre&gt;
If it is desirable to start with a specific directory, then that too can be specified.  
&lt;pre&gt;
sftp://xx.yy.zz.aa/var/www/pictures/
&lt;/pre&gt;
One special client worth knowing about is sshfs.  With sshfs as an SFTP client the other machine is accessible as an open folder on your machine's local file system.  In that way any program you normally have to work with files, such as openoffice.org, inkscape or gimp can access the remote machine via that folder.

===Background of FTP===

FTP is from the 1970s. It's a well proven workhorse, but from an era when if you were on the net you were supposed to be there and if there was trouble it could usually be cleared up with a short phone call or an e-mail or two. It sends the login name, password and all of the data unencrypted for anyone to intercept.  
FTP clients can connect to the FTP server in either passive or active modes.  Both active and passive modes for FTP use two ports, one for control and one for data.  In FTP Active mode, after the client makes a connection to the FTP server it then allows an incoming connection to be initiated from the server to  for data transfer.  In FTP Passive mode, after the client makes a connection to the FTP server, the server then responds with information about a second port for data transfer and the client initiates the second connection. 
Thus FTP is most relevant now as Anonymous FTP, which is still excellent for read-only downloads without login. To transfer read-only data, FTP is still one way to go, as would be using the web (HTTP or HTTPS) or a P2P protocol like bittorrent are other options for offering read-only downloads. 
Using tcpdump to show FTP activity

An illustration of how the old protocol, FTP, is insecure can be had from the utility '''tcpdump'''.  It can show what is going over the network during an Anonymous FTP session, or for that matter any FTP session.  Look at the manual page for '''tcpdump''' for an explanation of the individual arguments, but the overall result of the usage below is that it displays the first FTP or FTP-Data packets going from the client to the server and vice versa. 

The output below hows an excerpt from the output of '''tcpdump''' which captured packets between an FTP client and the FTP server, one line per packet. 

&lt;pre&gt;
$ sudo tcpdump -q -s 0 -c 10 -A -i eth0 \
&quot;tcp and ( port ftp or port ftp-data) &quot;
tcpdump: verbose output suppressed, use -v or -vv for full protocol decode
listening on eth0, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet), capture size 65535 bytes
… 
:18:36.010820 IP desk.55227 &gt; server.ftp: tcp 16 E..D..@.@.....1.[.X.....G.r. ........l..... .&quot;......USER anonymous 
:18:36.073192 IP server.ftp &gt; desk.55227: tcp 0 E..4jX@.7.3.[.X...1..... ...G.r#........... .....&quot;.. 
:18:36.074019 IP server.ftp &gt; desk.55227: tcp 34 E..VjY@.7.3.[.X...1..... ...G.r#....Y...... .....&quot;..331 Please specify the password. 
:18:36.074042 IP desk.55227 &gt; server.ftp: tcp 0 E..4..@.@..+..1.[.X.....G.r# ..)........... .&quot;...... 
:18:42.098941 IP desk.55227 &gt; server.ftp: tcp 23 E..K..@.@.....1.[.X.....G.r# ..)....gv..... .&quot;.w....PASS user@example.net 
:18:42.162692 IP server.ftp &gt; desk.55227: tcp 23 E..KjZ@.7.3.[.X...1..... ..)G.r:........... .....&quot;.w230 Login successful.
… 
:18:43.431827 IP server.ftp &gt; desk.55227: tcp 14 E..Bj\@.7.3.[.X...1..... ..SG.rF.....j..... .....&quot;..221 Goodbye.
… 
&lt;/pre&gt;

As can be seen in lines 3 and 7, data, such as text, from the server is visible.  In lines 1 and 5, text entered by the user is visible, in this case including the user name and password used to log in.  Fortunately the session is Anonymous FTP, which is read-only and used for downloading.  Anonymous FTP is a rather efficient way to publish material for download.  For Anonymous FTP, the user name is always &quot;anonymous&quot; and the password the user’s e-mail address and the server's data always read-only.  

If you have the package openssh-server already installed, no further configuration of the server is needed to start using SFTP for file transfers.  Though comparatively speaking, FTPS is significantly more secure than FTP.  If you want remote remote login access, then both FTP and FTPS should be avoided.  A very large reason to avoid both is to save work.

===On FTPS===

FTPS is FTP tunneled over SSL or TLS.  A goal of FTP was to encourage the use of remote computers.  It, along with the web, has succeeded.  A goal of FTPS was to secure logins and transfers, and was a necessary step in securing file transfers with the legacy protocol.  

Since SFTP is so much easier to deploy and most systems now include both graphical and text-based SFTP clients, FTPS can really be considered deprecated for most occasions.  Some good background material can be found in the Request for Comments (RFCs) for FTP and FTPS.  There, SFTP and even HTTPS are better matches and largely supercede FTPS.  See the section on [[OpenSSH/Client Applications|Client Applications]] for an idea of the SFTP clients available.

==Privilege Separation==

Privilege separation is when a process is divided into sub-processes, each of which have just enough access to just the right services to do their part of the job.  An underlying principle is that of least privilege, which is where each process has exactly enough privileges to accomplish a task, neither more nor less.  The goal of privilege separation is to compartmentalize any corruption and prevent a corrupt process from accessing the entire system.  
Privilege separation is applied in OpenSSH by using several levels of access, some higher some lower, to run [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html sshd(8)] and its subsystems and components.  The server starts out with a privileged process which then creates an unprivileged process to work with the network traffic.  Once the user has authenticated, another unprivileged process is created with the privileges of that authenticated user.  

Privilege separation has been the default in OpenSSH since version 3.3&lt;ref name=&quot;Provos_Privilege_Separation&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.citi.umich.edu/u/provos/ssh/privsep.html |title=Privilege Separated OpenSSH  |publisher=University of Michigan| author=Nils Provos| accessdate=2011-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since version 5.9, privilege separation further applies mandatory restrictions on the system calls the privilege separated child can perform.  The intent is to prevent a compromised privilege separated child from being used to attack other hosts either by opening sockets and proxying or by probing local kernel attack surface. &lt;ref name=&quot;OpenSSH_release_notes_5.9&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.openssh.com/txt/release-5.9 |title=OpenSSH 5.9 Release Notes |publisher=OpenSSH | date=2011-09-06 | accessdate=2012-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since version 6.1, this sandboxing is the default.

== Tips ==

I've corrected the root page of [[OpenSSH]].  Most content there needs to go to subpages as it's supposed to be a contents page.  Headings start at level *two* as seen in the edit toolbar.  Level one headings are reserved for the page's title and print versions. Subpages need to have {{tl|BookCat}} on them in order to categorize them into the book's category.  For further tips, please see [[Using Wikibooks]]. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|discuss]]&lt;/small&gt; 15:56, 17 February 2011 (UTC)

== Blanking ==

Blanking a page does not delete it and the page will show up in our maintenance list of pages with no links to them.  If you are the only/major contributor to a page, please add {{tlx|speedy|Author request}} to the page to have an administrator delete it. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|discuss]]&lt;/small&gt; 13:44, 18 February 2011 (UTC)

&lt;/pre&gt;
The following pattern would match any host in the 192.168.0.1 - 192.168.0.9 range:

&lt;pre&gt;
Host 192.168.0.?
&lt;/pre&gt;
A pattern-list is a comma-separated list of patterns.  The following list of patterns match hosts in the &quot;.co.uk&quot; or &quot;.ac.uk&quot; domains.
&lt;pre&gt;
Host *.co.uk, *.ac.uk
&lt;/pre&gt;
Individual patterns by themselves or as part of a pattern-lists may be negated by preceding them with an exclamation mark ('''!''').  The following will match any host from ''example.org'' except for ''gamma''. 

&lt;pre&gt;
Host *.example.org !gamma.example.org
&lt;/pre&gt;


For example, to allow a key to be used from anywhere within an organisation except from the dialup pool, the following entry in '''authorized_keys''' could be used:
&lt;pre&gt;
from=&quot;!*.dialup.example.com,*.example.com&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

On the client side, '''ssh''', '''scp''' and '''sftp''' provide a wide range of capabilities.  Interactive logins and file transfers are just the tip of the iceberg.

: [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh_config&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html ssh_config(5)] - The client configuration file.

==The SSH client==

'''ssh''' is a program which provides the client side for secure, encrypted communications between  hosts over an insecure network.  Its main use is for logging into and  running programs on a remote host.  It can also be used to secure remote X11 connections and and forward arbitrary TCP ports to secure legacy protocols.
ssh is was made, in part, to replace insecure tools like '''rsh''' and '''telnet'''.  It has largely succeeded at this goal.  '''rsh''' and '''telnet''' are rarely seen anymore for interactive sessions or anywhere else.  
ssh can authenticate using regular passwords or with the help of a public-private key pair.  More options, such as use of Kerberos, smartcards, or one-time passwords can be configured.  

Remote login, authenticating via password:
&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh fred@somehost.example.org 
&lt;/pre&gt;

Another way of logging in to the same account:
&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh -l fred somehost.example.org
&lt;/pre&gt;

Remote programs can be run interactively when the client is run via the shell on the remote host.  Or they can be run directly when passed as an argument to the SSH client.  They can even be	 pre-configured in the authentication key or the server configuration.  

Run '''uname''' on the remote machine:
&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh -l fred  somehost.example.org  &quot;uname -a&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

See what file systems are mounted and how much space is used there:
&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh -l fred  somehost.example.org  &quot;mount; df -h&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

It is possible to configure in great detail which programs are allowed by which accounts.  There are many combinations of options that give extra capabilities, such as re-using a single connection for multiple sessions or passing through intermediary machines.  The level of granularity can be increased even more with the help of [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sudo&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html sudo(8)].  

===ssh client environment variables===

Of course the foundation of most SSH activity is based upon the shell.  Upon a successful connection, OpenSSH sets several environment variables. 

&lt;pre&gt;
SSH_CLIENT='192.168.223.17 36673 22'
SSH_CONNECTION='192.168.223.17 36673 192.168.223.229 22'
SSH_TTY=/dev/pts/6
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''SSH_CLIENT''' shows the address of the client system, the outgoing port number on the client system and the incoming port on the server.  '''SSH_CONNECTION''' shows the address of the client, the outgoing port on the client, the address of the server and the incoming port on the server.  '''SSH_TTY''' names the pseudo-terminal device, abbreviated Ppty, on the server used by the connection.  For more information on pseudo-terminals see [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=pty&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html pty(7)], [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=tty&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html tty(1)] and [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=tty&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=4&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html tty(4)].  

The login session can be constrained to a single program with a predetermined set of parameters using '''ForceCommand''' in the server configuration or '''Command=''' in the authorized keys file.  In that case an additional environment variable gets set.

&lt;pre&gt;
SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND=echo &quot;hello, world&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Other variables are set depending on the user's shell settings and the system's own settings.  

===SSH client configuration options===

Configuration options can be passed to '''ssh''' as arguments, see [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html ssh(1)] for the full list.

Connect very verbose output, GSSAPI authention: 
&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh -vv -K -l account host.example.org
&lt;/pre&gt;

A subset of options can be defined on the server host in the user's own authorized keys file, in conjunction with specific keys.  See [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html sshd(8)] for which subset exactly.  

&lt;pre&gt;
command=&quot;/usr/local/sbin/backup.sh&quot;,no-pty ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAQEAsY6u71N...
command=&quot;/usr/games/wump&quot;,no-port-forwarding,no-pty ssh-dss AAAAB3NzaC1kc3MAeELb...
environment=&quot;gtm_dist=/usr/local/gtm/utf8&quot;,environment=&quot;gtm_principal_editing=NOINSERT:EDITING&quot; ssh-rsa AAAA8a2s809poloh05yhh...
&lt;/pre&gt;

Note that some directives, like setting the environment variables, are disabled by default and must be changed in the server configuration before available to the client.  
More configuration directives can be set by the user in '''~/.ssh/config''' or by the system administrator in '''/etc/ssh/ssh_config'''.  These same configuration directives can be passed as arguments using '''-o'''.  See [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh_config&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html ssh_config(5)] for the full list with descriptions.  
&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh -o &quot;ServerAliveInterval=60&quot; -o &quot;Compression=yes&quot; -l fred server.example.org
&lt;/pre&gt;

The system administrators of the client host can set some defaults in '''/etc/ssh/config'''.  Some of these global settings can be targeted per specific group or per user.

For example, if a particular SSH server is available via port 2022, it may be convenient to have the client use that port automatically.  Some of OpenBSD’s anoncvs servers accept SSH connections on this port.  However,  compression should not be used in this case because CVS already uses compression.  So that should be turned off.  So, one could specify something like the following in the '''$HOME/.ssh/config''' configuration file so that the default port is 2022 and the connection is made without compression:

&lt;pre&gt;
Host server.example.org
     Compression no
     Port 2022
&lt;/pre&gt;

See [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh_config&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html ssh_config(5)] for the client side and [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd_config&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html sshd_config(5)] for the server side for the full lists with descriptions.

==The SFTP client==

'''sftp''' is an interactive file transfer program which performs all operations over an encrypted SSH transport.  It may also use many features of [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh ssh(1)], such as public key authentication and compression.  It is also the name of the protocol used.  

The SFTP protocol is similar in some ways to the now venerable File Transfer Protocol (FTP), except that the entire session, including the login, is encrypted.  However, SFTP is not FTPS.  The latter old-fashioned FTP tunneled over SSH/SSL.  In contrast, SFTP is actually a whole new protocol.  '''sftp''' can also be made to start in a specific directory on the remote host.  

&lt;pre&gt;
$ sftp fred@server.example.org:/var/www
&lt;/pre&gt;

Frequently, SFTP is used to connect and log into a specified host and enter an interactive command mode.  See the manual page for [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sftp sftp(1)] for the available interactive commands.  Also, the same configuration options that work for '''ssh''' also apply to '''sftp'''.  '''sftp''' accepts all '''ssh_config''' options and these can be passed along as arguments at run time.  Some have explicit shortcuts, others can be specified by naming them in full using the '''-o''' option.

&lt;pre&gt;
$ sftp -o &quot;ServerAliveInterval=60&quot; -o &quot;Compression=yes&quot; fred@server.example.org
&lt;/pre&gt;

Another way to transfer is to write or retrieve files automatically.  If a non-interactive authentication method is used, the whole process can be automatic using batch mode.

&lt;pre&gt;
$ sftp -b session.batch -i ~/.ssh/some_key_rsa fred@server.example.org
&lt;/pre&gt;

Batch processing only works with non-interactive authentication.

==The SCP client==

'''scp''' is used for encrypted transfers of files between hosts and is used a lot like regular '''cp'''.    It is based on and a replacement for '''rcp''' from the original Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD), but uses ssh to encrypt the connection.

The '''scp''' client, unlike the SFTP client, is not based on any formal standard.  It has aimed at doing more or less what old '''rcp''' does and responding the same way.  Since the same program must be used at both ends of the connection and interoperability is required with other implementations of '''ssh'''.  Changes in functionality would probably break that interoperability, so new features are more likely to be added to '''sftp''' if at all.  Thus, it is best to lean towards using '''sftp''' instead when possible.  

Copy from remote to local:
&lt;pre&gt;
$ scp myaccount@sftp.example.org:*.txt .
&lt;/pre&gt;

Copy from local to remote, recursively:
&lt;pre&gt;
$ scp -r /etc myaccount@sftp.example.org:.
&lt;/pre&gt;

See also the '''sftp''' client above.

==GUI Clients==

There are a great many graphical utilities that support SFTP and SSH.  Many started out as transfer utilities with the outdated legacy protocol FTP and grew with the times to include SSH and SFTP support.  Sadly, many retain the epithet FTP program despite modernization.  Others are more general file managers that include SFTP support as one means of network transparency.  Most if not all provide full SFTP support including kerberos authentication.  

Below is a partial list to give an idea of the range of options available.  

'''Bluefish''' is a website managment tool and web page editor with built in support for SFTP.  Closed source competitors XMetaL and Dreamweaver are said to have at least partial support for SFTP.  Nothing for Quanta+ or Kompozer as of this writing.  
http://bluefish.openoffice.nl/

'''Cyberduck''' is a remote file browser for the Macintosh.  It supports an impressive range of protocols in addition to SFTP.  
http://cyberduck.ch/

'''Dolphin''' is a highly functional file manager for the KDE desktop, but can also be run in other environments.  It includes SFTP support

'''Fetch''', by Fetch Softworks, is a reliable and well-known SFTP client for the Macintosh.  It's been around since 1989, starting life as just an FTP client, and has many useful features combined with ease of use.  It is closed source, but academic institutions are eligible for a free of charge site license.  
http://fetchsoftworks.com/fetch/

'''Filezilla''' is presented as a FTP utility, but it has built in support for SFTP.  It is available for multiple platforms under the GPL.  
http://filezilla-project.org/

'''FireFTP''' is a SFTP plugin for Mozilla Firefox.  Though it is presented as an FTP add-on, it supports SFTP.  It is available under both the MIT license and the GPL.
http://fireftp.mozdev.org/

'''Fugu''', developed by the University of Michigan research systems unix group, is a graphical front-end for the Macintosh.  
http://rsug.itd.umich.edu/software/fugu/

'''gFTP''' is a multi-threaded file transfer client
http://www.gftp.org/

'''Konqueror''' is a file manager and universal document viewer for the KDE desktop, but can also be run in other environments. It includes SFTP support.  
http://www.konqueror.org/

'''lftp''' is a file transfer program that supports multiple protocols.  
http://lftp.yar.ru/

'''Nautilus''' is the default file manager for the GNOME desktop, but can also be run in other environments.  It includes SFTP support

http://wiki.lxde.org/en/PCManFM

'''PuTTY''' is another FOSS implementation of Telnet and SSH for legacy and Unix platforms, released under the MIT license.  It includes an SFTP client, PSFTP, in addition to an xterm terminal emulator and other tools like a key agent, Paegent.   It is written and maintained primarily by Simon Tatham.  
http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html 

'''Thunar''' is the default file manager for the XFCE desktop.  It includes SFTP support.  
http://docs.xfce.org/xfce/thunar/start

      <text xml:space="preserve">One parameter per line is allowed in the configuration file with the parameter name followed by its value or values.  Empty lines and lines starting with the hash ('''#''') are ignored.  An equal sign ('''=''') can be used instead of whitespace between the parameter name and the values.  

Values are case-sensitive, but parameter names are not.  

==System-wide Client Configuration Files==

System-wide client files set the default configuration for all users of OpenSSH clients on that system.  These defaults can be overridden, in many cases, by the user's own default settings in a local configuration file.  Both can be overridden, in many cases, by specifying various options or parameters at run time.  The prioritization is as follows:  

# run time arguments via the shell
# user's own configuration
# system-wide configuration

The first value obtained is used.

===''/etc/ssh/ssh_config''===

This file defines all the default settings for the client utilities for all users on that system.  it must be readable by all users.  The configuration options are described in detail in [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh_config&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html ssh_config(5)].

Below a shortcut is made for connecting to ''arc.example.org''.  It is enough to enter '''ssh arc''' and the rest of the information gets filled in automatically.

&lt;pre&gt;
Host arc
     Port 2022
     HostName arc.example.org
     User fred
     IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_arc
&lt;/pre&gt;

===''/etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts''===

This contains the system-wide list of known host keys used to verify the identity of the remote host and thus hinder impersonation or eavesdropping.  This file should be prepared by the system administrator to contain the public host keys of all necessary hosts.  It should be world-readable. 

See '''~/.ssh/known_hosts''' below for more explanation or see [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html sshd(8)] for further details of the format of this file.

===''/etc/ssh/sshrc''===

Programs in this file are executed by '''ssh''' when the user logs in, just before the user's shell or designated program is started.  It is not run as root, but instead as the user who is logging in.  See the [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html sshd(8)] manual page in the section SSHRC for more information.

==User-specific Client Configuration Files==

Users can override the default system-wide client settings and choose their own defaults.  For situations where the same change is made repeatedly it can make save work to add them to the user's local configuration.  

===''~/.ssh/config''===

The user's own configuration file which, where applicable, overrides the settings in the global client configuration file, '''/etc/ssh/ssh_config'''.  The configuration options are described in detail in [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh_config&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html ssh_config(5)].  

This file must ''not'' be accessible to other users in any way.  Set strict permissions: read/write for the user, and not accessible by others.  It may group-writable if and only if that user is the only member of the group in question.

===''~/.ssh/environment''===

If the server is configured to accept user-supplied, automatic changes to environment variables as part of the login process, then these changes can be set in this file.  

If the server, the environment file and an authorization key all try to change the same variable, the file environment takes precedence over what a key might contain.  Either one will override any environment variables that might have been passed by '''ssh''' using '''SendEnv'''.  See also the '''AcceptEnv''' and '''PermitUserEnvironment''' directives in the manual page for [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd_config&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html sshd_config(5)].  

Authentication keys stored in '''authorized_keys''' can also be used to set variables.  

===''~/.ssh/rc''===

This is a script which is executed by [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sh&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html sh(1)] just before the user's shell or command is started.  It is not run if '''ForceCommand''' is used.  The script is run after reading the environment variables.  The corresponding global file, '''/etc/ssh/sshrc''', is not run if the user's '''rc''' script exists.

===''~/.shosts''===
===''~/.rhosts''===
'''.rhosts''' is a legacy from rsh containing a local list of trusted host-user pairs that are allowed to log in.  Login requests matching an entry are granted access.  

See also the global list of trusted host-user pairs, '''/etc/hosts.equiv'''

'''rhosts''' can be used as part of host-based authentication.  Otherwise it is recommended not to use rhosts for authentication, there are a lot of ways to misconfigure the rhosts file.

===''~/.ssh/authorized_keys''===

'''authorized_keys''' is a one-key-per-line register of public ECDSA, RSA and ED25519 keys that this account can use to log in with.  The file's contents are not highly sensitive, but the recommended permissions are read/write for the user and not accessible by others.  The whole key including options and comments must be on a single, unbroken line. 

&lt;pre&gt;
ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAA...41Ev521Ei2hvz7S2QNr1zAiVaOFy5Lwc8Lo+Jk=
&lt;/pre&gt;

Lines starting with a hash (#) are ignored.  Whitespace is used to separate the key's fields.  They are, in sequence, an optional list of login options, the key type (usually ssh-dss or ssh-rsa), the key itself encoded as base64, and an optional comment.  

If a key is followed by an annotation, the comment does not need to be wrapped in quotes.  It has no effect on what the key does or how it works.  

&lt;pre&gt;
# an annotated key
ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAA...zAiVaOFy5Lwc8Lo+Jk=  Fred @ Project FOOBAR
&lt;/pre&gt;

Keys can be preceded by a comma-separated list of options to affect what happens upon successful login.  See the next section, [[OpenSSH/Client_Configuration_Files#Available_key_login_options |Available key login options]], for details.  

&lt;pre&gt;
# launch tinyfugue automatically
command=&quot;/usr/bin/tinyfugue&quot; ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAA...OFy5Lwc8Lo+Jk=

# set the PATH
environment=&quot;PATH=/bin:/usr/bin/:/opt/gtm/bin&quot; ssh-rsa AAAAB3N...4Y2t1j=
&lt;/pre&gt;

The format of '''authorized_keys''' is described in the [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html sshd(8)] manual page.  Old keys should be deleted from the file when no longer needed.

===''~/.ssh/authorized_principals''===

By default this file does not exist.  If it is specified in [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd_config&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html sshd_config(5)], it contains a list of names which can be used in place of the username when authorizing a certificate.   This option is useful for role accounts, disjoint account namespaces and &quot;user@realm&quot;-style naming policies in certificates.  Principals can also be specified in '''authorized_keys'''.

===''~/.ssh/known_hosts''===

As with ''/etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts'', this file contains the known keys for hosts that have been connected to in the past and is used to verify the identity of the remote host and protect against impersonation or man-in-the-middle attacks.  With each subsequent connection the key will be compared to the key provided by the remote server.   If there is a match, the connection will proceed.  If the match fails, ''ssh(1)'' will fail with an error message.  If there is no key at all listed for that remote host, then the key's fingerprint will be displayed and there will be the option to automatically add the key to the file.  This file can be created and edited manually, but if it does not exist it will be created automatically by [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html ssh(1)] when it first connects to a remote host.

===Local override of defaults===

Not all options can be set or overriden by the user.  Those options which may be set or overridden by the user can by defined at the end of the user's configuration, '''~/.ssh/config''', file by matching all hosts.  Those options which may not be set or overridden will be ignored.
&lt;pre&gt;
Host *
     ExitOnForwardFailure	yes
     Protocol	2
     ServerAliveInterval	400
&lt;/pre&gt;

==Available key login options==

The login options available for use in the local user authorized keys file might be overridden or blocked by the server's own settings.  

===cert-authority===

Specifies that the listed key is a certification authority (CA) trusted to validate signed certificates for user authentication.  Certificates may encode access restrictions similar to key options.  If both certificate restrictions and key restrictions are present, then the most restrictive union of the two is applied.  

===command=&quot;''program''&quot;===

Specifies a program, with options, that is executed when this key is used for authentication.  

The program is run on a pty if the client requests it, otherwise the default is to run without a tty.  The default, running without a tty, provides an 8-bit clean channel.  If the default has been changed, specify no-pty to get an 8-bit clean channel.
&lt;pre&gt;  
no-pty,command=&quot;&quot; ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAA...OFy5Lwc8Lo+Jk=
&lt;/pre&gt;

Quotes provided in the program's options must be escaped using a backslash.  ('\')
&lt;pre&gt;
command=&quot;sh -c \&quot;mysqldump db1 -u fred1 -p\&quot;&quot; ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc...Lwc8OFy5Lo+kU=
&lt;/pre&gt;

This option applies to execution of the shell, another program or subsystem.  Thus any other program specified by the user is ignored, but the program originally specified by the client remains available as the environment variable '''SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND'''.  

This way of forcing a program is useful to restrict a key to a single, specific operation, such as a remote backup.  However, TCP and X11 forwarding are still allowed unless explicitly disabled elsewhere.

===environment=&quot;''NAME''=''value''&quot;===

Sets the value of an environment variable when this key is used to log in.  It overrides default values of the variable, if it exists.  This option can be repeated to set multiple variables.  
This option is only allowed if the '''PermitUserEnvironment''' option is set.  The default is disabled, and this option becomes disabled automatically when '''UseLogin''' is enabled.

===from=&quot;''pattern-list''&quot;===

The canonical name of the remote host or its IP address required in addition to the key.              Addresses and hostnames can be listed using a comma-separated list of patterns, see PATTERNS in [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh_config&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html ssh_config(5)] for more information on patterns, or the CIDR address/masklen notation.

===no-agent-forwarding===

Forbids authentication agent forwarding when this key is used for authentication.

===no-port-forwarding===

Forbids TCP forwarding and any port forward requests by the client will return an error when this key is used for authentication.  
===no-pty===
tty allocation is prohibited and any request to allocate a pty will fail.  
===no-user-rc===
Use the '''no-user-rc''' option in '''authorized_keys''' to disable execution of '''~/.ssh/rc'''

===no-X11-forwarding===
Prevents X11 forwarding when this key is used for authentication, and requests to forward X11 will return an error.

===permitopen=&quot;''host'':''port''&quot;===
Limits local port forwarding ('''ssh -L''') to only the specified host and port.  IPv6 addresses can be specified with an alternative syntax: host/port.  Multiple permitopen options may be used and must be separated by commas.  No pattern matching is performed on the specified host names, they must be literal host names or IP addresses.  Used in conjunction with agent-forwarding.

===principals=&quot;''name1''[,''name2'',...]&quot;===
Specify a list of names that may be used in place of the username when authorizing a certificate trusted via the [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd_config&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html sshd_config(5)] '''TrustedCAKeys''' option.

===tunnel=&quot;''n''&quot;===
Select a specific [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=tun&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html tun(4)] device on the server.  Otherwise when a tunnel device is requested without this option the next available device will be used.

==User-specific Keys==
'''ssh''' uses ECDSA, RSA or DSA key pairs to verify hosts or authenticate users.  Individual user accounts can maintain their own list of keys or certificates for authentication or  to verify the identity of remote hosts.  

===Public Keys from other Hosts – ~/.ssh/known_hosts===
'''known_hosts''' is for verifying the identity of other systems.  It contains a list of public keys for all the hosts which the user has logged into.  It can also include public keys for hosts that the user plans to log into but are not already in the system-wide list of known host keys.  '''ssh''' automatically adds keys to the user file, but they can be added manually as well.  Usually when connecting to a host for the first time, ssh adds the remote host's public key to the user's '''known_hosts''' file.  

The format is one public key or certificate per unbroken line.  Each line in contains a hostname, number of bits, exponent, and modulus.  At the beginning of the line is either the host name or a hash representing the host name.  An optional comment can follow at the end of the line.  These can be preceded by an optional marker to indicate a certificate authority, if a certificate is used instead of a SSH key.  These fields are separated by spaces.  It is possible to use a comma-separated list of the hostname.  

&lt;pre&gt;
# keys with basic hostnames
anoncvs.fr.openbsd.org,93.184.34.123 ssh-rsa AAAA...njvPw==
anoncvs.eu.openbsd.org ssh-rsa AAAAB3Nz...cTqGvaDhgtAhw==
&lt;/pre&gt;

Non-standard ports can be indicated by enclosing the hostname with square brackets and followed by a colon and the port number.  

&lt;pre&gt;
# key with non-standard port
[ssh.example.org]:2222 ssh-rsa AAAAB3Nz...AKy2R2OE=
[127.0.0.2]:4922 ssh-rsa AAAAB4mV...1d6j=
[anga.funkfeuer.at]:2022,[78.41.115.130]:2022 ssh-rsa AAAAB...fgTHaojQ==
&lt;/pre&gt;

Hostname patterns can be created using &quot;'''*'''&quot; and &quot;'''?'''&quot; as wildcards and &quot;'''!'''&quot; to indicate negation. 
#

Up to one optional marker per line is allowed. If present it must be either '''@cert-authority''' or '''@revoked'''.  The former shows that the key is a certificate authority key, the latter flags the key as revoked and not acceptable for use.   

See [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html sshd(8)] for further details of the format of this file and [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh-keygen&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html ssh-keygen(1)] for managing the keys.

==Manually Adding Public Keys to ~/.ssh/known_hosts ==

Manually adding public host keys to known_hosts is a matter of adding one unbroken line per key.  How the key is obtained is not important, as long as it is complete, valid and '''guaranteed to be the real key and not a fake'''.  
[http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh-keyscan&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html ssh-keyscan(1)] can fetch a key and [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh-keygen&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html ssh-keygen(1)] can be used to show the fingerprint for verification.  See examples in the cookbook chapter for methods of verification.  
The corresponding system-wide file is '''/etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts'''

===Local User's Public / Private Key Pairs===
Users might have a variety of their own ECDSA, Ed25519, RSA and DSA keys around for various tasks and projects.   The naming convention for keys is only a convention, but recommended to follow anyway.  Public keys usually have the same name as the private key, but with '''.pub''' appended to the name.
  
====Public Keys –  ~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub	~/.ssh/id_ecdsa.pub	~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub	~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub====

Public keys are used for authentication.  Public keys are not sensitive and are allowed to be readable by anyone, unlike the private keys, but don't need to be.

====Private Keys –  ~/.ssh/id_dsa	~/.ssh/id_ecdsa	~/.ssh/id_ed25519	~/.ssh/id_rsa====

These private keys are sensitive data and should be readable by the user but not accessible by others, mode 0600.  The directory they are in should also have mode 0700 or 0500.  If a private key file is accessible by others, ssh will ignore it.  

It is possible to specify a passphrase when generating the key which will be used to encrypt the sensitive part of this file using AES128.  Until version 5.3, the cipher 3DES was used to encrypt the passphrase.  Old keys using 3DES that are given new passphrases will use AES128 when they are modified.

====Legacy Protocol Keys ~/.ssh/identity	~/.ssh/identity.pub====
identity and identity.pub are for ssh protocol version 1, and thus deprecated.

==User-specific Public Key Authentication==

Users can authenticate using a private key stored on their system or fetched from a smartcard if the corresponding public key is stored on the system being connected to in '''authorized_keys'''. 
It is not highly sensitive, but the recommended permissions are read/write for the user, and not accessible by others.

The keys can be preceded by a comma-separated list of options.  The whole key must be on a single, unbroken line.  No spaces are permitted, except within double quotes.  Any text after the key is considered a comment.  
See the section above on the '''authorized_keys''' file for more discussion.  The '''authorized_keys''' file is a one-key-per line register of public RSA and DSA keys that can be used to log in as this user.  

User-specified Host-based Authentication Configuration is also possible using the '''~/.shosts''',  '''~/.rhosts''',  '''~/.ssh/environment''', and '''~/.ssh/rc''' files.


==Managing Keys==

When working with keys there are some basic, common sense actions that should take place to prevent problems.  

Keys should use strong pass phrases.  If autonomous logins are required, then  the keys should be first loaded into an agent and used from there.  See [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh-add&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html ssh-add(1)] to get started there.  It uses [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh-agent&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html ssh-agent(1)] which many systems have installed and some have running by default.  

Keys should always be stored in protected locations, even on the client side. This is especially important for private keys.  The private keys should not have read permissions for any user or group other than the owner.  They should also be kept in a directory that is not accessible by anyone other than the owner in order to limit exposure.

Old and unused keys should be removed from the server.  In particular, keys without a known, valid purpose should be removed and not allowed to accumulate.  Using the comment field in the public key for annotation can help eliminate some of the confusion as to the purpose and owner when time has passed.  Along those lines, keys should be rotated at intervals.  In practice, rotation means generating new key pairs and removing the old ones.  This gives a chance to remove old and unused keys. It is also an opportunity to review access needs, whether access is required and if so at what level.  

Following the principle of least privilege can limit the chance for accidents or abuse.  If a key is only needed to run a specific application or script, then its login options should be limited to just what is needed.  See [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html sshd(8)] for the ''Authorized_keys File Format'' section on key login options.  For root level access, it is important to remember to configure '''/etc/sudoers''' appropriately.  Access there can be granted to a specific application and even limit that application to specific options.

== For beginners, Fibonacci not the best choice ==

This is an introduction page.  

If the target audience for this page is a user already familiar with mathematics and programming, a Fibonacci-series example can make sense.  If however, the target reader is new to programming or not that savvy mathematically, Fibonacci is not a good choice.  May I suggest the example code be replaced with something newcomers to Python are more likely to relate to?

Further, while &quot;a,b = 0,1&quot; is a valid Python construct it confuses readers new to Python, especially without explanation.  Python is a very powerful language but it would be better to use more conventional constructs lest the newcomer see Python as too complex and not worth the time to delve deeper.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The OpenSSH Server, [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html sshd(8)], listens for connections from clients and starts a new daemon for each new incoming connection, except in the case of multiplexing, to handle key exchange, encryption, authentication, program execution, and data exchange.  It can run standalone and wait in the background or it can be loaded on demand by [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=inetd&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html inetd(8)].  

==sshd==

[http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd sshd(8)] is the secure shell daemon and it listens for incoming connections.  The standard port for [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh ssh(1)] as specified by IANA is 22 &lt;ref name=&quot;IANA_ports&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ietf.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-names-port-numbers.txt |title=Service Name and Transport Protocol Port Number Registry |publisher=IETF |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  .  If [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd sshd(8)] does not listen to a privileged port, it does not have to be launched by root.  However there are few, if any occasions where a non-standard port should be considered.  
[http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd sshd(8)] can be bound to multiple addresses or just certain ones.  Multiple instances of [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd sshd(8)], each with a different configuration, can be run on the same machine, someting which may be useful on multi-homed machines.  
An absolute path must be given to launch [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd sshd(8)], i.e. '''/usr/sbin/sshd'''

Configuration data is parsed first from the arguments and options passed by the shell, the user-specific file, and lastly the system-wide configuration file.
 
:[http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd sshd(8)] - The ssh daemon that permits you to log in.

:[http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sftp-server sftp-server(8)] - SFTP server subsystem, started automatically by sshd when needed.
:[http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh-keysign ssh-keysign(8)] - Helper program for hostbased authentication.

:[http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd_config sshd_config(5)] - The server configuration file.

[http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd sshd(8)] can be made to parse the configuration file, test it for validity and then report the effective configuration settings.  This is done by running the extended test mode ('''-T''').   The extended test will print out the actual server settings.  It can also report modifications to the settings through use of the '''Match''' directive when combined with the connection specification ('''-C''') parameter.  The options for '''-C''' are '''user''', '''host''', and '''addr'''.  This is where '''host''' and '''addr''' refer to the host running [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd sshd(8)] and the address from which the connection is being made, respectively.

The following will print out the configurations that will be applied if the user ''fred'' tries to log in to the host ''server.example.org'' from the address ''192.168.100.5''.
&lt;pre&gt;
/usr/sbin/sshd -TC user=fred,host=server.example.org,addr=192.168.100.5
&lt;/pre&gt;

The output is long, so it might be sensible to pipe it through sort(1) or less(1).  See the section on [[OpenSSH/Logging#Debugging_a_server_configuration| Debugging a Server Configuration]] for more options.

By default, login is allowed for all groups.  However, if '''AllowGroups''' or '''AllowUsers''' is specified, then all users or groups not listed are prohibited from logging in.   The allow/deny directives are processed in the following order: 
# '''DenyUsers''', 
# '''AllowUsers''', 
# '''DenyGroups''', and finally, 
# '''AllowGroups'''.  

The first pattern matched takes effect, so if '''AllowUsers''' exists it will completely override '''AllowGroups''' regardless of the order in which they appear in the configuration file.   So for the most flexibility, it is recommended to use '''AllowGroups'''.   In contrast, '''DenyUsers''' and '''DenyGroups''' do not interfere with each other and may be used together.  List group names or patterns of group names, separated by spaces.  If specified, login is allowed or denied only for users who are members of a group that matches a group or pattern on the list.  Only group or user names are valid; numerical group or user IDs are not recognized.

==sshd under inetd / xinetd==

[http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=inetd&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html inetd(8)], the Internet services daemon, is a server to launch other servers on demand.  [http://linux.die.net/man/8/xinetd xinetd(8)] and [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=inetd&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html inetd(8)] are two variants.  All variants will be referred to as [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=inetd&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html inetd(8)] in this book.  [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=inetd&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html inetd(8)] can be used to specify additional parameters and constraints, including running the launched service as a particular user and group.  By having a single daemon active, which invokes others as needed, demands on the system can be reduced.  Launching [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html sshd(8)] this way means [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=inetd&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html inetd(8)] waits for an incoming request, launches [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html sshd(8)] and then when the SSH session is over, closes [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html sshd(8)].

There are many more possibilities.  See the manual pages for [http://linux.die.net/man/5/xinetd.conf xinetd.conf(5)] or [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=inetd.conf&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html inetd.conf(5)] for a full overview of [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=inetd&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html inetd(8)] configuration options.  

[http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=inetd&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html inetd(8)] is '''tcpd'''-aware and can make use of '''tcpd''''s tcpwrappers to further control access or logging.  So was [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html sshd(8)] by itself, up through 6.6.  See the manual pages for [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=hosts_access&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=5&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html hosts_access(5)] for more information about how to use the configuration files '''hosts.allow''' and '''hosts.deny'''.  Since 6.7, OpenSSH itself no longer supports tcpwrappers.  

The two main disadvantages with [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=inetd&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html inetd(8)] are that there can be a slight increase in the delay during the start of the connection and that [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html sshd(8)] must be configured to allow launching from [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=inetd&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html inetd(8)].  The delay only affects the initial connection and thus does not get in the way of actual operation.  [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=inetd&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html inetd(8)] should not be used for stateless services like http, where every action is essentially a new connection.  Again, see the manual page for [http://linux.die.net/man/5/xinetd.conf xinetd.conf(5)] or [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=inetd.conf&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html inetd.conf(5)] for more details.

One advantage with [http://linux.die.net/man/8/xinetd xinetd(8)] over

==The SFTP Server Subsystem==

The SFTP subsystem first appeared in OpenBSD 2.8 / OpenSSH 2.3&lt;ref name=&quot;OpenSSH_2.3.0p1_Release_Notes&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.openssh.com/txt/release-2.3.0p1 |title=OpenSSH 2.3.0p1 release notes |publisher=OpenSSH.org |month=November |year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  It is called by [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html sshd(8)] as needed using the Subsystem option and not intended to operate standalone.  There are two forms of the subsystem.  One is the regular sftp-server.  The other is an in-process SFTP server, which requires no support files when used with ''ChrootDirectory''.  The '''Subsystem''' configuration directive can be used to pass options: 

'''-d''' specifies an alternate starting directory for users, the default is the user's home directory.  (First in 6.2)

&lt;pre&gt;
Subsystem sftp internal-sftp -d /var/www
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''-e''' causes logging information to be sent to ''stderr'' instead of syslog.  

&lt;pre&gt;
Subsystem sftp internal-sftp -e
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''-f''' specifies the syslog facility code that is used when logging messages from sftp-server.  The possible values are: DAEMON, USER, AUTH, LOCAL0, LOCAL1, LOCAL2, LOCAL3, LOCAL4, LOCAL5, LOCAL6, LOCAL7.   

&lt;pre&gt;
# the actual path will vary from distro to distro
Subsystem    sftp    /usr/libexec/sftp-server -f LOCAL0
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''-l''' Specifies which messages will be logged by sftp-server.  The default is AUTH.  The other possible values are: QUIET, FATAL, ERROR, INFO, VERBOSE, DEBUG, DEBUG1, DEBUG2, and DEBUG3.  INFO and VERBOSE log transactions that sftp-server performs on behalf of the client.  DEBUG and DEBUG1 are equivalent while DEBUG2 and DEBUG3 each specify higher levels of debugging output.  Log levels DEBUG through DEBUG3 will violate user privacy and should not be used for regular operation.  The default log level is ERROR.

&lt;pre&gt;
# the actual path will vary from distro to distro
Subsystem    sftp    /usr/libexec/sftp-server -l VERBOSE
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''-p''' and '''-P''' specify whitelisted and blacklisted protocol requests, respectively.  The comma separated lists are permitted or prohibitted accordingly, the blacklist  is applied first if both are used.  '''-Q''' provides a list of protocol features supported by the server.  All three are available as of version 6.5. 

In version 6.5 ''requests'' are the only protocol features queriable.

&lt;pre&gt;
/usr/libexec/sftp-server -Q requests
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''-R''' places the SFTP subsystem in read-only mode.  Attempts to change the filesystem, including opening files for writing, will fail.

'''-u''' overrides the user's default umask and explicity sets the [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=umask&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html umask(2)] to be used for creating files and directories.  
See the manual page for [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=syslog.conf&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=5&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html syslog.conf(5)] for more information about log level or log facility.  
sshd must be able to access '''/dev/log''' for logging to work.  Using the sftp-server subsystem in conjunction with sshd's '''ChrootDirectory''' option therefore requires that syslogd(8) establish a logging node inside the chroot directory.

&lt;pre&gt;
# umask for sftp subsystem OpenSSH 5.4 and later
Subsystem sftp internal-sftp -u 0002
&lt;/pre&gt;

==Environment Variables==

[http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html ssh(1)] and [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html sshd(8)] set some environment variables automatically when logging in.  Other variables can be explicitly defined by users in '''~/.ssh/environment''' if the file exists and the user is allowed to change the environment.  Variables can also be set on a key by key basis in the '''authorized_keys''' file, if the user is allowed to change the environment.

In '''~/.ssh/environment''', the format '''NAME=value''' is used to set the variable.  In '''~/.ssh/authorized_keys''' and '''/etc/ssh/authorized_keys''' the format is '''environment=&quot;NAME=value&quot;'''

For more information, see the '''PermitUserEnvironment''' and '''AcceptEnv''' options in [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd_config&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html sshd_config(5)] and the '''AcceptEnv''' option in [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh_config&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html ssh_config(5)].

The following variables can be set by [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html ssh(1)], depending on the situation.  

'''DISPLAY'''	If X11 is tunnelled, this is set with the '''DISPLAY''' variable indicates the location of the X11 server.  It is automatically set by [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html ssh(1)] to point to a value of the form ''hostname'':''n'', where ''hostname'' indicates the host where the shell runs, and ''n'' is an integer greater than or equal to one.  [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html ssh(1)] uses this special value to forward X11 connections over the secure channel.  The user should normally not set '''DISPLAY''' explicitly, as that will render the X11 connection insecure (and will require the user to manually copy any required authorization cookies).

'''HOME'''	The path of the user's home directory.

'''LOGNAME'''	Synonym for USER; set for compatibility with systems that use this variable.

'''MAIL'''	The path of the user's mailbox.

'''PATH'''	The default PATH, as specified when compiling ssh.

'''SSH_ASKPASS'''	If '''DISPLAY''' and '''SSH_ASKPASS''' are both set, and ssh does not have a terminal associated with it, it will execute the program specified by '''SSH_ASKPASS''' and open an X11 window to read the passphrase when one is needed.  This is particularly useful when calling ssh from a xsession or related script.  On some machines it may be necessary to redirect the input from '''/dev/null''' to make this work.

'''SSH_AUTH_SOCK'''	The path on the client machine to tell ssh the UNIX-domain socket used to communicate with a ssh key agent.

'''SSH_CLIENT'''	Identifies the client end of the connection.  It contains three space-separated values: the client IP address, client port number and the server port number.  

'''SSH_CONNECTION'''	Identifies the client and server ends of the connection.  The variable contains four space-separated values: client IP address, client port number, server IP address, and server port number.

'''SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND'''	If ForceCommand was used, then this variable contains the original command line if a forced command is executed.  It can be used to extract the original arguments.

'''SSH_TTY'''	This is set to the name of the tty (path to the device) associated with the current shell or command.  If the current session has no tty, this variable is not set.

'''TZ'''	This variable is set to indicate the present time zone if it was set when the daemon was started (i.e. the daemon passes the value on to new connections).

'''USER'''	Set to the name of the user logging in.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Leandro Fernández de Moratín (1760-1828) is an important Spanish author of the late 18th and early 19th centuries. One of his most notable works in the late 18th century is &quot;La comedia nueva&quot; (The new comedy, 1792).

==&quot;The new comedy&quot;==

&quot;The new comedy&quot;. Time: 1790s. Place: Madrid, Spain. 

&quot;The new comedy&quot; text at ?

[[File:Ilustración para La comedia nueva o el café (L. F. Moratín).jpg|thumb|Eluterio seeks his friends' approval of his play. Paris edition of &quot;The new comedy&quot;, 1825]]

Eluterio has written his first comedy entitled &quot;The siege of Vienna&quot;, which he reads aloud to Antonio and Pedro, about a woman who dies after starving for six days, but not before pronouncing a very long diatribe against a vizier. Antonio murmurs some mild compliments, but Pedro calls it stupid. Hermogenus, devoted to Eluterio's sister, Mariquita, arrives to settle the question. According to Eluterio, he is the &quot;most eminently capable arbiter of the question that so agitates us&quot;. Hermogenus admits that Eluterio has arrived at the &quot;pinnacle of knowledge&quot;. But before judgment is rendered, Pedro leaves in disgust. Because Hermogenus is threatened by his landlord for failing to pay his rent for 18 months, he and Eluterio are counting on the play's success. Mariquita has doubts about Hermogenus' sincerity either towards the play or herself, which is regrettable, because her own love has no limits. &quot;Has a Pyramus, a Marc Antony, Ptolemies of Egypt or all the Seleucides of Assyria ever nourished a flame like mine that burns up all my being?&quot; she asks. Agustina, sister to Eluterio, also has aspirations as an author. She complains of often being distracted from writing by nursing her children: &quot;For learned women, fecundity is a malediction,&quot; she asserts. Hermogenus waxes eloquent on the subject of poetry, certain that &quot;verses are written thanks to the pineal gland...&quot; But the group is abashed on learning from Eluterio that only three copies of his play were sold. In talking thus, no one has noticed that Hermogenus' watch has stopped and they are late for the opening of the play. Pedro encounters Antonio, not having remained to the end of the play. He reports that he heard among the crowd &quot;a low grumbling sound, harbinger of the storm.&quot;  The group re-enters, defeated. Mariquita reports on the public reaction: &quot;How agitated they were, how they coughed, how they yawned! At last from all sides infernal noise!&quot; The famine scene was interrupted by ironic applause and out the public went. Hermogenus now agrees with public opinion, and is cursed by all for his hypocrisy. Having lost him, Mariquita is anxious for her future: &quot;Sixteen already, and without a husband!&quot; she exclaims. Due to the play's bad reception, Eluterio is worried as well, mainly about his finances, all the more so with having to care for a family of four children, none older than six years old. However, Pedro hires him to free him of his debts.

==ssh-agent==

'''ssh-agent''' is a tool to hold private keys in memory for re-use during a session.  Usually it is started at the beginning of a session and subsequent windows or programs run as clients to the agent.

==ssh-add==

'''ssh-add''' is a tool to load key identities into an agent for re-use.  It can also be used to remove identities from the agent.  The agent holds the private keys used for authentication.

==ssh-keyscan==

'''ssh-keyscan''' has been part of the OpenSSH suite since OpenSSH version 2.5.1 and is used to retrieve public keys.  Keys retrieved using '''ssh-keyscan''', or any other method, must be verified by checking the key fingerprint to ensure the authenticity of the key and reduce the possibility of a man-in-the-middle attack.  The default is to request a ECDSA key using SSH protocol 2.  
David Mazieres wrote the initial version of '''ssh-keyscan''' and Wayne Davison added support for SSH protocol version 2.

==ssh-keygen==
'''ssh-keygen''' is used to generate key pairs for use in authentication, update and manage keys or to verify key fingerprints.  It can generate either ECDSA, Ed25519, RSA or DSA keys and can do the following: 

* generate new key pairs, either ECDSA, Ed25519, RSA or DSA
* remove keys from known hosts
* regenerate a public key from a private key
* change the passphrase of a private key
* change the comment text of a private key
* show the fingerprint of a specific public key
* show ASCII art fingerprint of a specific public key
* load or read a key to or from a smartcard, if the reader is available

If the legacy protocol, SSH1, is used, then '''ssh-keygen''' can only generate RSA keys.  

One important use for key fingerprints is when connecting to a machine for the first time.  A fingerprint is a hash or digest of the public key.  Fingerprints can be sent ahead of time out of band via post, fax, SMS or other means not related to the Internet.  

The verification data for the key should be sent out of band, not done via the Internet.  It can be sent ahead of time by post, fax, SMS or a phone call instead or some other way you can be sure it is an authentic and unchanged key.  

&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh -l fred centipede.example.org
The authenticity of host 'centipede.example.org (192.168.212.24)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is 7c:c7:8d:23:69:fc:2d:e7:b3:26:7c:03:6f:b3:97:3e.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?
&lt;/pre&gt;

If you see that and the key matches what your were given in advance, the connection is probably good.  If you see that and the key is different than what you were given in advance, then stop and disconnect and get on the phone or voip to work out the mistake.  Once the SSH client has accepted the key from the server, it is saved in '''known_hosts'''.  

&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh -l fred centipede.example.org
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
@    WARNING: REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED!     @
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SOMEONE IS DOING SOMETHING NASTY!
Someone could be eavesdropping on you right now (man-in-the-middle attack)!
It is also possible that the RSA host key has just been changed.
The fingerprint for the RSA key sent by the remote host is
37:af:05:99:e7:fb:86:6c:98:ee:14:a6:30:06:bc:f0.

Offending key in /home/fred/.ssh/known_hosts:2
RSA host key for 192.168.212.24 has changed and you have requested strict checking.
Host key verification failed.
&lt;/pre&gt;

If you start to connect to a known host and you get an error like the one above, then either the first connection was to an impostor or the current connection is to an impostor, or something very foolish was done to the machine.  Regardless, disconnect and don't try to log in.  Contact the system administrator out of band to find out what is going on.&lt;ref name=&quot;SecurityFocus2004&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author=Brian Hatch |url=http://www.securityfocus.com/infocus/1806
 |title=SSH Host Key Protection |publisher=SecurityFocus |year=2004 |accessdate=2013-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is possible that the server was reinstalled, either the whole OS or just the OpenSSH server, without saving the old keys resulting in new keys being generated.  Either way, check with the system administrator before connecting to be sure.  

It is possible to use more than one key per account or the same key on more than one machine.  Single-use keys allow some remote data transfer tasks to be automated fairly securely.  

The public keys of the hosts you have verified the connections to are stored in '''known_hosts''' whereas the public keys of the users you accept logins from are kept in '''authorized_keys'''.  There are also global files kept on each machine though each account has its own local ones.  

When generating keys use good, solid passphrases.  Good passphrases are 10 to 30 characters in length and are not simple sentences or otherwise easily guessable words or phrases from any language.  It should contain a mixture of upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and non-alphanumeric characters.  Passphrases can be changed later, but there is no way to recover a lost passphrase.  If the passphrase is lost or forgotten, the key is useless and must be replaced with a new key pair.  Hashed host names and addresses can be looked up in '''known_hosts''' using '''-F''' or '''-R''' can be used to delete them.

&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh-keygen -F sftp.example.org -f ~/.ssh/known_hosts
# Host sftp.example.org found: line 7 type RSA
|1|slYCk3msDPyGQ8l0lq82IbUTzBU=|KN7HPqVnJHOFX5LFmTXS6skjK4o= ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAABIwAAAIEA3cqqA6fZtgexZ7+4wxoLN1+YDvPfBtt4/m+N/RI8o95CXqvqZMIQjuVarVKjwRwt9pTJIVzf6bwjcNkrUx9dQqZNpNBkcvBRdmd775opWCAfkHEueKxkNx3Kb1yitz0dUaFkRwfTsXAjh+NleBq2ofAfjowu/zzCnnbAKy2R2OE=
&lt;/pre&gt;

==ssh-vulnkey==

'''ssh-vulnkey''' is included in some distros to check a key against a blacklist of compromised keys.  The blacklist was made necessary when a broken version of OpenSSL was distributed by some distros&lt;ref name=&quot;Debian_OpenSSL_vuln&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author=Jake Edge |url=https://lwn.net/Articles/282230/ |title=Debian vulnerability has widespread effects |publisher=LWN |year=2008|accessdate=2013-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;, resulting in bad keys that were easily predicted and compromised.  Keys made while that broken version was in use that are found to have been compromised cannot be repaired and must be replaced.  The problem has since been fixed and new keys should be all right.

==ssh-copy-id==

'''ssh-copy-id''' is included in some distros to install a public key into a remote machine's '''authorized_keys''' file.  It is a simple shell script and the '''authorized_keys''' file should still be checked manually after first login to verify that everything went ok and that the key was copied as it should be.

      <text xml:space="preserve">It is possible to advance OpenSSH through donations of hardware or money.  See the OpenSSH project web site at [http://www.openssh.org www.openssh.org]  for details.  

OpenSSH is a volunteer project with the goal of making quality software.  In that way it relies upon hardware and cash donations to keep the project rolling.  Funds are needed for daily operation to cover network line subscriptions and electrical costs.  Hardware is needed for development and porting to new architectures and platforms always requires new hardware.  

OpenSSH is currently developed by two teams.  The first team works providing code that is as clean, simple and secure as possible as part of the OpenBSD project.  The second team works using this core version and ports it to a great many other operating systems.  Thus there are two development tracks, the OpenBSD core and the portable version.  The work is all done in countries that permit export of cryptography.

__TOC__

==Use the Source, Luke==

The main development branch of OpenSSH is part of the OpenBSD project.  So the &quot;-current&quot; branch of OpenBSD, available as source code, is where to look for current activity.  

The source code for the portable releases of OpenSSH are published using anonymous CVS, so no password is needed to download source from the read-only repository.  It is provided and maintained by Damien Miller.  
Nightly, bleeding-edge snapshots of OpenSSH itself are publicly available from its own CVS tree.  Use a mirror when possible.  

&lt;pre&gt; 
export CVSROOT=anoncvs@anoncvs.mindrot.org:/cvs
export CVS_RSH=/usr/bin/ssh
cvs get openssh
&lt;/pre&gt;

The fingerprints for the keys used by the OpenSSH source code repository, as of this writing, are:

==libssh2==

'''libssh2''' is an independent project providing a lean C library implementing the SSH2 protocol for embedding specific SSH capabilities into other tools.  It has a stable, well-documented API for working on the client side with the different SSH subsystems:  Session, Userauth, Channel, SFTP, and Public Key.  The API can be set to either blocking or non-blocking.  The code uses strict name spaces, is C89-compatible and builds using regular GNU Autotools.  

'''libssh2''' is available under a modified BSD license.  The functions are each documented in their own manual pages.  The project web site contains the documentation, source code and examples:
	http://www.libssh2.org/ 

There is a mailing list for '''libssh2''' in addition to an IRC channel.  The project is small, low-key and, as true to the spirit of the Internet, a meritocracy.  Hundreds of specific functions allow specific activities and components to be cherry-picked and added to an application:
* Shell and SFTP sessions
* Port forwarding
* Password, public-key, host-based keys, and keyboard-interactive authentication methods.
* Key Exchange Methods diffie-hellman-group1-sha1, diffie-hellman-group14-sha1, diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha1
* Host Key Types: ssh-rsa and ssh-dss
* Ciphers: aes256-cbc (rijndael-cbc@lysator.liu.se), aes192-cbc, aes128-cbc, 3des-cbc, blowfish-cbc, cast128-cbc, arcfour, or without a cipher.  
* Compression Scheme zlib or without compression
* Message Authentication Code (MAC) algorithms for hashes: hmac-sha1, hmac-sha1-96, hmac-md5, hmac-md5-96, hmac-ripemd160 (hmac-ripemd160@openssh.com), or none at all
* Channels: Shell, Exec – including the SCP wrapper, direct TCP/IP, subsystem
** Channel Requests: x11, pty
* Subsystems: sftp version 3, public-key version 2
* Thread-safe, blocking or non-blocking API
* Your sockets: the app hands over the socket, calls select() etc.
* Builds with either OpenSSL or gcrypt

See also the library '''libcurl''' which supports SFTP and SCP URLs.  

==Other language bindings for the SSH protocols==

What follows is a list of resources by programming language:

===Perl===

* [http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Net::SSH2 Net::SSH2]: a wrapper module for '''libssh2'''.
* [http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Net::SSH::Perl Net::SSH::Perl]: a full SSH/SFTP implementation in pure Perl. Unfortunately this module is not being maintained any more and has several open bugs. Also, installing it can be a daunting task due to some of its dependencies.
* [http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Net::OpenSSH Net::OpenSSH]: a wrapper for OpenSSH binaries and other handy programs ('''scp''', '''rsync''', '''sshfs'''). It uses OpenSSH multiplexing feature in order to reuse connections. 
* [http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Net::OpenSSH::Parallel Net::OpenSSH::Parallel] a module build on top of '''Net::OpenSSH''' that allows to transfer files and run programs on several machines in parallel efficiently.
* [http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?SSH::Batch SSH::Batch] another module build on top of '''Net::OpenSSH''' that allows to run programs on several hosts in parallel.
* [http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Net::SSH::Expect Net::SSH::Expect]: this module uses [http://search.cpan.org/search?query=expect Expect] to drive interactive shell sessions run on top of SSH.
* [http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Net::SSH Net::SSH]: a simple wrapper around any SSH client. It does not support password authentication and is very slow as it establishes a new SSH connection for every remote program invoked.
* [http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Net::SCP Net::SCP] and [http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Net::SCP::Expect Net::SCP::Expect]: modules wrapping the '''scp''' program. Note that '''Net::SSH2''', '''Net::SSH::Perl''' and '''Net::OpenSSH''' already support file transfers via '''scp''' natively.
* [http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Net::SFTP::Foreign Net::SFTP::Foreign]: a full SFTP client written in Perl with lots of bells and whistles. By default is uses '''ssh''' to connect to the remote machines but it can also run on top of '''Net::SSH2''' and '''Net::OpenSSH'''.
* [http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?GRID::Machine GRID::Machine], [http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?IPC::PerlSSH IPC::PerlSSH] and [http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?SSH::RPC SSH::RPC]: these modules allow to distribute and run Perl code on remote machines through SSH.

      <comment>-E ... append debug logs to log_file instead of standard error</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Both the OpenSSH client and server offer a lot of choice as to where the logs are written and how much information is collected.   

A prerequisite for logging is having an accurate system clock using the Network Time Protocol, NTP.  Having the NTP server running provides time synchronization with the world.  The more accurate the time stamp in the log is, the faster it is to coordinate forensics between machines or sites or service providers.  If you have to contact outside parties like a service provider, progress can usually only be made with very exact times.  

==Server Logs==

By default [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd sshd(8)] logs to the system logs, with log level INFO and syslog facility AUTH.  So the place to look for log data from [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd sshd(8)] is in '''/var/log/auth.log'''.  These defaults can be overridden using the '''SyslogFacility''' and '''LogLevel''' directives.  Below is a typical server startup entry in the authorization log.  
&lt;pre&gt;
Jan 27 10:01:11 eee sshd[20601]: Server listening on 0.0.0.0 port 22
&lt;/pre&gt;

In most cases the default level of logging is fine, but during initial testing of new services or activities it is sometimes necessary to have more information.  Debugging info usually goes to '''stderr'''.  The log excerpt below show the same basic server start up with increasing detail.  Contrast debug level 3 below with the default above:  
&lt;pre&gt;
debug1: sshd version OpenSSH_5.6
debug1: read PEM private key done: type RSA
debug1: private host key: #0 type 1 RSA
debug1: read PEM private key done: type DSA
debug1: private host key: #1 type 2 DSA
debug1: rexec_argv[0]='/usr/sbin/sshd’
debug1: rexec_argv[1]='-d’
debug1: Bind to port 22 on ::.
Server listening on :: port 22.
debug1: Bind to port 22 on 0.0.0.0.
Server listening on 0.0.0.0 port 22.
And same at the most verbose level, DEBUG3:
debug2: load_server_config: filename /etc/ssh/sshd_config
debug2: load_server_config: done config len = 144
debug2: parse_server_config: config /etc/ssh/sshd_config len 144
debug3: /etc/ssh/sshd_config:98 setting Subsystem sftp  /usr/libexec/sftp-server
debug1: sshd version OpenSSH_5.6
debug3: Not a RSA1 key file /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key.
debug1: read PEM private key done: type RSA
debug1: private host key: #0 type 1 RSA
debug3: Not a RSA1 key file /etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key.
debug1: read PEM private key done: type DSA
debug1: private host key: #1 type 2 DSA
debug1: rexec_argv[0]='/usr/sbin/sshd’
debug1: rexec_argv[1]='-ddd’
debug2: fd 4 setting O_NONBLOCK
debug1: Bind to port 22 on ::.
Server listening on :: port 22.
debug2: fd 5 setting O_NONBLOCK
debug1: Bind to port 22 on 0.0.0.0.
Server listening on 0.0.0.0 port 22.
&lt;/pre&gt;
Note that failed login attempts are not logged until half the value in directive '''MaxAuthTries''' is exceeded.  Below is how the default log looks after some failed attempts: 
&lt;pre&gt;
...
Nov 23 20:31:12 server sshd[15798]: Connection from 188.124.3.41 port 32889 
Nov 23 20:31:14 server sshd[15798]: Failed password for root from 188.124.3.41 port 32889 ssh2 
Nov 23 20:31:14 server sshd[29323]: Received disconnect from 188.124.3.41: 11: Bye Bye 
Nov 23 22:04:56 server sshd[25438]: Connection from 200.54.84.233 port 45196 
Nov 23 22:04:58 server sshd[25438]: Failed password for root from 200.54.84.233 port 45196 ssh2 
Nov 23 22:04:58 server sshd[30487]: Received disconnect from 200.54.84.233: 11: Bye Bye 
Nov 23 22:04:59 server sshd[21358]: Connection from 200.54.84.233 port 45528 
Nov 23 22:05:01 server sshd[21358]: Failed password for root from 200.54.84.233 port 45528 ssh2 
Nov 23 22:05:01 server sshd[2624]: Received disconnect from 200.54.84.233: 11: Bye Bye
...
&lt;/pre&gt;
It is usually a good idea not to allow root login.  That simplifies log analysis greatly.  It in particular eliminates the time consuming question of who is trying to get in and why.  Tasks that need root level access can be given it through custom-made entries in '''/etc/sudoers'''.  People that need root level access can gain it through '''sudo''' or '''su'''.  

===Successful logins===

By default, the server does not store much information about user transactions.  That is a good thing.  It is also a good thing to recognize when the system is operating as it should.  Here is a successful SSH login:
&lt;pre&gt;
Jan 28 11:47:59 server sshd[18884]: Accepted password for fred from 192.0.2.60 port 6647 ssh2
&lt;/pre&gt;
And one using a key for authentication.
&lt;pre&gt;
Jan 28 11:51:43 server sshd[5104]: Accepted publickey for fred from 192.0.2.60 port 60594 ssh2: RSA e8:31:68:c7:01:2d:25:20:36:8f:50:5d:f9:ee:70:4c
&lt;/pre&gt;
In older versions of OpenSSH, prior to 6.3, the key fingerprint is missing.
&lt;pre&gt;
Jan 28 11:52:05 server sshd[1003]: Accepted publickey for fred from 192.0.2.60 port 20042 ssh2
&lt;/pre&gt;

A password authentication for SFTP

&lt;pre&gt;
Jan 28 11:46:36 server sshd[14002]: Accepted password for fred from 192.0.2.60 port 15440 ssh2
Jan 28 11:46:36 server sshd[25260]: subsystem request for sftp
&lt;/pre&gt;
Here is a successful SFTP login using a key for authentication. 
&lt;pre&gt;
Jan 28 11:43:11 server sshd[5104]: Accepted publickey for fred from 192.0.2.60 port 60594 ssh2: RSA e8:31:68:c7:01:2d:25:20:36:8f:50:5d:f9:ee:70:4c
Jan 28 11:43:11 server sshd[9813]: subsystem request for sftp
&lt;/pre&gt;
Additional data, such as connection duration, can be logged with the help of '''xinetd'''.

===Logging Chrooted SFTP===

Logging the built-in '''sftp-subsystem''' inside a chroot jail needs a '''/dev/log''' node to exist inside the jail.  This can be done by having the system logger such as '''syslogd''' add additional log sockets when starting up.  On some systems that is as simple as adding more flags, like &quot;'''-u -a /chroot/dev/log'''&quot;, in '''/etc/rc.conf.local''' or whatever the equivalent startup script may be.  

Here is a SFTP login with password to a chroot jail, using log level ''Debug3'' for the SFTP-subsystem logging a file upload:
&lt;pre&gt;
Jan 28 12:42:41 server sshd[26299]: Connection from 192.0.2.60 port 47366
Jan 28 12:42:42 server sshd[26299]: Failed none for fred from 192.0.2.60 port 47366 ssh2
Jan 28 12:42:44 server sshd[26299]: Accepted password for fred from 192.0.2.60 port 47366 ssh2
Jan 28 12:42:44 server sshd[26299]: User child is on pid 21613
Jan 28 12:42:44 server sshd[21613]: Changed root directory to &quot;/home/fred&quot;
Jan 28 12:42:44 server sshd[21613]: subsystem request for sftp
Jan 28 12:42:44 server internal-sftp[2084]: session opened for local user fred from [192.0.2.60]
Jan 28 12:42:58 server internal-sftp[2084]: open &quot;/docs/somefile.txt&quot; flags WRITE,CREATE,TRUNCATE mode 0644
Jan 28 12:42:58 server internal-sftp[2084]: close “/docs/somefile.txt” bytes read 0 written 400
&lt;/pre&gt;
Remember that SFTP is a separate subsystem and that like the file creation mode, the log level and facility are set separately from the SSH server in [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd_config sshd_config(5)]:  
&lt;pre&gt;
Subsystem internal-sftp -l ERROR
&lt;/pre&gt;

===Logging Revoked Keys===

If the '''RevokedKeys''' directive is used to point to a list of public keys that have been revoked, [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd sshd(8)] will make a log entry when access is attempted using a revoked key.  The entry will be the same whether a plaintext list of public keys is used or if a binary Key Revocation List (KRL) has been generated.  

If password authentication is allowed, and the user tries it, then after the key authentication fails there will be a record of password authentication.  

&lt;pre&gt;
Apr 30 20:40:44 server sshd[10669]: error: WARNING: authentication attempt with a revoked RSA key 73:b5:83:af:b5:21:ef:b6:0a:ff:93:b4:61:17:24:dd
...
Apr 30 20:40:51 server sshd[10669]: Accepted password for fred from 192.0.2.10 port 51106 ssh2
&lt;/pre&gt;

If password authentication is not allowed, [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd sshd(8)] will close the connection as soon as the key fails.  

&lt;pre&gt;
Apr 30 20:41:51 server sshd[98]: error: WARNING: authentication attempt with a revoked RSA key 73:b5:83:af:b5:21:ef:b6:0a:ff:93:b4:61:17:24:dd
...
Apr 30 20:41:57 server sshd[98]: Connection closed by 192.0.2.10[preauth]
&lt;/pre&gt;

The same happens if the user cancels the connection without trying a password after the key attempt fails.  In both cases, there will be no clue as to which user tried to log on, so it will be necessary to try to look up the key by its fingerprint from your archive of old keys using '''ssh-keygen -lf''' and read the key's comments.

On the client side, no warning or error will be given if a revoked key is tried.  It will just fail and the next key or method will be tried.

===Brute force and Hail Mary attacks===

It’s fairly common to see failed login attempts almost as soon as the server is connected to the net.  Brute force attacks, where one machine hammers on a few accounts trying to find a valid password, are becoming rare.  In part this is because packet filters, like IP Tables for Linux and PF for BSD, can limit the number and rate of connection attempts from a single host.  The server configuration directive '''MaxStartups''' can limit the number of simultaneous, unauthenticated connections.  
&lt;pre&gt;
...
Nov 23 19:35:42 server sshd[14000]: Connection from 116.28.64.132 port 55680 
Nov 23 19:35:44 server sshd[14000]: Failed password for root from 116.28.64.132 port 55680 ssh2 
Nov 23 19:35:44 server sshd[11034]: Received disconnect from 116.28.64.132: 11: Bye Bye 
Nov 23 19:35:45 server sshd[3096]: Connection from 116.28.64.132 port 55932 
Nov 23 19:35:48 server sshd[3096]: Failed password for root from 116.28.64.132 port 55932 ssh2 
Nov 23 19:35:48 server sshd[11289]: Received disconnect from 116.28.64.132: 11: Bye Bye
...
&lt;/pre&gt;

The way to deal with brute force attacks is to customize the server host’s packet filter to limit the attacks or even temporarily block machines that overload the maximum number or rate of connections.  Optionally, one should also contact the attacker’s net block owner with the IP address and exact date and time of the attacks.  

A kind of attack common at the time of this writing is one which is distributed over a large number of compromised machines, each playing only a small role in attacking the server.  

To deal with Hail Mary attacks, contact the attacker’s net block owner.  A form letter with a cut-and-paste excerpt from the log is enough, if it gives the exact times and addresses.  Alternately, teams of network or system administrators can work to pool data to identify and blacklist the compromised hosts participating in the attack.

==Client Logging==

The OpenSSH the client normally sends log information to stderr.  The '''-y''' option can be used to send output to the system logs, managed by syslogd or something similar. Or the '''-E''' option sends log output to a designated file instead of stderr.  Working with the system logs or separate log files are something which can be useful when running ssh in automated scripts.  Below is a connection to an interactive shell with the normal level of client logging:

&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh -l fred server.example.org    
fred@server.example.org‘s password: 
Last login: Thu Jan 27 13:21:57 2011 from 192.168.11.1
&lt;/pre&gt;

The same connection at the first level of verbosity gives lots of debugging information, 42 lines more.
&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh -v -l fred server.example.org

...
&lt;/pre&gt;

The same login with the maximum of verbosity, '''-vvv''', gives around 120 lines of debugging information.  Remember that debugging information is sent to stderr rather than stdout.  Regular pipes and redirects work only with stdout so output on stderr must be sent to stdout first if one is going to capture it at the same time.  That is done with a redirect, '''2&gt;&amp;amp;1'''.  Mind the spaces, or lack of them:

This will only capture the session in a file, debugging info goes only to the screen, not to the output log:
&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh -vvv -l fred  somehost.example.org  | tee ~/ssh-output.log
&lt;/pre&gt;

The tool [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=tee tee(1)] is like a T-pipe and sends output two directions, one to stdout and one to a file.

This will capture both debugging info and session text:
&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh -vvv -l fred  somehost.example.org  2&gt;&amp;1  | tee ~/ssh-output.log
&lt;/pre&gt;

Also, the escape sequences '''~v''' and '''~V''' can be used to increase or decrease the verbosity of an existing connection.

==Debugging==

The SFTP-subsystem logging defaults to ERROR, reporting only errors.  To track transactions made by the client, change the log level to INFO or VERBOSE:
&lt;pre&gt;
Subsystem internal-sftp  -l INFO 
&lt;/pre&gt;
Caution.  Operating with elevated logging levels would violate the privacy of users, in addition to filling a lot of disk space, and should generally not be used in production once the changes are figured out.

===Debugging a script, configuration or key===

Usually log levels need only be changed when writing and testing a script, new configurations, new keys, or all three at once.  When working with sudo, it is especially important to see exactly what the client is sending so as to enter the right pattern into '''/etc/sudoers''' for safety.  Using the lowest level of verbosity, the exact string being sent by the client to the remote server is shown in the debugging output:
&lt;pre&gt;
$ rsync -e &quot;ssh -v -i /home/webmaint/.ssh/bkup_key -l webmaint&quot; \
	-a server.example.org:/var/www/ var/backup/www/
...
debug1: Authentication succeeded (publickey).
Authenticated to server.example.org ([192.0.2.20]:22).
debug1: channel 0: new [client-session]
debug1: Requesting no-more-sessions@openssh.com
debug1: Entering interactive session.
debug1: Sending command: rsync --server --sender -vlogDtpre.if . /var/www/
receiving incremental file list
... 
&lt;/pre&gt;
What sudoers then needs is something like the following, assuming account ''webmaint'' is in the group ''webmasters'':
&lt;pre&gt;
%webmasters ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/local/bin/rsync --server \
--sender -vlogDtpre.if . /var/www/
&lt;/pre&gt;

The same method can be used to debug new server configurations or key logins.  Once things are set to run as needed, the log level settings can be lowered back to INFO for [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd sshd(8)] and to ERROR for '''internal-sftp'''.  Additionally, once the script is left to run in fully automated mode, the client logging information can be set use the syslog system module instead of '''stderr''' by setting the '''-y''' option when it is launched.

===Debugging a server configuration===

Running the server in debug mode provides a lot of information about the connection and a smaller amount about the server configuration.  The server's debugging level ('''-d''') can be raised once, twice ('''-dd''') or thrice ('''-ddd''').  
&lt;pre&gt;
$ /usr/sbin/sshd -d
&lt;/pre&gt;

Note that the server in this case does not detach and become a daemon, so it will terminate when the SSH connection terminates.  To make a subsequent connection from the client, the server must be started again.  Though in some ways this is a hassle, it does make sure that session data is a unique set and not mixes of multiple sessions and thus possibly different configurations.  Alternately, another option ('''-e''') when debugging sends the debugging data to '''stderr''' to keep the system logs clean.  

In recent versions of OpenSSH, it is also possible to log the debug data from the system logs directly to a separate file and keep noise out of the system logs.  Since OpenSSH 6.3, the option '''-E''' will append the debug data to a particular log file instead of sending it to the system log.  This facilitates debugging live systems without cluttering the system logs.  
&lt;pre&gt;
$ /usr/sbin/sshd -E /home/fred/sshd.debug.log
&lt;/pre&gt;

On older versions of OpenSSH, if you need to save output to a file while still viewing it live on the screen, you can use '''tee(1)'''.  
&lt;pre&gt;
$ /usr/sbin/sshd -ddd 2&gt;&amp;1 | tee /tmp/foo
&lt;/pre&gt;

That will save output to the file ''foo'' by capturing what [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd sshd(8)] sent to '''stderr'''.  This works with older versions of OpenSSH, but the '''-E''' option above is preferable.  

If the server is remote and it is important to reduce the risk of getting locked out, the experiments on the configuration file can be done with a second instance of [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd sshd(8)] using a separate configuration file and listening to a high port until the settings have been tested. 
&lt;pre&gt;
$ /usr/sbin/sshd -dd -p 22222 -f /home/fred/sshd_config.test
&lt;/pre&gt;

It is possible to make an extended test ('''-T''') of the configuration file.  If there is a syntax error, it will be reported, but remember that even sound configurations could still lock you out.  The extended test mode can be used by itself, but it is also possible to specify particular connection parameters to use with '''-C'''.  [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd sshd(8)] will then process the configuration file in light of the parameters passed to it and output the results.  Of particular use, the results of '''Match''' directives will be shown.  

When passing specific connection parameters to [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd sshd(8)] for evaluation, ''user'', ''host'', and ''addr'' are the minimum required for extended testing.  The following will print out the configurations that will be applied if the user ''fred'' tries to log in to the host ''server.example.org'' from the address ''192.0.2.15'':
&lt;pre&gt;
$ /usr/sbin/sshd -TC user=fred,host=server.example.org,addr=192.0.2.15
&lt;/pre&gt;

Two more parameters, ''laddr'' and ''lport'', may also be passed.  They refer to the server IP number and port connected to.  
&lt;pre&gt;
$ /usr/sbin/sshd -TC user=fred,host=server.example.org,addr=192.0.2.15,laddr=192.0.2.2,lport=2222
&lt;/pre&gt;

Sometimes when debugging a server configuration it is necessary to track the client, too.  With [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sftp sftp(1)] the options are also passed to [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh ssh(1)]. 

&lt;pre&gt;
$ sftp -v -o &quot;IdentityFile=~/.ssh/weblog.key_rsa fred@server.example.org
&lt;/pre&gt;

The debugging verbosity on the client can be increased just like on the server.  
&lt;pre&gt;
$ sftp -vvv -o &quot;IdentityFile=~/.ssh/weblog.key_rsa fred@server.example.org
&lt;/pre&gt;

The extra information can be useful to see exactly what is being sent to or requested of the server.   

Even when a connection is already established, it is possible to change the verbosity of the client.  Using the escape sequences '''~v''' and '''~V''' it is possible to raise and lower the logging level for the client in an existing connection.  In order, it will raise the log level to VERBOSE, DEBUG, DEBUG2, and DEBUG3, if starting from the default of INFO.  When lowering the log level, it will descend through ERROR, FATAL, to QUIET if starting from the default of INFO.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The [http://www.openssh.org/ OpenSSH] suite provides secure remote access and file transfer.  Since its initial release, it has grown to become the most widely used implementation of the SSH protocol.  During the first ten years of its existence, ssh has largely replaced older corresponding unencrypted tools and protocols.  
The OpenSSH client is included by default in most operating system distributions, including OS X, Linux, BSD and Solaris.  Any day you use the Internet, you are using and relying on dozens if not hundreds of machines operated and maintained using OpenSSH.  A survey in 2008 showed that of the SSH servers found running, just over 80% were OpenSSH.  &lt;ref name=&quot;OpenSSH_marketshare_2008&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.openssh.com/usage/ssh-stats.html
 |title=Statistics from the current scan results |publisher=OpenSSH.org |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

OpenSSH was first released towards the end of 1999.  It is the latest step in a very long and useful history of networked commuting, remote access and telecommuting.

==History of OpenSSH==

The first release of OpenSSH was in December 1999 as part of OpenBSD 2.6. The source code was originally derived from a re-write of the last available open version, ssh 1.2.12 specifically, of SSH&lt;ref name=&quot;OpenSSH_History&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://openssh.org/history.html |title=OpenSSH History |publisher=OpenSSH|accessdate=2012-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  SSH went on to become Tectia SSH.   


Ongoing development of OpenSSH is done by the OpenBSD group.  Core development occurs first on OpenBSD, then portability teams bring the changes to other platforms.  OpenSSH is an integral part of as good as all server systems today and a good many network appliances such as routers, switches and networked storage.  
The first steps were in many ways the biggest.  

===The Early Days of Remote Access===

Some of the tools that inspired the need for SSH have been around since the beginning, too, or very near the beginning of the Internet.  Remote access has been a fundamental part of the concept since the idea stage and the nature and capabilities of this access has evolved as the network has evolved in scale, scope and usage.  See the web version of the ''Levnez Unix Timeline''&lt;ref name=&quot;Unix-Timeline&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.levenez.com/unix/ |title=UNIX History Timeline |publisher=Éric Lévénez|accessdate=2011-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Éric Lévénez for an overview of systems development and the web version of ''Hobbes' Internet Timeline''&lt;ref name=&quot;Hobbes-Internet-Timeline&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zakon.org/robert/internet/timeline/ |title=Hobbes' Internet Timeline |publisher=Robert H'obbes' Zakon|accessdate=2011-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Robert H Zakon for an overview of the development of the Internet.

'''1969'''
* Telnet was one of the original ARPAnet application protocols, named in RFC 97.  It was used to access a host at a remote site locally.  Telnet was described starting two years later in RFC 137, RFC 139, RFC 318 and others, including the lost RFC 97.  That is as good a turning point as any to delineate Telnet.  

'''1971'''
* Thompson Shell, by Ken Thompson, was an improvement on the old text-based user interface, the shell.   This new one allowed redirects but was only a user interface and not for scripting.
* In the same year FTP, the file transfer protocol, was described in RFC 114.  A key goal was to promote use of computers over the net by allowing users at any host on the network to use the file system of any cooperating host.

'''1978'''
* Bill Joy created BSD's C shell which is named for the C-like syntax it uses.  It allows job control, history substitution, and aliases, which features we find in today's interfaces.  
* In the same year, the Bourne Shell by Steve Bourne at Bell Labs &lt;ref name=&quot;CW-Bourne-Shell&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.computerworld.com.au/article/279011/a-z_programming_languages_bourne_shell_sh/
 |title=The A-Z of Programming Languages: Bourne shell, or sh | author=Howard Dahdah| publisher=Computerworld |year=2009|accessdate=2011-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; was created.  It is the progenitor to the default shells used in most distros today: '''ksh''' and '''bash'''.  

'''1983'''
* The remote file copy utility, '''rcp''', appeared in 4.2 BSD.  rcp copied files across the net to other hosts using '''rsh''', which also appeared staring 4.2 BSD, to perform its operations.  Like '''telnet''' and '''ftp''', all passwords, user names and data are transmitted unencrypted in clear text.  Both '''rsh''' and '''rcp''' were part of the '''rlogin''' suite.  

'''1991'''
* PGP, written at MIT by Philip Zimmermann&lt;ref name=&quot;WhyIWrotePGP&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mit.edu/~prz/EN/essays/WhyIWrotePGP.html |title=Why I Wrote PGP| author=Phil Zimmermann| publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology |year=1991|accessdate=2011-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;, charted new waters for encrypted electronic communications with the goals of preserving civil liberties online, ensuring individual privacy, keeping encryption legal in the USA, and protecting business communications.  Like SSH it uses asymmetric encryption with public / private key pairs.
  
'''1993'''	
* Kerberos V (RFC 1510) authentication service from MIT's project Athena &lt;ref name=&quot;WikiMarkup&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.mit.edu/Kerberos/dialogue.html |title=Designing an Authentication System: a Dialogue in Four Scenes. |Author=Bill Bryant|Author=Theodor Ts'o|accessdate=2011-02-17|year=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;  provides a means for authentication over an open, unsecure network.  Kerberos  got its original start in 1988.

===SSH - open then closed===

'''1995'''
* Tatu Ylönen at the Helsinki University of Technology developed the first SSH protocol and programs, releasing them under an open license&lt;ref name=&quot;SSH-1.0.0-license&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/mirrors/ftp.cs.hut.fi/pub/ssh/old/ssh-1.0.0.tar.gz  |title=Help:SSH 1.0.0 license |publisher=FUNET |
accessdate=2013-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; as per the norm in computer science, software engineering and advanced development.  &lt;ref name=&quot;SSH-Announce&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://groups.google.com/group/comp.security.unix/msg/67079d812a19f499?dmode=source&amp;hl=en&amp;pli=1 |title=ANNOUNCEMENT: Ssh (Secure Shell) Remote Login Program |author=Tatu Ylönen|publisher=news://comp.security.unix|date=1995-07-12|accessdate=2011-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
'''1995?'''
* Björn Grönvall dug out the most recent open version of ssh, version 1.2.12&lt;ref name=&quot;SSH-1.2.12-license&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wwwcip.informatik.uni-erlangen.de/~msfriedl/LIC/ssh-1.2.12/COPYING  |title=Help:SSH 1.2.12 license |publisher=friedl |
accessdate=2011-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;ref name=&quot;SSH-1.2.12.92-license&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wwwcip.informatik.uni-erlangen.de/~msfriedl/LIC/ssh-1.2.12.92/COPYING  |title=Help:SSH 1.2.12.92 license |publisher=friedl |
accessdate=2011-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  He and Holger Trapp did the initial work to free the distribution, resulting in OSSH

'''1996'''
* SSH2 protocol is defined

===OpenSSH===

'''1999'''
* OpenSSH begins based on OSSH.  Niels Provos, Theo de Raadt, Markus Friedl developed the cryptographic components during the port to OpenBSD which became the OpenSSH we know today.  Dug Song, Aaron Campbell and many others provided various non-crypto contributions.   openssl library issues were sorted by Bob Beck.  Damien Miller, Philip Hands, and others started porting OpenSSH to Linux 

'''2000'''
* Markus Friedl added SSH 2 protocol support to OpenSSH version 2.0, which was released in June.&lt;ref name=&quot;SSH-History&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.openssh.com/history.html
  |title=OpenSSH Project History and Credits |publisher=OpenSSH |
accessdate=2011-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  OpenSSH 2.0 shipped with OpenBSD 2.7.   Niels Provos and Theo de Raadt did most of the checking.  Bob Beck updated OpenSSL.  Markus also added support for the SFTP protocol later that same year.  
* In September of 2000, the long wait in the USA was over for the patents on the RSA algorithms to expire.  In the European Union, the European Patent Convention of 1972, frees software, algorithms, business methods or literature, unlike the unfortunate, anti-business situation in the USA.  This freedom in Europe hangs by a thread at the moment.  
* SSH Tectia changes licenses again.  

'''2001'''
* Damien Miller completed the SFTP client which was released in February.  
* SSH2 became the default protocol

'''2008'''
* Built-in chroot support for '''sshd'''.

'''2010'''
* As of OpenSSH 5.4, the legacy protocol SSH1 is finally disabled by default.
Note: OpenSSH can be used anywhere in the whole world because it uses only algorithms unencumbereed by software patents, business method patents, algorithm patents, and so on.  These types of patents do not apply in Europe, only physical inventions can be patented in Europe, but there are regions of the world where these problems do occur.  Small and medium businesses in Europe have been active in politics to keep the advantage.

==Why Use OpenSSH?==

A lot has changed since the commercialization of the Internet began in 1996.  It was once a University and Government research network and if you were on the net back then, odds were you were supposed to be there.  Though it was far from being utopia, any misbehavior could usually be quickly narrowed down to the individuals involved and dealt with easily, usually with no more than a phone call or a few e-mails.  Few, if any, sessions back then were encrypted and both passwords and user names were passed in clear text. 
 
By then, the WWW was more than a few years under way and undergoing explosive growth.  The estimated number of web servers online in 1996 grew from 100,000 at the beginning of the year to close to 650,000 by the end of the same year&lt;ref name=&quot;Hobbes' Internet Timeline&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zakon.org/robert/internet/timeline/ |title=Hobbes' Internet Timeline | Author=Robert H'obbes' Zakon| publisher=Zakon Group LLC|Accessdate=2011-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  When other types of servers are included in those figures, the estimated year-end number is over 16,000,000 hosts, representing approximately 828,000 domains.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hobbes' Internet Timeline&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Nowadays, hosts are subject to hostile scans from the moment they are connected to the network.  Any and all unencrypted traffic is scanned and parsed for user names, passwords and other sensitive information.  Currently, the biggest espionage threats come from private companies, but governments, individuals, and organized crime are not without a presences.  

Each connection goes through many networks and each packet may take the same or a different route there and back again.  Thirteen hops among three organizations in this example from a student computer to a search engine:

&lt;pre&gt;
% /usr/sbin/traceroute -n www.google.com
traceroute: Warning: www.google.com has multiple addresses; using 74.125.95.106
traceroute to www.l.google.com (74.125.95.106), 30 hops max, 40 byte packets
 1 xx.xx.xx.xx           0.419 ms	0.220 ms	0.213 ms	University of Michigan
 2 xx.xx.xx.xx           0.446 ms	0.349 ms	0.315 ms	Merit Network, Inc.
 3 xx.xx.xx.xx           0.572 ms	0.513 ms	0.525 ms	University of Michigan

 5 xx.xx.xx.xx           0.647 ms	0.551 ms	0.561 ms	University of Michigan
 6 xx.xx.xx.xx           0.945 ms	0.912 ms	0.865 ms	University of Michigan
 7 xx.xx.xx.xx           6.478 ms	6.503 ms	6.489 ms	Merit Network, Inc.
 8 xx.xx.xx.xx	         6.597 ms	6.590 ms	6.604 ms	Merit Network, Inc.
 9 216.239.48.154       64.935 ms	6.848 ms	6.793 ms	Google, Inc.
10 72.14.232.141        17.606 ms	17.581 ms	17.680 ms	Google, Inc.
11 209.85.241.27        17.736 ms	17.592 ms	17.519 ms	Google, Inc.
12 72.14.239.193        17.767 ms	17.778 ms	17.930 ms	Google, Inc.
13 74.125.95.106        17.903 ms	17.835 ms	17.867 ms	Google, Inc.:
&lt;/pre&gt;


The net is big.  It is not uncommon to find a trail of 15 to 20 hops between client and server nowadays.  Any machine on any of the subnets the packets travel over can eavesdrop with little difficulty if the packets are not well encrypted.  

===What OpenSSH Does===

The OpenSSH suite gives the following:

* Encrypted remote access, including tunneling insecure protocols.
* Encrypted file transfer
* Run remote commands, programs or scripts and, as mentioned, 
* Replacement for '''rsh''', '''rlogin''', '''telnet''' and '''ftp'''

More concretely, that means that the following undesirable activities are prevented:
* Eavesdropping of data transmitted over the network.
* Manipulation of data at intermediate elements in the network (e.g. routers).
* Address spoofing where an attack hosts pretends to be a trusted host by sending packets with the source address of the trusted host.
* IP source routing 

As a free software project, OpenSSH provides:
* Open Standards
* Flexible License - freedom emphasized for developers
* Strong Encryption using these ciphers:
** AES
** ChaCha20-Poly1305&lt;ref name=&quot;ChaCha20&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.djm.net.au/2013/11/chacha20-and-poly1305-in-openssh.html |title= ChaCha20 and Poly1305 in OpenSSH  |author=Damien Miller|date=2013-11-29 |accessdate=2014-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Strong Authentication
** Public Key
** Single Use Passwords
** Kerberos
** Dongles
* Built-in SFTP
* Data Compression
* Port Forwarding
** Encrypt legacy protocols
** Encrypted X11 forwarding for X Window System
* Key Agents
* Single Sign-on using 
** Authentication Keys
** Agent Forwarding
** Ticket Passing
** Kerberos
** AFS

===What OpenSSH Doesn't Do===

OpenSSH is a very useful tool, but much of its effectiveness depends on correct use.  It cannot protect from any of the following situations.

* Misconfiguration, misuse or abuse.
* Compromised systems, particularly where the root account is compromised. 
* Insecure or inappropriate directory settings, particularly home directory settings.

OpenSSH must be properly configured and on a properly configured system in order to be of benefit.  Arranging both is not difficult, but since each system is unique, there is no one-size-fits-all solution.  The right configuration is dependent on the uses the system and OpenSSH are put to.

If you login from a host to a server and an attacker has control of root on either side, he can listen to your session by reading from the pseudo-terminal device, even though SSH is encrypted on the network SSH must communicate in clear text with the terminal device.  

If an attacker can change files in your home directory, for example via a networked file system, he may be able to fool SSH.  

Last but not least, if OpenSSH is set to allow everyone in, whether on purpose or by accident, it will.

      <text xml:space="preserve">One of the main functions of OpenSSH is that of accessing and running programs on other systems.  In addition to an interactive login, ssh can be used to simply execute a program or script.  Logout is automatic when the program or script has run its course.  Some combinations are readily obvious.  Others require more careful planning.  Sometimes it is enough of a clue just to know that something can be done, at other times more detail is required.  A number of examples of useful combinations of using OpenSSH to run remote tasks follow.  

__TOC__

==Run a Remote Process==

An obvious use of [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh ssh(1)] is to use the shell interactively.  That is, after all, one of the main purposes of the program.  There are several ways to expand upon that, either interactively or as part of unattended scripts.  [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh ssh(1)] returns whatever exit value was returned by the remote process.  When a remote process is completed, [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh ssh(1)] will terminate and pass on the exit value of the last remote process to complete.  So in this way, it can be used in scripts and the outcome of the remote processes can be used.

The following will return success, 0, on the local system where [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh ssh(1)] was run.
&lt;pre&gt;
ssh -l fred server.example.org /bin/true
echo $?
&lt;/pre&gt;

The following will return failure, 1, on the local system where [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh ssh(1)] was run.

&lt;pre&gt;
ssh -l fred server.example.org /bin/false
echo $?
&lt;/pre&gt;

If any other values, from 0 to 255, were returned, [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh ssh(1)] will pass them on.  

===Run a remote process and capture output locally===

Output from programs run on the remote machine can be saved locally using a normal redirect.  Here we run [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=dmesg dmesg(8)] on the remote machine:
&lt;pre&gt;
ssh -l fred server.example.org dmesg &gt; /tmp/dmesg.from.server.log
&lt;/pre&gt;
Interactive processes will be difficult or impossible to operate in that manner because no output will be seen.  For interactive processes requiring any user input, output can be piped through tee  instead  to send the output both to the file and to stdout.  This example runs a FTP session remotely and logs the output locally.

&lt;pre&gt;
ssh -l fred server.example.org &quot;ftp -a anotherserver&quot; | tee /tmp/ftp.log
&lt;/pre&gt;

It may be necessary to force pseudo-tty allocation to get both input and output to be properly visible.  
&lt;pre&gt;
ssh -t -l fred server.example.org &quot;ftp -a anotherserver&quot; | tee /tmp/ftp.log
&lt;/pre&gt;

===Run a remote process in the background while disconnected===

Many routine tasks can be set in motion and then left to complete on their own without needing to stay logged in.  When running remote process in background it is useful to spawn a shell just for that task.
&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh -t -l fred server.example.org 'sh -c &quot;tar zcf /backup/usr.tgz /usr/&quot; &amp;' 
&lt;/pre&gt;
Another way is to use a terminal multiplexer, like [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=tmux tmux(1)] or [http://linux.die.net/man/1/screen screen(1)], to be able to reconnect and follow the process from time to time.  
&lt;pre&gt;
# start session and go about business
$ ssh -l fred server.example.org screen
&lt;/pre&gt;
Once a [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=tmux tmux(1)] or [http://linux.die.net/man/1/screen screen(1)] session is running, it is possible to detach it and close the ssh connection without disturbing the background processes it may be running.  
&lt;pre&gt;
# start session and pick up (reattach) session in progress
$ ssh -l fred server.example.org &quot;screen -x&quot;  ???
&lt;/pre&gt;
More on using terminal multiplexers [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=tmux tmux(1)] or [http://linux.die.net/man/1/screen screen(1)] below.  In some environments it might be necessary to also use [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=pagsh pagsh(1)], especially with kerberos, see below.  Or [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=nohup nohup(1)] might be of use.

==Reconnect and restore a session==

Sessions can be restored after either an intentional or accidental break using a terminal multiplexer like [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=tmux tmux(1)] or [http://linux.die.net/man/1/screen screen(1)].  Here [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh ssh(1)] is to assume that the connection is broken after 5 seconds of not being able to reach the server and to exit.  
&lt;pre&gt;
# using screen
while ! ssh -t fred@example.org -o 'ServerAliveInterval 5' screen -d -RR;  
do true;
done
&lt;/pre&gt;
Each time [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh ssh(1)] exits, the shell tries to run it again and to look for a screen session to attach to.  If the tcp connection is broken, none of the applications or sessions running inside the terminal multiplexer stop.  
&lt;pre&gt;
# using tmux
while ! ssh -t fred@example.org -o 'ServerAliveInterval 5' 'tmux attach -d || tmux new-session';  
do true;
done
&lt;/pre&gt;
The above examples give only an overly simplistic demonstration where at their most basic they are useful to resume a shell where it was after the tcp connection was broken.  Both [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=tmux tmux(1)] or [http://linux.die.net/man/1/screen screen(1)] are quite capable of much more and worth exploring for travelers and telecommuters. 

===Keeping authentication tickets for a remote process after disconnecting===

Authentication credentials are often deleted upon logout and thus any remaining processes no longer have access to whatever the authentication tokens were used for.  In such cases, it is necessary to first create a new credential cache sandbox to run an independent process in before disconnecting.  Using [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=pagsh pagsh(1)] is one solution for some environments.  
&lt;pre&gt;
$ pagsh
$ /usr/local/bin/a-slow-script.sh
&lt;/pre&gt;
Kerberos and AFS are two examples of services that require valid, active tickets.

==Sharing a remote shell==

Teaching, team programming, supervision and creating documentation are some examples of when it can be useful for two people to be sharing a shell.  There are several options for read-only viewing as well as for multiple parties being able to read and write.
  
===Read-only Monitoring or Logging===

Pipes and redirects are a quick way to save output from an ssh session or to allow additional users to follow along read-only.  

Sample use-case: Router needs to be reconfigured and is only available via serial console.  Say your router is down and a consultant must log in via your laptop's 3G modem to access the router's serial console and you need to see what is done or help at certain stages.  It is also very useful in documenting various activities, including configuration or installation.  

It is also possible for advanced users of [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=tmux tmux(1)] or [http://linux.die.net/man/1/screen screen(1)] to allow read-only observers.  

====Read-only using tee(1)====

Capture shell activity to a log file and optionally use tail to watch it real time.  The utility [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=tee tee(1)], like a t-joint in plumbing, is used here to send output two directions.  Output is sent with a pipe ( | ) to [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=tee tee(1)] which then sends the output both to '''stdout''' and to a file.  
&lt;pre&gt;
ssh fred@server.example.org | tee /tmp/session.log
&lt;/pre&gt;
The resulting file can be monitored live in another terminal using [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=tail tail(1)] or after the fact with a pager like [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=less less(1)].

====Force Serial Session with Logging using tee(1)====
[http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=tee tee(1)] can capture output from any program that can write to stdout.  It is very useful for walking someone at a remote site through a process or supervising. 

This example uses [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=chroot chroot(8)] to keep the choice of actions as simple as possible.  The guest user is a member of the group cconsult. The serial connection for my test is on device ttyUSB0, which is a USB to serial converter and [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=cu cu(1)] is used for the connection.  [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=tee tee(1)] takes the output from [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=cu cu(1)] and saves a copy to a file for logging while the program is used.  
&lt;pre&gt;
# from sshd_config
Match Group cconsult
   ChrootDirectory /var/chroot-test
   AllowTCPForwarding no
   X11Forwarding no
   ForceCommand cu -s 19200 -l /dev/ttyUSB0 | tee /var/tmp/cu.log
&lt;/pre&gt;

Then one or more people can follow the activity in [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=cu cu(1)] as it happens, use tail.
&lt;pre&gt;
# using the same logfile name as set in sshd_config
tail -f /var/tmp/cu.log.
&lt;/pre&gt;

Or the log can be edited and used for documentation.  

Read-only using [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=tmux tmux(1)] or [http://linux.die.net/man/1/screen screen(1)] or [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=tmux tmux(1)] is done by wrapping the (re-)connection attempt in a script.

&lt;pre&gt;
#!/bin/sh

# try attaching to an existing screen session or,
# or if none exist, make a new screen session

/usr/bin/screen -x || \
  /usr/bin/screen \
     sh -c &quot;/usr/bin/cu -s 19200 -l /dev/ttyUSB0 | \
     /usr/bin/tee /tmp/consultant.log&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

===Interactive Sharing Using a Terminal Multiplexer===

The terminal multiplexers [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=tmux tmux(1)] or [http://linux.die.net/man/1/screen screen(1)] or [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=tmux tmux(1)] can attach two or more users to the same session.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sharing Terminal Sessions With Tmux And Screen&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.howtoforge.com/sharing-terminal-sessions-with-tmux-and-screen
 |title=Sharing Terminal Sessions With Tmux And Screen |publisher=HowToForge |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The session can either be read-only for some or read-write for all participants.

====screen(1)====

If the same account is going to share a session, then it's an easy procedure.  In the one terminal, where ''sessionname'' is the name of your screen session, start a new session:

&lt;pre&gt;
screen -S sessionname
&lt;/pre&gt;

In the other terminal, attach to that session:

&lt;pre&gt;
screen -x sessionname
&lt;/pre&gt;

If two different accounts are going to share the same session, then the following steps are necessary.  ''user 1'' does this:

&lt;pre&gt;
screen -S sessionname
^A :multiuser on
^A :acladd user2
&lt;/pre&gt;

Then ''user 2'' does this:
&lt;pre&gt;
screen -x user1/sessionname
&lt;/pre&gt;


In [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=tmux tmux(1)] or [http://linux.die.net/man/1/screen screen(1)], if more than one user account is used the '''aclchg''' command can remove write access for the other user: '''^A :aclchg user -w &quot;#&quot;'''.  Note that [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=tmux tmux(1)] or [http://linux.die.net/man/1/screen screen(1)] must run as SUID for multiuser support.  If it is not set, you will get an error message reminding you when trying to connect the second user.  You might also have to set permissions for '''/var/run/screen''' to 755.

====tmux(1)====

If the same account is going to be sharing the session, then it's
rather easy.  In the first terminal, start [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=tmux tmux(1)] where 'sessionname' is the
session name:

&lt;pre&gt;
tmux new-session -s sessionname
&lt;/pre&gt;

Then in the second terminal:

&lt;pre&gt;
tmux attach-session -t sessionname
&lt;/pre&gt;


For different users, you have to set the permissions on the [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=tmux tmux(1)] socket so that both users can read and write it.  That will require a group which has both users as members.  

In the first terminal, start [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=tmux tmux(1)] where 'sessionname' is the session name and 'shareds' is the name of the socket:

&lt;pre&gt;
tmux -S /tmp/shareddir/shareds new-session -s sessionname
&lt;/pre&gt;

Then [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=chgrp chgrp(1)] the socket (/tmp/shareddir/shareds) and the socket's directory to a group that both users share in common.

In the second terminal attach using that socket and session

&lt;pre&gt;
tmux -S /tmp/shareddir/shareds attach-session -t sessionname
&lt;/pre&gt;

====scripting====

It is possible to automate some of the connection.  Make a script, such as '''/usr/local/bin/screeners''', then use that script with the '''ForceCommand''' directive.  Here is an example of a script that tries to reconnect to an existing session.  If no sessions already exist, then a new one is created and automatically establishes a connection to a serial device.  

&lt;pre&gt;
#!/bin/sh

# try attaching to an existing screen session,
# or if none exist, make a new screen session

/usr/bin/screen -x || \
  /usr/bin/screen \
     /bin/sh -c &quot;/usr/bin/cu -s 19200 -l /dev/ttyUSB0 | \
     /usr/bin/tee /tmp/consultant.log&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

==Run a local process and capture remote data==

Data can be produced on one system and used on another.  This is different than tunnelling X, where both the program and the data reside on the other machine and only the graphical interface is displayed locally.  The simplest way to read data on one machine and use it on another is to use I/O redirection.  

&lt;pre&gt;
ssh fred@server.example.org 'cat /etc/ntpd.conf' | diff /etc/ntpd.conf - 
&lt;/pre&gt;

Or

&lt;pre&gt;
cat /etc/ntpd.conf | ssh fred@server.example.org 'diff /etc/ntpd.conf -' 
&lt;/pre&gt;

In the case where the local program expects to read a file from the remote machine, a named pipe can be used in conjunction with a redirect to transfer the data.  In the following example, a named pipe is created as a transfer point for the data.  Then [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh ssh(1)] is used to launch a remote process which sends output to '''stdout''' which is captured by a redirect on the local machine and sent to the named pipe.  Any [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sudo sudo(8)] privileges for [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=tcpdump tcpdump(8)] also need to operate without an interactive password, so great care and precision must be exercised to spell out in '''/etc/sudoers''' exactly which program and parameters are to be permitted and nothing more. The authentication for [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh ssh(1)] must also occur non-interactively, such as with a key and key agent.  Once the configurations are set, [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh ssh(1)] is run and sent to the background after connecting.   With [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh ssh(1)] in the background the local application is launched, in this case [http://linux.die.net/man/1/wireshark wireshark(1)], a graphical network analyser, which is set to read the named pipe as input.  

&lt;pre&gt;
mkfifo -m 600 netdata

ssh -fq -i /home/fred/.ssh/key_rsa \
    'sudo tcpdump -lqi eth0 -w - &quot;not port 22&quot;' &gt; netdata

wireshark -k -i netdata &amp;
&lt;/pre&gt;

In this particular example, it is important to add a filter rule to [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=tcpdump tcpdump(8)] itself to prevent an infinite feedback loop if [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh ssh(1)] is connecting over the same interface as the data being collected.  This loop is prevented by excluding either the SSH port, the host used by the SSH connection, or the corresponding network interface.

On some systems, process substitution can be used to simplify the transfer of data between the two machines.  Doing process substitution requires only a single line.  

&lt;pre&gt;
wireshark -k -i &lt;( ssh -fq -i /home/fred/.ssh/key_rsa \
                  'sudo tcpdump -lqi eth0 -w - &quot;not port 22&quot;' )
&lt;/pre&gt;

However, process substitution is not POSIX compliant and thus not portable across platforms.  It is limited to [http://linux.die.net/man/1/bash bash(1)] only and not present in other shells.  For portability, use a named pipe.

==X11 Forwarding==
It is possible to  run graphical programs on the remote machine and have them display locally by forwarding '''X11''', the current implementation of the X Window system. It is used to provide the graphical interface on many systems.  See the website [http://www.x.org/ www.X.org] for its history and technical details.  '''X11''' is built into most desktop operating systems.  It is even distributed as part of Macintosh OS X, though there it is not the default method of graphical display.  

'''X11''' forwarding OpenSSH is off by default and must be enabled on both the ssh client and the server if it is to be used.  

'''X11''' uses a client server architecture with the X server being the part that does the display for the end user and the various programs acting as the clients connecting to the server.  By putting the client and server on different machines and forwarding the '''X11''' connections, it is possible to run programs on other computers but have them displayed and available as if they were on the user's computer.  

A note of caution is warranted.  Allowing the remote machine to forward '''X11''' connections will allow it and its applications to access many devices and resources on the machine hosting the X server.  Regardless of the intent of the users, these are the devices and other resources accessible to the user account.  So forwarding should only be done when the other machine, that user account account and its applications are reliable.  

On the server side, to enable '''X11''' forwarding by default, put the line below in [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd_config sshd_config(5)]:
&lt;pre&gt;
X11Forwarding yes
&lt;/pre&gt;
On the client side, forwarding of '''X11''' is also off by default, but can be enabled using three different ways.  It can be enabled using '''-X''' or '''-Y''' as a run-time argument or in [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh_config ssh_config(5)].  
&lt;pre&gt;
ssh -l fred -X desk.example.org 
&lt;/pre&gt;

===Using ''ssh_config'' to specify X11 forwarding===
Or '''X11''' forwarding can be enabled in '''/etc/ssh_config''' for all accounts.  In '''~/.ssh/config''' and '''/etc/ssh/ssh_config''' it can be enabled for all hosts or for specific ones.   
&lt;pre&gt;
#  Enable for all hosts.  Maybe this is not a good idea.
X11Forwarding yes
&lt;/pre&gt;
It is possible to use ssh_config or '''~/.ssh/config''' to limit forwarding by default to an individual host by hostname or ip number.

&lt;pre&gt;
# enable for one machine by name
Host desk.example.org 
	X11Forwarding yes

# enable for one machine by ip number
Host 192.168.111.25 
	X11Forwarding yes
&lt;/pre&gt;

Or likewise use limited pattern matching to allow forwarding for a subdomain or a range of ip addresses:

&lt;pre&gt;
# Any host in the subdomain
Host *.pool.example.org 
	X11Forwarding yes

# Any host in the range 192.168.100.100 - 192.168.100.109
Host 192.168.100.10?
	X11Forwarding yes

# Any host in the range 192.168.123.1 - 192.168.123.255
Host 192.168.123.*
	X11Forwarding yes
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''X11''' is built-in to most desktop systems with optional add-on for OS X which has its roots in NextStep.  
'''X11''' support may be missing from some particularly outdated, legacy platforms.  But even there it is often possible to retrofit them, one example being the tool [http://www.straightrunning.com/XmingNotes/ Xming].

'''Status: This book is still under construction.'''

This book is an introduction to the art of software engineering.  It is intended as a textbook for an undergraduate level course.

Software engineering is about teams and it is about quality.  The problems to solve are so complex or large, that a single developer cannot solve them anymore.  Software engineering is also about communication.  Teams do not consist only of developers, but also of testers, architects, system engineers, customer, project managers, etc.  Software projects can be so large that we have to do careful planning.  Implementation is no longer just writing code, but it is also following guidelines, writing documentation and also writing unit tests.  But unit tests alone are not enough.  The different pieces have to fit together.  And we have to be able to spot problematic areas using metrics.  They tell us if our code follows certain standards.  Once we are finished coding, that does not mean that we are finished with the project: for large projects maintaining software can keep many people busy for a long time.  Since there are so many factors influencing the success or failure of a project, we also need to learn a little about project management and its pitfalls, but especially what makes projects successful.  And last but not least, a good software engineer, like any engineer, needs tools, and you need to know about them.

So we invite you to join us on the journey through the mazes of software engineering!

      <text xml:space="preserve">Host-based authentication allows hosts to authenticate on behalf of all or some of the system's users.  It can apply to all users on a system or a subset using the '''Match''' directive.   This type of authentication can be useful for managing computing clusters and other fairly homogenous pools of machines.  

In all, three files on the server and one on the client must be modified to prepare for host-based authentication.  


==Server Configuration for host-based authentication==

Three files on the server or target host must be modified to get host-based authentication working:
: /etc/ssh/shosts.equiv	- same syntax as old '''rhosts.equiv''', can point to '''netgroups'''
: /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts - hold the identities of the clients
: /etc/ssh/sshd_config	- turn on host-based authentication

===/etc/ssh/shosts.equiv===

The '''/etc/ssh/shosts.equiv''' identifies which addresses are allowed to try authenticating.  The file can contain hostnames, IP addresses, or netgroups.  
Best to keep this file simple and oriented to just the list of hosts, either by name or IP number.  It provides only the first cut, anyway.  For fine tuning, use [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd_config sshd_config(5)] to set or revoke access for specific users and groups.  &lt;pre&gt;
client1.example.org
192.0.2.102
client8.example.org -bull
@statcluster
&lt;/pre&gt;

Two more files may optionally be modified, if they are referred to from within '''shosts.equiv'''.  Each line in the '''netgroup''' file consists of a net group name followed by a list of the members of the net group, specifically host, user, and domain.
&lt;pre&gt;
 /etc/netgroup	default netgroup list
 /etc/netgroup.db	netgroup database, build from netgroup
&lt;/pre&gt;

However, these are mostly legacy from the old '''rhosts''' and can be avoided.

===/etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts===

Those hosts listed in the server's '''shosts.equiv''' must also have their public keys in '''/etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts''' on the server to be acknowledged.  There are three required data fields per line.  First is the host name or IP address or comma separated list of them, corresponding to those from '''shosts.equiv'''.  Next is the key type, either ssh-rsa for RSA keys or ssh-dss for DSA keys.  Third is the public key itself.  Last, and optionally, can be a comment about the key.  
&lt;pre&gt;
desktop,192.0.2.102 ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAABIw ... qqU24CcgzmM=
&lt;/pre&gt;

There are many ways of collecting the public key information.  It can be copied using [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sftp sftp(1)], copied from '''~/.ssh/known_hosts''' or it can be grabbed using [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh-keyscan ssh-keyscan(1)].  Though the latter two only work if the client host also has an SSH server running.  
&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh-keyscan -t rsa client.example.org &gt;&gt; /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts
&lt;/pre&gt;

If it is not possible for there to be a valid DNS entry resolving the hostname and address of the client, then it might be necessary to use a work-around to make up for that lack.  One choice is to use or set up a local name service using '''dnsmasq''' or some other easy option.  Or another choice is to set [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd sshd(8)] to accept the hostname information provided in the connection itself as being what it claims to be.  See the '''HostbasedUsesNameFromPacketOnly''' directive for '''sshd_config''' below.

===/etc/ssh/sshd_config===

The third file that must be changed on the server is '''sshd_config'''.  It must be told to allow host-based authentication.  That is done using the '''HostbasedAuthentication''' directive, either for all users or just some users or groups.  
&lt;pre&gt;
   HostbasedAuthentication yes
&lt;/pre&gt;

Host-based authentication can be limited to specific users or groups.  Here is an example excerpt from '''sshd_config''' allowing allow any user in the group ''turtles'' to let the hosts authenticate on their behalf:  

&lt;pre&gt;
Match Group turtles
   HostbasedAuthentication yes
&lt;/pre&gt;

If the client machine is not listed in DNS, then the server might have trouble recognising it.  In that case you might have to tell [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd sshd(8)] not to do reverse lookups in DNS for connecting hosts.  Excerpt from '''/etc/ssh/sshd_config''' to work around lack of DNS records for the client using the '''HostbasedUsesNameFromPacketOnly''' directive.  
&lt;pre&gt;
   HostbasedAuthentication yes
   HostbasedUsesNameFromPacketOnly yes
&lt;/pre&gt;
  
Sometimes the host connecting gets identified to the target host as something other than what was expected.  So make sure that the configuration files match what the host is actually calling itself.  

====Local user host-based authentication====

The list of allowed hosts can be either local for the user or global.  Individual users can have a local '''.shosts''' containing a list of trusted remote machines, or user-machine pairs, which are allowed to try host-based authentication. 

'''.shosts''' must not writable by any group or any other users.  Permissions set to 0644 should do it.  The usage and format of '''.shosts''' is exactly the same as .rhosts, but allows host-based authentication without permitting login by insecure, legacy tools '''rlogin''' and '''rsh'''.  The list is one line per host.  The first column is obligatory and contains the name or address of the host permitted to attempt host-based authentication.  

The second column is optional contains either a user name or netgroup name.  But the user name checks using this method are not secure and restricting which specific users or groups may authenticate should be configured in '''sshd_config''' instead by using the '''Match Group''' directive.  

See the manual page [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=hosts.equiv&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html hosts.equiv(5)] for more details on '''.shosts.'''

==Client Configuration for Host-based Authentication==

On the client or source host, a single file must be configured:
: /etc/ssh/ssh_config	- allow clients to request host-based authentication

There two changes are needed.  The OpenSSH client's configuration must request host-based authentication when connecting, either for all hosts or for specific ones.  Also, the global OpenSSH client configuration file must be set to enable [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh-keysign ssh-keysign(8)].  It is a helper application to access the local host keys and generate the digital signature required for host-based authentication.  The '''EnableSSHKeysign''' configuration must be done globally in '''/etc/ssh/ssh_config'''.  The program [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh-keysign ssh-keysign(8)] itself must be SUID root, but that was probably set when it was installed and no changes there are needed.  

Here is an excerpt from '''/etc/ssh/ssh_config''' on the client trying host-based authentication to all machines:
&lt;pre&gt;
Host * 
	HostbasedAuthentication yes
	EnableSSHKeysign yes
&lt;/pre&gt;

Note that the '''Host''' directive in [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh_config&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html ssh_config(5)] can be used to further constrain access, and other configuration specifics, to a particular server or group of servers.
&lt;pre&gt;
Host *.pool.example.org
	HostbasedAuthentication yes
	EnableSSHKeysign yes
&lt;/pre&gt;

If the home directory of the client host is one that is shared with other machines, say using NFS or AFS, then it may be useful to look at the '''NoHostAuthenticationForLocalhost''' directive, too.  

Further, at least one of the following files must exist and contain the appropriate private key.  The private key used should match the public key stored in the server or target host's '''ssh_known_hosts''' file.  Any of the three types can be used, RSA, DSA or ECDSA.    
: /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key
: /etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key
: /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key

The program [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh-keysign ssh-keysign(8)] needs to read the client host's private keys in '''/etc/ssh/'''.  It is enough to have the keys by themselves, or at least one key.  If the client host's private key does not exist, it will be necessary to add one manually before host-based authentication will work.  The easy way to add the key is to install the OpenSSH server.  These keys are then created automatically when the package containing [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd sshd(8)] is installed.  Note that the client's machine does not have to have an SSH server actually running in order to use host-based authentication.  So it is entirely feasible to install but then disable or uninstall the SSH server on the client's machine just to get the host keys in place.  


==Debugging==

Configuration should be quite straight forward, with small changes in only three files, plus a key, to manage.  If there are difficulties, be prepared to run [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd sshd(8)] standalone at debug level 1 ('''-d''') to 3 ('''-ddd''') and [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh ssh(1)] at debug level 3 ('''-vvv''') a few times to see what you missed.  The mistakes have to be cleared up in the right order, so take it one step at a time.  

Here is a sample excerpt from a successful host-based authentication for user ''fred'' from the host at ''192.0.2.102'', also known as ''desktop1'', using an RSA key.

The basic SFTP service requires no additional setup, it is a built-in part of the OpenSSH server.  However, the same options and tricks available for the regular SSH client are also available for SFTP clients.  Some options may have to be specified with the full option name using the '''-o''' argument.   

For many graphical SFTP clients, it is possible to use a regular URL to point to the target.  Many file managers nowadays have built-in support for SFTP.  See the section &quot;[[OpenSSH/Client_Applications#GUI_Clients|GUI Clients]]&quot; above.

The subsystem '''sftp-server''' implements SFTP file transfer.  See [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sftp-server sftp-server(8)].  The subsystem [[OpenSSH/Server#The_SFTP_Server_Subsystem|internal-sftp]] implements an in-process SFTP server which may simplify configurations using '''ChrootDirectory''' to force a different filesystem root on clients.

==Basic SFTP==

Just to say it again, regular SFTP access requires no additional changes from the default configuration.  SFTP provides a very easy to use and very easy to configure option for accessing a remote system.  The usual clients can be used or special ones like '''sshfs'''.

===Automated SFTP===

SFTP uploads or downloads can be automated.  The prerequisite is [[OpenSSH/Cookbook/Authentication_Keys | key-based authentication]].  Once key-based authentication is working, a batch file can be used to carry out activities via SFTP.  See ''batchfile'' (-b) in [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sftp sftp(1)] for details.  

&lt;pre&gt;
$ sftp -b /home/fred/cmds.batch -i /home/fred/.ssh/foo_key_rsa server.example.org:/home/fred/logs/
&lt;/pre&gt;

If a dash ('''-''') is used as the batchfile name, SFTP commands will be read from '''stdin'''.

&lt;pre&gt;
$ echo &quot;put /var/log/foobar.log&quot; | sftp -b - -i /home/fred/.ssh/foo_key_rsa server.example.org:/home/fred/logs/
&lt;/pre&gt;

More than one SFTP command can be sent, but it is better then to use an actual batch file.

&lt;pre&gt;
$ echo -e &quot;put /var/log/foobar.log\nput /var/log/munged.log&quot; | sftp -b - -i /home/fred/.ssh/foo_key_rsa server.example.org:/home/fred/logs/
&lt;/pre&gt;

The batch file mode can be very useful in cron jobs and in scripting.

==SFTP-only Accounts==

Using the '''Match''' directive in [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd_config sshd_config(5)], it is possible to limit members of a specific group to using only SFTP for interaction with the server.  
&lt;pre&gt;
Subsystem sftp internal-sftp

Match Group sftp-only
	AllowTCPForwarding no
	X11Forwarding no
	ForceCommand internal-sftp
&lt;/pre&gt;

Note that disabling TCP forwarding does not improve security unless users are also denied shell access, as they can in principle install their own forwarders.

See PATTERNS in [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh_config ssh_config(5)] for more information on patterns avaiable to '''Match'''.

===Chrooted SFTP-only Accounts===

It's common that a group of users need to read and write files to their home directories on the server, but have little or no reason to access the rest of the file system.  SFTP provides a very easy to use and very easy to configure chroot.  In some cases, it is enough to chroot users to their home directories.
Depending on the opensshd version this may not be usable since some versions require that the chroot-target directory and all parent directories are owned by root and not writeable by any others.  In most cases home directories aren't owned by root and allow writing by at least one user.  One way around this restriction is to have the home directory owned by root, but have it populated with a number of other directories and files that are owned by the actual user to which the user can write.

&lt;pre&gt;
Subsystem sftp internal-sftp

Match Group sftp-only
	ChrootDirectory %h
	AllowTCPForwarding no
	X11Forwarding no
	ForceCommand internal-sftp
&lt;/pre&gt;

If it is not practical to have users' home directories owned by root, a compromise can be made.  '''ChrootDirectory''' can point to /home, which must be owned by root anyway, and then '''ForceCommand''' can then designate the user's home directory as the starting directory using the '''-d''' option.  

&lt;pre&gt;
Subsystem sftp internal-sftp

Match Group sftp-only
        ChrootDirectory /home
        AllowTCPForwarding no
        X11Forwarding no
        ForceCommand internal-sftp -d %u
&lt;/pre&gt;

If it is necessary to hide the contents of the home directories from other users, [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=chmod chmod(1)] should be used.  Permissions could be 0111 for /home and 0750 or 0700 for the home directories, be sure to check the group memberships as well.

Another common case is to chroot access to a web server's document root or server root.

&lt;pre&gt;
Subsystem sftp internal-sftp

Match Group webmasters
	ChrootDirectory /var/www
	AllowTCPForwarding no
	X11Forwarding no
	ForceCommand internal-sftp
&lt;/pre&gt;

===Umask===
Starting with OpenSSH 5.4, [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sftp-server sftp-server(8)] can set a umask to override the default one set by the user’s account.  The in-process SFTP server, internal-sftp, accepts the same options as the external SFTP subsystem.

&lt;pre&gt;
Subsystem sftp internal-sftp -u 0022
&lt;/pre&gt;

Earlier versions can do the same thing through the use of a helper script, but this complicates chrooted directories very much.  The helper script can be a regular script or it can be embedded inline in the configuration file though neither works easily in a chroot jail.  It’s often easier to get a newer version of [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd sshd(8)] which supports umask as part of the server’s configuration.

&lt;pre&gt;
# inline helper script for umask in OpenSSH 5.3 and earler, based on one by gilles@
Subsystem sftp /bin/sh -c 'umask 0022; /usr/libexec/openssh/sftp-server'
&lt;/pre&gt;

This umask is server-side only.  The original file permissions on the client side will usually, but not always, be used when calculating the final file permissions on the server.  This depends on the client itself.  Most clients pass the file permissions on to the server, FileZilla being a notable exception.  As such, permissions can generally be tightened but not loosened.  For example, a file that is mode 600 on the client will not be automatically made 664 or anything else less than the original 600 regardless of the server-side umask.  That is unless the client does not forward the permissions, in which case only the server's umask will be used.  So for most clients, if you want looser permissions on the uploaded file, change them on the client before uploading.

===Chrooted SFTP to Shared Directories===

Another common case is to chroot a group of users to different levels of the web server they are responsible for.  For obvious reasons, symbolic links going from inside the jail to parts of the filesystem outside the chroot jail are not accessible to the chrooted users.  So directory hierarchies must be planned more carefully if there are special combinations of access.  
&lt;pre&gt;
Subsystem sftp internal-sftp

Match Group webdevel
	ChrootDirectory /var/www/site1
	ForceCommand internal-sftp

Match Group webauthors
	ChrootDirectory /var/www/site1/htdocs
	ForceCommand internal-sftp
&lt;/pre&gt;

In these kinds of directories, it may be useful to give different levels of access to more than just one group.  In that case, ACLs should be used.

===Chrooted SFTP Accounts Accessible Only from Particular Addresses===

More complex matching can be done.  It is possible to allow a group of users to use SFTP, but not a shell login, only if they log in from a specific address or range of addresses.  If they log in from the right addresses, then get SFTP and only SFTP, but if they try to log in from other addresses they will be denied access completely.  Both conditions, the affirmative and negative matches, need to be accounted for.  

&lt;pre&gt;
Subsystem sftp internal-sftp

Match Group sftp-only, Address 192.0.43.10
        AllowTCPForwarding no
        X11Forwarding no
        ForceCommand internal-sftp
        ChrootDirectory  /home/servers/

Match Group sftp-only, Address *,!192.0.43.10
        DenyGroups sftp-only
&lt;/pre&gt;

Note that for negation a wildcard must be specified first and then the address or range to be excluded following it.  Mind the spaces or lack thereof.  Similar matching can be done for a range of addresses by specifying the addresses in CIDR address/mask format, such as 192.0.32.0/20.  Any number of criteria can be specified and only if all of them are met then the directive in the subsequent lines take effect.  

Again, the first '''Match''' block that fits is the one that takes effect, so care must be taken when constructing conditional blocks to make them fit the precise situation desired.  Also, any situations that don't fit a '''Match''' conditional block will fall through the cracks.  Those will get the general configuration settings whatever they may be.  Specific user and source address combinations can be tested with the configurations using the '''-T''' and '''-C''' options with the server for more options.  See the section [[OpenSSH/Logging#Debugging_a_server_configuration| Debugging a Server Configuration]] for more.

The logging daemon must establish a socket in the chroot directory for the sftp-server subsystem to access as '''/dev/log'''   See the section on [[OpenSSH/Logging|Logging]].

===Chrooted login shells===

The chroot and all its components, must be root-owned directories that are not writable by any other user or group.  The '''ChrootDirectory''' must contain the necessary files and directories to support the user's session.  For an interactive session this requires at least a shell, typically '''bash''' or '''ksh''' or [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sh sh(1)], and basic '''/dev''' nodes such as [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=null null(4)], [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=zero zero(4)], [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=stdin stdin(4)], [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=stdout stdout(4)], [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=stderr stderr(4)], [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=arandom arandom(4)] and [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=tty tty(4)] devices.  
The path may contain the following tokens that are expanded at runtime once the connecting user has been authenticated: '''%%''' is replaced by a literal ''''%'''', '''%h''' is replaced by the home directory of the user being authenticated, and '''%u''' is replaced by the username of that user.

==sshfs - SFTP file transfer via local folders==

Another way to transfer files back and forth, or even use them remotely, is to use '''sshfs'''  It is a file system client based on SFTP and utilizes the sftp-subsystem.  It can make a directory on the remote server accessible as a directory on the local file system which can be accessed by any program just as if it were a local directory.  The user must have read-write privileges for mount point to use '''sshfs'''.  

The following creates the mount point, ''server'', in the home directory if none exists.  Then '''sshfs''' mounts the remote server.

&lt;pre&gt;
$ test -e ~/mountpoint || mkdir --mode 700 ~/mountpoint
$ sshfs fred@server.example.org:. ~/mountpoint
&lt;/pre&gt;

Reading or writing files to the mount point is actually transferring data to or from the remote system.  The amount of bandwidth consumed by the transfers can be reduced using compression.  That can be important if the network connection has bandwidth caps or per-unit fees.  However, if speed is the only issue, compression can make the transfer slower if the processors on either end are busy or not powerful enough.  About the only way to be sure is to test and see which method is faster.   Below, compression is specified with '''-C'''.

&lt;pre&gt;
$ sshfs -C fred@server.example.org:. ~/mountpoint
&lt;/pre&gt;

Or try with debugging output:
&lt;pre&gt;
$ sshfs -o sshfs_debug fred@server.example.org:. /home/fred/mountpoint
&lt;/pre&gt;

Named pipes will not work over '''sshfs'''.

===sshfs with a key ===
The '''ssh_command''' option is used to pass parameters on to &lt;tt&gt;ssh(1)&lt;/tt&gt;.  In this example it is used to have &lt;tt&gt;ssh(1)&lt;/tt&gt; point to a key used for authentication to mount a remote directory, /usr/src, locally as /home/fred/src.  
&lt;pre&gt;
$ sshfs -o ssh_command=&quot;ssh -i /home/fred/.ssh/id_rsa&quot; fred@server.example.org:/usr/src /home/fred/src/
&lt;/pre&gt;

If a usable key is already loaded into the agent, then &lt;tt&gt;ssh(1)&lt;/tt&gt; should find it and use it on behalf of &lt;tt&gt;sshfs(1)&lt;/tt&gt; without needing intervention.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==MaxStartups==

If the number of incoming connections is not managed at the network level by a packet filter or other tricks like round-robin DNS, it is possible to limit it at the SSH server itself.   Setting '''MaxStartups''' to an integer sets a hard limit to  the maximum number of concurrent unauthenticated connections to the SSH daemon.  Additional connections will be dropped until authentication succeeds or the '''LoginGraceTime''' expires for another connection.  The old default was 10.

&lt;pre&gt;
MaxStartups   10
&lt;/pre&gt;

Alternately, random early drop can be enabled by specifying the three colon-separated values ''start'':''rate'':''full''.  After the number of unauthenticated connections reaches the value specified by ''start'', '''sshd''' will begin to refuse new connections at a percentage specified by ''rate''.  The proportional rate of refused connections then increases linearly as the limit specified by ''full'' is approached until 100% is reached.  At that point all new attempts at connection are refused until the backlog goes down.  

&lt;pre&gt;
MaxStartups   10:30:100
&lt;/pre&gt;

For example, if '''MaxStartups 5:30:90''' is given in '''sshd_config''', then starting with 5 new connections pending authentication the server will start to drop 30% of the new connections.  By the time the backlog increases to 90 pending unauthenticated connections, 100% will be dropped.  

In the default settings, the value for ''full'' has been increased to 100 pending connections to make it harder to succumb to a denial of service due to attack or heavy load.  So the new default is 10:30:100.

==Preventing timeouts of a not so active session==

There are two connections that can be tracked during an SSH session, the network's TCP connection and the encrypted SSH session traveling on top of it.  Some tunnels and VPNs might not be active all the time, so there is the risk that the session times out or even that the TCP session times out at the router or firewall.  The network connection can be be tracked with '''TCPKeepAlive''', but is not an accurate indication of the state of the actual SSH connections.  It is, however, a useful indicator of the status of the actual network.  Either the client or the server can counter that by keeping either the encrypted connection active using a heartbeat.  

On the server side, '''ClientAliveInterval''' sets the interval in seconds between client alive heartbeats.  '''ClientAliveCountMax''' sets the maximum number of missed client messages allowed before the encrypted SSH session is considered closed.  If no other data has been sent or received during that time, sshd(8) will send a message through the encrypted channel to request a response from the client.  If sshd_config has ClientAliveInterval set to 15, and '''ClientAliveCountMax''' set to 4, unresponsive SSH clients will be disconnected after approximately 60 (=15 x 4) seconds.  

&lt;pre&gt;
ClientAliveInterval  15
ClientAliveCountMax  4
&lt;/pre&gt;

On the client side, if the global client configuration is not set, individual users can use '''ServerAliveInterval''' to set the interval in seconds between server alive heartbeats and  '''ServerAliveCountMax''' sets the corresponding maximum number of missed client messages allowed before the encrypted SSH session is considered closed.  The same principal applies as with the server.  This is set in [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh_config ~/.ssh/config].

&lt;pre&gt;
ServerAliveInterval  15
ServerAliveCountMax  4
&lt;/pre&gt;

==TCP Wrappers (tcpd)==
As of 6.7, OpenSSH's [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi/OpenBSD-current/man8/sshd.8?query=sshd sshd(8)] no longer supports '''tcpwrappers'''.  So this subsection only applies to 6.6 and earlier.  Other options that can be used with or without '''tcpwrappers''' include packet filters like PF &lt;ref name=&quot;Hansteen_PF&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://home.nuug.no/~peter/pf/
 |title=Firewalling with PF  |author=Peter N M Hansteen |year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;, ipf or IPTables.  

'''tcpwrappers''', also known as [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=tcpd&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html tcpd(8)], is an access control utility for incoming requests to Internet services.  It can be used for services that have a one-to-one mapping to executables, such as '''sshd''', and that have been compiled to interact with '''tcpd'''.   It checks first a whitelist ('''/etc/hosts.allow''') and then a blacklist ('''/etc/hosts.deny''') to approve or deny access.  The first pattern to match any given connection attempt is used.  The default in '''/etc/hosts.deny''' is to block access, if no rules match in '''/etc/hosts.allow''':

&lt;pre&gt;
sshd: ALL
&lt;/pre&gt;
In addition to access control, tcpd can be set to run scripts using twist or spawn when a rule is triggered.  spawn launches another program as a child process of tcpd.  From '''/etc/hosts.allow''':

&lt;pre&gt;
sshd: .example.org : allow
sshd: .example.com : spawn \
	/bin/date -u +&quot;%%F %%T UTC from %h&quot; &gt;&gt; /var/log/sshd.log : allow
&lt;/pre&gt;
The variable '''%h''' expands to the connecting clients host name or ip number.  The manual page for  [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=hosts_access&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html hosts_access(5)] includes a full description of the variables available.  Because the program in the example, date, uses the same symbol for variables, the escape character ('''%''') must be escaped ('''%%''') so it will be ignored by '''tcpd''' and get passed on to date correctly.  

'''twist''' replaces the service requested with another program.  It is sometimes used for honeypots, but can really be used for anything.  From '''/etc/hosts.deny''':

&lt;pre&gt;
sshd: .example.org : deny
sshd: ALL : twist /bin/echo &quot;Sorry, fresh out.&quot; : deny
&lt;/pre&gt;
With '''tcpwrappers''' the whitelist '''/etc/hosts.allow''' is searched first, then the blacklist '''/etc/hosts.deny'''.  The first match is applied.  If no applicable rules are found, then access is granted by default.  

===Using tcp wrappers to allow connections only from a specific subnet===

Ok, it is possible to just set [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html sshd(1)] to listen only to the local address and not accept any external connections by setting '''sshd_config''' accordingly.  That is one way.  To use '''tcpwrappers''' for that, put a line in '''/etc/hosts.deny''' blocking everything:

&lt;pre&gt;
sshd: ALL
&lt;/pre&gt;

And add an exception for the in '''/etc/hosts.allow''' by designating the ip range using CIDR notation or by domain name
&lt;pre&gt;
sshd: 192.0.32.0/20
&lt;/pre&gt;
The same method can be used to limit access to just the localhost (127.0.0.0/8) by adding a line to '''/etc/hosts.allow''':  
&lt;pre&gt;
sshd: 127.0.0.0/8
&lt;/pre&gt;
Again, the best practice is to block from everywhere and then open up exceptions.  Keep in mind that if domains are used instead of IP ranges, DNS entries must be in order and DNS itself accessible.

==The Extended Internet Services Daemon (xinetd)==

The Extended Internet Services Daemon, '''xinetd''', can provide many kinds of access control. It includes but is not limited to name, address or network of remote host and time of day.  It can place limits on the number of services per each service as well as discontinue services if loads exceed a certain limit.

The super-server listens for incoming requests and launches '''sshd''' on demand, so it is necessary to first stop '''sshd''' from running as standalone daemon.  This may mean modifying System V init scripts or Upstart configuration files.  Then make an '''xinetd''' configuration file for the service SSH. It will probably go in '''/etc/xinetd.d/ssh'''  The argument '''-i''' is important as it tells '''sshd''' that it is being run from '''xinetd'''.

&lt;pre&gt;
service ssh
{
	socket_type     = stream
	protocol        = tcp
	wait            = no
	user            = root
	server          = /usr/sbin/sshd
	server_args     = -i
	per_source      = UNLIMITED
	log_on_failure  = USERID HOST
	access_times    = 08:00-15:25
	banner          = /etc/banner.inetd.connection.txt
	banner_success  = /etc/banner.inetd.welcome.txt	
	banner_fail     = /etc/banner.inetd.takeahike.txt

	# log_on_success  = PID HOST DURATION TRAFFIC EXIT
	# instances       = 10
	# nice            = 10
	# bind            = 192.168.0.100
	# only_from       = 192.168.0.0
	# no_access       = 192.168.54.0
	# no_access       += 192.168.33.0
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Finally, reload the configuration by sending SIGHUP to '''xinetd'''.

I suggest merging [[SSH, the Secure Shell]] into  [[OpenSSH]] -- taking the three pages of the book [[SSH, the Secure Shell]] and moving them into the book [[OpenSSH]].

:I'd say that [[SSH, the Secure Shell]] is a book fragment that can safely be removed at this point.  The sections 'Using SSH' and 'FAQ' are both empty and the sections 'Introduction' and 'Configuration' are extremely sparse.  These topics are already covered in great detail in [[OpenSSH]].  The section 'Installation' is redundant because all distros manage that through their package manager.  In some cases, like OS X and OpenBSD, it comes pre-installed.  As mentioned in [[OpenSSH]] there are multiple implementations of SSH. If someone with knowledge of them were to expand on them in the book, the book OpenSSH could then be renamed to a more general 'SSH, the Secure Shell' [[User:Larsnooden|Larsnooden]] ([[User talk:Larsnooden|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Larsnooden|contribs]]) 10:29, 1 March 2013 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">A proxy is an intermediary that forwards requests from clients to other servers.  Performance improvement, load balancing, security or access control are some reasons they are used.  Some proxies include caching to save bandwidth and increase speed by avoiding going out to the net to keep retrieving the same, unchanged documents.  

==SOCKS Proxy==
It's possible to connect via an intermediate machine using a SOCKS proxy.  SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxies are currently supported by OpenSSH.  SOCKS5&lt;ref name=&quot;WikiMarkup&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1928
 |title= SOCKS Protocol version 5|publisher=IETF|accessdate=2011-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; allows transparent traversal, by an application, of a firewall or other barrier and can use strong authentication with help of GSS-API.Dynamic application-level port forwarding allows the outgoing port to be allocated on the fly thus creating a proxy at the tcp session level.  

Here the web browser can connect to the SOCKS proxy on port 3555 on the local host:

&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh -D 3555 server.example.org 
&lt;/pre&gt;

Using ssh as a socks5 proxy, or in any other capacity where forwarding is used, you can specify multiple ports in one action:
&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh -D 80 -D 8080 -f -C -q -N fred@server.example.org
&lt;/pre&gt;

For example in Firefox, you'll also want the DNS requests to go via your proxy, so changing''' about:config''' needs '''network.proxy.socks_remote_dns''' set to '''true'''

It'll be similar for other programs that support SOCKS proxies.

You can tunnel samba over ssh, too.

===Tunneling SSH Over Tor with Netcat===

Instead of using '''ssh''' as a SOCKS proxy, it is possible to tunnel the SSH protocol itself over a SOCKS proxy such as [https://www.torproject.org/ Tor].  Tor is anonymity software and a corresponding network that uses relay hosts to conceal a user's location and network activity.   Its architecture is intended to prevent surveillance and traffic analysis.  Tor can be used in cases where it is important to conceal the point of origin of the SSH client.  

On the end point that the client sees, Tor is a regular SOCKS 5 proxy and can be used like any other SOCKS 5 proxy.  So this is tunneling SSH over a SOCKS proxy.  For example, if Tor is installed locally and listening on a port, then SSH can run over Tor
&lt;ref name=&quot;sshtor&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorifyHOWTO/ssh |title= SSH Over Tor |publisher=The Tor Project | date=2012-08-28 | accessdate=2013-05-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; using [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=nc netcat]:

&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh -o ProxyCommand=&quot;nc -X 5 -x localhost:9150 %h %p&quot; server.example.org
&lt;/pre&gt;

If the user name on the remote system is different from that on the local system, it is possible to pass along a different user name.

&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh -o User=fred -o ProxyCommand=&quot;nc -X 5 -x localhost:9150 %h %p&quot; server.example.org
&lt;/pre&gt;

When attempting a connection like this, it is very important that it does not leak information.  In particular, the DNS lookup should occur over Tor and not be done by the client itself.  Make sure that if '''VerifyHostKeyDNS''' is used that it be set to 'no'.  The default is 'no' but check to be sure.  It can be passed as a run-time argument to remove any doubt or uncertainty.

&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh -o &quot;VerifyHostKeyDNS=no&quot; -o ProxyCommand=&quot;nc -X 5 -x localhost:9150 %h %p&quot; server.example.org
&lt;/pre&gt;

Using the netcat-openbsd '''nc''' package, this seems not to leak any DNS information.  Other netcat packages might or might not be the same.  It's also not clear if there are other ways in which this method might leak information.  YMMV.

==Jump Hosts -- Passing through a gateway or two==
It is possible to connect to another host via an intermediary or two so that the client can act as if the connection were direct.  '''ProxyCommand''' works and the utility Netcat fits here, too.

A useful trick is &quot;ssh -tt&quot; which forces tty allocation, so instead of the above you can do the following, connecting to server2 via firewall as the jump host: 

&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh -tt firewall.example.com ssh -tt server2.example.org
&lt;/pre&gt;

This opens an ssh terminal to the remote machine. You can also pass commands.  For example, to reattach to a remote screen session using [http://linux.die.net/man/1/screen screen] you can do the following:

&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh -tt firewall.example.com ssh -tt server2.example.org screen -dR
&lt;/pre&gt;

The chain can be arbitrarily long and is not limited to just two hosts. 


===Port Forwarding via an Intermediate Host===

Tunneling, also called port forwarding, is when a port on one machine mapped to a connection to a port on another machine.  In that way remote services can be accessed as if they were local.  Or in the case of reverse port forwarding, vice verse.  Forwarding can be done directly from one machine to another or via a machine in the middle.  

Below we are setting up a tunnel from the ''localhost'' to ''machine2'', which is behind a firewall, ''machine1''.  The tunnel will be via ''machine1'' which is publicly accessible and also has access to ''machine2''.
&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh -L 2222:machine2.example.org:22 machine1.example.org
&lt;/pre&gt;

Next connecting to the tunnel will actually connect to the second host, ''machine2''.

&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh -p 2222 remoteuser@localhost
&lt;/pre&gt;

That's it.

It is possible to use all the options in this way, such as '''-X''' for X11 forwarding.  Here is an example of running '''rsync''' between the two hosts using ''machine1'' as an intermediary with the above setup.

&lt;pre&gt;
$ rsync -av -e &quot;ssh -p 2222&quot;  /path/to/some/dir/   localhost:/path/to/some/dir/
&lt;/pre&gt;

===ProxyCommand with Netcat===

Another way is to use the '''ProxyCommand''' configuration directive and [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=nc netcat].  The utility '''netcat''' is for reading and writing network connections directly.  It can be used to pass connections onward to a second machine.  In this case, ''login'' is the final destination reached via the intermediary ''jumphost''.

&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh -o 'ProxyCommand ssh %h nc login.example.edu 22' \
      -o 'HostKeyAlias=login.example.edu' \
      jumphost.example.org
&lt;/pre&gt;

Keys and different login names can also be used.  Using '''ProxyCommand''', '''ssh''' will first connect to ''jumphost'' and then from there to login.example.edu.  The '''HostKeyAlias''' directive is needed to look up the right key for login.example.edu, without it the key for ''jumphost'' will be tried and that will, of course, fail unless both have the same keys.  The account ''user2'' exists on ''jumphost''.  
&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh -o 'ProxyCommand ssh -i key-rsa -l user2 %h nc login.example.edu 22' \
      -o 'HostKeyAlias=login.example.edu' \
      jumphost.example.org
&lt;/pre&gt;

It's also possible to make this arrangement more permanent and reduce typing by editing '''ssh_config'''  Here a connection is made to host2 via host1:

&lt;pre&gt;
Host host2.example.org
  ProxyCommand ssh fred@host1.example.org nc %h %p
&lt;/pre&gt;

Here a connection is made to server2 via server1 using the shortcut name 'jump'.

&lt;pre&gt;
Host jump
  ProxyCommand ssh %h nc server2.example.org 22
  HostKeyAlias server2.example.org
  Hostname server1.example.org
  User fred
&lt;/pre&gt;

It can be made more general:

&lt;pre&gt;
Host gateway.example.org
  ProxyCommand none

Host *.example.org my-private-host
  ProxyCommand ssh myuser@gateway.example.org nc %h %p
&lt;/pre&gt;

The same can be done with '''sftp''' by passing parameters on to '''ssh'''.   Here is a simple example with '''sftp''' where machine1 is the jump host to connect to machine2.  The user name is the same for both hosts.

&lt;pre&gt;
$ sftp -o 'ProxyCommand=ssh %h nc machine2.example.edu 22' \
       -o 'HostKeyAlias=machine2.example.edu' \
       fred@machine1.example.edu
&lt;/pre&gt;

Here is a more complex example using a key for server1 but regular password-based login for the SFTP server.  

&lt;pre&gt;
$ sftp -o 'ProxyCommand ssh -i /Volumes/Home/fred/.ssh/server1_rsa \
       -l user2 server1.example.edu nc sftp.example.edu 22'   \
       -o 'HostKeyAlias=sftp.example.edu' sftp.example.edu
&lt;/pre&gt;

If the user accounts names are different on the two machines, that works, too.  Here, 'user2' is the account on the second machine which is the final target.  The user 'fred' is the account on the intermediary or jump host.

&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh -l user2 \
      -o 'ProxyCommand ssh -l fred %h nc machine2.example.org 22' \
      -o 'HostKeyAlias machine2.example.org' \
      machine1.example.org
&lt;/pre&gt;

===Passing through a gateway using netcat mode===
As of OpenSSH 5.4&lt;ref name=&quot;Netcat_mode&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.openssh.com/txt/release-5.4
 |title=OpenSSH 5.4 Release Notes|publisher=OpenSSH|accessdate=2013-04-19|date=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;, a 'netcat mode' can connect stdio on the client to a single port forwarded on the server.  This can also be used to connect using '''ssh(1)''', but it needs the '''ProxyCommand''' option either as a run time parameter or as part of '''~/.ssh/config'''.  However, it no longer needs netcat to be installed on the intermediary machine(s).  Here is an example of using it in a run time parameter.  

&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh -o ProxyCommand=&quot;ssh -W %h:%p jumphost.example.org&quot; server.example.org
&lt;/pre&gt;

In that example, authentication will happen twice, first on the jump host and then on the final host where it will bring up a shell.  

The syntax is the same if the gateway is identified in the configuration file.  '''ssh(1)''' expands the full name of the gateway and the desintation from the configuration file.  The following allows the destination host to be reached by entering ''ssh server'' in the terminal.  

&lt;pre&gt;
Host server
  Hostname server.example.org
  ProxyCommand ssh jumphost.example.org -W %h:%p
 &lt;/pre&gt;

The same can be done for SFTP.  Here the destination SFTP server can be reached by entering ''sftp sftpserver'' and the configuration file takes care of the rest.  If there is a mix up with the final host key, then it is necessary to add in '''HostKeyAlias''' to explicitly name which key will be used to identify the destination system.  

&lt;pre&gt;
Host sftpserver
  HostName sftpserver.example.org
  HostKeyAlias sftpserver.example.org
  ProxyCommand ssh jumphost.example.org -W %h:%p
 &lt;/pre&gt;

It is possible to add the key for the gateway to the ssh-agent which you have running or else specify it in the configuration file.  The option '''User''' refers to the user name on the destination.  If the user is the same on both the destination and the originating machine, then it does not need to be used.  If the user name is different on the gateway, then the '''-l''' option can be used in the '''ProxyCommand''' option.  Here, the user ''fred'' on the local machine, logs into the gateway as ''fred2'' and into the destination server as ''fred3''.

&lt;pre&gt;
Host server
  HostName server.example.org
  User fred3
  ProxyCommand ssh -l fred2 -i /home/fred/.ssh/rsa_key jumphost.example.org -W %h:%p
&lt;/pre&gt;

If both the gateway and destination are using keys, then the option '''IdentityFile''' is used to point to the destination's private key.  

&lt;pre&gt;
Host jump
  HostName server.example.org
  IdentityFile /home/fred/.ssh/rsa_key_2
  ProxyCommand ssh -i /home/fred/.ssh/rsa_key jumphost.example.org -W %h:%p
&lt;/pre&gt;

The old way prior to OpenSSH 5.4 used netcat, '''nc(1)'''.

&lt;pre&gt;
Host server
  Hostname server.example.org
  ProxyCommand ssh jumphost.example.org nc %h %p
&lt;/pre&gt;

But that should not be used anymore and the netcat mode, provided by '''-W''', should be used instead.  The new way does not require netcat at all on any of the machines.

===Recursively chaining gateways===
It is possible to make the configuration more abstract and allow passing through an arbitrary number of gateways.   This particular configuration only works if the user name is the same across all hosts involved.  There are limitations resulting from using the slash as a separator, as there would be with other symbols.  However, it allows use of '''dirname(1)''' and '''hostname(1)''' to process the host names.  

&lt;pre&gt;
Host */* 
  ProxyCommand ssh $(dirname %h) -W $(basename %h):%p
&lt;/pre&gt;

In this way hosts are separated with a slash (/) and can be arbitrary in number&lt;ref name=&quot;proxycommand-chaining&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://joshua.hoblitt.com/rtfm/2011/09/recursively_chaining_ssh_proxycommand/ |title=Recursively chaining SSH ProxyCommand |author=Josh Hoblitt | publisher=[Read This Fine Material] from Joshua Hoblitt|date=2011-09-03 |accessdate=2014-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  

&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh host1/host2/host3/host4
&lt;/pre&gt;

If keys are to be used, then agent forwarding can be specified in the command given in the '''ProxyCommand''' option using '''-A''' and first loading the keys into the agent.

The following configuration uses '''sed(1)''' to allow different port numbers and user names using the plus sign (+) as the delimiter for hosts, a colon (:) for ports, and an equal sign (=) for user names.  The basic structure is ''ssh $() -W $():$()'' and where '''%h''' is substituted for the target host name.  

&lt;pre&gt;
Host *+*
  ProxyCommand ssh -v $(echo %h | sed -e 's/+[^+]*$//; s/\([^+=]*\)=\([^+]*\)$/\2 -l \1/; s/^\([^+:]*\):\([0-9]*\)+/-p \2 \1+/' ) -W $(echo %h | sed -e 's/^.*+//; s/:.*$//;'):$(echo %h | sed -e ' s/^.*+//; /:/!s/^.*/22/; s/^.*://' ;)
&lt;/pre&gt;

The port can be left off for the default of 22 or delimited with a colon (:) for non-standard values.  

&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh host1+host2:2022+host3:2224
&lt;/pre&gt;

As-is, the colons confound '''sftp(1)''', so the above configuration will only work with it using standard ports.  If '''sftp(1)''' is needed on non-standard ports then another delimiter, such as an underscore (_), can be configured.  

Any user name except the final one can be specified for a given host using the designated delimiter, in the above it is an equal sign (=).  The destination host's user name is specified with '''-l''' and all others can be joined to their corresponding host name with the delimiter.

&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh -l user3 user1=host1+user2=host2+host3
&lt;/pre&gt;

If user names are specified, depending on the delimiter, '''ssh(1)''' can be unable to match the final host  to an IP number and the key fingerprint in ''known_hosts''.  In such cases, it will ask for verification each time the connection is established, but this should not be a problem if the equal sign (=) is used.

==Passing through a gateway with an ad hoc VPN==
Two subnets can be connected over ssh by configuring the network routing on the end points to use the tunnel.  The result is a VPN.  A drawback is that root access is needed on both hosts, or at least '''sudo''' access to '''ifconfig''' and '''route'''.  Note, there are very few instances where use of a VPN is legitimately called for, not because VPNs are illegal (quite they opposite, indeed data protection laws in many countries make them absolutely compulsory to protect content in transit) but simply because OpenSSH is usually flexible enough to complete most routine sysadmin and operational tasks using normal SSH methods as and when required. This SSH ad-hoc VPN method is therefore needed only very rarely.
 
Take this example with two networks.  One network has the address range 10.0.50.1 through 10.0.50.254.  The other has the address range 172.16.99.1 through 172.16.99.254.  Each has a machine, 10.0.50.1 and 172.16.99.1 respectively, that will function as a gateway.  Local machine numbering starts with 3 because 2 will be used for the tunnel interfaces on each LAN.  
&lt;pre&gt;
              +----10.0.50.1       172.16.99.1----+
              +    10.0.50.2 ===== 172.16.99.2    +
              |                                   |
10.0.50.3-----+                                   +---172.16.99.3
              |                                   |
10.0.50.4-----+                                   +---172.16.99.4
              |                                   |
10.0.50.5-----+                                   +---172.16.99.5
              |                                   |
10.0.50.etc---+                                   +---172.16.99.etc
              |                                   |
10.0.50.254---+                                   +---172.16.99.254
&lt;/pre&gt;

First a tun device is created on each machine, a virtual network device for point-to-point IP tunneling.  
Then the tun interfaces on these two gateways are then connected by an ssh tunnel.  Each tun interface is assigned an IP address.  

The tunnel connects machines  10.0.50.1 and  172.16.99.1 to each other, and each are already connected to their own local area network (LAN).  Here is a VPN with the client as 10.0.50.0/24, remote as 172.16.99.0/24.  First, set on the client:

&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh -f -w 0:1 192.0.2.15 true
$ ifconfig tun0 10.1.1.1 10.1.1.2 netmask 255.255.255.252
$ route add 10.0.99.0/24 10.1.1.2
&lt;/pre&gt;

On the server:

&lt;pre&gt;
$ ifconfig tun1 10.1.1.2 10.1.1.1 netmask 255.255.255.252
$ route add 10.0.50.0/24 10.1.1.1
&lt;/pre&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{BookCat}}
Using OpenSSH with keys can facilitate secure automated backups.  It's a myth that remote root access must be allowed.  '''sudo''' works just fine -- if properly configured.  '''rsync'''&lt;ref name=&quot;RsyncWorks&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.samba.org/rsync/how-rsync-works.html |title=How Rsync Works |publisher=Samba}}&lt;/ref&gt;, '''tar''', and dump are the foundation for most backup methods.  Remember, that until the backup data has been tested and shown to restore reliably, it does not count as a backup copy.  

==Backup with rsync==

'''rsync''' now defaults to using SSH.  But it still can be specified explicitly:

&lt;pre&gt;
$ rsync --exclude '*~' -avv \
        -e &quot;ssh&quot; \
        fred@server.example.org:./archive \
        /Users/fred/archive/.
&lt;/pre&gt;

For some types of data, transfer can be speeded up greatly by using '''rsync''' with compression, -z.

===Rsync with keys===

'''rsync''' can authenticate using SSH keys.  If the key is added to an agent, then the passphrase only needs to be entered once:

&lt;pre&gt;
$ rsync --exclude '*~' -avv \
        -e &quot;ssh -i ~/.ssh/key_rsa&quot; \
        fred@server.example.org:./archive \
        /Users/fred/archive/.
&lt;/pre&gt;

===Backup with rsync and sudo===
'''rsync''' is often used to back up locally or remotely.  '''rsync'''
is fast and flexible and copies incrementally so only the changes are transferred, thus avoiding wasting time re-copying what is already at the destination.  It does that through use of its now famous algorithm.  When working remotely, it needs a little help with the encryption and the usual practice is to tunnel it over SSH.  

Preparation: create an account to use for the backup, create a pair of keys to use only for backup, then make sure you can log in to that account with '''ssh''' with and without those keys.  

&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh -t -i ~/.ssh/mybkupkey bkupacct@www.example.org
&lt;/pre&gt;

Step 1: Configure '''sudoers''' and test '''rsync''' with '''sudo''' on the remote host.  In this case data is staying on the remote machine.  

Step 2: Test '''rsync''' with '''sudo''' over '''ssh'''. 
&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh -l bkupacct www.example.org sudo rsync -av:/var/www/ /tmp/
&lt;/pre&gt;
It will be necessary to tune '''/etc/sudoers''' a little at this stage.  More refinements may come later.  
Note that there is an '''rsync''' user and an '''ssh''' user.   The data in this case gets copied from the remote machine to the local '''/tmp'''.
&lt;pre&gt;
$ rsync -e &quot;ssh -t -l bkupacct&quot; --rsync-path='sudo rsync' \
-av bkupacct@www.example.org:/var/www/ /tmp/
&lt;/pre&gt;
Step 3: Use the key.
&lt;pre&gt;
$ rsync -e &quot;ssh -i ~/.ssh/key -t -l bkupacct&quot; --rsync-path='sudo rsync' \
-av bkupacct@www.example.org:/var/www/ /tmp/
&lt;/pre&gt;

Step 4: Adjust '''/etc/sudoers''' so that the backup account has enough access to run rsync but only in the directories it is supposed to run in and without free-rein on the system.  
Use the first debugging level to see the actual parameters getting passed to the remote host.  That provides the basis of what '''/etc/sudoers''' will need:
&lt;pre&gt;
$ rsync -e &quot;ssh -t -v&quot; --rsync-path='sudo rsync' \
-av bkupacct@www.example.org:/var/www/ /tmp/
...
debug1: Sending command: sudo rsync --server --sender -e.iLs . /var/www
...
&lt;/pre&gt;
Be sure that the backed up data is not accessible to others.  At this point you are done.  
However the process can be automated much further.  

Step 5: Test '''rsync''' with '''sudo over '''ssh'''.  
&lt;pre&gt;
$ rsync -e &quot;ssh -t&quot; --rsync-path='sudo rsync' \
-av bkupacct@www.example.org:/var/www/ /tmp/
&lt;/pre&gt;
Ok. The account on the server is named '''bkupacct''' and the private RSA key is '''~/.ssh/key_bkup_rsa''' on the client. On the server, the account bkupacct is a member of the group '''autobackup'''.

The public key, '''~/.ssh/key_bkup_rsa.pub''', has been copied to the account bkupacct on server and placed in '''~/.ssh/authorized_keys''' there. 

The following directories on server are owned by root and belong to the group bkupacct and not group readable, but not group writeable, and definitely not world readable: '''~''' and '''~/.ssh'''. Same for the file '''~/.ssh/authorized_keys''' there. (This assumes you are not also using ACLs)  This is one way of many to set permissions on the server:

&lt;pre&gt;
$ sudo chown root:bkupacct ~
$ sudo chown root:bkupacct ~/.ssh/
$ sudo chown root:bkupacct ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
$ sudo chmod u=rwx,g=rx,o= ~
$ sudo chmod u=rwx,g=rx,o= ~/.ssh/
$ sudo chmod u=rwx,g=r,o=  ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
&lt;/pre&gt;

Say you're backing up from server to client. '''rsync''' on the client uses '''ssh''' to make the connection to rsync on the server.  '''rsync''' is invoked from client like this to see exactly what parameters are being passed to the server:

&lt;pre&gt;
$ rsync \
  -e &quot;ssh \
          -i ~/.ssh/key_bkup_rsa  \
          -t             \
          -l bkupacct&quot;   \
  --rsync-path='sudo rsync' \ 
  --delete   \
  --archive  \
  --compress \
  --verbose  \
  bkupacct@server:/var/www \
  /media/backups/server/backup/
&lt;/pre&gt;
'''sudo''' will need to be configured on the server.  The argument '''--rsync-path''' tells the server what to run in place of '''rsync'''. In this case it runs '''sudo rsync'''.  The argument '''-e''' says which remote shell tool to use. In this case it is '''ssh'''.  For the SSH client being called by the '''rsync''' client, '''-i''' says which key, specifically, to use. That is independent of whether or not an authentication agent is used for ssh keys. Having more than one key is a possibility, since it is possible to have different keys for different tasks.  

Keep making adjustments to '''/etc/sudoers''' on the server until it works as it should.  You can find the exact settings(s) to use in '''/etc/sudoers''' by running the SSH in verbose mode ('''-v''') on the client.  Be careful when working with patterns not to match more that is safe.

&lt;pre&gt;
%autobackup ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/local/bin/rsync --server \
--sender -vlogDtpre.if . /var/www/
&lt;/pre&gt;

==Backup using tar==
The main choice for creating archives is [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=tar tar].  But since it copies whole files and directories, '''rsync''' is usually much more efficient for updates or incremental backups.  

The following will make a tarball of the directory '''/var/www''' and send it via stdout into sdtin via a pipe into '''ssh''' where, on the remote machine it is directed into the file called backup.tar.  Here '''tar''' runs on a local machine and stores the tarball remotely:

&lt;pre&gt;
$ tar cf - /var/www/ | ssh -l fred server.example.org &quot;cat &gt; backup.tar&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

There are really limitless options for that recipe:

&lt;pre&gt;
$ tar zcf - /var/www/ /home/*/www/ \
	|  ssh -l fred server.example.org &quot;cat &gt; $(date +&quot;%Y-%m-%d&quot;).tar.gz
&lt;/pre&gt;

That will do the same, but also get user www directories, compress the tarball using '''gzip''', and label the resulting file according to the current date.  

&lt;pre&gt;
$ tar zcf - /var/www/ /home/*/www/ \
	|  ssh -i key -l fred server.example.org &quot;cat &gt; $(date +&quot;%Y-%m-%d&quot;).tgz
&lt;/pre&gt;

It is just as easy to tar what is on a remote machine and store the tarball locally.  

&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh fred@server.example.org &quot;tar zcf - /var/www/&quot; &gt;  backup.tgz
&lt;/pre&gt;

Or a fancier example of running tar on the remote machine but storing the tarball locally.  
&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh -i key -l fred server.example.org &quot;tar jcf - /var/www/ /home/*/www/&quot; \
	&gt; $(date +&quot;%Y-%m-%d&quot;).tar.bz2
&lt;/pre&gt;

The secret to the backup is the use of '''stdout''' and '''stdin''' to effect the transfer through judicious use of pipes and redirects.

==Backup using dump==
Using [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=dump dump] remotely is like using '''tar'''.  One can copy from the remote server to the local server. 
&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh -t source.example.org 'sudo dump -0an -f - /var/www | gzip -c9' &gt; backup.dump.gz
&lt;/pre&gt;

Note that the password prompt for '''sudo''' might not be visible and it must be typed blindly. 

Or one can go the other direction, copying from the locate server to the remote:
&lt;pre&gt;
$ sudo dump -0an -f - /var/www | gzip -c9 | ssh target.example.org 'cat &gt; backup.dump.gz' 
&lt;/pre&gt;

Note that here the password prompt might get hidden in the initial output from '''dump'''.  It's still there.

== Preface ==
When preparing an undergraduate class on Software Engineering, I found that there are a lot of good articles in Wikipedia covering different aspects related to software engineering.  For a beginner, however, it is not so easy to find her or his way through that jungle of articles.  It is not evident what is important and what is less relevant, where to start and what to skip in a first reading.  Also, these articles contain too much information and too few examples.  Hence the idea for this book came about: to take the relevant articles from Wikipedia, combine them, edit them, fill in the missing pieces, put them in context and create a wikibook out of them. 

The hope is that this can be used as a textbook for an introductory software engineering class.  The advantage for the instructor is that she can just pick the pieces that fit into her course and create a [[Wikibooks:Collections|collection]].  The advantage for the student is that he can have a printed  or pdf version of the textbook at a reasonable price (free) and with reasonable licenses (creative commons).

As for the philosophy behind this book: brevity is preferred to completeness, and examples are preferred to theory. If this effort was successful, you be the judge of it, and if you have suggestions for improvement, just use the ’Edit’ button!

My special thanks go to [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] and [[User:Kayau|Kayau]] who did the tedious work of importing the original articles (with all their history) from Wikipedia to Wikibooks!

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{documentation subpage}}

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;

This is the {{tl|script doc auto}} template.

It is used in the [[MediaWiki:Clearyourcache]] system message that is shown on top of .css and .js pages. This template is only loaded when in &quot;User:&quot; space. It produces the small green doc box seen on top of user .css and .js pages.

When this template is called on top of [[User:Davidgothberg/monobook.js]] it produces this output:

{{script doc auto| page = User:Davidgothberg/monobook.js }}

When this template is called on top of [[User:Davidgothberg/clock.js]] it produces this output:

{{script doc auto| page = User:Davidgothberg/clock.js }}

The above boxes are not transparent, instead they use the same background color as the blue doc box.

When this template is called on a user skin file such as &quot;/monobook.css&quot; it gives a link to the accompanying &quot;/monobook.js&quot; file. It shows that link even if the accompanying skin file does not exist, but it then uses slightly different text.

For .css and .js pages in user space other than the skin files:

This template links to the documentation page for the script. It shows that link even if the documentation has not been created, but it then uses slightly different text. The doc pages of scripts are the page name but without the ending &quot;.css&quot; or &quot;.js&quot;. For instance [[User:Davidgothberg/clock.js]] has its documentation at [[User:Davidgothberg/clock]].

This template also detects if a .js page has an accompanying .css file and then links between them. It doesn't show that link if the other file does not exist.

For testing and demonstration purposes this template can take a parameter named '''page'''. Like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{script doc auto| page = User:Davidgothberg/clock.js }}
&lt;/pre&gt;

The '''page''' parameter makes this template behave exactly as if on that page.

=== Technical details ===

Internally this template uses the {{tl|str len}} template. Since {{tl|str len}} is heavy on the servers this template only calls it once, then it feeds the result to {{tl|script doc auto/core}} which contains most of the code for this template, that template then in turn calls {{tl|script doc auto/core2}} which renders the green doc box and the actual text messages.

'''Note to admins:''' MediaWiki does not parse and convert HTML wikimarkup in system messages the same way as it does for normal pages. This means for instance that &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;br&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is not automatically converted to &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;br /&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and missing &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;/td&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tags are not automatically added. Thus see to that any HTML code you use in this template is valid XHTML. That is, close all tags that you begin. However, regular wikimarkup works fine in most system messages.

      <text xml:space="preserve">__NOTOC__
== Introduction ==
This book is an introduction to the art of software engineering. It is intended as a textbook for an undergraduate level course.

Software engineering is about teams. The problems to solve are so complex or large, that a single developer cannot solve them anymore. Software engineering is also about communication. Teams do not consist only of developers, but also of testers, architects, system engineers, customer, project managers, etc. Software projects can be so large that we have to do careful planning. Implementation is no longer just writing code, but it is also following guidelines, writing documentation and also writing unit tests. But unit tests alone are not enough. The different pieces have to fit together. And we have to be able to spot problematic areas using metrics. They tell us if our code follows certain standards. Once we are finished coding, that does not mean that we are finished with the project: for large projects maintaining software can keep many people busy for a long time. Since there are so many factors influencing the success or failure of a project, we also need to learn a little about project management and its pitfalls, but especially what makes projects successful. And last but not least, a good software engineer, like any engineer, needs tools, and you need to know about them.
 
==== Developers Work in Teams ====
In your beginning semesters you were coding as individuals.  The problems you were solving were small enough so one person could master them.  In the real world this is different:- the problem sizes and time constraints are such that only teams can solve those problems.

For teams to work effectively they need a language to communicate (UML). Also teams do not consist only of developers, but also of testers, architects, system engineers and most importantly the customer.  So we need to learn about what makes good teams, how to communicate with the customer, and how to document not only the source code, but everything related to the software project.

==== New Language ==== 
In previous courses we learned languages, such as Java or C++, and how to turn ideas into code.  But these ideas are independent of the language.  With UML we will see a way to describe code independently of language, and more importantly, we learn to think in one higher level of abstraction.  UML can be an invaluable communication and documentation tool.

We will learn to see the big picture: patterns. This gives us yet one higher level of abstraction.  Again this increases our vocabulary to communicate more effectively with our peers.  Also, it is a fantastic way to learn from our seniors.  This is essential for designing large software systems.

==== Measurement ==== 
Also just being able to write software, doesn’t mean that the software is any good.  Hence, we will discover what makes good software, and how to measure software quality. On one hand we should be able to analyse existing source code through static analysis and measuring metrics, but also how do we guarantee that our code meets certain quality standards?  Testing is also important in this context, it guarantees high quality products.

==== New Tools ==== 
Up to now, you may have come to know about an IDE, a compiler and a debugger.  But there are many  more tools at the disposal of a software engineer.  There are tools that allow us to work in teams, to document our software, to assist and monitor the whole development effort.  There are tools for software architects, tools for testing and profiling, automation and re-engineering.

Is this the same thing as the Factory Method pattern? --[[User:Fishpi|Fishpi]] ([[User talk:Fishpi|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Fishpi|contribs]]) 20:57, 17 February 2011 (UTC)

I'm having severe doubts such a simple design guideline should be called an idiom at all. But let's assume it is. The implementation using static methods is &quot;sub-optimal&quot;, as it returns by value which will entail one unnecessary copy construction. The obvious implementation for this &quot;idiom&quot; is by using type tags:

class Game
{
  public:
struct SinglePlayerTag {};
struct MultiPlayerTag {};

    Game(SinglePlayerTag): Game(0) {} // named constructor
    Game(MultiPlayerTag ): Game(1) {} // named constructor
private:
    Game (int game_type);
};


An alternative is using Int2Type used on an enum specyfing single and multiplayer.</text>

      <comment>just because the page is for html4 doesn't mean you also need to ignore quotes in the &lt;source&gt; tags...</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Rails generates XHTML by default.  It can be made to generate HTML4.01 that can be validated with [http://validator.w3.org/ The W3C HTML validator].

== DOCTYPE ==

Layouts begin with the HTML4.01 Strict DOCTYPE:

&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN&quot; &quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd&quot;&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== ApplicationHelper ==

&lt;code&gt;application_helper.rb&lt;/code&gt; looks something like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;rails&quot;&gt;
module Html4ize

  # Supports making alternative versions of Rails helpers that output HTML
  # 4.01 markup as opposed to XHTML.  Example:
  #
  #   html4_version_of :submit_tag
  #
  # ..which creates a submit_tag_html4 helper that takes the same options as
  # submit_tag but which renders HTML 4.01.
  #
  def html4_version_of  helper_name
    define_method &quot;#{helper_name}_html4&quot; do |*args|
      html = send  helper_name, *args
      html.gsub! &quot; /&gt;&quot;, &quot;&gt;&quot;
      html
    end
  end

  def html4_versions_of *helper_names
    helper_names.each do |helper_name|
      html4_version_of  helper_name
    end
  end

  class &lt;&lt; self
    def included  receiver
      receiver.extend Html4ize
    end
  end

end


# Methods added to this helper will be available to all templates in the application.
module ApplicationHelper

  include Html4ize

  html4_versions_of :stylesheet_link_tag, :image_tag, :text_field, :submit_tag

  ...

end


# Extend FormBuilder with our own helper methods
class ActionView::Helpers::FormBuilder

  include Html4ize

  html4_versions_of :text_field, :check_box, :hidden_field, :submit

  ...

end
&lt;/source&gt;

== Views ==

Views can then refer to the newly-wrapped helpers:

&lt;source lang=&quot;rails&quot;&gt;

  ...

  &lt;%= image_tag_html4 &quot;logo.png&quot; %&gt;

  ...

  &lt;% form_for :person do |form| %&gt;

    &lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Name:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;%= form.text_field_html4 :name %&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    ...

    &lt;div class=&quot;submit&quot;&gt;&lt;%= form.submit_html4 &quot;Save&quot; %&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;% end %&gt;

&lt;/source&gt;

:I am new to this, but I was looking on how to do this, and found this [Wikibooks:Reading room/Assistance, http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Reading_room/Assistance], so I am trying to follow the advise you gave there, but I am also open for other suggestions. [[User:Rplano|Rplano]] ([[User talk:Rplano|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Rplano|contribs]]) 21:46, 17 February 2011 (UTC)

::Our [[Help:Contents|help pages]] will provide information on using the software in general, but if you've had experience at Wikipedia and already know how to edit, you'd probably be more interested in [[Using Wikibooks]], our guide to the interesting environment you'll find here. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|discuss]]&lt;/small&gt; 22:11, 17 February 2011 (UTC)

:::Thanks for the links, some I haven't seen before.  So should I issue a [[Wikibooks:Requests for import]] for the other pages (about 30 or so)?  And should I also say where they are supposed to go, or would you just import them to one place?  Thanks!  [[User:Rplano|Rplano]] ([[User talk:Rplano|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Rplano|contribs]]) 23:06, 17 February 2011 (UTC)

::::If you specify where they should go I can move them right then and there.  Otherwise they'll just be left in the Transwiki: [[WB:NS|namespace]] and you'll have to move them yourself (which you may not be able to, if your account isn't four days old yet). &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|discuss]]&lt;/small&gt; 01:56, 18 February 2011 (UTC)

== Labs ==

=== Lab 1a: StarUML (30 min) ===
We need to learn about a UML modelling tool.  StarUML&lt;ref&gt;http://staruml.sourceforge.net/en/ StarUML - The Open Source UML/MDA Platform&lt;/ref&gt; is a free UML modelling tool that is quite powerful, it allows for forward and reverse engineering.  It supports Java, C++ and C#.  A small disadvantage is that it is no longer supported, hence it is limited to Java 1.4 and C# 2.0, which is very unfortunate.

Start StarUML, and select ’Empty Project’ at the startup. Then in the Model Explorer add a new model by right-clicking on the ’untitled’ thing. After that you can create all kinds of UML diagrams by right-clicking on the model.

More details can be found at the following StarUML Tutorial. &lt;ref&gt;http://cnx.org/content/m15092/latest/ StarUML Tutorial&lt;/ref&gt;


=== Lab 1b: objectiF (30 min) ===
Another UML modelling tool, which is free for personal use is objectiF.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.microtool.de/objectif/en/index.asp objectiF - Tool for Model-Driven Software Development with UML&lt;/ref&gt;  To learn how to use objectiF, take a look at their tutorial.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.microtool.de/mT/pdf/objectiF/01/Tutorials/JavaTutorial.pdf Developing Java Applications with UML&lt;/ref&gt;


=== Lab 2: Restaurant Example (30 min) ===
Take the restaurant example from class and create all the different UML diagrams we created in class using StarUML or your favorite UML modelling tool. 

Once you are done with the class diagram, try out the 'Generate Code' feature.  In StarUML you right-click with your mouse in the class diagram, and select 'Generate Code'.  Look at the classes generated and compare them with your model.

Important Note: the restaurant example actually is not a very good example, because it may give you the impression that actors become objects.  They don't.  Actors never turn into objects, actors are always outside the system, hence the Tetris example below is much better.


=== Lab 3: Tetris (60 min) ===
Most of us know the game of Tetris.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris Tetris&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.percederberg.net/games/tetris/index.html Java Tetris&lt;/ref&gt; (However, I had students who did not know it, so in case you don't please learn about it and play it for a little before continuing with this lab).  If you recall from class, when inventing UML, the Three Amigos started with something that was called Object Oriented Analysis and Object Oriented Design.    So let's do it.

==== Object Oriented Analysis and Design ====
We want to program the game Tetris.  But before we can start we need to analyze the game.  We first need to identify 'objects' and second we must find out how they relate and talk to each other.  So for this lab do the following:
* build teams of 5 to 6 students per team
* looking at the game, try to identify objects, for instance the bricks that are dropping are objects
* have each student represent an object, e.g., a brick
* what properties does that student/brick have? (color,shape,...)
* how many bricks can there be, how do they interact?
* is the player who plays the game also an object or is she an actor?
* how does the player interact with the bricks?
* what restrictions exist on the movement of the bricks, how would you implement them?
* how would you calculate a score for the game?

==== Game Time ====
Once you have identified all the objects, start playing the real game.  For this one student is the 'actor', one student will write the minutes (protocol), and the other students will be objects (such as bricks).  Now start the game: the actor and the different objects interact by talking to each other.  The student who writes the minutes, will write down who said what to whom, i.e., everything that was said between the objects and the actor and the objects amongst themselves.  

Play the game for at least one or two turns.  Does your simulation work, did you forget something?  Maybe you need to add another object, like a timer.  

==== UML ====
We now need to make the connection between the play and UML.  
* Use Case diagram:  this is pretty straightforward, you identify the actor as the player, and write down all the use cases that the player can do.  One question you should check, if the timer is an actor.  The Use Case diagram tells you how your system interacts with its environment.  Draw the Use Case diagram for Tetris.
* Activity diagram:  from your game you find that there is some repetition, and some decisions have to be made at different stages in the game.  This can be nicely represented with an Activity diagram.  Draw a high level Activity diagram for the game.

Next we come to our minutes (protocol): this contains all the information we need to draw a Sequence diagram and finally arrive at the Collaboration diagram.
* Sequence diagram: take a look at your minutes (protocol).  First, identify the objects and put them horizontally.  Then go through your minutes line for line.  For every line in your minutes, draw the corresponding line in your Sequence diagram.  As you can see the Sequence diagram is in one-to-one correspondence with the minutes.
* Collaboration diagram: from the Sequence diagram it is easy to create the Collaboration diagram.  Just do it.
* Class diagram (Association): from the Collaboration diagram, you can infer the classes and the methods the classes need.  As for the attributes, some you have already identified (like the color and shape of the bricks), others you may have to think about for a little.  Draw the class diagram, and for every class try to guess what attributes are needed for the class to work properly.
* Class diagram (Inheritance): if you have some more experience with object-oriented languages, you may try to identify super classes, i.e., try to use inheritance to take into account common features of objects.

If you performed this lab properly, you will have learned a lot.  First, you have seen that through a simulation it is possible to identify objects, connections between the objects, hidden requirements and defects in you assumptions.  Second, using a carefully written protocol of your simulation is enough to create Sequence, Collaboration and Class diagrams.  So there is no magic in creating these diagrams, it is just playing a game.  Although you may think this is just a funny or silly game, my advice to you: play this game for every new project you start.

= Dutch Defence with 2.Bg5 =
=== 2. ... h6 ===
Black drives back the white bishop. White can now play either Bf4 or Bh4, the latter maintaining the pin on the pawn. Because 2. ... h6 weakens black's kingside squares, some players prefer to avoid it, although there is no obvious refutation for white.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==1st Order Differential Equations==
A 1st order differential equation has the form shown below
:&lt;math&gt;A \frac{d}{dx} f(x) + B = 0&lt;/math&gt;

It can be shown that roots o the differential equation above is
:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = Ae^(- \alpha x) &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\alpha = \frac{B}{A}&lt;/math&gt;

==Proof==
The above equation can be rewritten as
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d f(x)}{dx} + \frac{B}{A} f(x) = 0&lt;/math&gt;
Then
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d f(x)}{dx} = - \frac{B}{A} f(x) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\int \frac{d f(x)}{f(x)} = - \frac{B}{A} \int dx&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Ln f(x) = - \frac{B}{A} x + C&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = e^(- \frac{B}{A} x + C)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = Ae^(- \frac{B}{A} x) &lt;/math&gt;

==Summary==
First ordered differential equation of the form
:&lt;math&gt;A \frac{d}{dx} f(x) + B = 0&lt;/math&gt;

has a exponential root of the form
: &lt;math&gt;f(x) = e^(-\alpha x + c)&lt;/math&gt;
where
: &lt;math&gt;\alpha x = \frac{B}{A}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;A = e^c&lt;/math&gt;
or
: &lt;math&gt;f(x) = A e^(-\alpha x)&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==2nd Order Differential Equation==
2nd Order Differential Equation is an equation that has the general form
:&lt;math&gt;a \frac{d^2}{dx^2} f(x) + b \frac{d}{dx} f(x) + c = 0&lt;/math&gt;

==Characteristic Equation==
2nd Order Differential Equations above can be rewritten as shown
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2 }{dx^2} f(x) + \frac{b}{a} \frac{d }{dx} f(x) + \frac{c}{a} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

Let 
: &lt;math&gt;s = \frac{d}{dx}&lt;/math&gt;
Then
:&lt;math&gt;s^2 + \frac{b}{a} s + \frac{c}{a}= 0&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;s = (-\alpha \pm \sqrt{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt;) t
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha = \frac{b}{2a}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\beta = \frac{c}{a}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\lambda = \sqrt{\alpha^2 - \beta^2} &lt;/math&gt;

===Case 1===
When 
:&lt;math&gt;\lambda = 0&lt;/math&gt;
Then
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha^2 = \beta^2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;s = e^(-\alpha t)&lt;/math&gt;
Equation has ''one real'' roots

===Case 2===
When
:&lt;math&gt;\lambda &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;
Then
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha^2 &gt; \beta^2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;s = e^(-\alpha x) e ^ [\pm (\lambda x)]&lt;/math&gt;
Equation has ''two real'' roots

===Case 3===
When
:&lt;math&gt;\lambda &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt;
Then
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha^2 &lt; \beta^2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;s = e^(-\alpha t) [e^(\pm j\lambda t)]&lt;/math&gt;
Equation has ''two compex'' roots

==Special Case==
===Case 1===
Differential Equation of the form
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2 f(t)}{dt^2} + \lambda = 0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;s^2 = -\lambda &lt;/math&gt;

Roots of equation
:&lt;math&gt;s = \pm j\sqrt{\lambda} &lt;/math&gt;
===Case 2===
Differential Equation of the form
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2 f(t)}{dt^2} - \lambda = 0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;s^2 = \lambda &lt;/math&gt;

Roots of equation
:&lt;math&gt;s = \pm \sqrt{\lambda} &lt;/math&gt;

==Summary==
2nd Order Differential Equation
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2 }{dx^2} f(x) + \frac{b}{a} \frac{d }{dx} f(x) + \frac{c}{a} = 0&lt;/math&gt;
has roots depend on the value of &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\lambda = 0 . f(x) = e^(-\alpha x) &lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\lambda &gt; 0 . f(x) = e^(-\alpha x) e^(\pm \lambda x)&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\lambda &lt; 0 . f(x) = e^(-\alpha x) e^(\pm j\lambda x)&lt;/math&gt;
With
: &lt;math&gt;\alpha = \frac{b}{a}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\beta = \frac{c}{a}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\lambda = \sqrt{\alpha^2 - \beta^2}&lt;/math&gt;

I moved the page you created to the above location because you linked it from that book but I don't see what Egypt's constitution has to do with [[Canadian Constitutional Law]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">This place is only to collect ideas of what is still needed and should be added at some point in time:

Topics still to cover (look for relevant Wikipedia articles):
* Software licenses
* Mind mapping
* GUI testing / Mock objects
* Risk management

Examples:
* use GreenFoot, e.g. the GUI builder as an example for a level editor
* use GreenFoot ants example for design patterns application
* use PacMan or Breakout as another simple example in the exercises

In the following chapters add topic on
* Deployment: talk about installers
* Planning: MindMapping
* Testing: GUI testing, Mock objects

Other topics we may still want to cover are:
* Round-trip Engineering: [[Wikipedia:Round-trip_engineering]]
* Reengineering: [[Wikipedia:Reengineering_(software)]]
* Links to SE: [[Wikipedia:List_of_software_engineering_topics]]

==scanssh==
'''scanssh''' scans hosts and networks for running services.
ScanSSH - Scanning the Internet for SSH Servers
&lt;ref name=&quot;Provos_ScanSSH&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.citi.umich.edu/u/provos/papers/scanssh.pdf
 |title=ScanSSH - Scanning the Internet for SSH Servers|author=Niels Provos|author=Peter Honeyman |publisher=CITI|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It checks the version number of the server and displays the results in a list.  It detects ssh, sftp and several kinds of  SOCKS, HTTP, and telnet  proxies.  

Scan a small subnet for ssh servers:
&lt;pre&gt;
$ sudo scanssh -n 22 -s ssh 192.168.100.32/26
&lt;/pre&gt;

Scan the same small network for socks proxies:
&lt;pre&gt;
$ sudo scanssh -s socks5,socks4 192.168.100.32/26
&lt;/pre&gt;
Variable scanning speeds can be set as well as random sampling.  Open proxy detection scans to detect open proxies on common ports.

Scan 1000 hosts randomly selected from 172.16.1.1 through 172.31.254.254, at a rate of 200 per second :
&lt;pre&gt;
$ sudo scanssh -r 200 -p random(1000)/172.16.0.0/12
&lt;/pre&gt;

The hosts and networks to be scanned can be either specified as an IPv4 address or an CIDR like IP prefix with ip address and network mask.  Ports can be appended by adding a colon at the end of address specification.  The sequence of hosts scanned is random, but that can be modified by the following two parameters, random and split:

'''random(n[,seed])/''' selects a sample of n random addresses from the range specified as targets for scanning.  n is the number of address to randomly create in the given network and seed is an optional seed for the pseudo random number generator.
For example, it is possible to sample 10000 random hosts from the Internet by specifying 'random(10000)/0.0.0.0/0' as the address.

'''split(s,e)/'''	selects a specific segment of the address range for use.  e specifies the number of segments in parallel and s is the segment number used by this particular scan.  This can be used to scan from several hosts in parallel by scanning a different segment from each host. 

'''-n''' Specifies the port numbers to scan.  Ports are separated by commas.  Each specified scanner is run for each port in this list.  The default port is 22.

Scan for ssh servers on both port 22 and 2022:
&lt;pre&gt;
$ scanssh -s ssh -n 22,2022 192.168.0.0/24
&lt;/pre&gt;

==sshfs==

'''sshfs''' builds on Filesystem in Userspace (FUSE) to use allow non-privileged users to create a secure, reliable file system framework.  As the name implies, this is done in user space and not the kernel as is usually required for file systems.  FUSE has a stable API library and bindings to C, C++ and Java.  In this case it is specifically the SFTP client that is mounted as a file system.  

'''sshfs''' allows a remote file system to be mounted as a local folder taking advantage of the SFTP subsystem.   It uses SFTP to mount a directory from a remote server as a local directory. In that way, all use applications can interact with that directory and its contents as if it were local.   

See the Cookbook section on [[OpenSSH/Cookbook/SFTP|SFTP]]

==sshfp==

'''sshfp''' generates SSHFP NS records using the public keys stored in a '''known_hosts''' file or provided by '''ssh-keyscan''', as a means to use DNS to publish SSH key fingerprints.  That in turn allows DNSSEC lookups to verify SSH keys before use.  
SSHFP resource records in DNS are used to store fingerprint of SSH public host keys that are associated with host names.  A record itself consists of an algorithm number, fingerprint type and the fingerprint of the public host key.  
See RFC 4255 for details on SSHFP.

==keychain==

'''keychain''' is a manager for '''ssh-agent''' to allow multiple shells and processes, including cron jobs, to use the keys held by the agent.  It is often integrated into desktop-specific tools like Apple Keychain on OS X or kdewallet for KDE.  
http://www.funtoo.org/en/security/keychain/intro/

==rsync==

'''rsync''' is a file transfer utility to transfer files between computers very efficiently. It can run on top of SSH or use its own protocol.  SSH is the default.  http://rsync.samba.org/

==Gnome SSH Tunnel Manager (gstm)==
'''gstm''' is a graphical front-end for managing SSH connections and especially port forwarding.
http://sourceforge.net/projects/gstm/

==sslh==
'''sslh''' is a protocol demultiplexer.  It accepts connections on specified ports and forwards them based on the first packet sent by the client.  It can be used to share a single port between SSH, SSL, HTTP, OpenVPN, tinc and XMPP.
http://www.rutschle.net/tech/sslh.shtml

==sshguard==

'''sshguard''' is an intrusion prevention system.  It monitors logs to detect undesirable patterns of activities and triggers corresponding packet filter rules for increasing periods of time.  It can be used with a few other services besides SSH.  
http://www.sshguard.net/

==Additional Third Party Utilities==

The following are useful in working with OpenSSH, but outside the scope of this book to go into detail.  However, they are enough worth mentioning to warrant a list:

: '''netstat''' – Show network connections, routing tables, interface statistics, masquerade connections, and multicast memberships
: '''nc''' or '''netcat''' – Netcat, the TCP/IP swiss army knife.
: '''socat''' – SOcket CAT, a multipurpose relay similar to netcat.
: '''nmap''' – Network exploration tool and security scanner.
: '''tcpdump''' – Display network traffic realtime.
: '''telnet''' – Unencrypted interaction with another host.
: '''pagsh''' – Creates a new credential cache sandbox and process authentication group (PAG).  
: '''nohup''' – Invoke a process that ignores HANGUP signals
: '''sudo''' – Execute programs as another user
: '''lftp''' – A handy interactive multi-protocol file transfer text-based client supporting SFTP.
: '''curl''' – A multi-protocol file transfer text-based client supporting SCP and SFTP.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Multiplexing is the ability to send more than one signal over a single line or connection.  With multiplexing, OpenSSH can re-use an existing TCP connection for multiple concurrent SSH sessions rather than creating a new one each time.  

__TOC__

==Advantages of Multiplexing==

An advantage with SSH multiplexing is that the overhead of creating new TCP connections is eliminated.  The overall number of connections that a machine may accept is a finite resource and the limit is more noticeable on some machines than on others, and varies greatly depending on both load and usage.  There is also significant delay when opening a new connection.  Activities that repeatedly open new connections can be significantly sped up using multiplexing.

The difference multiplexing and standalone sessions can be seen by comparing the tables below.  We see in the table &quot;SSH Connections, Separate&quot; that without multiplexing each new login creates a new TCP connection, one per login session.  Following that we see in the other table, &quot;SSH Connections, Multiplexed&quot;, that when multiplexing is used, new logins are channeled over the already established TCP connection.    

&lt;pre&gt;
#              Local Address       Foreign Address         State

# one connection
tcp    0   0   192.168.x.y:45050   192.168.x.z:22       ESTABLISHED

# two separate connections
tcp    0   0   192.168.x.y:45050   192.168.x.z:22       ESTABLISHED
tcp    0   0   192.168.x.y:45051   192.168.x.z:22       ESTABLISHED

# three separate connections
tcp    0   0   192.168.x.y:45050   192.168.x.z:22       ESTABLISHED
tcp    0   0   192.168.x.y:45051   192.168.x.z:22       ESTABLISHED
tcp    0   0   192.168.x.y:45052   192.168.x.z:22       ESTABLISHED

Table 1: SSH Connections, Separate
&lt;/pre&gt;

Both tables show TCP/IP connections associated with SSH sessions.  The table above shows a new TCP/IP connection for each new SSH connection.  The table below shows a single TCP/IP connection despite multiple active SSH sessions.  

&lt;pre&gt;
#              Local Address       Foreign Address         State

# one connection
tcp    0   0   192.168.x.y:58913   192.168.x.z:22       ESTABLISHED

# two multiplexed connections
tcp    0   0   192.168.x.y:58913   192.168.x.z:22       ESTABLISHED

# three multiplexed connections
tcp    0   0   192.168.x.y:58913   192.168.x.z:22       ESTABLISHED

Table 2: SSH Connections, Multiplexed
&lt;/pre&gt;

As we can see, with multiplexing only a single TCP connection is set up and used regardless of whether or not there are multiple SSH sessions carried over it.

Or we can compare the time it takes to run [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ls ls(1)] on a slow remote server, using [http://linux.die.net/man/1/time  time(1)], first without multiplexing:

&lt;pre&gt;
real	0m0.658s
user	0m0.016s
sys	0m0.008s
&lt;/pre&gt;

Then we do the same, but use a multiplexed connection:

&lt;pre&gt;
real	0m0.029s
user	0m0.004s
sys	0m0.004s
&lt;/pre&gt;

The difference is quite large and will definitely add up for any activity where connections are made repeatedly.

==Setting Up Multiplexing==

OpenSSH does multiplexing using the '''ControlMaster''', '''ControlPath''' and '''ControlPersist''' configuration directives and get defined in [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh_config&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html ssh_config(5)] ('''~/.ssh/config''').  All three are described in the manual page for [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh_config&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html ssh_config(5)].   

'''ControlMaster''' determines whether [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh ssh(1)] will listen for control connections and what to do about them.  '''ControlPath''' is the location for the control socket used by the multiplexed sessions.  These can be set globally or locally in [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh_config&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html ssh_config(5)] or specified at run time.  Control sockets are removed automatically when the master connection is ended.  '''ControlPersist''' can be used in conjunction with '''ControlMaster'''.  If set to 'yes', it will leave the master connection open in the background  indefinitely to accept new connections until either killed explicitly or closed with '''-O'''.

&lt;pre&gt;
Host machine1
  HostName machine1.example.org
  ControlPath ~/.ssh/controlmasters/%r@%h:%p
  ControlMaster auto
  ControlPersist 10m
&lt;/pre&gt;

With that configuration, the first connection to ''machine1'' will create a control socket in the directory '''~/.ssh/controlmasters/'''  Then any subsequent connections, up to 10 by default as set by '''MaxSessions''', will re-use that control path automatically as multiplexed sessions.   Confirmation of each new connection can be required if '''ControlMaster''' set to 'autoask' instead of 'auto'.  

The option '''-O''' can be used to manage the connection using the same shortcut configuration.   

&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh -O check machine1
$ ssh -O stop machine1
&lt;/pre&gt;

First, the status of the connection is checked.  Then the master connection is told not to accept further multiplexing requests.  To cancel all existing connections, including the master connection, use 'exit' instead of 'stop'.

====Manually Establishing Multiplexed Connections====

Multiplexed sessions need a control master to connect to.  The run time parameters '''-M''' and '''-S''' also correspond to '''ControlMaster''' and '''ControlPath''', respectively.   So first an initial master connection is established using '''-M''' when accompanied by the path to the control socket using '''-S'''.

&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh -M -S /home/fred/.ssh/controlmasters/fred@server.example.org:22 server.example.org
&lt;/pre&gt;

Then subsequent multiplexed connections are made in other terminals.  They use '''ControlPath''' or '''-S''' to point to the control socket.  

&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh -S /home/fred/.ssh/controlmasters/fred@server.example.org:22 server.example.org
&lt;/pre&gt;

Note that the control socket is named &quot;fred@server.example.org:22&quot;, or ''%r@%h:%p'', to try to make the name unique.  The sockets should be given unique names.  The combination %r,  %h and %p stand for the remote user name, the remote host and the remote host's port.  

Multiple '''-M''' options place [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh ssh(1)] into '''master''' mode with confirmation required before slave connections are accepted.  This is the same as '''ControlMaster=ask'''.  Both require X to ask for the confirmation.  

Here is the master connection for the host ''server.example.org'' as set to ask for confirmation of new multiplexed sessions:

&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh -MM -S ~/.ssh/controlmasters/fred@server.example.org:22 server.example.org
&lt;/pre&gt;

And here is a subsequent multiplexed connection:

&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh -S ~/.ssh/controlmasters/fred@server.example.org:22  server.example.org
&lt;/pre&gt;

The status of the control master connection can be queried using '''-O check''', which will tell if the it is running or not.

&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh -O check -S ~/.ssh/controlmasters/fred@server.example.org:22  server.example.org
&lt;/pre&gt;

If the control session has been stopped, the query will return an error about &quot;No such file or directory&quot; even if there are still multiplexed sessions running because the socket is gone.  

Alternately, configuration options can be spelled out in full using '''-o'''.   The way below sets configuration options as run time parameters.  First, a control master is started.

&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh -o &quot;ControlMaster=yes&quot; -o &quot;ControlPath=/home/fred/.ssh/controlmasters/%r@%h:%p&quot; server.example.org
&lt;/pre&gt;

Then subsequent sessions are connected to the control master via socket at the end of the control path.

&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh -o &quot;ControlPath=/home/fred/.ssh/controlmasters/%r@%h:%p&quot;  server.example.org
&lt;/pre&gt;

And of course all that can be put into '''ssh_config'''.  Starting with 6.7, the combination of %r@%h:%p and variations on it can be replaced with %C which by itself generates a hash from the concatenation of %l%h%p%r.  The advantage there is that the hash can be shorter than its combined elements while still uniquely identifying the connection and it obfuscates the connection information which would have been otherwise displayed in the socket's name.

===Ending Multiplexed Connections===

One way to end multiplexed sessions is to exit all related '''ssh''' sessions, including the control master.  If the control master has been placed in the background using '''ControlPersist''', then it will be necessary to stop it with '''-O''' and either '''stop''' or '''exit'''.  That also requires knowing the full path and filename of the control socket, if it has not been defined in a short cut in '''ssh_config'''.

&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh -O stop server1
$ ssh -O stop -S ~/.ssh/controlmasters/fred@server1.example.org:22 server1.example.org
&lt;/pre&gt;

The multiplex command '''-O stop''' will gracefully shutdown multiplexing.  After issuing the command, the control socket is removed and no new multiplexed sessions are accepted for that master.  Existing connections are allowed to continue and the master connection will persist until the last multiplexed connection closes.  

The multiplex command '''-O exit''' removes the control socket and immediately terminates all existing connections.  

The directive '''ControlPersist''' can also be set to timeout after a set period of disuse.  The time interval there is written in a time in a format listed in [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd_config sshd_config(5)] or else defaults to seconds if no units are given.   It will cause the master connection to automatically close if it has no client connections for the specified time.  

&lt;pre&gt;
Host server1
  HostName server1.example.org
  ControlPath ~/.ssh/controlmasters/%r@%h:%p
  ControlMaster yes
  ControlPersist 2h
&lt;/pre&gt;

The above example lets the control master timeout after 2 hours of inactivity.  Care should be used.   A user that can read and write to a control socket can establish new connections without further authentication.  

===Multiplexing Options===

The values for configuring session multiplexing can be set either in the user-specific [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh_config&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html ssh_config(5)] or the global '''/etc/ssh/ssh_config''' or using parameters when running from the shell or a script.   '''ControlMaster''' can be overridden in the run time arguments to re-use an existing master when '''ControlMaster''' is set to 'yes', by setting it explicitly to 'no':

&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh -o &quot;ControlMaster=no&quot; server.example.org
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''ControlMaster''' accepts five different values: 'no', 'yes', 'ask', 'auto', and 'autoask'.   

* 'no' is the default.  New sessions will not try to connect to an established master session, but additional sessions can still multiplex by connecting explicitly to an existing socket.

* 'yes' creates a new master session each time, unless explicitly overridden.  The new master session will listen for connections.   

* 'ask'  creates a master each time, unless overridden, and listens for connections.  If overridden,  [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh-askpass&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html ssh-askpass(1)] will popup an message in X to ask the master session owner to approve or deny the request.  If the request is denied, then the session being created falls back to being a regular, standalone session.    

* 'auto' creates a master session automatically but if there is a master session already available, subsequent sessions are automatically multiplexed.

* 'autoask' automatically assumes that if a master session exists, that subsequent sessions should be multiplexed, but ask first before adding a session.   

Refused connections are logged to the master session.

&lt;pre&gt;
Host * 
  ControlMaster ask 
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''ControlPath'''  can be a fixed string or include any of serveral pre-defined variables.  '''%L''' is for the first component of the local host name and '''%l''' for the full local hos
t name.  '''%h''' is the target host name and '''%n''' is the original target host name and '''%p''' is for the destination port on the remote server.  '''%r''' is for the remote user name and '''%u''' for the user running [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html ssh(1)]

&lt;pre&gt;
Host * 
  ControlMaster ask 
  ControlPath ~/.ssh/controlmasters/%r@%h:%p
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''ControlPersist''' accepts 'yes', 'no' or a time interval.  If a time interval is given, the default is in seconds.  Units can extend the time to minutes, hours, days, weeks or  a combination.  If 'yes' the master connection stays in the background indefinitely. 

&lt;pre&gt;
Host * 
  ControlMaster ask 
  ControlPath ~/.ssh/controlmasters/%r@%h:%p
  ControlPersist 10m
&lt;/pre&gt;

====Port Forwarding After the Fact====

It is possible to request port forwarding without having to establish new connections.  Here we forward port 8080 on the local host to port 80 on the remote host using '''-L''':

&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh -O forward -L 8080:localhost:80 -S ~/.ssh/controlmasters/fred@server.example.org:22  server.example.org
&lt;/pre&gt;

The same can be done for remote forwarding, using '''-R'''.  The escape sequence '''~C''' is not available for multiplexed sessions, so '''-O forward''' is the only way to add port forwarding on the fly.  

Port forwarding can be canceled without having to close any sessions using '''-O cancel'''.  

&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh -O cancel -L 8080:localhost:80 -S ~/.ssh/controlmasters/fred@server.example.org:22  server.example.org
&lt;/pre&gt;

The exact same syntax used for forwarding is used for cancelling.  However, there is no way currently to look up which ports are being forwarded and how they are forwarded.  

==Additional Notes About Multiplexing==

Never use any publicly accessible directory for the control path sockets.  Place those sockets in a directory somewhere else, one to which only your account has access.  For example '''~/.ssh/socket/''' would be a much safer choice and '''/tmp/''' would be a bad choice. 

In cases where it is useful to have a standing connection, it is always possible to combine multiplexing with other options, such as '''-f''' or '''-N''' to have the control master drop to the background upon connection and not load a shell.  

In [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd_config sshd_config(5)], the directive '''MaxSessions''' specifies the maximum number of open sessions permitted per network connection.  This is used when multiplexing ssh sessions over a single TCP connection.  Setting '''MaxSessions''' to 1 disables multiplexing and setting it to 0 disables login/shell/subsystem sessions completely.  The default is 10.  The '''MaxSessions''' directive can also be set under a '''Match''' conditional block.

===Errors Preventing Multiplexing===

The directory used must be on a file system that allows the creation of sockets.   AFS is one example, as are some implementations of HFS+.  If an attempt is made at creating a socket on a file system that does not allow it, an error something like the following will occur:

&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh -M -S /home/fred/.ssh/mux 192.0.2.57
muxserver_listen: link mux listener /home/fred/.ssh/mux.vjfeIFFzHnhgHoOV =&gt; /home/fred/.ssh/mux: Operation not permitted
&lt;/pre&gt;

If the file system cannot be reconfigured to allow sockets, then the only other option is to place the control path socket somewhere else on a file system that does support creation of sockets.

==Multiplexing HTTPS and SSH Using sslh==

A different kind of multiplexing is when more than one protocol is carried over the same port.  [http://www.rutschle.net/tech/sslh.shtml sslh] does just that with SSL and SSH.  It figures out what kind of connection is coming in and forwards it to the appropriate service.  Thus it allows a server to receive both HTTPS and SSH over the same port.  Note that this does not actually hide SSH.  A scan for SSH on the listening port, say with [[OpenSSH/Third_Party_Utilities#scanssh|scanssh(1)]], will show that it is there.  What it does is make it possible to have one less port open in the firewall.  Here's how [http://linux.die.net/man/8/sslh sslh(8)] can be installed in four steps:

* First install your web server and configure it to accept HTTPS.  Be sure that it listens for HTTPS on the localhost only.  It can also help if it is on a non-standard port, say  2443, instead of 443.  

* Next, set your SSH server to accept connections on the localhost for port 22.  It really could be any port, but port 22 is the standard for SSH.

* Next, create an unprivileged user to run [http://linux.die.net/man/8/sslh sslh(8)].  The example below has the user ''sslh'' for the unprivileged account.  

* Lastly, install and launch [http://linux.die.net/man/8/sslh sslh(8)] so that it listens on port 443 and forwards HTTPS and SSH to the appropriate ports on the localhost.  Substitute the external IP number for your machine.  The actual name of the executable and path may vary from system to system:

&lt;pre&gt;
$ /usr/local/sbin/sslh-fork -u sslh -p xx.yy.zz.aa:443 --tls 127.0.0.1:2443 --ssh 127.0.0.1:22
&lt;/pre&gt;

Another option is to use a configuration file with [http://linux.die.net/man/8/sslh sslh(8)] and not pass any parameters at runtime.  There should be at least one sample configuration file, ''basic.cfg'' or ''example.cfg'', included in the package when it is installed.  The finished configuration file should look something like this:

If SSH is used in conjunction with TCP Wrappers, as described in [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=hosts_access&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=5 hosts_access(5)], then the option '''service:''' works to provide the name of the service that they need.    

&lt;pre&gt;
   { name: &quot;ssh&quot;; service: &quot;ssh&quot;; host: &quot;localhost&quot;; port: &quot;22&quot;; probe: &quot;builtin&quot;; },
&lt;/pre&gt;

If TCP Wrappers are not used, which is most likely the case, then '''service:''' is not needed.  

Runtime parameters override any configuration file settings that may be in place.  [http://linux.die.net/man/8/sslh sslh(8)] supports the protocols HTTP, SSL, SSH, OpenVPN, tinc, and XMPP out of the box.  But actually any protocol that can be identified by regular expression pattern matching can be used.  There are two variants of [http://www.rutschle.net/tech/sslh.shtml sslh], a forked version (sslh or sslh-fork) and a single-threaded version (sslh-select).

As we know Cell division is essential for an organism to grow, but, when a cell divides, it must replicate the DNA (DNA replication take place during S phase) in its genome so that the two daughter cells have the same genetic information as their parent. The double-stranded structure of DNA provides a simple mechanism for DNA replication. Here, the two strands are separated and then each strand's complementary DNA sequence is recreated by an enzyme called '''DNA polymerase'''. This enzyme makes the complementary strand by finding the correct base through complementary base pairing, and bonding it onto the original strand. As DNA polymerases can only extend a DNA strand in a 5′ to 3′ direction, different mechanisms are used to copy the antiparallel strands of the double helix. In this way, the base on the old strand dictates which base appears on the new strand, and the cell ends up with a perfect copy of its DNA.

==Replication==
[[Image:Replication fork.svg|right|350px|thumb|Schematic representation of the replication fork.&lt;br&gt;'''a:''' template, '''b:''' leading strand, '''c:''' lagging strand, '''d:''' replication fork, '''e:''' primer, '''f:''' Okazaki fragments]]
In a cell, DNA replication begins at specific locations in the genome, called '''&quot;origins&quot;'''. Unwinding of DNA at the origin, and synthesis of new strands, forms a '''replication fork'''. In addition to DNA polymerase, the enzyme that synthesizes the new DNA by adding nucleotides matched to the template strand, a number of other proteins are associated with the fork and assist in the initiation and continuation of DNA synthesis.
DNA replication can also be performed ''in vitro'' (outside a cell). DNA polymerases, isolated from cells, and artificial DNA primers are used to initiate DNA synthesis at known sequences in a template molecule. The polymerase chain reaction '''(PCR)''', a common laboratory technique, employs such artificial synthesis in a cyclic manner to amplify a specific target DNA fragment from a pool of DNA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_replication DNA replication]&lt;/ref&gt;


===Leading strand===
The leading strand template is the template strand of the DNA double helix that is oriented in a 3' to 5' manner. All DNA synthesis occurs 5'-3'. The original DNA strand must be read 3'-5' to produce a 5'-3' nascent strand.
The leading strand is formed along the leading strand template as a polymerase &quot;reads&quot; the template DNA and continuously adds nucleotides to the 3' end of the elongating strand. This polymerase is DNA polymerase III (DNA Pol III) in prokaryotes and presumably Pol ε in eukaryotes.

===Lagging strand===
[[Image:Dnareplication.png|thumb|250 px|Lagging strand during DNA replication]]
The lagging strand template is the coding strand of the DNA double helix that is oriented in a 5' to 3' manner. The newly made lagging strand still is synthesized 5'-3'. However, since the DNA is oriented in a manner that does not allow continual synthesis, only small sections can be read at a time. An RNA primer is placed on the DNA strand 3' to the origin of replication. Just as before, DNA Polymerase reads 3'-5' on the original DNA to produce a 5'-3' nascent strand. Polymerase reaches the origin of replication and stops replication until a new RNA primer is placed 3' to the last RNA primer. These fragments of DNA produced on the lagging strand are called Okazaki fragments. The orientation of the original DNA on the lagging strand prevents continual synthesis. As a result, replication of the lagging strand is more complicated than of the leading strand.
On the lagging strand template, primase &quot;reads&quot; the DNA and adds RNA to it in short, separated segments. In eukaryotes, primase is intrinsic to '''Pol α'''. '''DNA polymerase III''' or '''Pol δ''' lengthens the primed segments, forming '''Okazaki fragments'''. Primer removal in eukaryotes is also performed by Pol δ. In prokaryotes, DNA polymerase I &quot;reads&quot; the fragments, removes the RNA using its flap endonuclease domain, and replaces the RNA nucleotides with DNA nucleotides (this is necessary because RNA and DNA use slightly different kinds of nucleotides). DNA ligase joins the fragments together.

====Okazaki fragment====

An '''Okazaki fragment''' is a relatively short fragment of DNA (with no RNA primer at the 5' terminus) created on the lagging strand during DNA replication. The lengths of Okazaki fragments are between 1,000 to 2,000 nucleotides long in ''E. coli'' and are generally between 100 to 200 nucleotides long in eukaryotes.  It was originally discovered in 1968 by Reiji Okazaki, Tsuneko Okazaki, and their colleagues while studying replication of bacteriophage DNA in ''Escherichia coli''.&lt;ref&gt;Okazaki R, Okazaki T, Sakabe K, Sugimoto K.  Mechanism of DNA replication possible discontinuity of DNA chain growth. An American scientist, by the last name Shandel, discovered this mechanism prior to Okazaki, however he was never accredited with the discovery since the head of his research team decided the discovery was an erronus interpretation of test results.  Jpn J Med Sci Biol. 1967 Jun;20(3):255-60.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ogawa T, Okazaki T, Discontinuous DNA Replication. ''Annu. Rev. Biochem.'' 49:421-457, 1980&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:DNA_replication_editable.svg|thumb|550px|right|DNA replication. The double helix is unwound by a helicase and topoisomerase. Next, one DNA polymerase produces the leading strand copy. Another DNA polymerase binds to the lagging strand. This enzyme makes discontinuous segments (called Okazaki fragments) before DNA ligase joins them together.]]

===Classification of DNA polymerase===

Based on sequence homology, DNA polymerases are subdivided into seven different families:''' A, B, C, D, X, Y, and RT'''.

'''1.Family A'''
Polymerases contain both replicative and repair polymerases. Replicative members from this family include the extensively-studied T7 DNA polymerase, as well as the eukaryotic mitochondrial DNA Polymerase γ. Among the repair polymerases are Escherichia coli DNA pol I, Thermus aquaticus pol I, and Bacillus stearothermophilus pol I. These repair polymerases are involved in excision repair and processing of Okazaki fragments generated during lagging strand synthesis.

'''2.Family B'''
In XPV patients, alternative error-prone polymerases, e.g., Pol ζ (zeta) (polymerase ζ is a B Family polymerase a complex of the catalytic subunit REV3L with Rev7, which associates with Rev1), are thought to be involved in mistakes that result in the cancer predisposition of these patients. The DNA polymerase which belongs to B family contain DTDS motif. The  other members are Pol ε, Pol α, Pol δ.  

'''3.Family C'''
Polymerases are the primary bacterial chromosomal replicative enzymes. DNA Polymerase III alpha subunit from E. coli is the catalytic subunit  and possesses no known nuclease activity. A separate subunit, the epsilon subunit, possesses the 3'-5' exonuclease activity used for editing during chromosomal replication. Recent research has classified Family C polymerases as a subcategory of Family X.

'''4.Family D'''
Polymerases are still not very well characterized. All known examples are found in the Euryarchaeota subdomain of Archaea and are thought to be replicative polymerases.

'''5.Family X'''
Contains the well-known eukaryotic polymerase pol β, as well as other eukaryotic polymerases such as pol σ, pol λ, pol μ, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT). Pol β is required for short-patch base excision repair, a DNA repair pathway that is essential for repairing abasic sites. Pol λ and Pol μ are involved in non-homologous end-joining, a mechanism for rejoining DNA double-strand breaks. TdT is expressed only in lymphoid tissue, and adds &quot;n nucleotides&quot; to double-strand breaks formed during V(D)J recombination to promote immunological diversity. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has only one Pol X polymerase, Pol IV, which is involved in non-homologous end-joining.

'''6.Family Y'''
''Y Polymerases differ from others in having a low fidelity'' on undamaged templates and in their ability to replicate through damaged DNA. Members of this family are hence called translesion synthesis (TLS) polymerases. Depending on the lesion, TLS polymerases can bypass the damage in an error-free or error-prone fashion, the latter resulting in elevated mutagenesis. Xeroderma pigmentosum variant (XPV) patients for instance have mutations in the gene encoding Pol η (eta), which is error-free for UV-lesions. Other members in humans are Pol ι (iota), Pol κ (kappa), and Rev1 (terminal deoxycytidyl transferase). In E. coli, two TLS polymerases, ''Pol IV'' (DINB) and ''Pol V'' (UmuD'2C), are known.

'''7.Family RT (reverse transcriptase)'''
The reverse transcriptase family contains examples from both retroviruses and eukaryotic polymerases. The eukaryotic polymerases are usually restricted to telomerases. These polymerases use an RNA template to synthesize the DNA strand.

==Replication is semiconservative==
[[Image:DNAreplicationModes.png|thumb|400px|right|A summary of the three postulated methods of DNA synthesis]]
The '''Meselson and Stahl experiment''' was an experiment by [[Matthew Meselson]] and [[Franklin Stahl]] in 1958 which supported the hypothesis that ''DNA replication'' was semiconservative. Semiconservative replication means that when the double stranded DNA helix was replicated, each of the two double stranded [[DNA]] helices consisted of one strand coming from the original helix and one newly synthesized. It has been called &quot;the most beautiful experiment in biology.&lt;ref&gt;John Cairns to Horace F Judson, in The Eighth Day of Creation: Makers of the Revolution in Biology (1979). Touchstone Books, ISBN 0-671-22540-5. 2nd edition: Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1996 paperback: ISBN 0-87969-478-5.&lt;/ref&gt;&quot;


'''Three hypotheses had been previously proposed for the method of replication of DNA.'''  

In the ''semiconservative'' hypothesis, proposed by [[James D. Watson|Watson]] and [[Francis Crick|Crick]], the two strands of a DNA molecule separate during replication.  Each strand then acts as a template for synthesis of a new strand &lt;ref name=&quot;Watson&amp;Crick&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=WATSON JD, CRICK FH |title=The structure of DNA |journal=Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory|Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. |volume=18 |issue= |pages=123–31 |year=1953 |pmid=13168976 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The ''conservative'' hypothesis proposed that the entire DNA molecule acted as a template for synthesis of an entirely new one.  According to this model, [[histone]] proteins bound to the DNA, distorting it in such a way as to expose both strands' bases for hydrogen bonding &lt;ref name=&quot;Bloch&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bloch DP |title=A POSSIBLE MECHANISM FOR THE REPLICATION OF THE HELICAL STRUCTURE OF DESOXYRIBONUCLEIC ACID |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |volume=41 |issue=12 |pages=1058–64 |year=1955 |month=December |pmid=16589796 |pmc=528197 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

The ''dispersive'' hypothesis is exemplified by a model proposed by [[Max Delbrück]], which attempts to solve the problem of unwinding the two strands of the double helix by a mechanism that breaks the DNA backbone every 10 nucleotides or so, untwists the molecule, and attaches the old strand to the end of the newly synthesized one.  This would synthesize the DNA in short pieces alternating from one strand to the other &lt;ref name=&quot;Delbruck&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Delbrück M |title=ON THE REPLICATION OF DESOXYRIBONUCLEIC ACID (DNA) |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |volume=40 |issue=9 |pages=783–8 |year=1954 |month=September |pmid=16589559 |pmc=534166 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Each of these three models makes a different prediction about the distribution of the &quot;old&quot; DNA in molecules formed after replication.  In the conservative hypothesis, after replication, one molecule is the entirely conserved &quot;old&quot; molecule, and the other is all newly synthesized DNA.  The semiconservative hypothesis predicts that each molecule after replication will contain one old and one new strand.  The dispersive model predicts that each strand of each new molecule will contain a mixture of old and new DNA &lt;ref name=”Delbruck&amp;Stent”&gt;{{cite book |last1=Delbrück | first1=Max |last2=Stent |first2=Gunther S. |editor1-first=William D.| editor1-last=McElroy |editor2-first=Bentley |editor2-last=Glass |title=A Symposium on the Chemical Basis of Heredity|publisher=Johns Hopkins Pr. |date=1957 |pages=699–736 |chapter=On the mechanism of DNA replication}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The semi-conservative theory can be confirmed by making use of the fact that DNA is made up of nitrogen bases. Nitrogen has an isotope N15 (N14 is the most common isotope) called heavy nitrogen. The experiment that confirms the predictions of the semi-conservative theory&lt;ref name=&quot;Meselson&amp;Stahl&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author=Meselson, M. and Stahl, F.W. | title=The Replication of DNA in Escherichia coli | year=1958 | journal=PNAS | volume=44 | pages=671–82 |pmid=16590258 | url = http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&amp;pubmedid=16590258 | doi=10.1073/pnas.44.7.671}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meselson M, Stahl FW. Demonstration of the semiconservative mode of DNA duplication.  In “Phage and the Origins of Molecular Biology” (editors Cairns J, Stent GS, Watson JD) pages 246-251 of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory of Quantitative Biology, First edition (1966). ASIN: B00C2G89LM&lt;/ref&gt; makes use of this isotope and runs as follows:
Bacterial (E coli) DNA is placed in a media containing heavy nitrogen(N15), which binds to the DNA, making it identifiable.
Bacteria containing this DNA are then placed in a media with the presence of N14 and left to replicate only once. The new bases will contain nitrogen 14 while the originals will contain N15
The DNA is placed in test tubes containing caesium chloride (heavy compound) and centrifuged at 40,000 revolutions per minute.
The caesium chloride molecules sink to the bottom of the test tubes creating a density gradient. The DNA molecules will position at their corresponding level of density (taking into account that N15 is more dense than N14)
These test tubes are observed under ultraviolet rays. DNA appears as a fine layer in the test tubes at different heights according to their density.
According to the semi-conservative theory, after one replication of DNA, we should obtain 2 hybrid (part N14 part N15) molecules from each original strand of DNA. This would appear as a single line in the test tube. This result would be the same for the dispersive theory. On the other hand, according to the conservative theory, we should obtain one original DNA duplex and a completely new one i.e. two fine lines in the test tube placed separately one from the other. Up to this point, either the semi-conservative or the dispersive theories could be truthful, as experimental evidence confirmed that only one line appeared after one replication. In order to conclude between those two, DNA had to be left to replicate again, still in a media containing N14.
In the dispersive theory, after 2 divisions we should obtain a single line, but further up in the test tube, as the DNA molecules become less dense as N14 becomes more abundant in the molecule According to the semi-conservative theory, 2 hybrid molecules and 2 fully N14 molecules should be produced, so two fine lines at different heights in the test tubes should be observed. Experimental evidence confirmed that two lines were observed therefore offering compelling evidence for the semi-conservative theory.

''Genetic evidence''

An independent 'genetic' evidence for the semi-conservative theory was provided more recently by high throughput genomic sequencing of individual mutagenized bacteria. '' E. coli'' were treated with Ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS), known to induce G:C → A:T transitions due to generation of abnormal base O-6-ethylguanine, which is further misrecognized during DNA replication and paired with T instead of C. The sequenced DNA from individual colonies of EMS-mutagenized bacteria exhibited long stretches of solely G → A or C → T transitions, which in some cases were spanning entire bacterial genome. The elementary explanation of this observation is based on semi-conservative mechanism: one should expect the segregation between daughter strands into different cells after replication, which leads to each descendant cell having exclusively G → A or C → T conversions.

'''Nitrogen''' is a major constituent of DNA. [[Nitrogen-14|&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;N]] is by far the most abundant isotope of nitrogen, but DNA with the heavier (but non-radioactive) [[Nitrogen-15|&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N]] isotope is also functional. 

''[[E. coli]]'' were grown for several generations in a medium with &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N.  When DNA is extracted from these cells and centrifuged on a salt density gradient, the DNA separates out at the point at which its density equals that of the salt solution. The DNA of the cells grown in &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N medium had a higher density than cells grown in normal &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;N medium. After that, ''E. coli'' cells with only &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N in their DNA were transferred to a &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;N medium and were allowed to divide; the progress of cell division was monitored by measuring the optical density of the cell suspension. 

DNA was extracted periodically and was compared to pure &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;N DNA and &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N DNA. After one replication, the DNA was found to have close to the intermediate density. Since conservative replication would result in equal amounts of DNA of the higher and lower densities (but no DNA of an intermediate density), conservative replication was excluded.  However, this result was consistent with both semiconservative and dispersive replication. Semiconservative replication would result in double-stranded DNA with one strand of &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N DNA, and one of &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;N DNA, while dispersive replication would result in double-stranded DNA with both strands having mixtures of &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N and &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;N DNA, either of which would have appeared as DNA of an intermediate density.

The authors continued to sample cells as replication continued.  DNA from cells after two replications had been completed was found to consist of equal amounts of DNA with two different densities, one corresponding to the intermediate density of DNA of cells grown for only one division in &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;N medium, the other corresponding to DNA from cells grown exclusively in &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;N medium.  This was inconsistent with dispersive replication, which would have resulted in a single density, lower than the intermediate density of the one-generation cells, but still higher than cells grown only in &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;N DNA medium, as the original &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N DNA would have been split evenly among all DNA strands.  The result was consistent with the semiconservative replication hypothesis &lt;ref name=&quot;Meselson&amp;Stahl&quot; /&gt;

==Replication in prokaryote==
DNA replication in prokaryotes is extensively studied in E. coli. It is bi-directional and originates at a single origin of replication 
'''(OriC)'''.

===Primase===
In bacteria, primase binds to the DNA helicase forming a complex called the primosome. Primase is activated by DNA helicase where it then synthesizes a short RNA primer approximately 11 ±1 nucleotides long, to which new nucleotides can be added by DNA polymerase.

===Primosome===
A primosome is a protein complex responsible for creating RNA primers on single stranded DNA during DNA replication.Primosomes are nucleoproteins assemblies that activate DNA replication forks. Their primary role is to recruit the replicative helicase onto single-stranded DNA. The &quot;replication restart&quot; primosome, defined in Escherichia coli, is involved in the reactivation of arrested replication forks. 

Assembly of the Escherichia coli primosome requires six proteins, PriA, PriB, PriC, DnaB, DnaC, and DnaT, acting at a primosome assembly site (pas) on an SSBcoated single-stranded (8s) DNA. Assembly is initiated by interactions of PriA and PriB with ssDNA and the pas. PriC, DnaB, DnaC, and DnaT then act on the PriAPriB- DNA complex to yield the primosome.

The primosome consists of '''seven proteins''': '''DnaG''' primase, '''DnaB''' helicase, '''DnaC''' helicase assistant, '''DnaT, PriA, Pri B,''' and '''PriC'''. The primosome is utilized once on the leading strand of DNA and repeatedly, initiating each Okazaki fragment, on the lagging DNA strand. Initially the complex formed by '''PriA, PriB, and PriC''' binds to DNA. Then the DnaB-DnaC helicase complex attaches along with '''DnaT'''. This structure is referred to as the '''pre-primosome'''. Finally, '''DnaG''' will bind to the pre-primosome forming a complete primosome. The primosome attaches 1-10 RNA nucleotides to the single stranded DNA creating a DNA-RNA hybrid. This sequence of RNA is used as a primer to initiate DNA polymerase III. The RNA bases are ultimately replaced with DNA bases by RNase H nuclease (eukaryotes) or DNA polymerase I nuclease (prokaryotes). DNA Ligase then acts to join the two ends together.
===Elongation of DNA strand===
Once priming is complete, ''DNA polymerase III holoenzyme'' is loaded into the DNA and replication starts. The catalytic mechanism of DNA polymerase III involves the use of two metal ions in the active site, and a region in the active site that can discriminate between deoxyribonucleotides and ribonucleotides. The metal ions are general divalent cations that help the 3' OH initiate a nucleophilic attack onto the alpha phosphate of the deoxyribonucleotide and orient and stabilize the negatively charged triphosphate on the deoxyribonucleotide. Nucleophilic attack by the 3' OH on the alpha phosphate releases pyrophosphate, which is then subsequently hydrolyzed (by inorganic phosphatase) into two phosphates. This hydrolysis drives DNA synthesis to completion.

Furthermore, DNA polymerase III must be able to distinguish between correctly paired bases and incorrectly paired bases. This is accomplished by distinguishing Watson-Crick base pairs through the use of an active site pocket that is complementary in shape to the structure of correctly paired nucleotides. This pocket has a tyrosine residue that is able to form van der Waals interactions with the correctly paired nucleotide. In addition, dsDNA (double stranded DNA) in the active site has a wider and shallower minor groove that permits the formation of hydrogen bonds with the third nitrogen of purine bases and the second oxygen of pyrimidine bases. Finally, the active site makes extensive hydrogen bonds with the DNA backbone. These interactions result in the DNA polymerase III closing around a correctly paired base. If a base is inserted and incorrectly paired, these interactions could not occur due to disruptions in hydrogen bonding and van der Waals interactions.

DNA is read in the 3' → 5' direction, therefore, nucleotides are synthesized (or attached to the template strand) in the 5' → 3' direction. However, one of the parent strands of DNA is 3' → 5' while the other is 5' → 3'. To solve this, replication occurs in opposite directions. Heading towards the replication fork, the '''leading strand is synthesized in a continuous fashion''', only requiring one primer. On the other hand, the '''lagging strand''', heading away from the replication fork, is synthesized in a series of '''short fragments known as Okazaki fragments''', consequently requiring many primers. The RNA primers of Okazaki fragments are subsequently degraded by RNAse H and DNA Polymerase I (exonuclease), and the gap (or nicks) are filled with deoxyribonucleotides and sealed by the enzyme ligase.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prokaryotic_DNA_replication Prokaryotic DNA replication]&lt;/ref&gt;

The rate of semiconservative DNA replication in a living cell was first measured as the rate of phage T4 DNA strand elongation in phage-infected E. coli.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = McCarthy | first1 = D. | last2 = Minner | first2 = C. | last3 = Bernstein | first3 = H. | last4 = Bernstein | first4 = C. | title = DNA elongation rates and growing point distributions of wild-type phage T4 and a DNA-delay amber mutant. | journal = J Mol Biol | volume = 106 | issue = 4 | pages = 963-81 | month = Oct | year = 1976 | doi =  | PMID = 789903 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the period of exponential DNA increase at 37°C, the rate of strand elongation was 749 nucleotides per second.  The mutation rate per base pair per round of replication during phage T4 DNA synthesis is 2.4 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Drake | first1 = JW. | last2 = Charlesworth | first2 = B. | last3 = Charlesworth | first3 = D. | last4 = Crow | first4 = JF. | title = Rates of spontaneous mutation. | journal = Genetics | volume = 148 | issue = 4 | pages = 1667-86 | month = Apr | year = 1998 | doi =  | PMID = 9560386}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Thus semiconservative DNA replication is both rapid and accurate.

===Termination===
Termination of DNA replication in ''E. coli'' is completed through the use of termination sequences and the '''Tus''' protein.
Tus is a sequence-specific DNA binding protein that promotes termination in prokaryotic DNA replication. In ''E. Coli'', Tus binds to ten closely related 23 basepair binding sites encoded in the bacterial chromosome. These sites, called '''Ter sites''', are designated '''TerA, TerB, ..., TerJ'''. The binding sites are asymmetric, such that when a Tus-Ter complex (Tus protein bound to a Ter site) is encountered by a replication fork from one direction, the complex is dissociated and replication continues (permissive). When encountered from the other direction, however, the Tus-Ter complex provides a much larger kinetic barrier and halts replication (non-permissive). The multiple Ter sites in the chromosome are oriented such that the two oppositely moving replication forks are both stalled in the desired termination region.

==DNA polymerase in prokaryote==
[[Image:PolymeraseDomains.jpg|right|thumb|300px|&lt;center&gt;Functional domains in the Klenow Fragment (left) and DNA Polymerase I (right).&lt;/center&gt;]]
In Prokaryotic there are 5 kind of DNA polymerases:

'''Pol I:''' implicated in DNA repair; has 5'-&gt;3' polymerase activity, and both 3'-&gt;5' exonuclease activity (proofreading) and 5'-&gt;3' exonuclease activity (RNA primer removal).

'''Pol II:''' involved in repairing damaged DNA; has 3'-&gt;5' exonuclease activity.The enzyme is 90 kDa in size and is coded by the polB gene. DNA Pol II can synthesize DNA new base pairs at an average rate of between 40 and 50 nucleotides/second.

'''Pol III:''' the main polymerase in bacteria (responsible for elongation); has 3'-&gt;5' exonuclease activity (proofreading).The replisome is composed of the following:
2 DNA Pol III enzymes, made up of α, ε and θ subunits.
the α subunit synthesizes the RNA/DNA primer.
the ε subunit synthesizes the leading strand.
the θ subunit stimulates the ε subunit's proofreading.
2 β units which act as sliding DNA clamps, they keep the polymerase bound to the DNA.
2 τ units which acts to dimerize two of the core enzymes (α, ε, and θ subunits).
1 γ unit which acts as a clamp loader for the lagging strand Okazaki fragments, helping the two β subunits to form a unit and bind to DNA. The γ unit is made up of 5 γ subunits which include 3 γ subunits, 1 δ subunit, and 1 δ' subunit. The δ is involved in copying of the lagging strand

'''Pol IV:''' a Y-family DNA polymerase.

'''Pol V:''' a Y-family DNA polymerase; participates in bypassing DNA damage.
===DNA Polymerase I or Pol I===

DNA Polymerase I (or Pol I) is an enzyme that participates in the process of DNA replication in prokaryotes. It contains 928 amino acids, and is an example of a processive enzyme - it can sequentially catalyze multiple polymerisations. It was Discovered by '''Arthur Kornberg in 1956''', it was the first known DNA polymerase (and, indeed, the first known of any kind of polymerase). It was initially characterized in E. coli, although it is ubiquitous in prokaryotes. In E. coli and many other bacteria, the gene which encodes '''Pol I is known as polA'''.
Pol I possesses three enzymatic activities: (1) a 5' -&gt; 3' (forward) DNA polymerase activity, requiring a 3' primer site and a template strand; (2) a 3' -&gt; 5' (reverse) exonuclease activity that mediates proofreading; and (3) a 5' -&gt; 3' (forward) exonuclease activity mediating nick translation during DNA repair.

==== Klenow fragment====
The 5' → 3' exonuclease activity of DNA polymerase I from E. coli makes it unsuitable for many applications, the Klenow fragment, which lacks this activity, can be very useful in research. The Klenow fragment is extremely useful for research-based tasks such as: (1) Synthesis of double-stranded DNA from single-stranded templates; (2) Filling in (meaning removal of overhangs to create blunt ends) recessed 3' ends of DNA fragments; (3) Digesting away protruding 3' overhangs; (4) Preparation of radioactive DNA probes.
The Klenow fragment was also the original enzyme used for greatly amplifying segments of DNA in the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) process, before being replaced by thermostable enzymes such as Taq polymerase.

==Helicases and Topoisomerase==

Many cellular processes (DNA replication, transcription, translation, recombination, DNA repair, ribosome biogenesis) involve the separation of nucleic acid strands. Helicases are often utilized to separate strands of a DNA double helix or a self-annealed RNA molecule using the energy from ATP hydrolysis, a process characterized by the breaking of hydrogen bonds between annealed nucleotide bases. They move incrementally along one nucleic acid strand of the duplex with a directionality and processivity specific to each particular enzyme. There are many helicases '''(14 confirmed in E. coli, 24 in human cells)''' resulting from the great variety of processes in which strand separation must be catalyzed.

Helicases adopt different structures and oligomerization states. Whereas DnaB-like helicases unwind DNA as donut-shaped hexamers, other enzymes have been shown to be active as monomers or dimers. Studies have shown that helicases may act passively, waiting for uncatalyzed unwinding to take place and then translocating between displaced strands,[1] or can play an active role in catalyzing strand separation using the energy generated in ATP hydrolysis. In the latter case, the helicase acts comparably to an active motor, unwinding and translocating along its substrate as a direct result of its ATPase activity. Helicases may process much faster in vivo than in vitro due to the presence of accessory proteins that aid in the destabilization of the fork junction.
Defects in the gene that codes helicase cause Werner syndrome, a disorder characterized by the appearance of premature aging.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicase Helicase]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Superfamilies'''

Helicases have been classified in 5 superfamilies (SF1-SF5). All of the proteins bind ATP, and, as a consequence, all of them carry the classical Walker A (phosphate-binding loop or P-loop) and Walker B (Mg2+-binding aspartic acid) motifs.

Superfamily I: UvrD (E. coli, DNA repair), Rep (E. coli, DNA replication), PcrA (Staphylococcus aureus, recombination), Dda (bacteriophage T4, replication initiation), RecD (E. coli, recombinational repair), TraI (F-plasmid, conjugative DNA transfer). This family includes RNA helicases thought to be involved in duplex unwinding during viral RNA replication. Members of this family are found in positive-strand single-stranded RNA viruses from superfamily 1. This helicase has multiple roles at different stages of viral RNA replication, as dissected by mutational analysis.

Superfamily II: RecQ (E. coli, DNA repair), eIF4A (Baker's Yeast, RNA translation), WRN (human, DNA repair), NS3[5] (Hepatitis C virus, replication). TRCF (Mfd) (E.coli, transcription-repair coupling).

Superfamily III: LTag (Simian Virus 40, replication), E1 (human papillomavirus, replication), Rep (Adeno-Associated Virus, replication, viral integration, virion packaging). 
Superfamily 3 consists of helicases encoded mainly by small DNA viruses and some large nucleocytoplasmic DNA viruses.[6][7] Small viruses are very dependent on the host-cell machinery to replicate. SF3 helicase in small viruses is associated with an origin-binding domain. By pairing a domain that recognises the ori with a helicase, the virus can bypass the host-cell-based regulation pathway and initiate its own replication. The protein binds to the viral ori leading to origin unwinding. Cellular replication proteins are then recruited to the ori, and the viral DNA is replicated.

DnaB-like family: dnaB (E. coli, replication), gp41 (bacteriophage T4, DNA replication), T7gp4 (bacteriophage T7, DNA replication).

Rho-like family: Rho (E. coli, transcription termination).
Note that these superfamilies do not subsume all possible helicases. For example, XPB and ERCC2 are helicases not included in any of the above families.

'''RNA Helicases'''
RNA Helicases and DNA Helicases can be found together in all the Helicase Super Families except for SF6.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;RNA Helicases&quot; Edited by Eckhard Jankowsky, RSC Publishing 2010&lt;/ref&gt; However, not all RNA Helicases exhibit helicase activity as defined by enzymatic function, i.e., proteins of the Swi/Snf family. Although these proteins carry the typical helicase motifs, hydrolize ATP in a nucleic acid-dependent manner, and are built around a helicase core, in general, no unwinding activity is observed.&lt;ref&gt;Trends Biochem Sci. 2010 Aug 31.  [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20813532 RNA helicases at work: binding and rearranging]. Jankowsky E.  Center for RNA Molecular Biology &amp; Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, 10900 Euclid Ave., Cleveland, OH 44106, USA&lt;/ref&gt;

RNA Helicases that do exhibit unwinding activity have been characterized by at least two different mechanisms: canonical duplex unwinding and local strand separation. Canonical duplex unwinding is the stepwise directional separation of a duplex strand, as described above, for DNA unwinding. However, local strand separation occurs by a process wherein the helicase enzyme is loaded at any place along the duplex. This is usually aided by a single-stranded region of the RNA, and the loading of the enzyme is accompanied with ATP binding.&lt;ref&gt;Yang et al., DEAD-box proteins unwind duplexes by local strand separation, Mol. Cell 28 (2007), pp. 253–263&lt;/ref&gt; Once the helicase and ATP are bound, local strand separation occurs, which requires binding of ATP but not the actual process of ATP hydrolysis.&lt;ref&gt;. Liu et al., ATP hydrolysis is required for DEAD-box protein recycling but not for duplex unwinding, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 105 (2008), pp. 20209–20214&lt;/ref&gt; Presented with fewer base pairs the duplex then dissociates without further assistance from the enzyme. This mode of unwinding is used by DEAD-box helicases.&lt;ref&gt;Jarmoskaite, I. and Russell, R., (2010) DEAD-box proteins as RNA helicases and chaperones. WIREs: RNA, in press.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Topoisomerase'''

Topoisomerases are enzymes that unwind and wind DNA, in order for DNA to control the synthesis of proteins, and to facilitate DNA replication. 
The double-helical configuration that DNA strands naturally reside in makes them difficult to separate, and yet they must be separated by helicase proteins if other enzymes are to transcribe the sequences that encode proteins, or if chromosomes are to be replicated. In so-called circular DNA, in which double helical DNA is bent around and joined in a circle, the two strands are topologically linked, or knotted. Otherwise, identical loops of DNA having different numbers of twists are topoisomers, and cannot be interconverted by any process that does not involve the breaking of DNA strands. Topoisomerases catalyze and guide the unknotting or unkinking of DNA[3] by creating transient breaks in the DNA using a conserved Tyrosine as the catalytic residue.
The insertion of viral DNA into chromosomes and other forms of recombination can also require the action of topoisomerases.

Topoisomerases can fix these topological problems and are separated into two types separated by the number of strands cut in one round of action:&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid1849888&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Wang JC | title = DNA topoisomerases: why so many? | journal = J. Biol. Chem. | volume = 266 | issue = 11 | pages = 6659–62 | year = 1991 | month = April | pmid = 1849888 | doi = | url = http://www.jbc.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=1849888 | issn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Both these classes of enzyme utilize a conserved tyrosine.  However these enzymes are structurally and mechanistically different. 

* [[Type I topoisomerase]] cuts one strand of a DNA double helix, relaxation occurs, and then the cut strand is reannealed.  Cutting one strand allows the part of the molecule on one side of the cut to rotate around the uncut strand, thereby reducing stress from too much or too little twist in the helix.  Such stress is introduced when the DNA strand is &quot;supercoiled&quot; or uncoiled to or from higher orders of coiling.  Type I topoisomerases are subdivided into two subclasses: type IA topoisomerases, which share many structural and mechanistic features with the type II topoisomerases, and type IB topoisomerases, which utilize a controlled rotary mechanism.  Examples of type IA topoisomerases include topo I and topo III.  In the past, type IB topoisomerases were referred to as eukaryotic topo I, but IB topoisomerases are present in all three domains of life.  It is interesting to note that type IA topoisomerases form a covalent intermediate with the 5' end of DNA, while the IB topoisomerases form a covalent intermediate with the 3' end of DNA.  Recently, a type IC topoisomerase has been identified, called topo V. While it is structurally unique from type IA and IB topoisomerases, it shares a similar mechanism with type IB topoisomerase.

* [[Type II topoisomerase]] cuts both strands of one DNA double helix, passes another unbroken DNA helix through it, and then reanneals the cut strand.  It is also split into two subclasses: type IIA and type IIB topoisomerases, which share similar structure and mechanisms.  Examples of type IIA topoisomerases include eukaryotic topo II, E. coli gyrase, and E. coli topo IV.  Examples of type IIB topoisomerase include topo VI.

Both type I and type II topoisomerases change the linking number (L) of DNA.  Type IA topoisomerases change the linking number by one, type IB and type IC topoisomerases change the linking number by any integer, while type IIA and type IIB topoisomerases change the linking number by two.

Many drugs operate through interference with the topoisomerases. The broad-spectrum fluoroquinolone antibiotics act by disrupting the function of bacterial type II topoisomerases.
Some chemotherapy drugs work by interfering with topoisomerases in cancer cells:
type 1 is inhibited by irinotecan and topotecan.
type 2 is inhibited by etoposide (VP-16), teniposide and HU-331, a quinolone synthesized from cannabidiol.
Topoisomerase I is the antigen recognized by Anti Scl-70 antibodies in scleroderma.
These small molecule inhibitors act as efficient anti-bacterial and anti-cancer agents by hijacking the natural ability of topoisomerase to create breaks in chromosomal DNA. These breaks in DNA accumulate, ultimately leading to programmed cell death, or apoptosis.

==Replication in Eukaryote==
[[Image:DNA polymerase.png|thumb|3D structure of the DNA-binding [[helix-turn-helix]] motifs in human DNA polymerase beta]]
[[Image:pre-RC.png|thumb|350px|Pre-RC assembly involves the  assembly of the ORC subunits, Cdc6 and Cdt1 and the Mcm2-7 complex]]
DNA replication in eukaryotes is much more complicated than in prokaryotes, although there are many similar aspects. Eukaryotic cells can only initiate DNA replication at a specific point in the cell cycle, the beginning of '''S phase'''.

DNA replication in eukaryotes occurs only in the S phase of the cell cycle. However, pre-initiation occurs in the G1 phase. Thus, the separation of pre-initiation and activation ensures that the origin can only fire once per cell cycle.
Due to the sheer size of chromosomes in eukaryotes, eukaryotic chromosomes contain '''multiple origins of replication'''. Some origins are well characterized, such as the '''autonomously replicating sequences (ARS)''' of yeast while other eukaryotic origins, particularly those in metazoa, can be found in spans of thousands of basepairs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eukaryotic_DNA_replication Eukaryotic DNA replication]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eukaryotic DNA polymerase===

There are at least 15 known Eukaryotic DNA polymerase:

POLA1, POLA2: Pol α (also called RNA primase): forms a complex with a small catalytic (PriS) and a large noncatalytic (PriL) subunit, with the Pri subunits acting as a primase (synthesizing an RNA primer), and then with DNA Pol α elongating that primer with DNA nucleotides. After around 20 nucleotides[3] elongation is taken over by Pol ε (on the leading strand) and δ (on the lagging strand).

POLB: Pol β: Implicated in repairing DNA, in base excision repair and gap-filling synthesis.

POLG, POLG2: Pol γ: Replicates and repairs mitochondrial DNA and has proofreading 3'-&gt;5' exonuclease activity.

POLD1, POLD2, POLD3, POLD4: Pol δ: Highly processive and has proofreading 3'-&gt;5' exonuclease activity. Thought to be the main polymerase involved in lagging strand synthesis, though there is still debate about its role.

POLE, POLE2, POLE3: Pol ε: Also highly processive and has proofreading 3'-&gt;5' exonuclease activity. Highly related to pol δ, and thought to be the main polymerase involved in leading strand synthesis[5], though there is again still debate about its role.

POLH, POLI, POLK, : η, ι, κ, and Rev1 are Y-family DNA polymerases and Pol ζ is a B-family DNA polymerase. These polymerases are involved in the bypass of DNA damage.

There are also other eukaryotic polymerases known, which are not as well characterized:
POLQ: 'θ
POLL: λ
φ
σ
POLM: μ
None of the eukaryotic polymerases can remove primers (5'-&gt;3' exonuclease activity); that function is carried out by other enzymes. Only the polymerases that deal with the elongation (γ, δ and ε) have proofreading ability (3'-&gt;5' exonuclease).



''Preparation in G1 phase''

The first step in DNA replication is the formation of the pre-initiation replication complex (the pre-RC). The formation of this complex occurs in two stages. The first stage requires that there is no CDK activity. This can only occur in early G1. The formation of the pre-RC is known as licensing, but a licensed pre-RC cannot initiate replication in the 
''G1 phase''
Current models hold that it begins with the binding of the origin recognition complex (ORC) to the origin. This complex is a hexamer of related proteins and remains bound to the origin, even after DNA replication occurs. Furthermore, ORC is the functional analogue of prokaryotic DnaA. Following the binding of ORC to the origin, Cdc6/Cdc18 and Cdt1 coordinate the loading of the MCM (Mini Chromosome Maintenance) complex to the origin by first binding to ORC and then binding to the MCM complex. The MCM complex is thought to be the major DNA helicase in eukaryotic organisms. Once binding of MCM occurs, a fully licensed pre-RC exists.

===DNA Replication occurs during the S phase===
Activation of the complex occurs in S-phase and requires Cdk2-Cyclin E and Ddk. The activation process begins with the addition of Mcm10 to the pre-RC, which displaces Cdt1. Following this, Ddk phosphorylates Mcm3-7, which activates the helicase. It is believed that ORC and Cdc6/18 are phosphorylated by Cdk2-Cyclin E. Ddk and the Cdk complex then recruits another protein called Cdc45, which then recruits all of the DNA replication proteins to the replication fork. At this stage the origin fires and DNA synthesis begins.
Activation of a new round of replication is prevented through the actions of the cyclin dependent kinases and a protein known as geminin. Geminin binds to Cdt1 and sequesters it. It is a periodic protein that first appears in S-phase and is degraded in late M-phase, possibly through the action of the anaphase promoting complex (APC). In addition, phosphorylation of Cdc6/18 prevent it from binding to the ORC (thus inhibiting loading of the MCM complex) while the phosphorylation of ORC remains unclear. Cells in the G0 stage of the cell cycle are prevented from initiating a round of replication because the Mcm proteins are not expressed.

At least three different types of eukaryotic DNA polymerases are involved in the replication of DNA in animal cells (POL α, Pol δ and POL ε).

Pol α forms a complex with a small catalytic (PriS) and a large noncatalytic (PriL) subunit, with the Pri subunits acting as a primase (synthesizing an RNA primer), and then with DNA Pol α elongating that primer with DNA nucleotides. After around 20 nucleotides elongation is taken over by Pol ε (on the leading strand) and δ (on the lagging strand).

Pol δ: Highly processive and has proofreading 3'-&gt;5' exonuclease activity. Thought to be the main polymerase involved in leading strand synthesis, though there is still debate about its role.

Pol ε: Also highly processive and has proofreading 3'-&gt;5' exonuclease activity. Highly related to pol δ, and thought to be the main polymerase involved in lagging strand synthesis, though there is again still debate about its role&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Eukaryotic_DNA_replication&amp;oldid=423827289&lt;/ref&gt;.
[[Image:Mitochondrial DNA en.svg|thumb|400px|right|Mitochondrial DNA.]]

==Replication in mitochondria==

Nuclear and mitochondrial DNA are thought to be of separate evolutionary origin, with the mtDNA being derived from the circular genomes of the bacteria that were engulfed by the early ancestors of today's eukaryotic cells. This theory is called the endosymbiotic theory. Each mitochondrion is estimated to contain 2-10 mtDNA copies. In the cells of extant organisms, the vast majority of the proteins present in the mitochondria (numbering approximately 1500 different types in mammals) are coded for by nuclear DNA, but the genes for some of them, if not most, are thought to have originally been of bacterial origin, having since been transferred to the eukaryotic nucleus during evolution.

mtDNA is replicated by the DNA polymerase gamma complex which is composed of a 140 kDa catalytic DNA polymerase encoded by the POLG gene and a 55 kDa accessory subunit encoded by the POLG2 gene. During embryogenesis, replication of mtDNA is strictly down-regulated from the fertilized oocyte through the preimplantation embryo. At the blastocyst stage, the onset of mtDNA replication is specific to the cells of the trophectoderm. In contrast, the cells of the inner cell mass restrict mtDNA replication until they receive the signals to differentiate to specific cell types.
D-loop replication is a process by which chloroplasts and mitochondria replicate their genetic material. An important component of understanding D-loop replication is that chloroplasts and mitochondria have a single circular chromosome like bacteria instead of the linear chromosomes found in eukaryotes.
In many organisms, one strand of DNA in the plastid comprises heavier nucleotides (relatively more purines: adenine and guanine). This strand is called the H (heavy) strand. The L (light) strand comprises lighter nucleotides (pyrimidines: thymine and cytosine). Replication begins with replication of the heavy strand starting at the D-loop (also known as the control region). An origin of replication opens, and the heavy strand is replicated in one direction. After heavy strand replication has continued for some time, a new light strand is also synthesized, through the opening of another origin of replication. When diagramed, the resulting structure looks like the letter D.
The D-loop region is important for phylogeographic studies. Because the region does not code for any genes, it is free to vary with only a few selective limitations on size and heavy/light strand factors. The mutation rate is among the fastest of anywhere in either the nuclear or mitochondrial genomes in animals. Mutations in the D-loop can effectively track recent and rapid evolutionary changes such as within species and among very closely related species.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrial_DNA Mitochondrial DNA]&lt;/ref&gt;

==C&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;t values==
It was first developed and utilized by Roy Britten and his colleagues at the Carnegie Institution of Washington in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson EH, Britten RJ (1973) Organization, transcription, and regulation in the animal genome. Quart. Rev. Biol. 48: 565-613.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Britten RJ, Graham DE, Neufeld BR |title=Analysis of repeating DNA sequences by reassociation |journal=Meth.

Repeated sequences in DNA. &lt;ref&gt;Science 161: 529-540.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, it wasn't until the breakthrough DNA reassociation kinetics experiments of Britten and his colleagues that it was shown that not all DNA coded for genes. In fact, their experiments demonstrated that the majority of eukaryotic genomic DNA is composed of repetitive, non-coding elements.
The amount of single and double-stranded DNA is measured by rapidly diluting the sample, which slows reassociation, and then binding the DNA to a hydroxylapatite column. The column is first washed with a low concentration of sodium phosphate buffer, which elutes the single-stranded DNA, and then with high concentrations of phosphate, which elutes the double stranded DNA. The amount of DNA in these two solutions is then measured using a spectrophotometer.
Since a sequence of single-stranded DNA needs to find its complementary strand to reform a double helix, common sequences renature more rapidly than rare sequences. Indeed, the rate at which a sequence will reassociate is proportional to the number of copies of that sequence in the DNA sample. A sample with a highly-repetitive sequence will renature rapidly, while complex sequences will renature slowly.
However, instead of simply measuring the percentage of double-stranded DNA versus time, the amount of renaturation is measured relative to a C0t value. The C0t value is the product of C0 (the initial concentration of DNA), t (time in seconds), and a constant that depends on the concentration of cations in the buffer. Repetitive DNA will renature at low C0t values, while complex and unique DNA sequences will renature at high C0t values.

[[Image:CoT analysis.png|thumb|right|250px|Repetitive DNA sequences renature at lower C&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;t values than single-copy sequences.]]

==DNA repair==
DNA damage, due to environmental factors and normal metabolic processes inside the cell, occurs at a rate of 1,000 to 1,000,000 molecular lesions per cell per day. While this constitutes only 0.000165% of the human genome's approximately 6 billion bases '''(3 billion base pairs)''', unrepaired lesions in critical genes (such as tumor suppressor genes) can impede a cell's ability to carry out its function and appreciably increase the likelihood of tumor formation.

The vast majority of DNA damage affects the primary structure of the double helix; that is, the bases themselves are chemically modified. These modifications can in turn disrupt the molecules' regular helical structure by introducing non-native chemical bonds or bulky adducts that do not fit in the standard double helix. Unlike proteins and RNA, DNA usually lacks tertiary structure and therefore damage or disturbance does not occur at that level. DNA is, however, supercoiled and wound around &quot;packaging&quot; proteins called histones (in eukaryotes), and both superstructures are vulnerable to the effects of DNA damage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_repair DNA repair]&lt;/ref&gt;
===Types of DNA damage===
[[Image:direct DNA damage.png|thumb|right|500px| Direct DNA damage: The UV-photon is directly absorbed by the DNA (left). One of the possible reactions from the excited state is the formation of a thymine-thymine cyclobutane dimer (right). The direct DNA damage leads to sunburn, causing an increase in melanin production, thereby leading to a long-lasting tan. However, it is responsible for only 8% of all melanoma.]]
There are five main types of damage to DNA due to endogenous cellular processes: (1) oxidation of bases [e.g. 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine (8-oxoG)] and generation of DNA strand interruptions from reactive oxygen species; (2) alkylation of bases (usually methylation), such as formation of 7-methylguanine, 1-methyladenine, 6-O-Methylguanine; (3) hydrolysis of bases, such as deamination, depurination, and depyrimidination; (4) &quot;bulky adduct formation&quot; (i.e., benzo[a]pyrene diol epoxide-dG adduct); (5) mismatch of bases, due to errors in DNA replication, in which the wrong DNA base is stitched into place in a newly forming DNA strand, or a DNA base is skipped over or mistakenly inserted.  '''Damage caused by exogenous agents''' Damage caused by exogenous agents comes in many forms. Some examples are described below.

UV-B light causes crosslinking between adjacent cytosine and thymine bases creating '''pyrimidine dimers'''. This is called direct DNA damage.

UV-A light creates mostly free radicals. The damage caused by free radicals is called indirect DNA damage.

Ionizing radiation such as that created by radioactive decay or in cosmic rays causes breaks in DNA strands. Low-level ionizing radiation may induce irreparable DNA damage (leading to replicational and transcriptional errors needed for neoplasia or may trigger viral interactions) leading to pre-mature aging and cancer.

Thermal disruption at elevated temperature increases the rate of depurination (loss of purine bases from the DNA backbone) and single-strand breaks. For example, hydrolytic depurination is seen in the thermophilic bacteria, which grow in hot springs at 40-80 °C. The rate of depurination (300 purine residues per genome per generation) is too high in these species to be repaired by normal repair machinery, hence a possibility of an adaptive response cannot be ruled out.

Industrial chemicals also play very important role in DNA damage, such as vinyl chloride and hydrogen peroxide, and environmental chemicals such as polycyclic hydrocarbons found in smoke, soot and tar create a huge diversity of DNA adducts- ethenobases, oxidized bases, alkylated phosphotriesters and Crosslinking of DNA just to name a few.
'''UV damage, alkylation/methylation, X-ray damage and oxidative damage are examples of induced damage'''. Spontaneous damage can include the loss of a base, deamination, sugar ring puckering and tautomeric shift.

===Sources of damage===
DNA damage can be subdivided into '''two''' main types:

'''Endogenous''' damage such as attack by reactive oxygen species produced from normal metabolic byproducts, especially the process of oxidative deamination, and this also includes base mismatches due to replication errors

'''Exogenous damage''' caused by external agents such as

ultraviolet [UV 200-300nm] radiation from the sun

other radiation frequencies, including x-rays and gamma rays

hydrolysis or thermal disruption

certain plant toxins

human-made mutagenic chemicals, especially aromatic compounds that act as DNA intercalating agents

cancer chemotherapy and radiotherapy

viruses

===Types of mutation===

When DNA damages are repaired this can sometimes give rise to a simple one base-pair mutation, described here.  (Deletions and translocations can also arise during repair)

'''Transition''' In molecular biology, a transition is a point mutation that changes a purine nucleotide to another purine (A ↔ G) or a pyrimidine nucleotide to another pyrimidine (C ↔ T). Approximately two out of three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are transitions.
Transitions can be caused by oxidative deamination and tautomerization. Although there are twice as many possible transversions, transitions appear more often in genomes, possibly due to the molecular mechanisms that generate them.
5-Methylcytosine is more prone to transition than unmethylated cytosine, due to spontaneous deamination. This mechanism is important because it dictates the rarity of CpG islands.

'''Transversion''' In molecular biology, transversion refers to the substitution of a purine for a pyrimidine or vice versa. It can only be reverted by a spontaneous reversion. Because this type of mutation changes the chemical structure dramatically, the consequences of this change tend to be more severe and less common than that of transitions. Transversions can be caused by ionizing radiation and alkylating agents.

==DNA repair and disorders==
Defects in the NER mechanism are responsible for squally several genetic disorders, including:

'''Xeroderma pigmentosum:''' hypersensitivity to sunlight/UV, resulting in increased skin cancer incidence and premature aging

'''Cockayne syndrome:''' hypersensitivity to UV and chemical agents

'''Trichothiodystrophy:''' sensitive skin, brittle hair and nails
Mental retardation often accompanies the latter two disorders, suggesting increased vulnerability of developmental neurons.

Other DNA repair disorders include:

'''Werner's syndrome:''' premature aging and retarded growth

'''Bloom's syndrome:''' sunlight hypersensitivity, high incidence of malignancies (especially leukemias).

'''Ataxia telangiectasia:''' sensitivity to ionizing radiation and some chemical agents

All of the above diseases are often called '''&quot;segmental progerias&quot;''' (&quot;accelerated aging diseases&quot;) because their victims appear elderly and suffer from aging-related diseases at an abnormally young age, while not manifesting all the symptoms of old age.

Other diseases associated with reduced DNA repair function include '''Fanconi's anemia''', hereditary breast cancer and hereditary colon cancer.

==Human Chromosome and Chromosomal aberrations ==
Chromosomes can be divided into two types—autosomes, and sex chromosomes. Certain genetic traits are linked to your sex, and are passed on through the sex chromosomes. The autosomes contain the rest of the genetic hereditary information. All act in the same way during cell division. Human cells have 23 pairs of large linear nuclear chromosomes, (22 pairs of autosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes) giving a total of 46 per cell. In addition to these, human cells have many hundreds of copies of the mitochondrial genome. Sequencing of the human genome has provided a great deal of information about each of the chromosomes. Below is a table compiling statistics for the chromosomes, based on the Sanger Institute's human genome information in the Vertebrate Genome Annotation (VEGA) database. Number of genes is an estimate as it is in part based on gene predictions. Total chromosome length is an estimate as well, based on the estimated size of unsequenced heterochromatin regions.

Chromosomal aberrations are disruptions in the normal chromosomal content of a cell and are a major cause of genetic conditions in humans, such as [[Down syndrome]]. Some chromosome abnormalities do not cause disease in carriers, such as [[translocations]], or [[chromosomal inversions]], although they may lead to a higher chance of birthing a child with a chromosome disorder. Abnormal numbers of chromosomes or chromosome sets, [[aneuploidy]], may be lethal or give rise to genetic disorders. [[Genetic counseling]] is offered for families that may carry a chromosome rearrangement.

The gain or loss of DNA from chromosomes can lead to a variety of [[genetic disorders]]. Human examples include:
* [[Cri du chat]], which is caused by the [[Genetic deletion|deletion]] of part of the short arm of chromosome 5. &quot;Cri du chat&quot; means &quot;cry of the cat&quot; in French, and the condition was so-named because affected babies make high-pitched cries that sound like those of a cat. Affected individuals have wide-set eyes, a small head and jaw, moderate to severe mental health issues, and are very short.
* [[Down syndrome]], usually is caused by an extra copy of chromosome 21 ([[trisomy 21]]). Characteristics include decreased muscle tone, stockier build, asymmetrical skull, slanting eyes and mild to moderate developmental disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Miller|first=Kenneth R.|title=Biology|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey|year=2000|edition=5th |pages=194–5|chapter=9-3|isbn=0-13-436265-9|accessdate=2008-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Edwards syndrome]], which is the second-most-common trisomy; Down syndrome is the most common. It is a trisomy of chromosome 18. Symptoms include motor retardation, developmental disability and numerous congenital anomalies causing serious health problems. Ninety percent die in infancy; however, those that live past their first birthday usually are quite healthy thereafter. They have a characteristic clenched hands and overlapping fingers.
* [[Idic15]], abbreviation for Isodicentric 15 on chromosome 15; also called the following names due to various researches, but they all mean the same; IDIC(15), Inverted duplication 15, extra Marker, Inv dup 15, partial tetrasomy 15
* [[Jacobsen syndrome]], also called the terminal 11q deletion disorder.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.11q.org European Chromosome 11 Network&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; This is a very rare disorder. Those affected have normal intelligence or mild developmental disability, with poor expressive language skills. Most have a bleeding disorder called [[Paris-Trousseau syndrome]].
* [[Klinefelter's syndrome]] (XXY). Men with Klinefelter syndrome are usually sterile, and tend to have longer arms and legs and to be taller than their peers. Boys with the syndrome are often shy and quiet, and have a higher incidence of speech delay and [[dyslexia]]. During puberty, without testosterone treatment, some of them may develop [[gynecomastia]].
* [[Patau Syndrome]], also called D-Syndrome or trisomy-13. Symptoms are somewhat similar to those of trisomy-18, but they do not have the characteristic hand shape.
* [[Small supernumerary marker chromosome]]. This means there is an extra, abnormal chromosome. Features depend on the origin of the extra genetic material. [[Cat-eye syndrome]] and [[Isodicentric 15|isodicentric chromosome 15 syndrome]] (or Idic15) are both caused by a supernumerary marker chromosome, as is [[Pallister-Killian syndrome]].
* [[Triple-X syndrome]] (XXX). XXX girls tend to be tall and thin. They have a higher incidence of dyslexia.
* [[Turner syndrome]] (X instead of XX or XY). In Turner syndrome, female sexual characteristics are present but underdeveloped. People with Turner syndrome often have a short stature, low hairline, abnormal eye features and bone development and a &quot;caved-in&quot; appearance to the chest.
* [[XYY syndrome]]. XYY boys are usually taller than their siblings. Like XXY boys and XXX girls, they are somewhat more likely to have learning difficulties.
* [[Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome]], which is caused by partial deletion of the short arm of chromosome 4. It is characterized by severe growth retardation and severe to profound mental health issues.

Chromosomal mutations produce changes in whole chromosomes (more than one gene) or in the number of chromosomes present.
* Deletion&amp;nbsp;– loss of part of a chromosome
* Duplication&amp;nbsp;– extra copies of a part of a chromosome
* Inversion&amp;nbsp;– reverse the direction of a part of a chromosome
* Translocation&amp;nbsp;– part of a chromosome breaks off and attaches to another chromosome
Most mutations are neutral&amp;nbsp;– have little or no effect. Chromosomal aberrations are the changes in the structure of chromosomes. It has a great role in evolution. A detailed graphical display of all human chromosomes and the diseases annotated at the correct spot may be found at the [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ornl.gov/hgmis/posters/chromosome/ ORNL.gov&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;], Exploring Genes &amp; Genetic Disorders&lt;/ref&gt;

==DNA Recombination==
[[Image:Morgan crossover 1.jpg|thumb|200px|Thomas Hunt Morgan's illustration of crossing over (1916)]]
[[Image:Morgan crossover 2.jpg||thumb|200px|A double crossing over]]
[[File:Homologous Recombination.jpg|thumb|400px|A current model of meiotic recombination, initiated by a double-strand break or gap, followed by pairing with an homologous chromosome and strand invasion to initiate the recombinational repair process. Repair of the gap can lead to crossover (CO) or non-crossover (NCO) of the flanking regions. CO recombination is thought to occur by the Double Holliday Junction (DHJ) model, illustrated on the right, above. NCO recombinants are thought to occur primarily by the Synthesis Dependent Strand Annealing (SDSA) model, illustrated on the left, above. Most recombination events appear to be the SDSA type.]]
Recombination is a process by which a molecule of nucleic acid (usually DNA, but can also be RNA) is broken and then joined to a different one (or in which genetic information is exchanged between two such molecules). Recombination ordinarily occurs between similar molecules of DNA, as in homologous recombination. Recombination is a common method of DNA repair in both bacteria and eukaryotes. In eukaryotes, recombination also occurs in meiosis, where it facilitates informational exchange and/or chromosomal crossover. The crossover process leads to offspring's having different combinations of genes from those of their parents, and can occasionally produce new chimeric alleles. In organisms with an adaptive immune system, a type of genetic recombination called V(D)J recombination helps immune cells rapidly diversify to recognize and adapt to new pathogens. The shuffling of genes brought about by genetic recombination can have long term advantages, as it is a major engine of genetic variation and also allows sexually reproducing organisms to avoid Muller's ratchet, in which the genomes of an asexual population accumulate deleterious mutations in an irreversible manner.
In genetic engineering, recombination can also refer to artificial and deliberate recombination of disparate pieces of DNA, often from different organisms, creating what is called recombinant DNA. A prime example of such a use of genetic recombination is gene targeting, which can be used to add, delete or otherwise change an organism's genes. This technique is important to biomedical researchers as it allows them to study the effects of specific genes. Techniques based on genetic recombination are also applied in protein engineering to develop new proteins of biological interest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_recombination Genetic recombination]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Chromosomal crossover'' in eukaryotes is an exchange of genetic material between homologous chromosomes. It can occur in one of the final phases of genetic recombination, which occurs during prophase I of meiosis (pachytene). The pairing of homologous chromsomes during meiosis (synapsis) begins before the synaptonemal complex develops, and is not completed until near the end of prophase I. Crossover usually occurs when matching regions on matching chromosomes break and then reconnect to the other chromosome.
Crossing over was described, in theory, by Thomas Hunt Morgan. He relied on the discovery of the Belgian Professor Frans Alfons Janssens of the University of Leuven who described the phenomenon in 1909 and had called it 'chiasmatypie'. The term chiasma is linked if not identical to chromosomal crossover. Morgan immediately saw the great importance of Janssens' cytological interpretation of chiasmata to the experimental results of his research on the heredity of Drosophila. The physical basis of crossing over was first demonstrated by Harriet Creighton and Barbara McClintock in 1931.

'''Meiotic recombination''' can be initiated by double-stranded breaks that can be introduced into the DNA by the Spo11 protein. In addition, meiotic recombination can be induced in response to spontaneous double strand breaks, possibly caused by reactive oxygen species, carried over from the prior round of synthesis.&lt;ref&gt;Carofiglio F, Inagaki A, de Vries S, Wassenaar E, Schoenmakers S, Vermeulen C, van Cappellen WA, Sleddens-Linkels E, Grootegoed JA, Te Riele HP, de Massy B, Baarends WM. (2013). SPO11-independent DNA repair foci and their role in meiotic silencing.PLoS Genet. 9(6):e1003538. doi: 10.1371/journal.pgen.1003538. PMID: 23754961&lt;/ref&gt;  One or more exonucleases then digest the 5’ ends generated by the double-stranded breaks to produce 3’ single-stranded DNA tails (see lowest Figure in this section). The meiosis-specific recombinase Dmc1 and the general recombinase Rad51 coat the single-stranded DNA to form nucleoprotein filaments.The recombinases catalyze invasion of the opposite chromatid by the single-stranded DNA from one end of the break. Next, the 3’ end of the invading DNA primes DNA synthesis, causing displacement of the complementary strand.  

'''Crossover recombinants''' are generated by a process in which the displaced complementary strand subsequently anneals to the single-stranded DNA generated from the other end of the initial double-stranded break (see DHJ pathway on the Figure). The structure that results is a cross-strand exchange, also known as a Holliday junction. The contact between two chromatids that will soon undergo crossing-over is known as a chiasma. The Holliday junction is a tetrahedral structure which can be 'pulled' by other recombinases, moving it along the four-stranded structure (see Double Holliday Junction or DHJ in the Figure).

'''Gene conversion''' can result from the repair of a double strand break.  Gene conversion involves the unidirectional transfer of genetic sequence information from a 'donor' sequence to a highly homologous 'acceptor' chromosome.  Gene conversion usually occurs by Synthesis Dependent Strand Annealing (SDSA)&lt;ref name=Allers&gt; Allers T, Lichten M. (2001). Differential timing and control of noncrossover and crossover recombination during meiosis. Cell 106(1):47-57. PMID: 11461701&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; McMahill MS, Sham CW, Bishop DK. (2007). Synthesis-dependent strand annealing in meiosis. PLoS Biol. 5(11):e299. PMID:17988174 PMCID: PMC2062477.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Andersen&gt;Andersen SL, Sekelsky J. (2010). Meiotic versus mitotic recombination: two different routes for double-strand break repair: the different functions of meiotic versus mitotic DSB repair are reflected in different pathway usage and different outcomes. Bioessays. 32(12);1058-66. doi: 10.1002/bies.201000087. Review. PMID: 20967781&lt;/ref&gt; illustrated in the lowest Figure in this section.  In this model of SDSA DNA repair, a free strand of DNA from the end of a double strand break invades an homologous chromosome, extending itself by replication along the sequence on the complementary strand of DNA of the ‘donor’ chromosome.  The extended strand is then retracted from the donor chromosome and pairs with the complementary sequence on the recipient chromosome in a region at the other end of the double strand break (needing about 25 to 50 base pairs of homology).&lt;ref name=Allers /&gt;  This allows completion of healing of the double strand break by replication, to complete the duplex structure on the recipient chromosome, from information on the extended strand copied from the donor chromosome.  The usual length of a gene conversion tract in mammals is between 200 to 1,000 base pairs.&lt;ref&gt; Chen JM, Cooper DN, Chuzhanova N, Férec C, Patrinos GP. (2007) Gene conversion: mechanisms, evolution and human disease. Nat Rev Genet 8(10);762-75. Review. PMID: 17846636&lt;/ref&gt;

During meiosis, gene conversion is most often associated with non-crossover of outside regions (e.g. the SDSA pathway shown in the Figure).  Less frequently, gene conversion during meiosis is associated with crossover of outside regions and these events are usually generated by the DHJ pathway.  Gene conversion without crossover occurs more frequently than crossover recombination during meiosis in many organisms, often by about a 2 to 1 ratio.&lt;ref name=Whitehouse&gt;Whitehouse, HLK. Genetic Recombination.(see Table 38) New York: Wiley; 1982. ISBN-10: 0471102059  ISBN-13: 978-0471102052&lt;/ref&gt;  During mitosis, gene conversion is almost the exclusive mode of double strand break repair by homologous recombination.&lt;ref name=Andersen /&gt;  

Studies of gene conversion have contributed to our understanding of the adaptive function of meiotic recombination.  Since gene conversion in most species studied is more frequently of the non-crossover type,&lt;ref name=Whitehouse /&gt; explanations for the adaptive function of meiotic recombination that focus exclusively on the adaptive benefit of producing new genetic variation seem inadequate to explain the majority of recombination events during meiosis.  However, the majority of meiotic recombination events can be explained by the proposal that they are an adaptation for repair of damages in the DNA that is to be passed on to gametes.&lt;ref&gt;Hörandl E. (2013). Meiosis and the Paradox of Sex in Nature, Meiosis, Dr. Carol Bernstein (Ed.), ISBN: 978-953-51-1197-9, InTech, DOI: 10.5772/56542. Available from: http://www.intechopen.com/books/meiosis/meiosis-and-the-paradox-of-sex-in-nature&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein H, BernsteinC and Michod RE.  (2011). Meiosis as an Evolutionary Adaptation for DNA Repair. Chapter 19 in DNA Repair. Inna Kruman editor. InTech Open Publisher. DOI: 10.5772/25117 http://www.intechopen.com/books/dna-repair/meiosis-as-an-evolutionary-adaptation-for-dna-repair&lt;/ref&gt;

Genetic recombination is catalyzed by enzymes called recombinases. RecA, the chief recombinase found in Escherichia coli, is responsible for the repair of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs). In yeast and other eukaryotic organisms there are two recombinases required for repairing DSBs. The RAD51 protein is employed in both mitotic and meiotic recombination, whereas the DMC1 protein is specific to meiotic recombination.

'''Nonhomologous recombination'''  Recombinational repair can infrequently occur between DNA sequences that contain no or little sequence homology. This is referred to as nonhomologous recombination.

== Software Engineer ==
Software engineering is done by the software engineer, an engineer who applies the principles of software engineering to the design, development, testing, and evaluation of software and systems that make computers or anything containing software work.  There has been some controversy over the term engineer&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Sayo|first=Mylene|title=[http://www.peo.on.ca/enforcement/June112002newsrelease.html What's in a Name? Tech Sector battles Engineers on &quot;software engineering&quot;]|url=http://www.peo.on.ca/enforcement/June112002newsrelease.html|accessdate=2008-07-24|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;, since it implies a certain level of academic training, professional discipline, adherence to formal processes, and especially legal liability that often are not applied in cases of software development.  In 2004, the U. S. Bureau of Labor Statistics counted 760,840 software engineers holding jobs in the U.S.; in the same period there were some 1.4 million practitioners employed in the U.S. in all other engineering disciplines combined.&lt;ref&gt;Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor, [ftp://ftp.bls.gov/pub/news.release/ocwage.txt ''USDL 05-2145: Occupational Employment and Wages, November 2004'']&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Overview ===
Prior to the mid-1990s, software practitioners called themselves ''programmers'' or ''developers,'' regardless of their actual jobs. Many people prefer to call themselves ''software developer'' and ''programmer'', because most widely agree what these terms mean, while ''software engineer'' is still being debated. A prominent computing scientist, E. W. Dijkstra, wrote in a paper that the coining of the term ''software engineer'' was not a useful term since it was an inappropriate analogy, &quot;The existence of the mere term has been the base of a number of extremely shallow --and false-- analogies, which just confuse the issue...Computers are such exceptional gadgets that there is good reason to assume that most analogies with other disciplines are too shallow to be of any positive value, are even so shallow that they are only confusing.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD06xx/EWD690.html E.W.Dijkstra Archive: The pragmatic engineer versus the scientific designer&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''programmer'' has often been used to refer to those without the tools, skills, education, or ethics to write good quality software. In response, many practitioners called themselves ''software engineers'' to escape the stigma attached to the word programmer. 

The label software engineer is used very liberally in the corporate world. Very few of the practicing software engineers actually hold Engineering degrees from accredited universities. In fact, according to the Association for Computing Machinery, &quot;most people who now function in the U.S. as serious software engineers have degrees in computer science, not in software engineering&quot;. 
&lt;ref&gt;http://computingcareers.acm.org/?page_id=12 ACM, Computing - Degrees &amp; Careers, Software Engineering&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Education ===
About half of all practitioners today have computer science degrees. A small, but growing, number of practitioners have software engineering degrees. In 1987 Imperial College London introduced the first three-year software engineering Bachelor's degree in the UK and the world.  Since then, software engineering undergraduate degrees have been established at many universities. A standard international curriculum for undergraduate software engineering degrees was recently defined by the ACM&lt;ref&gt;http://sites.computer.org/ccse/ Curriculum Guidelines for Undergraduate Degree Programs in Software Engineering&lt;/ref&gt;. As of 2004, in the U.S., about 50 universities offer software engineering degrees, which teach both computer science and engineering principles and practices.  ETS University and UQAM were mandated by IEEE to develop the SoftWare Engineering BOdy of Knowledge (SWEBOK) &lt;ref&gt;http://www.computer.org/portal/web/swebok Guide to the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge&lt;/ref&gt;, which has become an ISO standard describing the body of knowledge covered by a software engineer.

In business, some software engineering practitioners have Management Information Systems (MIS) degrees. In embedded systems, some have electrical engineering or computer engineering degrees, because embedded software often requires a detailed understanding of hardware. In medical software, practitioners may have medical informatics, general medical, or biology degrees.  Some practitioners have mathematics, science, engineering, or technology degrees. Some have philosophy (logic in particular) or other non-technical degrees, and others have no degrees.

=== Profession ===
Most software engineers work as employees or contractors. They work with businesses, government agencies (civilian or military), and non-profit organizations. Some software engineers work for themselves as freelancers. Some organizations have specialists to perform each of the tasks in the software development process. Other organizations required software engineers to do many or all of them. In large projects, people may specialize in only one role. In small projects, people may fill several or all roles at the same time. 

There is considerable debate over the future employment prospects for Software Engineers and other Information Technology (IT) Professionals. For example, an online futures market called the Future of IT Jobs in America&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ideosphere.com/fx-bin/Claim?claim=ITJOBS Future of IT Jobs in America]&lt;/ref&gt; attempts to answer whether there will be more IT jobs, including software engineers, in 2012 than there were in 2002.

Some students in the developed world may have avoided degrees related to software engineering because of the fear of offshore outsourcing and of being displaced by foreign workers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.computerworld.com/printthis/2006/0,4814,111202,00.html As outsourcing gathers steam, computer science interest wanes&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Although government statistics do not currently show a threat to software engineering itself; a related career, computer programming, does appear to have been affected.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos110.htm#outlook Computer Programmers&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infoworld.com/article/07/03/13/HNslowsoftdev_1.html Software developer growth slows in North America | InfoWorld | News | 2007-03-13 | By Robert Mullins, IDG News Service&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Some career counselors suggest a student to also focus on &quot;people skills&quot; and business skills rather than purely technical skills, because such &quot;soft skills&quot; are allegedly more difficult to offshore.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleTOC&amp;specialReportId=9000100&amp;articleId=112360 Hot Skills, Cold Skills&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; It is the quasi-management aspects of software engineering that appear to be what has kept it from being impacted by globalization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://itmanagement.earthweb.com/career/article.php/3523066 Dual Roles: The Changing Face of IT&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''software development methodology''' or '''system development methodology''' in software engineering is a framework that is used to structure, plan, and control the process of developing an information system.

== History ==
The software development methodology framework didn't emerge until the 1960s. According to Elliott (2004) the systems development life cycle (SDLC) can be considered to be the oldest formalized methodology framework for building information systems. The main idea of the SDLC has been &quot;to pursue the development of information systems in a very deliberate, structured and methodical way, requiring each stage of the life cycle from inception of the idea to delivery of the final system, to be carried out in rigidly and sequentially&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ell04&quot;&gt;Geoffrey Elliott (2004) ''Global Business Information Technology: an integrated systems approach''. Pearson Education. p.87.&lt;/ref&gt; within the context of the framework being applied. The main target of this methodology framework in the 1960s was &quot;to develop large scale functional business systems in an age of large scale business conglomerates. Information systems activities revolved around heavy data processing and number crunching routines&quot;.&lt;ref name=Ell04/&gt;

=== As a noun ===
As a noun, a software development methodology is a framework that is used to structure, plan, and control the process of developing an information system - this includes the pre-definition of specific deliverables and artifacts that are created and completed by a project team to develop or maintain an application.&lt;ref name=&quot;CMS08&quot;&gt;Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) Office of Information Service (2008). ''[http://www.cms.hhs.gov/SystemLifecycleFramework/Downloads/SelectingDevelopmentApproach.pdf Selecting a development approach]''. Webarticle. United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Revalidated: March 27, 2008.  Retrieved 27 Oct 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Three software development patterns mashed together.svg|thumb|420px|The three basic approaches applied to software development methodology frameworks.]] A wide variety of such frameworks have evolved over the years, each with its own recognized strengths and weaknesses. One software development methodology framework is not necessarily suitable for use by all projects. Each of the available methodology frameworks are best suited to specific kinds of projects, based on various technical, organizational, project and team considerations.&lt;ref name=CMS08/&gt;

These software development frameworks are often bound to some kind of organization, which further develops, supports the use, and promotes the methodology framework. The methodology framework is often defined in some kind of formal documentation. Specific software development methodology frameworks (noun) include

* Rational Unified Process (RUP, IBM) since 1998.
* Agile Unified Process (AUP) since 2005 by Scott Ambler

=== As a verb ===
As a verb, the software development methodology is an approach used by organizations and project teams to apply the software development methodology framework (noun). Specific software development methodologies (verb) include:

;1970s
* Structured programming since 1969
* Cap Gemini SDM, originally from PANDATA, the first English translation was published in 1974. SDM stands for System Development Methodology
;1980s
* Structured Systems Analysis and Design Methodology (SSADM) from 1980 onwards
* Information Requirement Analysis/Soft systems methodology
;1990s
* Object-oriented programming (OOP) has been developed since the early 1960s, and developed as a dominant programming approach during the mid-1990s
* Rapid application development (RAD) since 1991
* Scrum, since the late 1990s
* Team software process developed by Watts Humphrey at the SEI
* Extreme Programming since 1999

== Verb approaches ==
Every software development methodology framework acts as a basis for applying specific approaches to develop and maintain software. Several software development approaches have been used since the origin of information technology. These are:&lt;ref name=CMS08/&gt;
* Waterfall: a linear framework
* Prototyping: an iterative framework
* Incremental: a combined linear-iterative framework
* Spiral: a combined linear-iterative framework
* Rapid application development (RAD): an iterative framework
* Extreme Programming

=== Waterfall development ===
The Waterfall model is a sequential development approach, in which development is seen as flowing steadily downwards (like a waterfall) through the phases of requirements analysis, design, implementation, testing (validation), integration, and maintenance. The first formal description of the method is often cited as an article published by Winston W. Royce&lt;ref&gt;[http://cartoon.iguw.tuwien.ac.at/fit/fit01/wasserfall/entstehung.html Wasserfallmodell &gt; Entstehungskontext], Markus Rerych, Institut für Gestaltungs- und Wirkungsforschung, TU-Wien. Accessed on line November 28, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1970 although Royce did not use the term &quot;waterfall&quot; in this article.

The basic principles are:&lt;ref name=CMS08/&gt;
* Project is divided into sequential phases, with some overlap and splashback acceptable between phases.
* Emphasis is on planning, time schedules, target dates, budgets and implementation of an entire system at one time.
* Tight control is maintained over the life of the project via extensive written documentation, formal reviews, and approval/signoff by the user and information technology management occurring at the end of most phases before beginning the next phase.

=== Prototyping ===
Software prototyping, is the development approach of activities during software development, the creation of prototypes, i.e., incomplete versions of the software program being developed.

The basic principles are:&lt;ref name=CMS08/&gt;
* Not a standalone, complete development methodology, but rather an approach to handling selected parts of a larger, more traditional development methodology (i.e. incremental, spiral, or rapid application development (RAD)).
* Attempts to reduce inherent project risk by breaking a project into smaller segments and providing more ease-of-change during the development process.
* User is involved throughout the development process, which increases the likelihood of user acceptance of the final implementation.
* Small-scale mock-ups of the system are developed following an iterative modification process until the prototype evolves to meet the users’ requirements.
* While most prototypes are developed with the expectation that they will be discarded, it is possible in some cases to evolve from prototype to working system.
* A basic understanding of the fundamental business problem is necessary to avoid solving the wrong problem.

=== Incremental development ===
Various methods are acceptable for combining linear and iterative systems development methodologies, with the primary objective of each being to reduce inherent project risk by breaking a project into smaller segments and providing more ease-of-change during the development process.

The basic principles are:&lt;ref name=CMS08/&gt;
* A series of mini-Waterfalls are performed, where all phases of the Waterfall are completed for a small part of a system, before proceeding to the next increment, or
* Overall requirements are defined before proceeding to evolutionary, mini-Waterfall development of individual increments of a system, or
* The initial software concept, requirements analysis, and design of architecture and system core are defined via Waterfall, followed by iterative Prototyping, which culminates in installing the final prototype, a working system.

=== Spiral development ===
[[Image:Software Development Spiral.svg|thumb|200px|The spiral model.]]
The spiral model is a software development process combining elements of both design and prototyping-in-stages, in an effort to combine advantages  of top-down and bottom-up concepts.

The basic principles are:&lt;ref name=CMS08/&gt;
* Focus is on risk assessment and on minimizing project risk by breaking a project into smaller segments and providing more ease-of-change during the development process, as well as providing the opportunity to evaluate risks and weigh consideration of project continuation throughout the life cycle.
* &quot;Each cycle involves a progression through the same sequence of steps, for each part of the product and for each of its levels of elaboration, from an overall concept-of-operation document down to the coding of each individual program.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;BB86&quot;&gt;Barry Boehm (1996., [http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/12944.12948 &quot;A Spiral Model of Software Development and Enhancement]&quot;. In: ''ACM SIGSOFT Software Engineering Notes'' (ACM) 11(4):14-24, August 1986&lt;/ref&gt;
* Each trip around the spiral traverses four basic quadrants: (1) determine objectives, alternatives, and constraints of the iteration; (2) evaluate alternatives; Identify and resolve risks; (3) develop and verify deliverables from the iteration; and (4) plan the next iteration.&lt;ref name=BB86/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard H. Thayer, Barry W. Boehm (1986). ''Tutorial: software engineering project management''. Computer Society Press of the IEEE. p.130&lt;/ref&gt;
* Begin each cycle with an identification of stakeholders and their win conditions, and end each cycle with review and commitment.&lt;ref&gt;Barry W. Boehm (2000). ''Software cost estimation with Cocomo II: Volume 1''.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rapid application development ===
Rapid application development (RAD) is a software development methodology, which involves iterative development and the construction of prototypes. Rapid application development is a term originally used to describe a software development process introduced by James Martin in 1991.

The basic principles are:&lt;ref name=CMS08/&gt;
* Key objective is for fast development and delivery of a high quality system at a relatively low investment cost.
* Attempts to reduce inherent project risk by breaking a project into smaller segments and providing more ease-of-change during the development process.
* Aims to produce high quality systems quickly, primarily via iterative Prototyping (at any stage of development), active user involvement, and computerized development tools. These tools may include Graphical User Interface (GUI) builders, Computer Aided Software Engineering (CASE) tools, Database Management Systems (DBMS), fourth-generation programming languages, code generators, and object-oriented techniques.
* Key emphasis is on fulfilling the business need, while technological or engineering excellence is of lesser importance.
* Project control involves prioritizing development and defining delivery deadlines or “timeboxes”. If the project starts to slip, emphasis is on reducing requirements to fit the timebox, not in increasing the deadline.
* Generally includes joint application design (JAD), where users are intensely involved in system design, via consensus building in either structured workshops, or electronically facilitated interaction.
* Active user involvement is imperative.
* Iteratively produces production software, as opposed to a throwaway prototype.
* Produces documentation necessary to facilitate future development and maintenance.
* Standard systems analysis and design methods can be fitted into this framework.

=== Other practices ===
Other methodology practices include:
* Object-oriented development methodologies, such as Grady Booch's object-oriented design (OOD), also known as object-oriented analysis and design (OOAD). The Booch model includes six diagrams: class, object, state transition, interaction, module, and process.&lt;ref&gt;Georges Gauthier Merx &amp; Ronald J. Norman (2006). ''Unified Software Engineering with Java''. p.201.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Top-down programming: evolved in the 1970s by IBM researcher Harlan Mills (and Niklaus Wirth) in developed structured programming.
* Unified Process (UP) is an iterative software development methodology framework, based on Unified Modeling Language (UML). UP organizes the development of software into four phases, each consisting of one or more executable iterations of the software at that stage of development: inception, elaboration, construction, and guidelines. Many tools and products exist to facilitate UP implementation. One of the more popular versions of UP is the Rational Unified Process (RUP).
* Agile software development refers to a group of software development methodologies based on iterative development, where requirements and solutions evolve via collaboration between self-organizing cross-functional teams. The term was coined in the year 2001 when the Agile Manifesto was formulated.
* Integrated software development refers to a deliverable based software development framework using the three primary IT (project management, software development, software testing) life cycles that can be leveraged using multiple (iterative, waterfall, spiral, agile) software development approaches, where requirements and solutions evolve via collaboration between self-organizing cross-functional teams.

== Subtopics ==
=== View model ===
[[File:TEAF Matrix of Views and Perspectives.jpg|thumb|360px|The TEAF Matrix of Views and Perspectives.]]
A view model is framework which provides the viewpoints on the system and its environment, to be used in the software development process. It is a graphical representation of the underlying semantics of a view.

The purpose of viewpoints and views is to enable human engineers to comprehend very complex systems, and to organize the elements of the problem and the solution around domains of expertise. In the engineering of physically intensive systems, viewpoints often correspond to capabilities and responsibilities within the engineering organization.&lt;ref name=&quot;NIST2003&quot;&gt;Edward J. Barkmeyer ea (2003). [http://www.mel.nist.gov/msidlibrary/doc/AMIS-Concepts.pdf ''Concepts for Automating Systems Integration''] NIST 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most complex system specifications are so extensive that no one individual can fully comprehend all aspects of the specifications. Furthermore, we all have different interests in a given system and different reasons for examining the system's specifications. A business executive will ask different questions of a system make-up than would a system implementer. The concept of viewpoints framework, therefore, is to provide separate viewpoints into the specification of a given complex system. These viewpoints each satisfy an audience with interest in some set of aspects of the system. Associated with each viewpoint is a viewpoint language
that optimizes the vocabulary and presentation for the audience of that viewpoint.

=== Business process and data modelling ===
Graphical representation of the current state of information provides a very effective means for presenting information to both users and system developers.
[[Image:Process and data modeling.jpg|thumb|360px|example of the interaction between business process and data models.&lt;ref name=SS93/&gt;]]
* A business model illustrates the functions associated with the business process being modeled and the organizations that perform these functions. By depicting activities and information flows, a foundation is created to visualize, define, understand, and validate the nature of a process.
* A data model provides the details of information to be stored, and is of primary use when the final product is the generation of computer software code for an application or the preparation of a functional specification to aid a computer software make-or-buy decision. See the figure on the right for an example of the interaction between business process and data models.&lt;ref name=&quot;SS93&quot;&gt;Paul R. Smith &amp; Richard Sarfaty (1993). [http://www.osti.gov/energycitations/servlets/purl/10160331-YhIRrY/ Creating a strategic plan for configuration management using Computer Aided Software Engineering (CASE) tools.] Paper For 1993 National DOE/Contractors and Facilities CAD/CAE User's Group.&lt;/ref&gt;

Usually, a model is created after conducting an interview, referred to as business analysis. The interview consists of a facilitator asking a series of questions designed to extract required information that describes a process. The interviewer is called a facilitator to emphasize that it is the participants who provide the information. The facilitator should have some knowledge of the process of interest, but this is not as important as having a structured methodology by which the questions are asked of the process expert. The methodology is
important because usually a team of facilitators is collecting information across the facility and the results of the information from all the interviewers must fit together once completed.&lt;ref name=SS93/&gt;

The models are developed as defining either the current state of the process, in which case the final product is called the &quot;as-is&quot; snapshot model, or a collection of ideas of what the process should contain, resulting in a &quot;what-can-be&quot; model. Generation of process and data models can be used to determine if the existing processes and information systems are sound and only need minor modifications or enhancements, or if re-engineering is required as a corrective action. The creation of business models is more than a way to view or automate your information process. Analysis can be used to fundamentally reshape the way your business or organization conducts its operations.&lt;ref name=SS93/&gt;

=== Computer-aided software engineering ===
Computer-aided software engineering (CASE), in the field software engineering is the scientific application of a set of tools and methods to a software which results in high-quality, defect-free, and maintainable software products.&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, D.L (1989). &quot;Selecting and effectively using a computer aided software engineering tool&quot;. Annual Westinghouse computer symposium; 6-7 Nov 1989; Pittsburgh, PA (USA); DOE Project.&lt;/ref&gt; It also refers to methods for the development of information systems together with automated tools that can be used in the software development process.&lt;ref&gt;P. Loucopoulos and V. Karakostas (1995). ''System Requirements Engineering''. McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; The term &quot;computer-aided software engineering&quot; (CASE) can refer to the software used for the automated development of systems software, i.e., computer code. The CASE functions include analysis, design, and programming. CASE tools automate methods for designing, documenting, and producing structured computer code in the desired programming language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.its.bldrdoc.gov/projects/devglossary/_case.html CASE] definition In: ''[http://www.its.bldrdoc.gov/projects/devglossary/ Telecom Glossary 2000]. Retrieved 26 Oct 2008.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Two key ideas of Computer-aided Software System Engineering (CASE) are:&lt;ref&gt;K. Robinson (1992). ''Putting the Software Engineering into CASE''. New York : John Wiley and Sons Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Foster computer assistance in software development and or software maintenance processes, and
* An engineering approach to software development and or maintenance.

Typical CASE tools exist for configuration management, data modeling, model transformation, refactoring, source code generation, and Unified Modeling Language.

=== Integrated development environment ===
[[Image:Anjuta-2.0.0-2.png|thumb|360px|Anjuta, a C and C++ IDE for the GNOME environment]]
An integrated development environment (IDE) also known as ''integrated design environment'' or ''integrated debugging environment'' is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development. An IDE normally consists of a:
* source code editor,
* compiler and/or interpreter,
* build automation tools, and
* debugger (usually).
IDEs are designed to maximize programmer productivity by providing tight-knit components with similar user interfaces. Typically an IDE is dedicated to a specific programming language, so as to provide a feature set which most closely matches the programming paradigms of the language.

=== Modeling language ===
A modeling language is any artificial language that can be used to express information or knowledge or systems in a structure that is defined by a consistent set of rules. The rules are used for interpretation of the meaning of components in the structure. A modeling language can be graphical or textual.&lt;ref&gt;Xiao He (2007). &quot;A metamodel for the notation of graphical modeling languages&quot;. In: ''Computer Software and Applications Conference, 2007. COMPSAC 2007 - Vol. 1. 31st Annual International'', Volume 1, Issue , 24–27 July 2007, pp 219-224.&lt;/ref&gt; Graphical modeling languages use a diagram techniques with named symbols that represent concepts and lines that connect the symbols and that represent relationships and various other graphical annotation to represent constraints. Textual modeling languages typically use standardised keywords accompanied by parameters to make computer-interpretable expressions.

Example of graphical modelling languages in the field of software engineering are:
* Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN, and the XML form BPML) is an example of a process modeling language.
* EXPRESS and EXPRESS-G (ISO 10303-11) is an international standard general-purpose data modeling language.
* Extended Enterprise Modeling Language (EEML) is commonly used for business process modeling across layers.
* Flowchart is a schematic representation of an algorithm or a stepwise process,
* Fundamental Modeling Concepts (FMC) modeling language for software-intensive systems.
* IDEF is a family of modeling languages, the most notable of which include IDEF0 for functional modeling, IDEF1X for information modeling, and IDEF5 for modeling ontologies.
* LePUS3 is an object-oriented visual Design Description Language and a formal specification language that is suitable primarily for modelling large object-oriented (Java, [[C++]], [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]]) programs and design patterns.
* Specification and Description Language(SDL) is a specification language targeted at the unambiguous specification and description of the behaviour of reactive and distributed systems.
* Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a general-purpose modeling language that is an industry standard for specifying software-intensive systems. UML 2.0, the current version, supports thirteen different diagram techniques, and has widespread tool support.

Not all modeling languages are executable, and for those that are, using them doesn't necessarily mean that programmers are no longer needed. On the contrary, executable modeling languages are intended to amplify the productivity of skilled programmers, so that they can address more difficult problems, such as parallel computing and distributed systems.

=== Programming paradigm ===
A programming paradigm is a fundamental style of computer programming, in contrast to a software engineering methodology, which is a style of solving specific software engineering problems. Paradigms differ in the concepts and abstractions used to represent the elements of a program (such as objects, functions, variables, constraints...) and the steps that compose a computation (assignation, evaluation, continuations, data flows...).

A programming language can support multiple paradigms. For example programs written in C++ or Object Pascal can be purely procedural, or purely object-oriented, or contain elements of both paradigms. Software designers and programmers decide how to use those paradigm elements. In object-oriented programming, programmers can think of a program as a collection of interacting objects, while in functional programming a program can be thought of as a sequence of stateless function evaluations. When programming computers or systems with many processors, process-oriented programming allows programmers to think about applications as sets of concurrent processes acting upon logically shared data structures.

Just as different groups in software engineering advocate different ''methodologies'', different programming languages advocate different ''programming paradigms''. Some languages are designed to support one paradigm (Smalltalk supports object-oriented programming, Haskell supports functional programming), while other programming languages support multiple paradigms (such as Object Pascal, C++, C#, Visual Basic, Common Lisp, Scheme, Python, Ruby, and Oz).

Many programming paradigms are as well known for what methods they ''forbid'' as for what they enable. For instance, pure functional programming forbids using side-effects; structured programming forbids using goto statements. Partly for this reason, new paradigms are often regarded as doctrinaire or overly rigid by those accustomed to earlier styles.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} Avoiding certain methods can make it easier to prove theorems about a program's correctness, or simply to understand its behavior.

=== Software framework ===
A software framework is a re-usable design for a software system or subsystem. A software framework may include support programs, code libraries, a scripting language, or other software to help develop and ''glue together'' the different components of a software project. Various parts of the framework may be exposed via an API.

=== Software development process ===
A software development process is a framework imposed on the development of a software product.  Synonyms include software life cycle and ''software process''.  There are several models for such processes, each describing approaches to a variety of tasks or activities that take place during the process.

A largely growing body of software development organizations implement process methodologies. Many of them are in the defense industry, which in the U.S. requires a rating based on 'process models' to obtain contracts. The international standard describing the method to select, implement and monitor the life cycle for software is ISO 12207.

A decades-long goal has been to find repeatable, predictable processes that improve productivity and quality. Some try to systematize or formalize the seemingly unruly task of writing software. Others apply project management methods to writing software. Without project management, software projects can easily be delivered late or over budget. With large numbers of software projects not meeting their expectations in terms of functionality, cost, or delivery schedule, effective project management appears to be lacking.

== UML Models and Diagrams ==
The Unified Modeling Language is a standardized general-purpose modeling language and nowadays is managed as a de facto industry standard by the Object Management Group (OMG).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.omg.org/ Object Management Group&lt;/ref&gt;  UML includes a set of graphic notation techniques to create visual models of software-intensive systems.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Unified_Modeling_Language&amp;oldid=413683022 Unified Modeling Language&lt;/ref&gt;

=== History ===
UML was invented by the ''Three Amigos'': James Rumbaugh, Grady Booch and Ivar Jacobson. 
After Rational Software Corporation hired James Rumbaugh from General Electric in 1994, the company became the source for the two most popular object-oriented modeling approaches of the day: Rumbaugh's Object-modeling technique (OMT), which was better for object-oriented analysis (OOA), and Grady Booch's Booch method, which was better for object-oriented design (OOD). They were soon assisted in their efforts by Ivar Jacobson, the creator of the object-oriented software engineering (OOSE) method. Jacobson joined Rational in 1995, after his company, Objectory AB,&lt;ref&gt;Objectory AB, known as Objectory System, was founded in 1987 by Ivar Jacobson. In 1991, It was acquired and became a subsidiary of Ericsson.&lt;/ref&gt; was acquired by Rational. 

=== Definition ===
The Unified Modeling Language (UML) is used to specify, visualize, modify, construct and document the artifacts of an object-oriented software-intensive system under development.&lt;ref name=&quot;Foldoc01&quot;&gt; [[Wikipedia:FOLDOC]] (2001). [http://foldoc.org/index.cgi?query=UML&amp;action=Search Unified Modeling Language] last updated 2002-01-03. Accessed 6 feb 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; UML offers a standard way to visualize a system's architectural blueprints, including elements such as activities, actors, business processes, database schemas, components, programming language statements, and reusable software components.&lt;ref name = &quot;OMG00&quot;&gt; Grady Booch, Ivar Jacobson &amp; Jim Rumbaugh (2000) [http://www.omg.org/docs/formal/00-03-01.pdf OMG Unified Modeling Language Specification], Version 1.3 First Edition: March 2000. Retrieved 12 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; 

UML combines techniques from data modeling (entity relationship diagrams), business modeling (work flows), object modeling, and component modeling. It can be used with all processes, throughout the software development life cycle, and across different implementation technologies.&lt;ref&gt;
Satish Mishra (1997). [http://www2.informatik.hu-berlin.de/~hs/Lehre/2004-WS_SWQS/20050107_Ex_UML.ppt &quot;Visual Modeling &amp; Unified Modeling Language (UML) : Introduction to UML&quot;]. Rational Software Corporation. Accessed 9 Nov 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Models and Diagrams ===
It is important to distinguish between the UML model and the set of diagrams of a system. A diagram is a partial graphic representation of a system's model. The model also contains documentation that drive the model elements and diagrams. 

UML diagrams represent two different views of a system model &lt;ref&gt;Jon Holt Institution of Electrical Engineers (2004). ''UML for Systems Engineering: Watching the Wheels'' IET, 2004, ISBN 0863413544. p.58&lt;/ref&gt;:
* Static (or structural) view: emphasizes the static structure of the system using objects, attributes, operations and relationships. The structural view includes class diagrams and composite structure diagrams.
* Dynamic (or behavioral) view: emphasizes the dynamic behavior of the system by showing collaborations among objects and changes to the internal states of objects. This view includes sequence diagrams, activity diagrams and state machine diagrams.

=== Diagrams Overview ===
In UML 2.2 there are 14 types of diagrams divided into two categories.&lt;ref&gt;''UML Superstructure Specification Version 2.2''. OMG, February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Seven diagram types represent structural information, and the other seven represent general types of behavior, including four that represent different aspects of interactions.  These diagrams can be categorized hierarchically as shown in the following diagram:
[[File:Uml diagram2.png|center|Hierarchy of UML 2.2 Diagrams, shown as a class diagram.]]


==== Structure Diagrams ====
Structure diagrams emphasize the things that must be present in the system being modeled. Since structure diagrams represent the structure, they are used extensively in documenting the software architecture of software systems.
* Class diagram: describes the structure of a system by showing the system's classes, their attributes, and the relationships among the classes.
* Component diagram: describes how a software system is split up into components and shows the dependencies among these components.
* Composite structure diagram: describes the internal structure of a class and the collaborations that this structure makes possible.
* Deployment diagram: describes the hardware used in system implementations and the execution environments and artifacts deployed on the hardware.
* Object diagram: shows a complete or partial view of the structure of a modeled system at a specific time.
* Package diagram: describes how a system is split up into logical groupings by showing the dependencies among these groupings.
* Profile diagram: operates at the metamodel level to show stereotypes as classes with the &lt;&lt;stereotype&gt;&gt; stereotype, and profiles as packages with the &lt;&lt;profile&gt;&gt; stereotype. The extension relation (solid line with closed, filled arrowhead) indicates what metamodel element a given stereotype is extending.

==== Behaviour Diagrams ====
Behavior diagrams emphasize what must happen in the system being modeled. Since behavior diagrams illustrate the behavior of a system, they are used extensively to describe the functionality of software systems.
* Use case diagram: describes the functionality provided by a system in terms of actors, their goals represented as use cases, and any dependencies among those use cases.
* Activity diagram: describes the business and operational step-by-step workflows of components in a system. An activity diagram shows the overall flow of control.
* state machine diagram: describes the states and state transitions of the system.

==== Interaction Diagrams ====
Interaction diagrams, a subset of behaviour diagrams, emphasize the flow of control and data among the things in the system being modeled:
* Sequence diagram: shows how objects communicate with each other in terms of a sequence of messages. Also indicates the lifespans of objects relative to those messages.
* Communication diagram: shows the interactions between objects or parts in terms of sequenced messages. They represent a combination of information taken from Class, Sequence, and Use Case Diagrams describing both the static structure and dynamic behavior of a system.
* Interaction overview diagram: provides an overview in which the nodes represent communication diagrams.
* Timing diagrams: a specific type of interaction diagram where the focus is on timing constraints.

=== UML Modelling Tools ===
To draw UML diagrams, all you need is a pencil and a piece of paper.  However, for a software engineer that seems a little outdated, hence most of us will use tools.  The simplest tools are simply drawing programs, like Visio or Dia.  The diagrams generated this way look nice, but are not really that useful, since they do not include the code generation feature.  

Hence, when deciding on a UML modelling tool (sometimes also called CASE tool)&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_software_engineering Computer-aided software engineering&lt;/ref&gt; you should make sure, that it allows for code generation and even better, it should also allow for reverse engineering.  Combined, these two are also referred to as round-trip engineering.  Any serious tool should be able to do that.  Finally, UML models can be exchanged among UML tools by using the XMI interchange format, hence you should check that your tool of choice supports this.

Since the Rational Software Corporation so to say 'invented' UML, the most well-known UML modelling tool is IBM Rational Rose. Other tools include Rational Rhapsody, MagicDraw UML, StarUML, ArgoUML, Umbrello, BOUML, PowerDesigner, Visio and Dia. Some of popular development environments also offer UML modelling tools, i. e. Eclipse, NetBeans, and Visual Studio. &lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Unified_Modeling_Language_tools List of Unified Modeling Language Tools&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">First we need to  take a brief look at the big piture.  The software development process is a structure imposed on the development of a software product. It is made up of a set of activities and steps with the goal to find repeatable, predictable processes that improve productivity and quality.

== Software Development Activities ==
[[File:SDLC - Software Development Life Cycle.jpg|thumb|Model of the Systems Development Life Cycle]]
[[File:CPT-SystemLifeSycle.svg|thumb|240px|Model of the Systems Development Life Cycle]]
The software development process consists of a set of activities and steps, which are
* Requirements
* Specification
* Architecture
* Design
* Implementation
* Testing
* Deployment
* Maintenance

=== Planning ===
The important task in creating a software product is extracting the requirements or requirements analysis. Customers typically have an abstract idea of what they want as an end result, but not what software should do. Incomplete, ambiguous, or even contradictory requirements are recognized by skilled and experienced software engineers at this point. Frequently demonstrating live code may help reduce the risk that the requirements are incorrect.

Once the general requirements are gathered from the client, an analysis of the scope of the development should be determined and clearly stated.  This is often called a scope document.

Certain functionality may be out of scope of the project as a function of cost or as a result of unclear requirements at the start of development. If the development is done externally, this document can be considered a legal document so that if there are ever disputes, any ambiguity of what was promised to the client can be clarified.

=== Implementation, Testing and Documenting ===
Implementation is the part of the process where software engineers actually program the code for the project.

Software testing is an integral and important part of the software development process. This part of the process ensures that defects are recognized as early as possible.

Documenting the internal design of software for the purpose of future maintenance and enhancement is done throughout development. This may also include the writing of an API, be it external or internal. It is very important to document everything in the project.

=== Deployment and Maintenance ===
Deployment starts after the code is appropriately tested, is approved for release and sold or otherwise distributed into a production environment.

Software Training and Support is important and a lot of developers fail to realize that. It would not matter how much time and planning a development team puts into creating software if nobody in an organization ends up using it. People are often resistant to change and avoid venturing into an unfamiliar area, so as a part of the deployment phase, it is very important to have training classes for new clients of your software.

Maintaining and enhancing software to cope with newly discovered problems or new requirements can take far more time than the initial development of the software. It may be necessary to add code that does not fit the original design to correct an unforeseen problem or it may be that a customer is requesting more functionality and code can be added to accommodate their requests. If the labor cost of the maintenance phase exceeds 25% of the prior-phases' labor cost, then it is likely that the overall quality of at least one prior phase is poor.  In that case, management should consider the option of rebuilding the system (or portions) before maintenance cost is out of control.

[[File:CPT-SystemLifeSycle.svg|thumb|240px|Model of the Systems Development Life Cycle]]
The '''Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC)''', or ''Software Development Life Cycle'' in systems engineering, information systems and software engineering, is the process of creating or altering systems, and the models and methodologies that people use to develop these systems. The concept generally refers to computer or information systems.

In software engineering the SDLC concept underpins many kinds of software development methodologies. These methodologies form the framework for planning and controlling the creation of an information system&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cms.hhs.gov/SystemLifecycleFramework/Downloads/SelectingDevelopmentApproach.pdf SELECTING A DEVELOPMENT APPROACH]. Retrieved 27 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;: the software development process.

== Overview ==
Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a process used by a systems analyst to develop an information system, including requirements,  validation, training, and user (stakeholder) ownership. Any SDLC should result in a high quality system that meets or exceeds customer expectations, reaches completion within time and cost estimates, works effectively and efficiently in the current and planned Information Technology infrastructure, and is inexpensive to maintain and cost-effective to enhance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://foldoc.org/foldoc.cgi?Systems+Development+Life+Cycle &quot;Systems Development Life Cycle&quot;]. In: Foldoc(2000-12-24)&lt;/ref&gt;

Computer systems are complex and often (especially with the recent rise of Service-Oriented Architecture) link multiple traditional systems potentially supplied by different software vendors. To manage this level of complexity, a number of SDLC models have been created: &quot;waterfall&quot;; &quot;fountain&quot;; &quot;spiral&quot;; &quot;build and fix&quot;; &quot;rapid prototyping&quot;; &quot;incremental&quot;; and &quot;synchronize and stabilize&quot;. &lt;ref&gt; http://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:bfhOl8jp1S8J:condor.depaul.edu/~jpetlick/extra/394/Session2.ppt+&amp;hl=en&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEEShCfW0_MLC4wRbczfUxrndHTkbwguF9fZuaUCe0RDyOCWyO2PTmaPhHnZ4jRhZZ75maVO_7gVAD2ex5-QIhrj1683hMefBNkak7FkQJCAwd-i0-_aQfEVEEKP177h4mmkvMMWJ7&amp;sig=AHIEtbRhMlZ-TUyioKEhLQQxXk1WoSJXWA &lt;/ref&gt;

SDLC models can be described along a spectrum of agile to iterative to sequential. Agile methodologies, such as XP and Scrum, focus on light-weight processes which allow for rapid changes along the development cycle.  Iterative methodologies, such as Rational Unified Process and Dynamic Systems Development Method, focus on limited project scopes and expanding or improving products by multiple iterations. Sequential or big-design-up-front (BDUF) models, such as Waterfall, focus on complete and correct planning to guide large projects and risks to successful and predictable results {{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}. Other models, such as Anamorphic Development, tend to focus on a form of development that is guided by project scope and adaptive iterations of feature development.

In project management a project can be defined both with a project life cycle (PLC) and an SDLC, during which slightly different activities occur. According to Taylor (2004) &quot;the project life cycle encompasses all the activities of the project, while the systems development life cycle focuses on realizing the product requirements&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;James Taylor (2004). ''Managing Information Technology Projects''. p.39..&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The '''Systems  Life Cycle (SLC)''' is a type of methodology used to describe the process for building information systems, intended to develop information systems in a very deliberate, structured and methodical way, reiterating each stage of the life cycle. The systems development life cycle, according to Elliott &amp; Strachan &amp; Radford (2004), &quot;originated in the 1960s,to develop large scale functional business systems in an age of large scale business conglomerates. Information systems activities revolved around heavy data processing and number crunching routines&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ell04&quot;&gt;Geoffrey Elliott &amp; Josh Strachan (2004) ''Global Business Information Technology''. p.87.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several systems development frameworks have been partly based on SDLC, such as the Structured Systems Analysis and Design Method (SSADM) produced for the UK government Office of Government Commerce in the 1980s. Ever since, according to Elliott (2004), &quot;the traditional life cycle approaches to systems development have been increasingly replaced with alternative approaches and frameworks, which attempted to overcome some of the inherent deficiencies of the traditional SDLC&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ell04&quot;/&gt;

== Systems development phases ==
The System Development Life Cycle framework provides a sequence of activities for system designers and developers to follow. It consists of a set of steps or phases in which each phase of the SDLC uses the results of the previous one.

A Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC) adheres to important phases that are essential for developers, such as planning, analysis, design, and implementation, and are explained in the section below. A number of system development life cycle (SDLC) models have been created: waterfall, fountain, spiral, build and fix, rapid prototyping, incremental, and synchronize and stabilize. The oldest of these, and the best known, is the waterfall model: a sequence of stages in which the output of each stage becomes the input for the next. These stages can be characterized and divided up in different ways, including the following&lt;ref&gt;http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/71151/System_Development_Life_Cycle&lt;/ref&gt;:

* '''Project planning, feasibility study''': Establishes a high-level view of the intended project and determines its goals.
* '''Systems analysis, requirements definition''': Refines project goals into defined functions and operation of the intended application. Analyzes end-user information needs.
* '''Systems design''': Describes desired features and operations in detail, including screen layouts, business rules, process diagrams, pseudocode and other documentation.
* '''Implementation''': The real code is written here.
* '''Integration and testing''': Brings all the pieces together into a special testing environment, then checks for errors, bugs and interoperability.
* '''Acceptance, installation, deployment''': The final stage of initial development, where the software is put into production and runs actual business.
* '''Maintenance''': What happens during the rest of the software's life: changes, correction, additions, moves to a different computing platform and more. This, the least glamorous and perhaps most important step of all, goes on seemingly forever.

In the following example (see picture) these stage of the Systems Development Life Cycle are divided in ten steps from definition to creation and modification of IT work products:

[[Image:Systems Development Life Cycle.jpg|thumb|720px|center| The tenth phase occurs when the system is disposed of and the task performed is either eliminated or transferred to other systems. The tasks and work products for each phase are described in subsequent chapters. &lt;ref name = &quot;US DJ03&quot;&gt; US Department of Justice (2003). [http://www.usdoj.gov/jmd/irm/lifecycle/ch1.htm INFORMATION RESOURCES MANAGEMENT] Chapter 1. Introduction.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Not every project will require that the phases be sequentially executed. However, the phases are interdependent. Depending upon the size and complexity of the project, phases may be combined or may overlap.&lt;ref name = &quot;US DJ03&quot;/&gt;

=== System analysis ===
The goal of system analysis is to determine where the problem is in an attempt to fix the system. This step involves breaking down the system in different pieces to analyze the situation, analyzing project goals, breaking down what needs to be created and attempting to engage users so that definite requirements can be defined. 

Requirements analysis sometimes requires individuals/teams from client as well as service provider sides to get detailed and accurate requirements; often there has to be a lot of communication to and from to understand these requirements. Requirement gathering is the most crucial aspect as many times communication gaps arise in this phase and this leads to validation errors and bugs in the software program.

=== Design ===
In systems design the design functions and operations are described in detail, including screen layouts, business rules, process diagrams and other documentation. The output of this stage will describe the new system as a collection of modules or subsystems.

The design stage takes as its initial input the requirements identified in the approved requirements document. For each requirement, a set of one or more design elements will be produced as a result of interviews, workshops, and/or
prototype efforts. 

Design elements describe the desired software features in detail, and generally include functional hierarchy diagrams, screen layout diagrams, tables of business rules, business process diagrams, pseudocode, and a complete entity-relationship diagram with a full data dictionary. These design elements are intended to describe the software in sufficient detail that skilled programmers may develop the software with minimal additional input design.

=== Implementation ===
Modular and subsystem programming code will be accomplished during this stage. Unit testing and module testing are done in this stage by the developers. This stage is intermingled with the next in that individual modules will need testing before integration to the main project.

=== Testing ===
The code is tested at various levels in software testing. Unit, system and user acceptance testings are often performed.  This is a grey area as many different opinions exist as to what the stages of testing are and how much if any iteration occurs. Iteration is not generally part of the waterfall model, but usually some occur at this stage. In the testing the whole system is test one by one

Following are the types of testing:
* Defect testing
* Path testing
* Data set testing
* Unit testing
* System testing
* Integration testing
* Black box testing
* White box testing
* Regression testing
* Automation testing
* User acceptance testing
* Performance testing

=== Operations and maintenance ===
The deployment of the system includes changes and enhancements before the decommissioning or sunset of the system. Maintaining the system is an important aspect of SDLC.  As key personnel change positions in the organization, new changes will be implemented, which will require system updates.

== Systems Analysis and Design ==
The '''Systems Analysis and Design (SAD)''' is the process of developing Information Systems (IS) that effectively use of hardware, software, data, process, and people to support the company’s business objectives.

== Systems development life cycle topics ==
=== Management and control ===
[[Image:SDLC Phases Related to Management Controls.jpg|thumb|400px|SDLC Phases Related to Management Controls.&lt;ref name= &quot;USHR99&quot;&gt;U.S. House of Representatives (1999). [http://www.house.gov/cao-opp/PDFSolicitations/SDLCPOL.pdf ''Systems Development Life-Cycle Policy'']. p.13.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC) phases serve as a programmatic guide to project activity and provide a flexible but consistent way to conduct projects to a depth matching the scope of the project. Each of the SDLC phase objectives are described in this section with key deliverables, a description of recommended tasks, and a summary of related control objectives for effective management. It is critical for the project manager to establish and monitor control objectives during each SDLC phase while executing projects. Control objectives help to provide a clear statement of the desired result or purpose and should be used throughout the entire SDLC process. Control objectives can be grouped into major categories (Domains), and relate to the SDLC phases as shown in the figure.&lt;ref name= &quot;USHR99&quot;/&gt;

To manage and control any SDLC initiative, each project will be required to establish some degree of a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) to capture and schedule the work necessary to complete the project. The WBS and all programmatic material should be kept in the “Project Description” section of the project notebook. The WBS format is mostly left to the project manager to establish in a way that best describes the project work. There are some key areas that must be defined in the WBS as part of the SDLC policy. The following diagram describes three key areas that will be addressed in the WBS in a manner established by the project manager.&lt;ref name= &quot;USHR99&quot;/&gt;

=== Work breakdown structured organization ===
[[Image:SDLC Work Breakdown Structure.jpg|thumb|400px|Work Breakdown Structure.&lt;ref name= &quot;USHR99&quot;/&gt;]]
The upper section of the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) should identify the major phases and milestones of the project in a summary fashion. In addition, the upper section should provide an overview of the full scope and timeline of the project and will be part of the initial project description effort leading to project approval. The middle section of the WBS is based on the seven Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC) phases as a guide for WBS task development. The WBS elements should consist of milestones and “tasks” as opposed to “activities” and have a definitive period (usually two weeks or more). Each task must have a measurable output (e.x. document, decision, or analysis). A WBS task may rely on one or more activities (e.g. software engineering, systems engineering) and may require close coordination with other tasks, either internal or external to the project. Any part of the project needing support from contractors should have a Statement of work (SOW) written to include the appropriate tasks from the SDLC phases. The development of a SOW does not occur during a specific phase of SDLC but is developed to include the work from the SDLC process that may be conducted by external resources such as contractors and struct.&lt;ref name= &quot;USHR99&quot;/&gt;

=== Baselines in the SDLC ===
Baselines are an important part of the Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC). These baselines are established after four of the five phases of the SDLC and are critical to the iterative nature of the model .&lt;ref&gt;Blanchard, B. S., &amp; Fabrycky, W. J.(2006) ''Systems engineering and analysis'' (4th ed.) New Jersey: Prentice Hall. p.31&lt;/ref&gt; Each baseline is considered as a milestone in the SDLC.

* Functional Baseline: established after the conceptual design phase.
* Allocated Baseline: established after the preliminary design phase.
* Product Baseline: established after the detail design and development phase.
* Updated Product Baseline: established after the production construction phase.

=== Complementary to SDLC ===
Complementary Software development methods to Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC) are:
* Software Prototyping
* Joint Applications Design (JAD)
* Rapid Application Development (RAD)
* Extreme Programming (XP); extension of earlier work in Prototyping and RAD.
* Open Source Development
* End-user development
* Object Oriented Programming

== Strengths and weaknesses ==
Few people in the modern computing world would use a strict waterfall model for their Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC) as many modern methodologies have superseded this thinking. Some will argue that the SDLC no longer applies to models like Agile computing, but it is still a term widely in use in Technology circles. The SDLC practice has advantages in traditional models of software development, that lends itself more to a structured environment. The disadvantages to using the SDLC methodology is when there is need for iterative development or (i.e. web development or e-commerce) where stakeholders need to review on a regular basis the software being designed. Instead of viewing SDLC from a strength or weakness perspective, it is far more important to take the best practices from the SDLC model and apply it to whatever may be most appropriate for the software being designed.

A comparison of the strengths and weaknesses of SDLC:

An alternative to the SDLC is Rapid Application Development, which combines prototyping, Joint Application Development and implementation of CASE tools. The advantages of RAD are speed, reduced development cost, and active user involvement in the development process.

The '''V-model''' represents a software development process (also applicable to hardware development) which may be considered an extension of the waterfall model. Instead of moving down in a linear way, the process steps are bent upwards after the coding phase, to form the typical V shape. The V-Model demonstrates the relationships between each phase of the development life cycle and its associated phase of testing. The horizontal and vertical axes represents time or project completeness (left-to-right) and level of abstraction (coarsest-grain abstraction uppermost), respectively.

== Verification Phases ==
=== Requirements analysis ===
In the Requirements analysis phase, the requirements of the proposed system are collected by analyzing the needs of the user(s). This phase is concerned about establishing what the ideal system has to perform. However it does not determine how the software will be designed or built. Usually, the users are interviewed and a document called the user requirements document is generated.

The user requirements document will typically describe the system’s functional, interface, performance, data, security, etc requirements as expected by the user. It is used by business analysts to communicate their understanding of the system to the users. The users carefully review this document as this document would serve as the guideline for the system designers in the system design phase. The user acceptance tests are designed in this phase. See also Functional requirements.
this is parallel processing

There are different methods for gathering requirements of both soft and hard methodologies including; interviews, questionnaires, document analysis, observation, throw-away prototypes, use cases and status and dynamic views with users.

=== System Design ===
Systems design is the phase where system engineers analyze and understand the business of the proposed system by studying the user requirements document. They figure out possibilities and techniques by which the user requirements can be implemented. If any of the requirements are not feasible, the user is informed of the issue. A resolution is found and the user requirement document is edited accordingly.

The software specification document which serves as a blueprint for the development phase is generated. This document contains the general system organization, menu structures, data structures etc. It may also hold example business scenarios, sample windows, reports for the better understanding. Other technical documentation like entity diagrams, data dictionary will also be produced in this phase. The documents for system testing are prepared in this phase.

===Architecture Design===
The phase of the design of computer architecture and software architecture can also be referred to as high-level design. The baseline in selecting the architecture is that it should realize all which typically consists of the list of modules, brief functionality of each module, their interface relationships, dependencies, database tables, architecture diagrams, technology details etc. The integration testing design is carried out  in the particular  phase.

===Module Design===
The module design phase can also be referred to as low-level design. The designed system is broken up into smaller units or modules and each of them is explained so that the programmer can start coding directly.
The low level design document or program specifications will contain a detailed functional logic of the module, in pseudocode:

* database tables, with all elements, including their type and size
* all interface details with complete API references
* all dependency issues
* error message listings
* complete input and outputs for a module.

The unit test design is developed in this stage.

== Validation Phases ==
===Unit Testing===
In computer programming, unit testing is a method by which individual units of source code are tested to determine if they are fit for use. A unit is the smallest testable part of an application. In procedural programming a unit may be an individual function or procedure. Unit tests are created by programmers or occasionally by white box testers. The purpose is to verify the internal logic code by testing every possible branch within the function, also known as test coverage. Static analysis tools are used to facilitate in this process, where variations of input data are passed to the function to test every possible case of execution.

===Integration Testing===
In integration testing the separate modules will be tested together to expose faults  in the interfaces and in the interaction between integrated components. Testing is usually  black box as the code is not directly checked for errors.

===System Testing===
System testing will compare the system specifications against the actual system.After the integration test is completed, the next test level is the system test. System testing checks if the integrated product meets the specified requirements. Why is this still necessary after the component and integration tests? The reasons for this are as follows:

====Reasons for system test====
#In the lower test levels, the testing was done against technical specifications, i.e., from the technical perspective of the software producer. The system test, though, looks at the system from the perspective of the customer and the future user. The testers validate whether the requirements are completely and appropriately met.
#*Example: The customer (who has ordered and paid for the system) and the user (who uses the system) can be different groups of people or organizations with their own specific interests and requirements of the system.
# Many functions and system characteristics result from the interaction of all system components, consequently, they are only visible on the level of the entire system and can only be observed and tested there.

===User Acceptance Testing===
Acceptance testing is the phase of testing used to determine whether a system satisfies the requirements specified in the requirements analysis phase. The acceptance test design is derived from the requirements document. The acceptance test phase is the phase used by the customer to determine whether to accept the system or not.

Acceptance testing helps
* to determine whether a system satisfies its acceptance criteria or not.
* to enable the customer to determine whether to accept the system or not.
* to test the software in the &quot;real world&quot; by the intended audience.
Purpose of acceptance testing:
* to verify the system or changes according to the original needs.

====Procedures ====
#Define the acceptance criteria:
#* Functionality requirements.
#* Performance requirements.
#* Interface quality requirements.
#* Overall software quality requirements.
#Develop an acceptance plan:
#* Project description.
#* User responsibilities.
#* Acceptance description.
#* Execute the acceptance test plan.

'''Agile software development''' is a group of software development methodologies based on iterative and incremental development, where requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration between self-organizing, cross-functional teams. The ''Agile Manifesto''&lt;ref name=&quot;Agile Manifesto&quot;&gt;{{Cite web
|url=http://agilemanifesto.org/
|title=Manifesto for Agile Software Development |year=2001 |publisher=Agile Alliance
|author=Beck, Kent |author2=et al.|authorlink=Kent Beck
|accessdate=2010-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; introduced the term in 2001.

==History==
=== Predecessors ===
[[File:Jeff Sutherland.JPG|thumb|upright|Jeff Sutherland, one of the developers of the Scrum agile software development process]]
Incremental software development methods have been traced back to 1957.&lt;ref name=&quot;craig2003&quot;/&gt; In 1974, a paper by E. A. Edmonds introduced an adaptive software development process.&lt;ref name=&quot;edmonds1974&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal| last=Edmonds| first=E. A.| title= A Process for the Development of Software for Nontechnical Users as an Adaptive System| journal=General Systems| volume=19| year=1974| pages=215–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

So-called &quot;lightweight&quot; software development methods evolved in the mid-1990s as a reaction against &quot;heavyweight&quot; methods, which were characterized by their critics as a heavily regulated, regimented, micromanaged, waterfall model of development. Proponents of lightweight methods (and now &quot;agile&quot; methods) contend that they are a return to development practices from early in the history of software development.&lt;ref name=&quot;craig2003&quot;&gt;Gerald M. Weinberg, as quoted in {{cite journal

|title=Iterative and Incremental Development: A Brief History
|journal=Computer |volume=36 |issue=6 |pages=47–56 |doi=10.1109/MC.2003.1204375 |ISSN=0018-9162 |accessdate=2007-02-22
|quote=We were doing incremental development as early as 1957, in Los Angeles, under the direction of Bernie Dimsdale [at IBM's ServiceBureau Corporation]. He was a colleague of John von Neumann, so perhaps he learned it there, or assumed it as totally natural. I do remember Herb Jacobs (primarily, though we all participated) developing a large simulation for Motorola, where the technique used was, as far as I can tell .... All of us, as far as I can remember, thought waterfalling of a huge project was rather stupid, or at least ignorant of the realities. I think what the waterfall description did for us was make us realize that we were doing something else, something unnamed except for 'software development.'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early implementations of lightweight methods include Scrum (1995), Crystal Clear, Extreme Programming (1996), Adaptive Software Development, Feature Driven Development, and Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM) (1995). These are now typically referred to as agile methodologies, after the Agile Manifesto published in 2001.&lt;ref name=Larman2004&gt;{{Cite book | last=Larman | first=Craig | year=2004 | title=Agile and Iterative Development: A Manager's Guide | publisher=Addison-Wesley | isbn=9780131111554 | page=27 | postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Agile Manifesto ===
In February 2001, 17 software developers&lt;ref&gt;Kent Beck, Mike Beedle, Arie van Bennekum, Alistair Cockburn, Ward Cunningham, Martin Fowler, James Grenning, Jim Highsmith, Andrew Hunt, Ron Jeffries, Jon Kern, Brian Marick, Robert C. Martin, Stephen J. Mellor, Ken Schwaber, Jeff Sutherland, and Dave Thomas&lt;/ref&gt; met at a ski resort in Snowbird, Utah, to discuss lightweight development methods. They published the &quot;Manifesto for Agile Software Development&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Agile Manifesto&quot;/&gt; to define the approach now known as agile software development. Some of the manifesto's authors formed the Agile Alliance, a nonprofit organization that promotes software development according to the manifesto's principles.

Agile Manifesto reads, in its entirety, as follows:&lt;ref name=&quot;Agile Manifesto&quot;/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value:

:'''Individuals and interactions''' over processes and tools
:'''Working software''' over comprehensive documentation
:'''Customer collaboration''' over contract negotiation
:'''Responding to change''' over following a plan

That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Twelve principles underlie the Agile Manifesto, including:&lt;ref name=&quot;manifestoprinciples&quot;&gt;{{Cite web
|url=http://www.agilemanifesto.org/principles.html
|title=Principles behind the Agile Manifesto|year=2001 |publisher=Agile Alliance
|author=Beck, Kent |author2=et al.
|accessdate=2010-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Customer satisfaction by rapid delivery of useful software
* Welcome changing requirements, even late in development
* Working software is delivered frequently (weeks rather than months)
* Working software is the principal measure of progress
* Sustainable development, able to maintain a constant pace
* Close, daily co-operation between business people and developers
* Face-to-face conversation is the best form of communication (co-location)
* Projects are built around motivated individuals, who should be trusted
* Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design
* Simplicity
* Self-organizing teams
* Regular adaptation to changing circumstances

In 2005, a group headed by Alistair Cockburn and Jim Highsmith wrote an addendum of project management principles, the Declaration of Interdependence,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://pmdoi.org
|authorlink=David Anderson |first=David |last=Anderson
|title=Declaration of Interdependence
|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; to guide software project management according to agile development methods.

==Characteristics==
 [[Image:Pair programming 1.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Pair programming, an XP development technique used by agile]]
There are many specific agile development methods. Most promote development, teamwork, collaboration, and process adaptability throughout the life-cycle of the project.

Agile methods break tasks into small increments with minimal planning, and do not directly involve long-term planning. Iterations are short time frames (timeboxes) that typically last from one to four weeks. Each iteration involves a team working through a full software development cycle including planning, requirements analysis, design, coding, unit testing, and acceptance testing when a working product is demonstrated to stakeholders. This minimizes overall risk and allows the project to adapt to changes quickly. Stakeholders produce documentation as required. An iteration may not add enough functionality to warrant a market release, but the goal is to have an available release (with minimal bugs) at the end of each iteration.&lt;ref name=&quot;embracing change&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|
last=Beck|first=Kent|
year=1999|title=Embracing Change with Extreme Programming|
journal=Computer|volume=32|issue=10|
pages=70–77|
doi=10.1109/2.796139}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multiple iterations may be required to release a product or new features.

Team composition in an agile project is usually cross-functional and self-organizing without consideration for any existing corporate hierarchy or the corporate roles of team members. Team members normally take responsibility for tasks that deliver the functionality an iteration requires. They decide individually how to meet an iteration's requirements.

Agile methods emphasize face-to-face communication over written documents when the team is all in the same location. Most agile teams work in a single open office (called a bullpen), which facilitates such communication. Team size is typically small (5-9 people) to simplify team communication and team collaboration. Larger development efforts may be delivered by multiple teams working toward a common goal or on different parts of an effort. This may require a co-ordination of priorities across teams. When a team works in different locations, they maintain daily contact through videoconferencing, voice, e-mail, etc.

No matter what development disciplines are required, each agile team will contain a customer representative. This person is appointed by stakeholders to act on their behalf and makes a personal commitment to being available for developers to answer mid-iteration problem-domain questions. At the end of each iteration, stakeholders and the customer representative review progress and re-evaluate priorities with a view to optimizing the return on investment (ROI) and ensuring alignment with customer needs and company goals.

Most agile implementations use a routine and formal daily face-to-face communication among team members. This specifically includes the customer representative and any interested stakeholders as observers. In a brief session, team members report to each other what they did the previous day, what they intend to do today, and what their roadblocks are. This face-to-face communication exposes problems as they arise.

Agile development emphasizes working software as the primary measure of progress. This, combined with the preference for face-to-face communication, produces less written documentation than other methods. The agile method encourages stakeholders to prioritize wants with other iteration outcomes based exclusively on business value perceived at the beginning of the iteration.

Specific tools and techniques such as continuous integration, automated or xUnit test, pair programming, test driven development, design patterns, domain-driven design, code refactoring and other techniques are often used to improve quality and enhance project agility.

==Comparison with other methods==
Agile methods are sometimes characterized as being at the opposite end of the spectrum from &quot;plan-driven&quot; or &quot;disciplined&quot; methods; agile teams may, however, employ highly disciplined formal methods.&lt;ref name=&quot;black2009&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal| last1=Black| first1=S. E.| last2=Boca.| first2=P. P.| last3=Bowen| first3=J. P.| last4=Gorman| first4=J.| last5= Hinchey| first5=M. G.| authorlink1=Sue Black (computer scientist)| authorlink3=Jonathan Bowen| authorlink5=Michael Hinchey| title= Formal versus agile: Survival of the fittest| journal=IEEE Computer| volume=49| number=9| month=September| year=2009| pages=39–45}}&lt;/ref&gt; A more accurate distinction is that methods exist on a continuum from &quot;adaptive&quot; to &quot;predictive&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;boehm2004App&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Boehm|first=B.|authorlink=Barry Boehm|coauthors=R. Turner|title=Balancing Agility and Discipline: A Guide for the Perplexed|publisher=Addison-Wesley|location=Boston, MA|year=2004|isbn=0-321-18612-5}} Appendix A, pages 165-194&lt;/ref&gt; Agile methods lie on the &quot;adaptive&quot; side of this continuum.
Adaptive methods focus on adapting quickly to changing realities. When the needs of a project change, an adaptive team changes as well. An adaptive team will have difficulty describing exactly what will happen in the future. The further away a date is, the more vague an adaptive method will be about what will happen on that date.  An adaptive team cannot report exactly what tasks are being done next week, but only which features are planned for next month. When asked about a release six months from now, an adaptive team may only be able to report the mission statement for the release, or a statement of expected value vs. cost.

Predictive methods, in contrast, focus on planning the future in detail. A predictive team can report exactly what features and tasks are planned for the entire length of the development process. Predictive teams have difficulty changing direction. The plan is typically optimized for the original destination and changing direction can require completed work to be started over. Predictive teams will often institute a change control board to ensure that only the most valuable changes are considered.

Formal methods, in contrast to adaptive and predictive methods, focus on computer science theory with a wide array of types of provers. A formal method attempts to prove the absence of errors with some level of determinism. Some formal methods are based on model checking and provide counter examples for code that cannot be proven. Generally, mathematical models (often supported through special languages see SPIN model checker) map to assertions about requirements. Formal methods are dependent on a tool driven approach, and may be combined with other development approaches. Some provers do not easily scale. Like agile methods, manifestos relevant to high integrity software have been proposed in [http://elsmar.com/pdf_files/A%20Manifesto%20for%20High-Integrity%20Software.pdf Crosstalk].

Agile methods have much in common with the &quot;Rapid Application Development&quot; techniques from the 1980/90s as espoused by James Martin and others.

==Agile methods==

Well-known agile software development methods include:
*Agile Modeling
*Agile Unified Process (AUP)
*Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM)
*Essential Unified Process (EssUP)
*Extreme Programming (XP)
*Feature Driven Development (FDD)
*Open Unified Process (OpenUP)
*Scrum
*Velocity tracking

===Method tailoring===
In the literature, different terms refer to the notion of method adaptation, including ‘method tailoring’, ‘method fragment adaptation’ and ‘situational method engineering’. Method tailoring is defined as:

&lt;blockquote&gt; A process or capability in which human agents through responsive changes in, and dynamic interplays between contexts, intentions, and method fragments determine a system development approach for a specific project situation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aydin2004&quot;&gt;Aydin, M.N., Harmsen, F., Slooten, K. v., &amp; Stagwee, R. A. (2004). An Agile Information Systems Development Method in use. ''Turk J Elec Engin, 12(2),'' 127-138&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Potentially, almost all agile methods are suitable for method tailoring. Even the DSDM method is being used for this purpose and has been successfully tailored in a CMM context.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abrahamsson2003&quot;&gt;Abrahamsson, P., Warsta, J., Siponen, M.T., &amp; Ronkainen, J. (2003). New Directions on Agile Methods: A Comparative Analysis. ''Proceedings of ICSE'03'', 244-254&lt;/ref&gt; Situation-appropriateness can be considered as a distinguishing characteristic between agile methods and traditional software development methods, with the latter being relatively much more rigid and prescriptive. The practical implication is that agile methods allow project teams to adapt working practices according to the needs of individual projects. Practices are concrete activities and products that are part of a method framework. At a more extreme level, the philosophy behind the method, consisting of a number of principles, could be adapted (Aydin, 2004).&lt;ref name=&quot;Aydin2004&quot; /&gt;

Extreme Programming (XP) makes the need for method adaptation explicit. One of the fundamental ideas of XP is that no one process fits every project, but rather that practices should be tailored to the needs of individual projects. Partial adoption of XP practices, as suggested by Beck, has been reported on several occasions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abrahamsson2002&quot;&gt;Abrahamsson, P., Salo, O., Ronkainen, J., &amp; Warsta, J. (2002). Agile Software Development Methods: Review and Analysis. ''VTT Publications 478''&lt;/ref&gt; A tailoring practice is proposed by [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1370143.1370149&amp;coll=ACM&amp;dl=ACM&amp;CFID=69442744&amp;CFTOKEN=96226775, Mehdi Mirakhorli] which provides sufficient roadmap and guideline for adapting all the practices. RDP Practice is designed for customizing XP. This practice, first proposed as a long research paper in the APSO workshop at the ICSE 2008 conference, is currently the only proposed and applicable method for customizing XP. Although it is specifically a solution for XP, this practice has the capability of extending to other methodologies. At first glance, this practice seems to be in the category of static method adaptation but experiences with RDP Practice says that it can be treated like dynamic method adaptation. The distinction between static method adaptation and dynamic method adaptation is subtle.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aydin2005&quot;&gt;Aydin, M.N., Harmsen, F., Slooten van K., &amp; Stegwee, R.A. (2005). On the Adaptation of An Agile Information(Suren) Systems Development Method. ''Journal of Database Management Special issue on Agile Analysis, Design, and Implementation, 16(4),'' 20-24&lt;/ref&gt; The key assumption behind static method adaptation is that the project context is given at the start of a project and remains fixed during project execution. The result is a static definition of the project context. Given such a definition, route maps can be used in order to determine which structured method fragments should be used for that particular project, based on predefined sets of criteria. Dynamic method adaptation, in contrast, assumes that projects are situated in an emergent context. An emergent context implies that a project has to deal with emergent factors that affect relevant conditions but are not predictable. This also means that a project context is not fixed, but changing during project execution. In such a case prescriptive route maps are not appropriate. The practical implication of dynamic method adaptation is that project managers often have to modify structured fragments or even innovate new fragments, during the execution of a project (Aydin et al., 2005).&lt;ref name=&quot;Aydin2005&quot; /&gt;

==Measuring agility==
While agility can be seen as a means to an end, a number of approaches have been proposed to quantify agility. Agility Index Measurements (AIM)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jroller.com/page/bokmann?entry=improving_your_processes_aim_high |title=David Bock's Weblog : Weblog |publisher=Jroller.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; score projects against a number of agility factors to achieve a total. The similarly-named Agility Measurement Index,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1185448.1185509 |title=Agility measurement index |publisher=Doi.acm.org |date= |accessdate=2010-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  scores developments against five dimensions of a software project (duration, risk, novelty, effort, and interaction). Other techniques are  based on measurable goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smr.co.uk/presentations/measure.pdf |title=Assessing Agility |author=Peter Lappo |coauthors=Henry C.T. Andrew |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2010-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another  study using fuzzy mathematics&lt;ref name=&quot;Kurian 2006&quot;&gt;Kurian, Tisni (2006). &quot;Agility Metrics: A Quantitative Fuzzy Based Approach for Measuring Agility of a Software Process&quot;  ''ISAM-Proceedings of International Conference on Agile Manufacturing'06(ICAM-2006)'', Norfolk, U.S.&lt;/ref&gt; has suggested that project velocity can be used as a metric of agility. There are agile self assessments to determine whether a team is using agile practices (Nokia test,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://agileconsortium.blogspot.com/2007/12/nokia-test.html |title=Nokia test, A Scrum specific test |author=Joe Little |publisher=Agileconsortium.blogspot.com |date=2007-12-02 |accessdate=2010-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Karlskrona test,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mark Seuffert, Piratson Technologies, Sweden |url=http://www.piratson.se/archive/Agile_Karlskrona_Test.html |title=Karlskrona test, A generic agile adoption test |publisher=Piratson.se |date= |accessdate=2010-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; 42 points test&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agile-software-development.com/2008/01/how-agile-are-you-take-this-42-point.html |title=How agile are you, A Scrum specific test |publisher=Agile-software-development.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

While such approaches have been proposed to measure agility, the practical application of such metrics has yet to be seen.

==Experience and reception==
One of the early studies reporting gains in quality, productivity, and business satisfaction by using Agile methods was a survey conducted by Shine Technologies from November 2002 to January 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=  http://www.shinetech.com/attachments/104_ShineTechAgileSurvey2003-01-17.pdf |title= Agile Methodologies Survey Results |date=2003 |month=January |publisher= [http://www.shinetech.com Shine Technologies] |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-06-03 |quote=95% [stated] that there was either no effect or a cost reduction . . . 93% stated that productivity was better or significantly better . . . 88% stated that quality was better or significantly better . . . 83% stated that business satisfaction was better or significantly better}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A similar survey conducted in 2006 by Scott Ambler, the Practice Leader for Agile Development with IBM Rational's Methods Group reported similar benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=  http://www.drdobbs.com/architecture-and-design/191800169;jsessionid=2QJ23QRYM3H4PQE1GHPCKH4ATMY32JVN?queryText=agile+survey |title=Survey Says: Agile Works in Practice |first=Scott |last=Ambler |authorlink=Scott Ambler |date=August 3, 2006 |work=Dr. Dobb's |accessdate=2010-06-03 |quote=Only 6 percent indicated that their productivity was lowered . . .

Agile development has been widely documented (see Experience Reports, below, as well as Beck&lt;ref name=&quot;beck1999&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Beck|first=K.|authorlink=Kent Beck|title=Extreme Programming Explained: Embrace Change|publisher=Addison-Wesley|location=Boston, MA|year=1999|isbn=0-321-27865-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; pg. 157, and Boehm and Turner&lt;ref name=&quot;boehm2004&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Boehm|first=B.|authorlink=Barry Boehm|coauthors=R.

Some things that may negatively impact the success of an agile project are:

* Distributed development efforts (non-colocated teams). Strategies have been described in ''Bridging the Distance''&lt;ref name=&quot;BridgingTheDistance&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drdobbs.com/architecture-and-design/184414899 |title=Bridging the Distance |publisher=Sdmagazine.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Using an Agile Software Process with Offshore Development''&lt;ref name=&quot;AgileOffshore&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Martin Fowler |url=http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/agileOffshore.html |title=Using an Agile Software Process with Offshore Development |publisher=Martinfowler.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barry Boehm and Richard Turner suggest that risk analysis be used to choose between adaptive (&quot;agile&quot;) and predictive (&quot;plan-driven&quot;) methods.&lt;ref name=&quot;boehm2004&quot;/&gt; The authors suggest that each side of the continuum has its own ''home ground'' as follows:

Agile home ground:&lt;ref name=&quot;boehm2004&quot;/&gt;
* Low criticality
* Senior developers
* Requirements change often
* Small number of developers
* Culture that thrives on chaos

Plan-driven home ground:&lt;ref name=&quot;boehm2004&quot;/&gt;
* High criticality
* Junior developers
* Requirements do not change often
* Large number of developers
* Culture that demands order

Formal methods:
* Extreme criticality
* Senior developers
* Limited requirements, limited features see Wirth's law
* Requirements that can be modeled
* Extreme quality

===Experience reports===
Agile development has been the subject of several conferences.  Some of these conferences have had academic backing and included peer-reviewed papers, including a peer-reviewed experience report track.  The experience reports share industry experiences with agile software development.

As of 2006, experience reports have been or will be presented at the following conferences&lt;!-- better links to reports needed; also need clarification of which conferences were peer-reviewed and which have academic credentials --&gt;:

'''Rapid application development''' ('''RAD''') refers to a type of software development methodology that uses minimal planning in favor of rapid prototyping. The &quot;planning&quot; of software developed using RAD is interleaved with writing the software itself. The lack of extensive pre-planning generally allows software to be written much faster, and makes it easier to change requirements.

== Overview ==
Rapid application development is a software development methodology that involves methods like iterative development and software prototyping. According to Whitten (2004), it is a merger of various structured techniques, especially data-driven Information Engineering, with prototyping techniques to accelerate software systems development.&lt;ref name=&quot;WBD04&quot;&gt;Whitten, Jeffrey L.; Lonnie D. Bentley, Kevin C. Dittman. (2004). ''Systems Analysis and Design Methods''. 6th edition. ISBN 025619906X.&lt;/ref&gt;  

In rapid application development, structured techniques and prototyping are especially used to define users' requirements and to design the final system. The development process starts with the development of preliminary data models and business process models using structured techniques. In the next stage, requirements are verified using prototyping, eventually to refine the data and process models. These stages are repeated iteratively; further development results in &quot;a combined business requirements and technical design statement to be used for constructing new systems&quot;.&lt;ref name=WBD04/&gt;     

RAD approaches may entail compromises in functionality and performance in exchange for enabling faster development and facilitating application maintenance.

== History ==
Rapid application development is a term originally used to describe a software development process introduced by James Martin in 1991. Martin's methodology involves iterative development and the construction of prototypes. More recently, the term and its acronym have come to be used in a broader, general sense that encompasses a variety of methods aimed at speeding application development, such as the use of software frameworks of varied types, such as web application frameworks.

Rapid application development was a response to non-agile processes developed in the 1970s and 1980s, such as the Structured Systems Analysis and Design Method and other Waterfall models. One problem with previous methodologies was that applications took so long to build that requirements had changed before the system was complete, resulting in inadequate or even unusable systems. Another problem was the assumption that a methodical requirements analysis phase alone would identify all the critical requirements. Ample evidence{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} attests to the fact that this is seldom the case, even for projects with highly experienced professionals at all levels.

Starting with the ideas of Brian Gallagher, Alex Balchin, Barry Boehm and Scott Shultz, James Martin developed the rapid application development approach during the 1980s at IBM and finally formalized it by publishing a book in 1991, ''Rapid Application Development''.

== Relative effectiveness ==
The shift from traditional session-based client/server development to open sessionless and collaborative development like Web 2.0 has increased the need for faster iterations through the phases of the SDLC.&lt;ref name=&quot;RAD1&quot;&gt;Maurer and S. Martel. (2002). &quot;Extreme Programming: Rapid Development for Web-Based Applications&quot;. IEEE Internet Computing, 6(1) pp 86-91 January/February 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;  This, coupled with the growing use of open source frameworks and products in core commercial development, has, for many developers, rekindled interest in finding a silver bullet RAD methodology.

Although most RAD methodologies foster software re-use, small team structure and distributed system development, most RAD practitioners recognize that, ultimately, no one “rapid” methodology can provide an order of magnitude improvement over any other development methodology. 

All types of RAD have the potential for providing a good framework for faster product development with improved software quality, but successful implementation and benefits often hinge on project type, schedule, software release cycle and corporate culture. It may also be of interest that some of the largest software vendors such as Microsoft&lt;ref name=&quot;SpecsOnLine&quot;&gt;{{cite web

Proceedings of International Conference of Software Engineering, Portland, OR, pp. 564-569, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; do not extensively use RAD in the development of their flagship products and for the most part, they still primarily rely on traditional waterfall methodologies with some degree of spiraling.&lt;ref name=&quot;RAD3&quot;&gt;M.

== Criticism ==
Since rapid application development is an iterative and incremental process, it can lead to a succession of prototypes that never culminate in a satisfactory production application. Such failures may be avoided if the application development tools are robust, flexible, and put to proper use. This is addressed in methods such as the 2080 Development method or other post-agile variants.

== Practical implications ==

When organizations adopt rapid development methodologies, care must be taken to avoid role and responsibility confusion and communication breakdown within a development team, and between team and client. In addition, especially in cases where the client is absent or not able to participate with authority in the development process, the system analyst should be endowed with this authority on behalf of the client to ensure
appropriate prioritisation of non-functional requirements. Furthermore, no increment of the system should be developed without a thorough and formally documented design phase.&lt;ref&gt;Gerber, Aurona; Van der Merwe, Alta; Alberts, Ronell; (2007), Implications of Rapid Development Methodologies, CSITEd 2007, Mauritius, November 2007 [http://ksg.meraka.org.za/~agerber/publications.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Extreme Programming''' (XP) is a software development methodology which is intended to improve software quality and responsiveness to changing customer requirements.  As a type of agile software development,&lt;ref name=&quot;Informatics85&quot;&gt;&lt;!--

it advocates frequent &quot;releases&quot; in short development cycles (timeboxing), which is intended to improve productivity and introduce checkpoints where new customer requirements can be adopted.

Other elements of extreme programming include: programming in pairs or doing extensive code review, unit testing of all code, avoiding programming of features until they are actually needed, a flat management structure, simplicity and clarity in code, expecting changes in the customer's requirements as time passes and the problem is better understood, and frequent communication with the customer and among programmers.&lt;ref name=&quot;UPenn49&quot;&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  The methodology takes its name from the idea that the beneficial elements of traditional software engineering practices are taken to &quot;extreme&quot; levels, on the theory that if some is good, more is better.  It is unrelated to &quot;cowboy coding&quot;, which is more free-form and unplanned.  It does not advocate &quot;death march&quot; work schedules, but instead working at a sustainable pace.&lt;ref name=&quot;tr&quot;/&gt;

Critics have noted several potential drawbacks,&lt;ref name=Cworld92/&gt; including problems with unstable requirements, no documented compromises of user conflicts, and a lack of an overall design specification or document.

== History ==
Extreme Programming was created by Kent Beck during his work on the Chrysler Comprehensive Compensation System (C3) payroll project.&lt;ref name=Cworld92/&gt; Beck became the C3 project leader in March 1996 and began to refine the development method used in the project and wrote a book on the method (in October 1999, ''Extreme Programming Explained'' was published).&lt;ref name=&quot;Cworld92&quot;&gt;

  December 2001, webpage: [http://www.computerworld.com/softwaretopics/software/appdev/story/0,10801,66192,00.html Computerworld-appdev-92].
&lt;/ref&gt;
Chrysler cancelled the C3 project in February 2000, after the company was acquired by Daimler-Benz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | coauthors=Matt Stephens, Doug Rosenberg | title=Extreme Programming Refactored: The Case Against XP | isbn=1590590961 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although extreme programming itself is relatively new, many of its practices have been around for some time; the methodology, after all, takes &quot;best practices&quot; to extreme levels. For example, the &quot;practice of test-first development, planning and writing tests before each micro-increment&quot; was used as early as NASA's Project Mercury, in the early 1960s {{Harvard citation | Larman | 2003}}. To shorten the total development time, some formal test documents (such as for acceptance testing) have been developed in parallel (or shortly before) the software is ready for testing. A NASA independent test group can write the test procedures, based on formal requirements and logical limits, before the software has been written and integrated with the hardware. In XP, this concept is taken to the extreme level by writing automated tests (perhaps inside of software modules) which validate the operation of even small sections of software coding, rather than only testing the larger features. Some other XP practices, such as refactoring, modularity, bottom-up design, and incremental design were described by Leo Brodie in his book published in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Brodie | first=Leo | coauthors= | editor= | others= | title=Thinking Forth | origdate= | origyear= | origmonth= | url=http://thinking-forth.sourceforge.net | format=paperback | accessdate=2006-06-19 | edition= | date= | year=1984 | month= | publisher=Prentice-Hall | location=  | isbn=0-13-917568-7 | pages= | chapter= | chapterurl= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Origins ===
Software development in the 1990s was shaped by two major influences: internally, object-oriented programming replaced procedural programming as the programming paradigm favored by some in the industry; externally, the rise of the Internet and the dot-com boom emphasized speed-to-market and company-growth as competitive business factors. Rapidly-changing requirements demanded shorter product life-cycles, and were often incompatible with traditional methods of software development.

The Chrysler Comprehensive Compensation System was started in order to determine the best way to use object technologies, using the payroll systems at Chrysler as the object of research, with Smalltalk as the language and GemStone as the data access layer. They brought in Kent Beck,&lt;ref name=Cworld92/&gt; a prominent Smalltalk practitioner, to do performance tuning on the system, but his role expanded as he noted several problems they were having with their development process. He took this opportunity to propose and implement some changes in their practices based on his work with his frequent collaborator, Ward Cunningham. Beck describes the early conception of the methods:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=20972 Interview with Kent Beck and Martin Fowler]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The first time I was asked to lead a team, I asked them to do a little bit of the things I thought were sensible, like testing and reviews. The second time there was a lot more on the line. I thought, &quot;Damn the torpedoes, at least this will make a good article,&quot; [and] asked the team to crank up all the knobs to 10 on the things I thought were essential and leave out everything else.}}

Beck invited Ron Jeffries to the project to help develop and refine these methods. Jeffries thereafter acted as a coach to instill the practices as habits in the C3 team.

Information about the principles and practices behind XP was disseminated to the wider world through discussions on the original Wiki, Cunningham's WikiWikiWeb. Various contributors discussed and expanded upon the ideas, and some spin-off methodologies resulted (see agile software development). Also, XP concepts have been explained, for several years, using a hypertext system map on the XP website at &quot;http://www.extremeprogramming.org&quot; circa 1999.

Beck edited a series of books on XP, beginning with his own ''Extreme Programming Explained'' (1999, ISBN 0-201-61641-6), spreading his ideas to a much larger, yet very receptive, audience. Authors in the series went through various aspects attending XP and its practices. Even a book was written, critical of the practices.

=== Current state ===
XP created quite a buzz in the late 1990s and early 2000s, seeing adoption in a number of environments radically different from its origins.

The high discipline required by the original practices often went by the wayside, causing some of these practices, such as those thought too rigid, to be deprecated or reduced, or even left unfinished, on individual sites. For example, the practice of end-of-day integration tests, for a particular project, could be changed to an end-of-week schedule, or simply reduced to mutually agreed dates. Such a more relaxed schedule could avoid people feeling rushed to generate artificial stubs just to pass the end-of-day testing. A less rigid schedule allows, instead, for some complex features to be more fully developed over a several-day period. However, some level of periodic integration testing can detect groups of people working in non-compatible, tangent efforts before too much work is invested in divergent, wrong directions.

Meanwhile, other agile development practices have not stood still, and XP is still evolving, assimilating more lessons from experiences in the field, to use other practices. In the second edition of ''Extreme Programming Explained'', Beck added more values and practices and differentiated between primary and corollary practices.

== Concept ==
=== Goals ===
''Extreme Programming Explained'' describes Extreme Programming as a software development discipline that organizes people to produce higher quality software more productively.

In traditional system development methods (such as SSADM or the waterfall model) the requirements for the system are determined at the beginning of the development project and often fixed from that point on. This means that the cost of changing the requirements at a later stage (a common feature of software engineering projects{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}&lt;!-- Should this be qualified, i.e. &quot;a common feature of BLAH software engineering projects&quot;? --&gt;) will be high. Like other agile software development methods, XP attempts to reduce the cost of change by having multiple short development cycles, rather than one long one.
In this doctrine changes are a natural, inescapable and desirable aspect of software development projects, and should be planned for instead of attempting to define a stable set of requirements.

Extreme programming also introduces a number of basic values, principles and practices on top of the agile programming framework.

=== Activities ===
XP describes four basic activities that are performed within the software development process: coding, testing, listening, and designing. Each of those activities is described below.

==== Coding ====
The advocates of XP argue that the only truly important product of the system development process is code - software instructions a computer can interpret. Without code, there is no working product.

Coding can also be used to figure out the most suitable solution.  Coding can also help to communicate thoughts about programming problems. A programmer dealing with a complex programming problem and finding it hard to explain the solution to fellow programmers might code it and use the code to demonstrate what he or she means. Code, say the proponents of this position, is always clear and concise and cannot be interpreted in more than one way. Other programmers can give feedback on this code by also coding their thoughts.

==== Testing ====
One can not be certain that a function works unless one tests it. Bugs and design errors are pervasive problems in software development.  Extreme programming's approach is that if a little testing can eliminate a few flaws, a lot of testing can eliminate many more flaws.
* Unit tests determine whether a given feature works as intended.  A programmer writes as many automated tests as they can think of that might &quot;break&quot; the code; if all tests run successfully, then the coding is complete.  Every piece of code that is written is tested before moving on to the next feature.
*Acceptance tests verify that the requirements as understood by the programmers satisfy the customer's actual requirements.  These occur in the exploration phase of release planning.

A &quot;testathon&quot; is an event when programmers meet to do collaborative test writing, a kind of brainstorming relative to software testing.

==== Listening ====
Programmers must listen to what the customers need the system to do, what &quot;business logic&quot; is needed.  They must understand these needs well enough to give the customer feedback about the technical aspects of how the problem might be solved, or cannot be solved. Communication between the customer and programmer is further addressed in the Planning Game.

==== Designing ====
From the point of view of simplicity, of course one could say that system development doesn't need more than coding, testing and listening. If those activities are performed well, the result should always be a system that works. In practice, this will not work. One can come a long way without designing but at a given time one will get stuck. The system becomes too complex and the dependencies within the system cease to be clear. One can avoid this by creating a design structure that organizes the logic in the system. Good design will avoid lots of dependencies within a system; this means that changing one part of the system will not affect other parts of the system.

=== Values ===
Extreme Programming initially recognized four values in 1999. A new value was added in the second edition of ''Extreme Programming Explained''. The five values are:

==== Communication ====
Building software systems requires communicating system requirements to the developers of the system. In formal software development methodologies, this task is accomplished through documentation. Extreme programming techniques can be viewed as methods for rapidly building and disseminating institutional knowledge among members of a development team. The goal is to give all developers a shared view of the system which matches the view held by the users of the system. To this end, extreme programming favors simple designs, common metaphors, collaboration of users and programmers, frequent verbal communication, and feedback.

==== Simplicity ====
Extreme Programming encourages starting with the simplest solution. Extra functionality can then be added later. The difference between this approach and more conventional system development methods is the focus on designing and coding for the needs of today instead of those of tomorrow, next week, or next month.  This is sometimes summed up as the &quot;you ain't gonna need it&quot; (YAGNI) approach.&lt;ref name=&quot;tr&quot;&gt;&quot;Everyone's a Programmer&quot; by Clair Tristram.  ''Technology Review'', Nov 2003.  p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of XP acknowledge the disadvantage that this can sometimes entail more effort tomorrow to change the system; their claim is that this is more than compensated for by the advantage of not investing in possible future requirements that might change before they become relevant. Coding and designing for uncertain future requirements implies the risk of spending resources on something that might not be needed. Related to the &quot;communication&quot; value, simplicity in design and coding should improve the quality of communication. A simple design with very simple code could be easily understood by most programmers in the team.

==== Feedback ====
Within extreme programming, feedback relates to different dimensions of the system development:
*Feedback from the system: by writing unit tests,&lt;small&gt;&lt;ref name=Cworld92/&gt;&lt;/small&gt; or running periodic integration tests, the programmers have direct feedback from the state of the system after implementing changes.
*Feedback from the customer: The functional tests (aka acceptance tests) are written by the customer and the testers. They will get concrete feedback about the current state of their system. This review is planned once in every two or three weeks so the customer can easily steer the development.
*Feedback from the team: When customers come up with new requirements in the planning game the team directly gives an estimation of the time that it will take to implement.

Feedback is closely related to communication and simplicity. Flaws in the system are easily communicated by writing a unit test that proves a certain piece of code will break. The direct feedback from the system tells programmers to recode this part. A customer is able to test the system periodically according to the functional requirements, known as ''user stories''.&lt;ref name=Cworld92/&gt; To quote Kent Beck, &quot;Optimism is an occupational hazard of programming, feedback is the treatment.&quot;{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

==== Courage ====
Several practices embody courage. One is the commandment to always design and code for today and not for tomorrow. This is an effort to avoid getting bogged down in design and requiring a lot of effort to implement anything else. Courage enables developers to feel comfortable with refactoring their code when necessary.&lt;ref name=Cworld92/&gt; This means reviewing the existing system and modifying it so that future changes can be implemented more easily. Another example of courage is knowing when to throw code away: courage to remove source code that is obsolete, no matter how much effort was used to create that source code. Also, courage means persistence: A programmer might be stuck on a complex problem for an entire day, then solve the problem quickly the next day, if only they are persistent.

==== Respect ====
The respect value includes respect for others as well as self-respect. Programmers should never commit changes that break compilation, that make existing unit-tests fail, or that otherwise delay the work of their peers. Members respect their own work by always striving for high quality and seeking for the best design for the solution at hand through refactoring.

Adopting the four earlier values leads to respect gained from others in the team. Nobody on the team should feel unappreciated or ignored. This ensures a high level of motivation and encourages loyalty toward the team and toward the goal of the project. This value is very dependent upon the other values, and is very much oriented toward people in a team.

=== Rules ===
The first version of rules for XP was published in 1999 by Don Wells&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules.html Don Wells]&lt;/ref&gt; at the XP website. 29 rules are given in the categories of planning, managing, designing, coding, and testing. Planning, managing and designing are called out explicitly to counter claims that XP doesn't support those activities.

Another version of XP rules was proposed by Ken Auer&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rolemodelsoftware.com/moreAboutUs/publications/rulesOfXp.php Ken Auer]&lt;/ref&gt; in XP/Agile Universe 2003.  He felt XP was defined by its rules, not its practices (which are subject to more variation and ambiguity). He defined two categories: &quot;Rules of Engagement&quot; which dictate the environment in which software development can take place effectively, and &quot;Rules of Play&quot; which define the minute-by-minute activities and rules within the framework of the Rules of Engagement.

=== Principles ===
The principles that form the basis of XP are based on the values just described and are intended to foster decisions in a system development project. The principles are intended to be more concrete than the values and more easily translated to guidance in a practical situation.

==== Feedback ====
Extreme programming sees feedback as most useful if it is done rapidly and expresses that the time between an action and its feedback is critical to learning and making changes. Unlike traditional system development methods, contact with the customer occurs in more frequent iterations. The customer has clear insight into the system that is being developed. He or she can give feedback and steer the development as needed.

Unit tests also contribute to the rapid feedback principle. When writing code, the unit test provides direct feedback as to how the system reacts to the changes one has made. If, for instance, the changes affect a part of the system that is not in the scope of the programmer who made them, that programmer will not notice the flaw. There is a large chance that this bug will appear when the system is in production.

==== Assuming simplicity ====
This is about treating every problem as if its solution were &quot;extremely simple&quot;. Traditional system development methods say to plan for the future and to code for reusability. Extreme programming rejects these ideas.

The advocates of extreme programming say that making big changes all at once does not work. Extreme programming applies incremental changes: for example, a system might have small releases every three weeks. When many little steps are made, the customer has more control over the development process and the system that is being developed.

==== Embracing change ====
The principle of embracing change is about not working against changes but embracing them. For instance, if at one of the iterative meetings it appears that the customer's requirements have changed dramatically, programmers are to embrace this and plan the new requirements for the next iteration.

== Practices ==
Extreme programming has been described as having 12 practices, grouped into four areas:

=== Fine scale feedback ===
* Pair programming&lt;small&gt;&lt;ref name=Cworld92/&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
* Planning game
* Test-driven development
* Whole team

=== Continuous process ===
* Continuous integration
* Refactoring or design improvement&lt;small&gt;&lt;ref name=Cworld92/&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
* Small releases

=== Shared understanding ===
* Coding standards
* Collective code ownership&lt;small&gt;&lt;ref name=Cworld92/&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
* Simple design&lt;small&gt;&lt;ref name=Cworld92/&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
* System metaphor

=== Programmer welfare ===
* Sustainable pace

=== Coding ===
* The customer is always available
* Code the Unit test first
* Only one pair integrates code at a time
* Leave Optimization till last
* No Overtime

=== Testing ===
* All code must have Unit tests
* All code must pass all Unit tests before it can be released.
* When a Bug is found tests are created before the bug is addressed (a bug is not an error in logic, it is a test you forgot to write)
* Acceptance tests are run often and the results are published

== Controversial aspects ==
The practices in XP have been heavily debated.&lt;ref name=Cworld92/&gt; Proponents of extreme programming claim that by having the on-site customer&lt;small&gt;&lt;ref name=Cworld92/&gt;&lt;/small&gt; request changes informally, the process becomes flexible, and saves the cost of formal overhead. Critics of XP claim this can lead to costly rework and project scope creep beyond what was previously agreed or funded.

Change control boards are a sign that there are potential conflicts in project objectives and constraints between multiple users. XP's expedited methodology is somewhat dependent on programmers being able to assume a unified client viewpoint so the programmer can concentrate on coding rather than documentation of compromise objectives and constraints. This also applies when multiple programming organizations are involved, particularly organizations which compete for shares of projects.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

Other potentially controversial aspects of extreme programming include:
* Requirements are expressed as automated acceptance tests rather than specification documents.
* Requirements are defined incrementally, rather than trying to get them all in advance.
* Software developers are usually required to work in pairs.
* There is no Big Design Up Front. Most of the design activity takes place on the fly and incrementally, starting with &lt;span id=&quot;SimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&quot;the simplest thing that could possibly work&quot; and adding complexity only when it's required by failing tests. Critics compare this to &quot;debugging a system into appearance&quot; and fear this will result in more re-design effort than only re-designing when requirements change.
* A customer representative is attached to the project. This role can become a single-point-of-failure for the project, and some people have found it to be a source of stress. Also, there is the danger of micro-management by a non-technical representative trying to dictate the use of technical software features and architecture.
* Dependence upon all other aspects of XP: &quot;XP is like a ring of poisonous snakes, daisy-chained together. All it takes is for one of them to wriggle loose, and you've got a very angry, poisonous snake heading your way.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.softwarereality.com/lifecycle/xp/safety_net.jsp The Case Against Extreme Programming: A Self-Referential Safety Net]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scalability===
Historically, XP only works on teams of twelve or fewer people. One way to circumvent this limitation is to break up the project into smaller pieces and the team into smaller groups. It has been claimed that XP has been used successfully on teams of over a hundred developers{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}. ThoughtWorks has claimed reasonable success on distributed XP projects with up to sixty people{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}.

In 2004 Industrial Extreme Programming (IXP)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cutter.com/content-and-analysis/resource-centers/agile-project-management/sample-our-research/apmr0502.html Cutter Consortium :: Industrial XP: Making XP Work in Large Organizations&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; was introduced as an evolution of XP. It is intended to bring the ability to work in large and distributed teams. It now has 23 practices and flexible values. As it is a new member of the Agile family, there is not enough data to prove its usability, however it claims to be an answer to what it sees as XP's imperfections.

===Severability and responses===
In 2003, Matt Stephens and Doug Rosenberg published ''Extreme Programming Refactored: The Case Against XP'' which questioned the value of the XP process and suggested ways in which it could be improved. This triggered a lengthy debate in articles, internet newsgroups, and web-site chat areas. The core argument of the book is that XP's practices are interdependent but that few practical organizations are willing/able to adopt all the practices; therefore the entire process fails. The book also makes other criticisms and it draws a likeness of XP's &quot;collective ownership&quot; model to socialism in a negative manner.

Certain aspects of XP have changed since the book ''Extreme Programming Refactored'' (2003) was published; in particular, XP now accommodates modifications to the practices as long as the required objectives are still met. XP also uses increasingly generic terms for processes. Some argue that these changes invalidate previous criticisms; others claim that this is simply watering the process down.

RDP Practice is a technique for tailoring extreme programming. This practice was initially proposed as a long research paper in a workshop organized by Philippe Kruchten and Steve Adolph( See [http://www.lero.ie/apso08/introduction.html APSO workshop] at [http://icse08.upb.de/ ICSE 2008]) and yet it is the only proposed and applicable method for customizing XP. The valuable concepts behind RDP practice, in a short time provided the rationale for applicability of it in industries. RDP Practice tries to customize XP by relying on technique XP Rules.

Other authors have tried to reconcile XP with the older methods in order to form a unified methodology. Some of these XP sought to replace, such as the waterfall method; example: [http://www.lux-seattle.com/resources/whitepapers/waterfall.htm Project Lifecycles: Waterfall, Rapid Application Development, and All That]. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. tried combining XP with the computer programming methodologies of Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI), and Six Sigma. They found that the three systems reinforced each other well, leading to better development, and did not mutually contradict.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sei.cmu.edu/library/assets/jarvis-gristock.pdf Extreme Programming (XP) Six Sigma CMMI].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Extreme programming's initial buzz and controversial tenets, such as pair programming and continuous design, have attracted particular criticisms, such as the ones coming from McBreen&lt;ref name=&quot;mcbreen&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=McBreen|first=P.|title=Questioning Extreme Programming|publisher=Addison-Wesley|location=Boston, MA|year=2003|isbn=0-201-84457-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Boehm and Turner.&lt;ref name=&quot;boehm2004&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Boehm|first=B.|authorlink=Barry Boehm|coauthors=R. Turner|title=Balancing Agility and Discipline: A Guide for the Perplexed|publisher=Addison-Wesley|location=Boston, MA|year=2004|isbn=0-321-18612-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the criticisms, however, are believed by Agile practitioners to be misunderstandings of agile development.&lt;ref name=&quot;sdmagazine1811&quot;&gt;[http://www.sdmagazine.com/documents/s=1811/sdm0112h/0112h.htm sdmagazine]&lt;/ref&gt;

In particular, extreme programming is reviewed and critiqued by Matt Stephens's and Doug Rosenberg's ''Extreme Programming Refactored''.&lt;ref name= &quot;ExtremeProgrammingRefactored&quot;&gt;[http://www.softwarereality.com/ExtremeProgrammingRefactored.jsp Extreme Programming Refactored], Matt Stephens and Doug Rosenberg, Publisher: Apress L.P.&lt;/ref&gt;

Criticisms include:
* A methodology is only as effective as the people involved, Agile does not solve this
* Often used as a means to bleed money from customers through lack of defining a deliverable
* Lack of structure and necessary documentation
* Only works with senior-level developers
* Incorporates insufficient software design
* Requires meetings at frequent intervals at enormous expense to customers
* Requires too much cultural change to adopt
* Can lead to more difficult contractual negotiations
* Can be very inefficient—if the requirements for one area of code change through various iterations, the same programming may need to be done several times over. Whereas if a plan were there to be followed, a single area of code is expected to be written once.
* Impossible to develop realistic estimates of work effort needed to provide a quote, because at the beginning of the project no one knows the entire scope/requirements
* Can increase the risk of scope creep due to the lack of detailed requirements documentation
* Agile is feature driven; non-functional quality attributes are hard to be placed as user stories

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Round-trip engineering (RTE)''' is a functionality of software development tools that synchronizes two or more related software artifacts, such as, source code, models, configuration files, and other documents. The need for round-trip engineering arises when the same information is present in multiple artifacts and therefore an inconsistency may occur if not all artifacts are consistently updated to reflect a given change. For example, some piece of information was added to/changed in only one artifact and, as a result, it became missing in/inconsistent with the other artifacts.

Round-trip engineering is closely related to traditional software engineering disciplines: forward engineering (creating software from specifications), reverse engineering (creating specifications from existing software), and reengieering (understanding existing software and modifying it). Round-trip engineering is often wrongly defined as simply supporting both forward and reverse engineering. In fact, the key characteristic of round-trip engineering that distinguishes it from forward and reverse engineering is the ability to synchronize '''existing''' artifacts that evolved '''concurrently''' by '''incrementally''' updating each artifact to reflect changes made to the other artifacts. Furthermore, forward engineering can be seen as a special instance of RTE in which only the specification is present and reverse engineering can be seen as a special instance of RTE in which only the software is present. Many reengineering activities can also be understood as RTE when the software is updated to reflect changes made to the previously reverse engineered specification.

Another characteristic of round-trip engineering is '''automatic''' update of the artifacts in response to '''automatically''' detected inconsistencies. In that sense, it is different from forward- and reverse engineering which can be both manual (traditionally) and automatic (via automatic generation or analysis of the artifacts). The automatic update can be either '''instantaneous''' or '''on-demand'''. In instantaneous RTE, all related artifacts are immediately updated after each change made to one of them. In on-demand RTE, authors of the artifacts may concurrently evolve the artifacts (even in a distributed setting) and at some point choose to execute matching to identify inconsistencies and choose to propagate some of them and reconcile potential conflicts.

==Examples of round-trip engineering==
Perhaps the most common form of round-trip engineering is synchronization between UML (Unified Modeling Language) models and the corresponding source code. Many commercial tools and research prototypes (e.g., FUJABA) support this form of RTE. Usually, UML class diagrams are supported to some degree; however, certain UML concepts, such as ''associations'' and ''containment'' do not have straightforward representations in many programming languages which limits the usability of the created code and accuracy of code analysis (e.g., containment is hard to recognize in the code). Behavioral parts of UML impose even more challenges for RTE.

A more tractable form of round-trip engineering is implemented in the context of framework application programming interfaces (APIs), whereby a model describing the usage of a framework API by an application is synchronized with that application's code. In this setting, the API '''prescribes''' all correct ways the framework can be used in applications, which allows precise and complete detection of API usages in the code as well as creation of useful code implementing correct API usages. Two prominent RTE implementations in this category are framework-specific modeling languages and Spring Roo.

Round-trip engineering is critical for maintaining consistency among multiple models and between the models and the code in Object Management Group's (OMG) Model-driven architecture. OMG proposed the QVT (query/view/transformation) standard to handle model transformations required for MDA. To date, a few implementations of the standard have been created. (Need to present practical experiences with MDA in relation to RTE).

It often involves taking something (e.g., a mechanical device, electronic component, or software program) apart and analyzing its workings in detail to be used in maintenance, or to try to make a new device or program that does the same thing without using or simply duplicating (without understanding) any part of the original.

Reverse engineering has its origins in the analysis of hardware for commercial or military advantage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1109/52.43044 |first=E. J. |last=Chikofsky |lastauthoramp=yes |first2=J.

The same techniques are subsequently being researched for application to legacy software systems, not for industrial or defence ends, but rather to replace incorrect, incomplete, or otherwise unavailable documentation.&lt;ref&gt;A Survey of Reverse Engineering and Program Comprehension. Michael L. Nelson, April 19, 1996, ODU CS 551 - Software Engineering Survey .Furthermore,reverse enginerring concept is use to modify or change premade .dll files in an operating systems&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motivation==
Reasons for reverse engineering:
* Interoperability.
* Lost documentation: Reverse engineering often is done because the documentation of a particular device has been lost (or was never written), and the person who built it is no longer available.  Integrated circuits often seem to have been designed on obsolete, proprietary systems, which means that the only way to incorporate the functionality into new technology is to reverse-engineer the existing chip and then re-design it.
* Product analysis.  To examine how a product works, what components it consists of, estimate costs, and identify potential patent infringement.
* Digital update/correction. To update the digital version (e.g. CAD model) of an object to match an &quot;as-built&quot; condition.
* Security auditing.
* Acquiring sensitive data by disassembling and analysing the design of a system component.&lt;ref name=rfc2828&gt;Internet Engineering Task Force RFC 2828 Internet Security Glossary&lt;/ref&gt;
* Military or commercial espionage. Learning about an enemy's or competitor's latest research by stealing or capturing a prototype and dismantling it.
* Removal of copy protection, circumvention of access restrictions.
* Creation of unlicensed/unapproved duplicates.
* Materials harvesting, sorting, or scrapping.&lt;ref&gt;http://scrappingmetal.blogspot.com/2010/10/reverse-engineering.html&lt;/ref&gt;
* Academic/learning purposes.
* Curiosity.
* Competitive technical intelligence (understand what your competitor is actually doing versus what they say they are doing).
* Learning: learn from others' mistakes. Do not make the same mistakes that others have already made and subsequently corrected.

==Reverse engineering of machines==
As computer-aided design (CAD) has become more popular, reverse engineering has become a viable method to create a 3D virtual model of an existing physical part for use in 3D CAD, CAM, CAE or other software.&lt;ref&gt;T. Varady, R. R. Martin, J. Cox, Reverse Engineering of Geometric Models—An Introduction, Computer Aided Design 29 (4), 255-268, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; The reverse-engineering process involves measuring an object and then reconstructing it as a 3D model.  The physical object can be measured using 3D scanning technologies like CMMs, laser scanners, structured light digitizers or Industrial CT Scanning (computed tomography).  The measured data alone, usually represented as a point cloud, lacks topological information and is therefore often processed and modeled into a more usable format such as a triangular-faced mesh, a set of NURBS surfaces or a CAD model.

Reverse engineering is also used by businesses to bring existing physical geometry into digital product development environments, to make a digital 3D record of their own products or to assess competitors' products. It is used to analyse, for instance, how a product works, what it does, and what components it consists of, estimate costs, and identify potential patent infringement, etc.

Value engineering is a related activity also used by businesses. It involves de-constructing and analysing products, but the objective is to find opportunities for cost cutting.

==Reverse engineering of software==
The term ''reverse engineering'' as applied to software means different things to different people, prompting Chikofsky and Cross to write a paper researching the various uses and defining a taxonomy. From their paper, they state, &quot;Reverse engineering is the process of analyzing a subject system to create representations of the system at a higher level of abstraction.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Chikofsky | first=E.J. | coauthors=J.H. Cross II | year=1990 | month=January | title=Reverse Engineering and Design Recovery: A Taxonomy in IEEE Software | journal=IEEE Computer Society | pages=13–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be seen as &quot;going backwards through the development cycle&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Warden | first=R. | title=Software Reuse and Reverse Engineering in Practice | year=1992 | publisher=Chapman &amp; Hall | location=London, England | pages=283–305}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this model, the output of the implementation phase (in source code form) is reverse-engineered back to the analysis phase, in an inversion of the traditional waterfall model. Reverse engineering is a process of examination only: the software system under consideration is not modified (which would make it re-engineering). Software anti-tamper technology is used to deter both reverse engineering and re-engineering of proprietary software and software-powered systems. In practice, two main types of reverse engineering emerge. In the first case, source code is already available for the software, but higher-level aspects of the program, perhaps poorly documented or documented but no longer valid, are discovered. In the second case, there is no source code available for the software, and any efforts towards discovering one possible source code for the software are regarded as reverse engineering. This second usage of the term is the one most people are familiar with. Reverse engineering of software can make use of the clean room design technique to avoid copyright infringement.

On a related note, black box testing in software engineering has a lot in common with reverse engineering. The tester usually has the API, but their goals are to find bugs and undocumented features by bashing the product from outside.

Other purposes of reverse engineering include security auditing, removal of copy protection (&quot;cracking&quot;), circumvention of access restrictions often present in consumer electronics, customization of embedded systems (such as engine management systems), in-house repairs or retrofits, enabling of additional features on low-cost &quot;crippled&quot; hardware (such as some graphics card chip-sets), or even mere satisfaction of curiosity.

The Certified Reverse Engineering Analyst (CREA) is a certification provided by the IACRB that certifies candidates are proficient in reverse engineering software.

===Binary software===
This process is sometimes termed ''Reverse Code Engineering'', or RCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Chuvakin | first=Anton | coauthors=Cyrus Peikari | edition=1st | title=Security Warrior |accessdate=2006-05-25 | publisher=O'Reilly | year=2004 | month=January}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an example, decompilation of binaries for the Java platform can be accomplished using Jad. One famous case of reverse engineering was the first non-IBM implementation of the PC BIOS which launched the historic IBM PC compatible industry that has been the overwhelmingly dominant computer hardware platform for many years. An example of a group that reverse-engineers software for enjoyment (and to distribute registration cracks) is CORE which stands for &quot;Challenge Of Reverse Engineering&quot;. Reverse engineering of software is protected in the U.S. by the fair use exception in copyright law.&lt;ref&gt;See {{Cite journal |doi=10.2307/797533 |authorlink=Pamela Samuelson |first=Pamela |last=Samuelson |lastauthoramp=yes |first2=Suzanne |last2=Scotchmer |title=The Law and Economics of Reverse Engineering |volume=111 |journal=Yale Law Journal |issue= 7|pages=1575–1663 |year=2002 |url=http://www.yalelawjournal.org/the-yale-law-journal/content-pages/the-law-and-economics-of-reverse-engineering/ |postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to &quot;.&quot; for the cite to end in a &quot;.&quot;, as necessary. --&gt; |jstor=797533 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Samba software, which allows systems that are not running Microsoft Windows systems to share files with systems that are, is a classic example of software reverse engineering,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Samba: An Introduction | url=http://www.samba.org/samba/docs/SambaIntro.html | date=2001-11-27 | accessdate=2009-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; since the Samba project had to reverse-engineer unpublished information about how Windows file sharing worked, so that non-Windows computers could emulate it. The Wine project does the same thing for the Windows API, and OpenOffice.org is one party doing this for the Microsoft Office file formats. The ReactOS project is even more ambitious in its goals, as it strives to provide binary (ABI and API) compatibility with the current Windows OSes of the NT branch, allowing software and drivers written for Windows to run on a clean-room reverse-engineered GPL free software or open-source counterpart.

====Binary software techniques====
Reverse engineering of software can be accomplished by various methods.
The three main groups of software reverse engineering are
#Analysis through observation of information exchange, most prevalent in protocol reverse engineering, which involves using bus analyzers and packet sniffers, for example, for accessing a computer bus or computer network connection and revealing the traffic data thereon. Bus or network behavior can then be analyzed to produce a stand-alone implementation that mimics that behavior. This is especially useful for reverse engineering device drivers. Sometimes, reverse engineering on embedded systems is greatly assisted by tools deliberately introduced by the manufacturer, such as JTAG ports or other debugging means. In Microsoft Windows, low-level debuggers such as SoftICE are popular.
#Disassembly using a disassembler, meaning the raw machine language of the program is read and understood in its own terms, only with the aid of machine-language mnemonics. This works on any computer program but can take quite some time, especially for someone not used to machine code. The Interactive Disassembler is a particularly popular tool.
#Decompilation using a decompiler, a process that tries, with varying results, to recreate the source code in some high-level language for a program only available in machine code or bytecode.

==Source code==
A number of UML tools refer to the process of importing and analysing source code to generate UML diagrams as &quot;reverse engineering&quot;. See List of UML tools.

==Reverse engineering of protocols==

Protocols are sets of rules that describe message formats and how messages are exchanged (i.e., the protocol state-machine). Accordingly, the problem of protocol reverse-engineering can be partitioned into two subproblems; message format and state-machine reverse-engineering.

The message formats have traditionally been reverse-engineered through a tedious manual process, which involved analysis of how protocol implementations process messages, but recent research proposed a number of automatic solutions &lt;ref&gt;W. Cui, J. Kannan, and H. J. Wang. Discoverer: Automatic protocol reverse engineering from network traces. In Proceedings of 16th USENIX Security Symposium on USENIX Security Symposium, pages 1-14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W. Cui, M. Peinado, K. Chen, H. J. Wang, and L. Irún-Briz. Tupni: Automatic reverse engineering of input formats. In Proceedings of the 15th ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security, pages 391-402. ACM, Oct 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;M. Comparetti, G. Wondracek pages 110-125&quot;&gt;P. M. Comparetti, G. Wondracek, C. Kruegel, and E. Kirda. Prospex: Protocol specification extraction. In Proceedings of the 2009 30th IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy, pages 110-125, Washington, 2009. IEEE Computer Society.&lt;/ref&gt;. Typically, these automatic approaches either group observed messages into clusters using various clustering analyses, or emulate the protocol implementation tracing the message processing.

There has been less work on reverse-engineering of state-machines of protocols. In general, the protocol state-machines can be learned either through a process of offline learning, which passively observes communication and attempts to build the most general state-machine accepting all observed sequnces of messages, and online learning, which allows interactive generation of probing sequences of messages and listening to responses to those probing sequences. In general, offline learning of small state-machines is known to be NP-complete &lt;ref&gt;E. M. Gold. Complexity of automaton identification from given data. Information and Control, 37(3):302-320, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;, while online learning can be done in polynomial time &lt;ref&gt;D. Angluin. Learning regular sets from queries and counterexamples. Information and Computation, 75(2):87-106, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;. An automatic offline approach has been demonstrated by Comparetti at al.&lt;ref name=&quot;M. Comparetti, G. Wondracek pages 110-125&quot;/&gt;. and an online approach very recently by Cho et al.&lt;ref&gt;C.Y. Cho, D. Babic, R. Shin, and D. Song. [http://www.domagoj-babic.com/index.php/Pubs/CCS10botnets Inference and Analysis of Formal Models of Botnet Command and Control Protocols], 2010 ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Other components of typical protocols, like encryption and hash functions, can be reverse-engineered automatically as well. Typically, the automatic approaches trace the execution of protocol implementations and try to detect buffers in memory holding unencrpyted packets &lt;ref&gt;[http://bitblaze.cs.berkeley.edu/papers/polyglot_ccs07_av.pdf   Polyglot: automatic extraction of protocol message format using dynamic binary analysis]. J. Caballero, H. Yin, Z. Liang, and D. Song. Proceedings of the 14th ACM conference on Computer and communications security, p. 317-329.&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Reverse engineering of integrated circuits/smart cards==
Reverse engineering is an invasive and destructive form of analyzing a smart card. The attacker grinds away layer by layer of the smart card and takes pictures with an electron microscope. With this technique, it is possible to reveal the complete hardware and software part of the smart card. The major problem for the attacker is to bring everything into the right order to find out how everything works. Engineers try to hide keys and operations by mixing up memory positions, for example, busscrambling.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Rankl, Wolfgang Effing, Smart Card Handbook (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;T. Welz: Smart cards as methods for payment (2008), Seminar ITS-Security Ruhr-Universität Bochum, &quot;http://www.crypto.rub.de/its_seminar_ws0708.html&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;
In some cases, it is even possible to attach a probe to measure voltages while the smart card is still operational. Engineers employ sensors to detect and prevent this attack.&lt;ref&gt;David C. Musker: Protecting &amp; Exploiting Intellectual Property in Electronics, IBC Conferences, 10 June 1998&lt;/ref&gt; This attack is not very common because it requires a large investment in effort and special equipment that is generally only available to large chip manufacturers. Furthermore, the payoff from this attack is low since other security techniques are often employed such as shadow accounts.

==Reverse engineering for military applications==
Reverse engineering is often used by militaries in order to copy other nations' technologies, devices or information that have been obtained by regular troops in the fields or by intelligence operations. It was often used during the Second World War and the Cold War. Well-known examples from WWII and later include
* Jerry can: British and American forces noticed that the Germans had gasoline cans with an excellent design.  They reverse-engineered copies of those cans.  The cans were popularly known as &quot;Jerry cans&quot;.
* Tupolev Tu-4: Three American B-29 bombers on missions over Japan were forced to land in the USSR.  The Soviets, who did not have a similar strategic bomber, decided to copy the B-29.  Within a few years, they had developed the Tu-4, a near-perfect copy.
* V2 Rocket:  Technical documents for the V2 and related technologies were captured by the Western Allies at the end of the war.  Soviet and captured German engineers had to reproduce technical documents and plans, working from captured hardware, in order to make their clone of the rocket, the R-1, which began the postwar Soviet rocket program that led to the R-7 and the beginning of the space race.
* Vympel K-13/R-3S missile (NATO reporting name '''AA-2 Atoll'''), a Soviet reverse-engineered copy of the AIM-9 Sidewinder, made possible after a Taiwanese AIM-9B hit a Chinese MiG-17 without exploding; amazingly, the missile became lodged within the airframe, the pilot returning to base with what Russian scientists would describe as a university course in missile development.
* BGM-71 TOW Missile: In May 1975, negotiations between Iran and Hughes Missile Systems on co-production of the TOW and Maverick missiles stalled over disagreements in the pricing structure, the subsequent 1979 revolution ending all plans for such co-production. Iran was later successful in reverse-engineering the missile and are currently producing their own copy: the Toophan.
* China has reversed engineered many examples of Western and Russian hardware, from fighter aircraft to missiles and HMMWV cars.

==Legality==
In the United States even if an artifact or process is protected by trade secrets, reverse-engineering the artifact or process is often lawful as long as it is obtained legitimately.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.memagazine.org/contents/current/features/trade101/trade101.html&lt;/ref&gt; Patents, on the other hand, need a public disclosure of an invention, and therefore, patented items do not necessarily have to be reverse-engineered to be studied. (However, an item produced under one or more patents could also include other technology that is not patented and not disclosed.) One common motivation of reverse engineers is to determine whether a competitor's product contains patent infringements or copyright infringements.

The reverse engineering of software in the US is generally illegal because most EULA prohibit it, and courts have found such contractual prohibitions to override the copyright law; see Bowers v. Baystate Technologies.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.utsystem.edu/ogc/intellectualproperty/baystatevbowersdiscussion.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.infoworld.com/d/developer-world/contract-case-could-hurt-reverse-engineering-337&lt;/ref&gt; Article 6 of the 1991 EU Computer Programs Directive allows reverse engineering for the purposes of interoperability, but prohibits it for the purposes of creating a competing product, and also prohibits the public release of information obtained through reverse engineering of software.&lt;ref&gt;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31991L0250:EN:HTML&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://books.google.com/books?id=KJmNGglq0nwC&amp;pg=PA321&amp;lpg=PA321&amp;dq=e+European+Software+Directive+reverse+engineering&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=D-fjaWSI4Y&amp;sig=47VJ-tdmg8abUjEjEtvYueC4WKU&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=SIGITJDxI8GLswa4kpScCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CBwQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=e%20European%20Software%20Directive%20reverse%20engineering&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jenkins.eu/articles-general/reverse-engineering.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Requirements analysis''' in systems engineering and software engineering, encompasses those tasks that go into determining the needs or conditions to meet for a new or altered product, taking account of the possibly conflicting requirements of the various stakeholders, such as beneficiaries or users. 

Requirements analysis is critical to the success of a development project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Requirements must be documented, actionable, measurable, testable, related to identified business needs or opportunities, and defined to a level of detail sufficient for system design. Requirements can be architectural, structural, behavioral, functional, and non-functional.  

== Overview ==
Conceptually, requirements analysis includes three types of activity:
*Eliciting requirements: the task of communicating with customers and users to determine what their requirements are. This is sometimes also called requirements gathering.
*Analyzing requirements: determining whether the stated requirements are unclear, incomplete, ambiguous, or contradictory, and then resolving these issues.
*Recording requirements: Requirements might be documented in various forms, such as natural-language documents, use cases, user stories, or process specifications.

Requirements analysis can be a long and arduous process during which many delicate psychological skills are involved. New systems change the environment and relationships between people, so it is important to identify all the stakeholders, take into account all their needs and ensure they understand the implications of the new systems. Analysts can employ several techniques to elicit the requirements from the customer. Historically, this has included such things as holding interviews, or holding focus groups (more aptly named in this context as requirements workshops) and creating requirements lists. More modern techniques include prototyping, and use cases. Where necessary, the analyst will employ a combination of these methods to establish the exact requirements of the stakeholders, so that a system that meets the business needs is produced.

== Requirements engineering ==
Systematic requirements analysis is also known as '' requirements engineering''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes referred to loosely by names such as ''requirements gathering'', ''requirements capture'', or requirements specification. The term ''requirements analysis'' can also be applied specifically to the analysis proper, as opposed to elicitation or documentation of the requirements, for instance. Requirements Engineering can be divided into discrete chronological steps:
* Requirements elicitation,
* Requirements analysis and negotiation,
* Requirements specification,
* System modeling,
* Requirements validation,
* Requirements management.
Requirement engineering according to Laplante (2007) is &quot;a subdiscipline of systems engineering and software engineering that is concerned with determining the goals, functions, and constraints of hardware and software systems.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;PAL07&quot;&gt;Phillip A. Laplante (2007) ''What Every Engineer Should Know about Software Engineering''. Page 44.&lt;/ref&gt; In some life cycle models, the requirement engineering process begins with a feasibility study activity, which leads to a feasibility report. If the feasibility study suggests that the product should be developed, then requirement analysis can begin. If requirement analysis precedes feasibility studies, which may foster outside the box thinking, then feasibility should be determined before requirements are finalized.

== Requirements analysis topics ==
=== Stakeholder identification ===
See Stakeholder analysis for a discussion of business uses.
Stakeholders (SH) are people or organizations (legal entities such as companies, standards bodies) which have a valid interest in the system. They may be affected by it either directly or indirectly.
A major new emphasis in the 1990s was a focus on the identification of ''stakeholders''. It is increasingly recognized that stakeholders are not limited to the organization employing the analyst. Other stakeholders will include:
* anyone who operates the system (normal and maintenance operators)
* anyone who benefits from the system (functional, political, financial and social beneficiaries)
* anyone involved in purchasing or procuring the system. In a mass-market product organization, product management, marketing and sometimes sales act as surrogate consumers (mass-market customers) to guide development of the product
* organizations which regulate aspects of the system (financial, safety, and other regulators)
* people or organizations opposed to the system (negative stakeholders; see also Misuse case)
* organizations responsible for systems which interface with the system under design
* those organizations who integrate horizontally with the organization for whom the analyst is designing the system

=== Stakeholder interviews ===
Stakeholder interviews are a common technique used in requirement analysis. Though they are generally idiosyncratic in nature and focused upon the perspectives and perceived needs of the stakeholder, very often without larger enterprise or system context, this perspective deficiency has the general advantage of obtaining a much richer understanding of the stakeholder's unique business processes, decision-relevant business rules, and perceived needs. Consequently this technique can serve as a means of obtaining the highly focused knowledge that is often not elicited in Joint Requirements Development sessions, where the stakeholder's attention is compelled to assume a more cross-functional context. Moreover, the in-person nature of the interviews provides a more relaxed environment where lines of thought may be explored at length.

=== Joint Requirements Development (JRD) Sessions ===
Requirements often have cross-functional implications that are unknown to individual stakeholders and often missed or incompletely defined during stakeholder interviews. These cross-functional implications can be elicited by conducting JRD sessions in a controlled environment, facilitated by a trained facilitator, wherein stakeholders participate in discussions to elicit requirements, analyze their details and uncover cross-functional implications. A dedicated scribe and Business Analyst should be present to document the discussion. Utilizing the skills of a trained facilitator to guide the discussion frees the Business Analyst to focus on the requirements definition process.

JRD Sessions are analogous to  Joint Application Design Sessions. In the former, the sessions elicit requirements that guide design, whereas the latter elicit the specific design features to be implemented in satisfaction of elicited requirements.

=== Contract-style requirement lists ===
One traditional way of documenting requirements has been contract style requirement lists. In a complex system such requirements lists can run to hundreds of pages.

An appropriate metaphor would be an extremely long shopping list. Such lists are very much out of favour in modern analysis; as they have proved spectacularly unsuccessful at achieving their aims; but they are still seen to this day.

=====Strengths=====
* Provides a checklist of requirements.
* Provide a contract between the project sponsor(s) and developers.
* For a large system can provide a high level description.

=====Weaknesses=====
* Such lists can run to hundreds of pages. It is virtually impossible to read such documents as a whole and have a coherent understanding of the system.
* Such requirements lists abstract all the requirements and so there is little context
:* This abstraction makes it impossible to see how the requirements fit or work together.
:* This abstraction makes it difficult to prioritize requirements properly; while a list does make it easy to prioritize each individual item, removing one item out of context can render an entire use case or business requirement useless.
:* This abstraction increases the likelihood of misinterpreting the requirements; as more people read them, the number of (different) interpretations of the envisioned system increase.
:* This abstraction means that it's extremely difficult to be sure that you have the majority of the requirements. Necessarily, these documents speak in generality; but the devil, as they say, is in the details.
* These lists create a false sense of mutual understanding between the stakeholders and developers.
* These contract style lists give the stakeholders a false sense of security that the developers must achieve certain things. However, due to the nature of these lists, they inevitably miss out crucial requirements which are identified later in the process. Developers can use these discovered requirements to renegotiate the terms and conditions in their favour.heheheheheh
* These requirements lists are no help in system design, since they do not lend themselves to application.

=====Alternative to requirement lists=====
As an alternative to the large, pre-defined requirement lists Agile Software Development uses User stories to define a requirement in every day language.

=== Measurable goals ===
Best practices take the composed list of requirements merely as clues and repeatedly ask &quot;why?&quot; until the actual business purposes are discovered. Stakeholders and developers can then devise tests to measure what level of each goal has been achieved thus far.  Such goals change more slowly than the long list of specific but unmeasured requirements. Once a small set of critical, measured goals has been established, rapid prototyping and short iterative development phases may proceed to deliver actual stakeholder value long before the project is half over.

===Prototypes===
In the mid-1980s, prototyping was seen as the best solution to the requirements analysis problem. Prototypes are Mockups of an application. Mockups allow users to visualize an application that hasn't yet been constructed. Prototypes help users get an idea of what the system will look like, and make it easier for users to make design decisions without waiting for the system to be built. Major improvements in communication between users and developers were often seen with the introduction of prototypes. Early views of applications led to fewer changes later and hence reduced overall costs considerably.

However, over the next decade, while proving a useful technique, prototyping did not solve the requirements problem:
* Managers, once they see a prototype, may have a hard time understanding that the finished design will not be produced for some time.
* Designers often feel compelled to use patched together prototype code in the real system, because they are afraid to 'waste time' starting again.
* Prototypes principally help with design decisions and user interface design. However, they can not tell you what the requirements originally were.
* Designers and end-users can focus too much on user interface design and too little on producing a system that serves the business process.
* Prototypes work well for user interfaces, screen layout and screen flow but are not so useful for batch or asynchronous processes which may involve complex database updates and/or calculations. 

Prototypes can be flat diagrams (often referred to as wireframes) or working applications using synthesized functionality. Wireframes are made in a variety of graphic design documents, and often remove all color from the design (i.e. use a greyscale color palette) in instances where the final software is expected to have graphic design applied to it. This helps to prevent confusion over the final visual look and feel of the application.

===Use cases===
A use case is a technique for documenting the potential requirements of n a new system or software change.  Each use case provides one or more ''scenarios'' that convey how the system should interact with the end-user or another system to achieve a specific business goal.  Use cases typically avoid technical jargon, preferring instead the language of the end-user or ''domain expert''.  Use cases are often co-authored by requirements engineers and stakeholders.

Use cases are deceptively simple tools for describing the behavior of software or systems. A use case contains a textual description of all of the ways which the intended users could work with the software or system. Use cases do not describe any internal workings of the system, nor do they explain how that system will be implemented. They simply show the steps that a user follows to perform a task. All the ways that users interact with a system can be described in this manner.

===Software requirements specification===
A software requirements specification (SRS) is a complete description of the behavior of the system to be developed. It includes a set of use cases that describe all of the interactions that the users will have with the software.  Use cases are also known as functional requirements.  In addition to use cases, the SRS also contains nonfunctional (or supplementary) requirements. Non-functional requirements are requirements which impose constraints on the design or implementation (such as performance requirements, quality standards, or design constraints).

Recommended approaches for the specification of software requirements are described by IEEE 830-1998. This standard describes possible structures, desirable contents, and qualities of a software requirements specification.

== Types of Requirements ==
Requirements are categorized in several ways. The following are common categorizations of requirements that relate to technical management:&lt;ref name=&quot;SEF01&quot;/&gt; 

;Customer Requirements : Statements of fact and assumptions that define the expectations of the system in terms of mission objectives, environment, constraints, and measures of effectiveness and suitability (MOE/MOS). The customers are those that perform the eight primary functions of systems engineering, with special emphasis on the operator as the key customer. Operational requirements will define the basic need and, at a minimum, answer the questions posed in the following listing:&lt;ref name=&quot;SEF01&quot;/&gt;

*''Operational distribution or deployment'': Where will the system be used?
*''Mission profile or scenario'': How will the system accomplish its mission objective?
*''Performance and related parameters'': What are the critical system parameters to accomplish the mission?
*''Utilization environments'': How are the various system components to be used?
*''Effectiveness requirements'': How effective or efficient must the system be in performing its mission?
*''Operational life cycle'': How long will the system be in use by the user?
*''Environment'': What environments will the system be expected to operate in an effective manner?

; Architectural Requirements
: Architectural requirements explain what has to be done by identifying the necessary system architecture of a system.
; Structural Requirements
: Structural requirements explain what has to be done by identifying the necessary structure of a system.
; Behavioral Requirements
: Behavioral requirements explain what has to be done by identifying the necessary behavior of a system.
; Functional Requirements
: Functional requirements explain what has to be done by identifying the necessary task, action or activity that must be accomplished. Functional requirements analysis will be used as the toplevel functions for functional analysis.&lt;ref name=&quot;SEF01&quot;/&gt;
; Non-functional Requirements
: Non-functional requirements are requirements that specify criteria that can be used to judge the operation of a system, rather than specific behaviors.
; Performance Requirements
: The extent to which a mission or function must be executed; generally measured in terms of quantity, quality, coverage, timeliness or readiness. During requirements analysis, performance (how well does it have to be done) requirements will be interactively developed across all identified functions based on system life cycle factors; and characterized in terms of the degree of certainty in their estimate, the degree of criticality to system success, and their relationship to other requirements.&lt;ref name=&quot;SEF01&quot;/&gt;
; Design Requirements
: The “build to,” “code to,” and “buy to” requirements for products and “how to execute” requirements for processes expressed in technical data packages and technical manuals.&lt;ref name=&quot;SEF01&quot;/&gt;
; Derived Requirements
: Requirements that are implied or transformed from higher-level requirement. For example, a requirement for long range or high speed may result in a design requirement for low weight.&lt;ref name=&quot;SEF01&quot;/&gt;
; Allocated Requirements
: A requirement that is established by dividing or otherwise allocating a high-level requirement into multiple lower-level requirements. Example: A 100-pound item that consists of two subsystems might result in weight requirements of 70 pounds and 30 pounds for the two lower-level items.&lt;ref name=&quot;SEF01&quot;/&gt;

Well-known requirements categorization models include FURPS and FURPS+, developed at Hewlett-Packard.

== Requirements analysis issues==
===Stakeholder issues===
Steve McConnell, in his book ''Rapid Development'', details a number of ways users can inhibit requirements gathering:
* Users do not understand what they want or users don't have a clear idea of their requirements
* Users will not commit to a set of written requirements
* Users insist on new requirements after the cost and schedule have been fixed 
* Communication with users is slow
* Users often do not participate in reviews or are incapable of doing so
* Users are technically unsophisticated
* Users do not understand the development process
* Users do not know about present technology

This may lead to the situation where user requirements keep changing even when system or product development has been started.

===Engineer/developer issues===
Possible problems caused by engineers and developers during requirements analysis are:
* Technical personnel and end-users may have different vocabularies. Consequently, they may wrongly believe they are in perfect agreement until the finished product is supplied.
* Engineers and developers may try to make the requirements fit an existing system or model, rather than develop a system specific to the needs of the client.
* Analysis may often be carried out by engineers or programmers, rather than personnel with the people skills and the domain knowledge to understand a client's needs properly.

===Attempted solutions===
One attempted solution to communications problems has been to employ specialists in  business or system analysis. 

Techniques introduced in the 1990s like prototyping, Unified Modeling Language (UML), use cases, and Agile software development are also intended as solutions to problems encountered with previous methods.

Also, a new class of application simulation or application definition tools have entered the market. These tools are designed to bridge the communication gap between business users and the IT organization — and also to allow applications to be 'test marketed' before any code is produced. The best of these tools offer:
* electronic whiteboards to sketch application flows and test alternatives
* ability to capture business logic and data needs
* ability to generate high fidelity prototypes that closely imitate the final application
* interactivity
* capability to add contextual requirements and other comments
* ability for remote and distributed users to run and interact with the simulation

'''Requirements management''' is the process of documenting, analyzing, tracing, prioritizing and agreeing on requirements and then controlling change and communicating to relevant stakeholders. It is a continuous process throughout a project. A requirement is a capability to which a project outcome (product or service) should conform.

== Overview ==
The purpose of requirements management is to assure the organization documents, verifies and meets the needs and expectations of its customers and internal or external stakeholders&lt;ref name=&quot;Stellman05&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last=Stellman | first=Andrew | last2=Greene | first2=Jennifer | title=Applied Software Project Management | url=http://www.stellman-greene.com/aspm/ | publisher=O'Reilly Media | year=2005 | isbn=978-0-596-00948-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;. Requirements management begins with the analysis and elicitation of the objectives and constraints of the organization. Requirements management further includes supporting planning for requirements, integrating requirements and the organization for working with them (attributes for requirements), as well as relationships with other information delivering against requirements, and changes for these. 

The traceability thus established is used in managing requirements to report back fulfillment of company and stakeholder interests, in terms of compliance, completeness, coverage and consistency. Traceabilities also support change management as part of requirements management in understanding the impacts of changes through requirements or other related elements (e.g., functional impacts through relations to functional architecture), and facilitating introducing these changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ogc.gov.uk/delivery_lifecycle_requirements_management.asp |title=Requirements management |publisher=UK Office of Government Commerce  |accessdate=2009-11-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Requirements management involves communication between the project team members and stakeholders, and adjustment to requirements changes throughout the course of the project&lt;ref name=&quot;PMBOK08&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title=A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge | edition=4th | url=http://www.pmi.org/ | publisher=Project Management Institute | year=2008 | isbn=978-1-933-89051-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;. To prevent one class of requirements from overriding another, constant communication among members of the development team is critical. For example, in software development for internal applications, the business has such strong needs that it may ignore user requirements, or believe that in creating use cases, the user requirements are being taken care of.

==Traceability==
Requirements traceability is concerned with documenting the life of a requirement. It should be possible to trace back to the origin of each requirement and every change made to the requirement should therefore be documented in order to achieve traceability. Even the use of the requirement after the implemented features have been deployed and used should be traceable&lt;ref&gt;Gotel, O., Finkelstein, A. An Analysis of the Requirements Traceability Problem Proc. of First International Conference on Requirements Engineering, 1994, pages 94-101&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Requirements come from different sources, like the business person ordering the product, the marketing manager and the actual user. These people all have different requirements for the product. Using requirements traceability, an implemented feature can be traced back to the person or group that wanted it during the requirements elicitation. This can, for example, be used during the development process to prioritize the requirement, determining how valuable the requirement is to a specific user. It can also be used after the deployment when user studies show that a feature is not used, to see why it was required in the first place.

==Requirements activities==
At each stage in a development process, there are key requirements management activities and methods. To illustrate, consider a standard five-phase development process with Investigation, Feasibility, Design, Construction and Test, and Release stages.

===Investigation===
In Investigation, the first three classes of requirements are gathered from the users, from the business and from the development team. In each area, similar questions are asked; what are the goals, what are the constraints, what are the current tools or processes in place, and so on. Only when these requirements are well understood can functional requirements be developed.

A caveat is required here: no matter how hard a team tries, requirements cannot be fully defined at the beginning of the project. Some requirements will change, either because they simply weren’t extracted, or because internal or external forces at work affect the project in mid-cycle. Thus, the team members must agree at the outset that a prime condition for success is flexibility in thinking and operation.

The deliverable from the Investigation stage is a requirements document that has been approved by all members of the team. Later, in the thick of development, this document will be critical in preventing scope creep or unnecessary changes. As the system develops, each new feature opens a world of new possibilities, so the requirements specification anchors the team to the original vision and permits a controlled discussion of scope change.

While many organizations still use only documents to manage requirements, others manage their requirements baselines using software tools. These tools allow requirements to be managed in a database, and usually have functions to automate traceability (e.g., by allowing electronic links to be created between parent and child requirements, or between test cases and requirements), electronic baseline creation, version control, and change management. Usually such tools contain an export function that allows a specification document to be created by exporting the requirements data into a standard document application.

===Feasibility===
In the Feasibility stage, costs of the requirements are determined. For user requirements, the current cost of work is compared to the future projected costs once the new system is in place. Questions such as these are asked: “What are data entry errors costing us now?” Or “What is the cost of scrap due to operator error with the current interface?” Actually, the need for the new tool is often recognized as these questions come to the attention of financial people in the organization.

Business costs would include, “What department has the budget for this?” “What is the expected rate of return on the new product in the marketplace?” “What’s the internal rate of return in reducing costs of training and support if we make a new, easier-to-use system?”

Technical costs are related to software development costs and hardware costs. “Do we have the right people to create the tool?” “Do we need new equipment to support expanded software roles?” This last question is an important type. The team must inquire into whether the newest automated tools will add sufficient processing power to shift some of the burden from the user to the system in order to save people time.

The question also points out a fundamental point about requirements management. A human and a tool form a system, and this realization is especially important if the tool is a computer or a new application on a computer. The human mind excels in parallel processing and interpretation of trends with insufficient data. The CPU excels in serial processing and accurate mathematical computation. The overarching goal of the requirements management effort for a software project would thus be to make sure the work being automated gets assigned to the proper processor. For instance, “Don’t make the human remember where she is in the interface. Make the interface report the human’s location in the system at all times.” Or “Don’t make the human enter the same data in two screens. Make the system store the data and fill in the second screen as needed.”

The deliverable from the Feasibility stage is the budget and schedule for the project.

===Design===
Assuming that costs are accurately determined and benefits to be gained are sufficiently large, the project can proceed to the Design stage. In Design, the main requirements management activity is comparing the results of the design against the requirements document to make sure that work is staying in scope.

Again, flexibility is paramount to success. Here’s a classic story of scope change in mid-stream that actually worked well. Ford auto designers in the early ‘80s were expecting gasoline prices to hit $3.18 per gallon by the end of the decade. Midway through the design of the Ford Taurus, prices had centered to around $1.50 a gallon. The design team decided they could build a larger, more comfortable, and more powerful car if the gas prices stayed low, so they redesigned the car. The Taurus launch set nationwide sales records when the new car came out, primarily because it was so roomy and comfortable to drive.

In most cases, however, departing from the original requirements to that degree does not work. So the requirements document becomes a critical tool that helps the team make decisions about design changes.

===Construction and test===
In the construction and testing stage, the main activity of requirements management is to make sure that work and cost stay within schedule and budget, and that the emerging tool does in fact meet requirements. A main tool used in this stage is  prototype construction and iterative testing. For a software application, the user interface can be created on paper and tested with potential users while the framework of the software is being built. Results of these tests are recorded in a user interface design guide and handed off to the design team when they are ready to develop the interface. This saves their time and makes their jobs much easier.

===Release===
Requirements management does not end with product release. From that point on, the data coming in about the application’s acceptability is gathered and fed into the Investigation phase of the next generation or release. Thus the process begins again.

==Tools==
There exist both desktop and Web-based tools for requirements management. A Web-based requirements tool can be installed at the customer′s datacenter or can be offered as an on-demand requirements management platform which in some cases is completely free.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |url=http://www.incose.org/ProductsPubs/products/rmsurvey.aspx |title=Requirements Management Tools Survey |publisher=International Council on Systems Engineering  |accessdate=2009-11-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modeling Languages ===
The system engineering modeling language SysML incorporates a requirements diagram allowing the developer to graphically organize, manage, and trace requirements.

=== On-demand requirements management platforms ===
An on-demand requirements management platform is a fully hosted requirements management solution, where the only system requirements would normally be Internet access and a standard Web browser. 

The service would normally include all special hardware and software. Other services may include technology and processes designed to secure your data against physical loss and unauthorized use, 24×7 data availability, and assurance that the service will scale as you add users, applications, and additional activities.

Some on-demand requirements management platforms charge a fee while others are free to use.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''reengineering''' of software was described by Chikofsky and Cross in their 1990 paper&lt;ref&gt;Chikofsky, E. and Cross, J., 1990. Reverse Engineering and Design Recovery: A Taxonomy. IEEE Software, 7(1):13-18.&lt;/ref&gt;, as '''&quot;The examination and alteration of a system to reconstitute it in a new form&quot;'''. Less formally, reengineering is the modification of a software system that takes place after it has been reverse engineered, generally to add new functionality, or to correct errors. 

This entire process is often erroneously referred to as reverse engineering; however, it is more accurate to say that reverse engineering is the initial examination of the system, and reengineering is the subsequent modification.

Re-engineering is mostly used in the context where a legacy system is involved&lt;ref&gt;Asit Kumar Gahalaut et. al. / International Journal of Engineering Science and Technology  Vol. 2(06), 2010, 2296-2303 &lt;/ref&gt;. Software systems are evolving on high rate because there more research to make the better so therefore software system in most cases, legacy software needs to operate on a new computing platform.
''''Re-engineering'''' is a set of activities that are carried out to re-structure a legacy system to a new system with better functionalities and conform to the hardware and software quality constraint.

[[Image:Specification and Levels of Development.jpg|thumb|360px|Systems engineering model of Specification and Levels of Development. During system development a series of specifications are generated to describe the system at different levels of detail. These program unique specifications form the core of the configuration baselines. As shown here, in addition to referring to different levels within the system hierarchy, these baselines are defined at different phases of the design process.&lt;ref name=&quot;SEF01&quot;&gt; [http://www.dau.mil/pubscats/PubsCats/SEFGuide%2001-01.pdf ''Systems Engineering Fundamentals.''] Defense Acquisition University Press, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;]]

A '''functional specification''' (also, ''functional spec'', ''specs'', ''functional specifications document (FSD)'', or ''Program specification'') in systems engineering and software development is the documentation that describes the requested behavior of an engineering system. The documentation typically describes what is needed by the system user as well as requested properties of inputs and outputs (e.g. of the software system).

== Overview ==
In systems engineering a specification is a document that clearly and accurately describes the essential technical requirements for items, materials, or services including the procedures by which it can be determined that the requirements have been met. Specifications help avoid duplication and inconsistencies, allow for accurate estimates of necessary work and resources, act as a negotiation and reference document for engineering changes, provide documentation of configuration, and allow for consistent communication among those responsible for the eight primary functions of Systems Engineering. They provide a precise idea of the problem to be solved so that they can efficiently design the system and estimate the cost of design alternatives. They provide guidance to testers for verification (qualification) of each technical requirement.&lt;ref name=&quot;SEF01&quot;/&gt;

A functional specification does not define the inner workings of the proposed system; it does not include the specification how the system function will be implemented.  Instead, it focuses on what various outside agents (people using the program, computer peripherals, or other computers, for example) might &quot;observe&quot; when interacting with the system. A typical functional specification might state the following:

:''When the user clicks the OK button, the dialog is closed and the focus is returned to the main window in the state it was in before this dialog was displayed.''

Such a requirement describes an interaction between an external agent (the user) and the software system.  When the user provides input to the system by clicking the OK button, the program responds (or should respond) by closing the dialog window containing the OK button.

It can be ''informal'', in which case it can be considered as a blueprint or user manual from a developer point of view, or ''formal'', in which case it has a definite meaning defined in mathematical or programmatic terms. In practice, most successful specifications are written to understand and fine-tune applications that were already well-developed, although safety-critical software systems are often carefully specified prior to application development. Specifications are most important for external interfaces that must remain stable.

== Functional specification topics ==
=== Purpose ===
There are many purposes for functional specifications.  One of the primary purposes on team projects is to achieve some form of team consensus on what the program is to achieve before making the more time-consuming effort of writing source code and test cases, followed by a period of debugging.  Typically, such consensus is reached after one or more reviews by the stakeholders on the project at hand after having negotiated a cost-effective way to achieve the requirements the software needs to fulfill.

=== Process ===
In the ordered industrial software engineering life-cycle (waterfall model), functional specification describes what has to be implemented. The next system specification document describes how the functions will be realized using a chosen software environment. In not industrial, prototypical systems development, functional specifications are typically written after or as part of requirements analysis.

When the team agrees that functional specification consensus is reached, the functional spec is typically declared &quot;complete&quot; or &quot;signed off&quot;.  After this, typically the software development and testing team write source code and test cases using the functional specification as the reference.  While testing is performed the behavior of the program is compared against the expected behavior as defined in the functional specification.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Obfuscated code''' is source or machine code that has been made difficult to understand for humans. Programmers may deliberately obfuscate code to conceal its purpose (security through obscurity) or its logic to prevent tampering, deter reverse engineering, or as a puzzle or recreational challenge for someone reading the source code. Programs known as ''obfuscators'' transform readable code into obfuscated code using various techniques. Code obfuscation is different in essence from hardware obfuscation, where description and/or structure of a circuit is modified to hide its functionality.

==Overview==
Some languages may be more prone to obfuscation than others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.devx.com/MicrosoftISV/Article/11351 Obfuscation: Cloaking your Code from Prying Eyes]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000291.html Jeff Atwood, May 15 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; C,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kenter.demon.nl/obfuscate.html Obfuscation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; C++,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dreamincode.net/forums/index.php?showtopic=38102 C++ Tutorials - Obfuscated Code - A Simple Introduction | DreamInCode.net&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and Perl&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=291267 Pe(a)rls in line noise]&lt;/ref&gt; are some examples. 

==Recreational obfuscation==

Writing and reading obfuscated source code can be a brain teaser for programmers. A number of programming contests reward the most creatively obfuscated code: the International Obfuscated C Code Contest, Obfuscated Perl Contest, and [http://iorcc.blogspot.com/ International Obfuscated Ruby Code Contest].

Types of obfuscations include simple keyword substitution, use or non-use of whitespace to create artistic effects, and self-generating or heavily compressed programs.

Short obfuscated Perl programs may be used in signatures of Perl programmers.  These are JAPHs (&quot;Just another Perl hacker&quot;).{{fact|date=December 2010}}

===Examples===

&lt;/source&gt;
Modern C compilers don't allow constant strings to be overwritten,
which can be avoided by changing &quot;*M&quot; to &quot;M[3]&quot; and omitting &quot;M=&quot;.

An example of a JAPH:

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
@P=split//,&quot;.URRUU\c8R&quot;;@d=split//,&quot;\nrekcah xinU / lreP rehtona tsuJ&quot;;sub p{

close$_}%p;wait until$?;map{/^r/&amp;&amp;&lt;$_&gt;}%p;$_=$d[$q];sleep rand(2)if/\S/;print
&lt;/source&gt;

This slowly displays the text &quot;Just another Perl / Unix hacker&quot;, multiple characters at a time, with delays. An explanation can be found [http://perl.plover.com/obfuscated/ here].

Some Python examples can be found in the [http://www.python.org/doc/faq/programming/#is-it-possible-to-write-obfuscated-one-liners-in-python official Python programming FAQ].

==Disadvantages of obfuscation==
At best, obfuscation merely makes it time-consuming, but not impossible, to reverse engineer a program. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.math.ias.edu/~boaz/Papers/obf_informal.html &quot;Can We Obfuscate Programs?&quot; by Boaz Barak]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Obfuscating software==
A variety of tools exists to perform or assist with code obfuscation.
These include experimental research tools created by academics, hobbyist tools,
commercial products written by professionals, and open-source software. 
There also exist deobfuscation tools that attempt to perform the reverse
transformation.

Although the majority of commercial obfuscation solutions work by transforming
either program source

== Introduction ==
When you build your house, you would never think about building it without an architect, correct?  However, many medium to large size software projects are build without a software architect.  That seems kind of scary, and you might wonder why?  Well, the role of the software architect has neither been widely understood, nor his necessity been acknowledged.  Even to date there is still no agreement on the precise definition of the term “software architecture”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=SEI|title= How do you define Software Architecture?|url= http://www.sei.cmu.edu/architecture/start/definitions.cfm |year=2006|accessdate=2006-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Matthew R. McBride writes, &quot;a software architect is a technically competent system-level thinker, guiding planned and efficient design processes to bring a system into existence.  He is viewed by customers and developers alike as a technical expert.  The architect is the author of the solution, accountable for its success or failure.&quot;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McBride|first=Matthew R.|title=The software architect: essence, intuition, and guiding principles|publisher = ACM|year=2004|location=New York|pages=230-235|isbn=1-58113-833-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term software architecture also refers to documentation of a system's software architecture.  Documenting software architecture facilitates communication between stakeholders, documents early decisions about high-level design, and allows reuse of design components and patterns between projects.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book|last=Bass|first=Len|coauthors=Paul Clements, Rick Kazman|title=Software Architecture In Practice, Second Edition|publisher = Addison-Wesley|year=2003|location=Boston|pages=21–24|isbn=0-321-15495-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==== Architecture and Design ====
Software architecture, also described as strategic design, is an activity concerned with global requirements governing ''how'' a solution is implemented such as programming paradigms, architectural styles, component-based software engineering standards, architectural patterns, security, scale, integration, and law-governed regularities.  Functional design, also described as tactical design, is an activity concerned with local requirements governing ''what'' a solution does such as algorithms, design patterns, programming idioms, refactorings, and low-level implementation. 

Architecture is design but not all design is architectural.&lt;ref name=&quot;DSA2&quot;&gt;
{{cite book|last=Clements|first=Paul|coauthors=Felix Bachmann, Len Bass, David Garlan, James Ivers, Reed Little, Paulo Merson, Robert Nord, Judith Stafford|title=Documenting Software Architectures: Views and Beyond, Second Edition|publisher = Addison-Wesley|date=2010|location=Boston|isbn=0321552687}}&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, the architect is the one who draws the line between software architecture (architectural design) and detailed design (non-architectural design). There aren't rules or guidelines that fit all cases. Examples of rules or heuristics that architects (or organizations) can establish when they want to distinguish between architecture and detailed design include:
* Architecture is driven by non-functional requirements, while functional design is driven by functional requirements. 
* Pseudo-code belongs in the detailed design document.
* UML component, deployment, and package diagrams generally appear in software architecture documents; UML class, object, and behavior diagrams appear in detailed functional design documents.


== Software Architecture ==
The field of computer science has come across problems associated with complexity since its formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=University of Waterloo|title= A Very Brief History of Computer Science |url=http://www.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~shallit/Courses/134/history.html |year=2006|accessdate=2006-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier problems of complexity were solved by developers by choosing the right data structures, developing algorithms, and by applying the concept of separation of concerns. Although the term “software architecture” is relatively new to the industry, the fundamental principles of the field have been applied sporadically by software engineering pioneers since the mid 1980s. Early attempts to capture and explain software architecture of a system were imprecise and disorganized, often characterized by a set of box-and-line diagrams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering|title= Introduction to the Special Issue on Software Architecture |url=http://csdl2.computer.org/persagen/DLAbsToc.jsp?resourcePath=/dl/trans/ts/&amp;toc=comp/trans/ts/1995/04/e4toc.xml&amp;DOI=10.1109/TSE.1995.10003
|year=2006|accessdate=2006-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1990s there was a concentrated effort to define and codify fundamental aspects of the discipline. Initial sets of design patterns, styles, best practices, description languages, and formal logic were developed during that time.

As a maturing discipline with no clear rules on the right way to build a system, designing software architecture is still a mix of art and science. The “art” aspect of software architecture is because a commercial software system supports some aspect of a business or a mission. How a system supports key business drivers is described via scenarios as non-functional requirements of a system, also known as quality attributes, determine how a system will behave.&lt;ref name=&quot;softwareqa&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=SoftwareArchitectures.com|title= Intro to Software Quality Attributes |url=http://www.softwarearchitectures.com/one/Designing+Architecture/78.aspx |year=2006|accessdate=2006-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Every system is unique due to the nature of the business drivers it supports, as such the degree of quality attributes exhibited by a system such as fault-tolerance, backward compatibility, extensibility, reliability, maintainability, availability, security, usability, and such other –ilities will vary with each implementation.&lt;ref name=&quot;softwareqa&quot;/&gt;

The origin of software architecture as a concept was first identified in the research work of Edsger Dijkstra in 1968 and David Parnas in the early 1970s. These scientists emphasized that the structure of a software system matters and getting the structure right is critical. The study of the field increased in popularity since the early 1990s with research work concentrating on architectural styles (patterns), architecture description languages, architecture documentation, and formal methods&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Garlan &amp; Shaw |title= An Introduction to Software Architecture |url= http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/able/ftp/intro_softarch/intro_softarch.pdf |year=1994|accessdate=2006-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Views and UML ===
Although there exist 'architecture description languages' (see below), no consensus exists on which symbol-set or language should be used.  However, as already indicated above, UML is a standard used regularly by architects.  For instance, UML component, deployment, and package diagrams generally appear in software architecture documents.  Thus, the UML is a visual language that is often being used to create software architecture views.

Software architecture views are analogous to the different types of blueprints made in building architecture. A view is a representation of a set of system components and relationships among them. &lt;ref name=&quot;DSA2&quot;/&gt;  Some possible views are:
*Functional/logic view
*Code/module view
*Development/structural view
*Concurrency/process/runtime/thread view
*Physical/deployment/install view
*User action/feedback view
*Data view/data model 

=== Architecture Frameworks ===
There are several architecture frameworks related to the domain of software architecture, most well known being the '4+1' model.  Also the Reference Model of Open Distributed Processing (RM-ODP) and the Service-Oriented Modeling Framework (SOMF) are being used.  Other architectures such as the Zachman Framework, DODAF, and TOGAF relate to the field of Enterprise architecture.

=== Architecture Description Languages ===
Several languages for describing software architectures ('architecture description language' (ADL) in ISO/IEC 42010 / IEEE-1471 terminology) have been devised.  ADLs  are used to describe a Software Architecture. Several different ADLs have been developed by different organizations, including AADL (SAE standard), Wright (developed by Carnegie Mellon), Acme (developed by Carnegie Mellon), xADL (developed by UCI), Darwin (developed by Imperial College London), DAOP-ADL (developed by University of Málaga), and ByADL (University of L'Aquila, Italy). Common elements of an ADL are component, connector and configuration.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''decompiler''' is the name given to a computer program that performs the reverse operation to that of a compiler.  That is, it translates a file containing information at a relatively low level of abstraction (usually designed to be computer readable rather than human readable) into a form having a higher level of abstraction (usually designed to be human readable).

==Introduction==
The term ''decompiler'' is most commonly applied to a program which translates executable programs (the output from a compiler) into source code in a (relatively) high level language which, when compiled, will produce an executable whose behavior is the same as the original executable program. By comparison, a disassembler translates an executable program into assembly language (and an assembler could be used to assemble it back into an executable program).

Decompilation is the act of using a decompiler, although the term, when used as a noun, can also refer to the output of a decompiler. It can be used for the recovery of lost source code, and is also useful in some cases for computer security, interoperability and error correction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.program-transformation.org/Transform/WhyDecompilation |title=Why Decompilation |publisher=Program-transformation.org |date=2005-04-11 |accessdate=2010-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The success of decompilation depends on the amount of information present in the code being decompiled and the sophistication of the analysis performed on it. The bytecode formats used by many virtual machines (such as the Java Virtual Machine or the .NET Framework Common Language Runtime) often include extensive metadata and high-level features that make decompilation quite feasible. The presence of debug data can make it possible to reproduce the original variable and structure names and even the line numbers. Machine language without such metadata or debug data is much harder to decompile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|contribution=Decompiling Java Bytecode: Problems, Traps and Pitfalls|first1=Jerome|last1=Miecznikowski|first2=Laurie|loast2=Hendren|

isbn=3-540-43369-4|publisher=Springer-Verlag|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some compilers and post-compilation tools produce obfuscated code (that is, they attempt to produce output that is very difficult to decompile). This is done to make it more difficult to reverse engineer the executable.

==Design==
Decompilers can be thought of as composed of a series of phases each of which contributes specific aspects of the overall decompilation process.

===Loader===
The first decompilation phase loads and parses the input machine code or intermediate language program's binary file format. It should be able to discover basic facts about the input program, such as the architecture (Pentium, PowerPC, etc), and the entry point. In many cases, it should be able to find the equivalent of the &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; function of a C program, which is the start of the user written code. This excludes the runtime initialization code, which should not be decompiled if possible. If available the symbol tables and debug data are also loaded. The front end may be able to identify the libraries used even if they are linked with the code, this will provide library interfaces. If it can determine the compiler or compilers used it may provide useful information in identifying code idioms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Decompilation of Binary Programs|journal=Software Practice and Experience|first1=Cristina|last1=Cifuentes|first2=K. John|last2=Gough|volume=25|issue=7|pages=811–829|year=1995|month=July|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.14.8073&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disassembly===
The next logical phase is the disassembly of machine code instructions into a machine independent intermediate representation (IR). For example, the Pentium machine instruction
    mov    eax, [ebx+0x04]
might be translated to the IR
    eax := m[ebx+4];

===Idioms===
Idiomatic machine code sequences are sequences of code whose combined semantics is not immediately apparent from the instructions' individual semantics. Either as part of the disassembly phase, or as part of later analyses, these idiomatic sequences need to be translated into known equivalent IR. For example, the x86 assembly code:
    cdq    eax             ; edx is set to the sign-extension of eax
    xor    eax, edx
    sub    eax, edx
could be translated to
    eax := abs(eax);

Some idiomatic sequences are machine independent; some involve only one instruction. For example, &lt;code&gt;xor eax, eax&lt;/code&gt; clears the &lt;code&gt;eax&lt;/code&gt; register (sets it to zero). This can be implemented with a machine independent simplification rule, such as &lt;code&gt;a xor a = 0&lt;/code&gt;.

In general, it is best to delay detection of idiomatic sequences if possible, to later stages that are less affected by instruction ordering. For example, the instruction scheduling phase of a compiler may insert other instructions into an idiomatic sequence, or change the ordering of instructions in the sequence. A pattern matching process in the disassembly phase would probably not recognize the altered pattern. Later phases group instruction expressions into more complex expressions, and modify them into a canonical (standardized) form, making it more likely that even the altered idiom will match a higher level pattern later in the decompilation.

It is particularly important to recognize the compiler idioms for subroutine calls, exception handling, and switch statements. Some languages also have extensive support for strings or long integers.

===Program analysis===
Various program analyses can be applied to the IR. In particular, expression propagation combines the semantics of several instructions into more complex expressions. For example,
    mov   eax,[ebx+0x04]
    add   eax,[ebx+0x08]
    sub   [ebx+0x0C],eax
could result in the following IR after expression propagation:
    m[ebx+12] := m[ebx+12] - (m[ebx+4] + m[ebx+8]);
The resulting expression is more like high level language, and has also eliminated the use of the machine register &lt;code&gt;eax&lt;/code&gt; . Later analyses may eliminate the &lt;code&gt;ebx&lt;/code&gt; register.

===Data flow analysis===
The places where register contents are defined and used must be traced using data flow analysis. The same analysis can be applied to locations that are used for temporaries and local data. A different name  can then be formed for each such connected set of value definitions and uses. It is possible that the same local variable location was used for more than one variable in different parts of the original program. Even worse it is possible for the data flow analysis to identify a path whereby a value may flow between two such uses even though it would never actually happen or matter in reality. This may in bad cases lead to needing to define a location as a union of types. The decompiler may allow  the user to explicitly break such unnatural dependencies which will lead to clearer code. This of course means a variable is potentially used without being initialized and so indicates a problem in the original program.

===Type analysis===
A good machine code decompiler will perform type analysis. Here, the way registers or memory locations are used result in constraints on the possible type of the location. For example, an &lt;code&gt;and&lt;/code&gt; instruction implies that the operand is an integer; programs do not use such an operation on floating point values (except in special library code) or on pointers. An &lt;code&gt;add&lt;/code&gt; instruction results in three constraints, since the operands may be both integer, or one integer and one pointer (with integer and pointer results respectively; the third constraint comes from the ordering of the two operands when the types are different).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|contribution=Type-Based Decompilation|title=Programming languages and systems: 8th European Symposium on Programming Languages and Systems
|first1=Alan|last1=Mycroft|editor=S. Doaitse Swierstra|pages=208–223|year=1999|publisher=Springer-Verlag|isbn=3-540-65699-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various high level expressions can be recognized which trigger recognition of structures or arrays. However, it is difficult to distinguish many of the possibilities, because of the freedom that machine code or even some high level languages such as C allow with casts and pointer arithmetic.

The example from the previous section could result in the following high level code:

 struct T1 *ebx;
    struct T1 {
        int v0004; 
        int v0008;
        int v000C;
    };
  ebx-&gt;v000C -= ebx-&gt;v0004 + ebx-&gt;v0008;

===Structuring===
The penultimate decompilation phase involves structuring of the IR into higher level constructs such as &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt; loops and &lt;code&gt;if/then/else&lt;/code&gt; conditional statements. For example, the machine code
    xor eax, eax
 l0002:
    or  ebx, ebx
    jge l0003
    add eax,[ebx]
    mov ebx,[ebx+0x4]
    jmp l0002    
 l0003:
    mov [0x10040000],eax

could be translated into:

    eax = 0;
    while (ebx &lt; 0) {
        eax += ebx-&gt;v0000;
        ebx = ebx-&gt;v0004;
    }
    v10040000 = eax;

Unstructured code is more difficult to translate into structured code than already structured code. Solutions include replicating some code, or adding boolean variables.&lt;ref&gt;C. Cifuentes. ''Reverse Compilation Techniques''. PhD thesis, Queensland University of Technology, 1994. (available as [http://web.archive.org/web/20051216200552/http://www.itee.uq.edu.au/~cristina/dcc/decompilation_thesis.ps.gz compressed postscript Chapter 6])&lt;/ref&gt;

===Code generation===
The final phase is the generation of the high level code in the back end of the decompiler. Just as a compiler may have several back ends for generating machine code for different architectures, a decompiler may have several back ends for generating high level code in different high level languages.

Just before code generation, it may be desirable to allow an interactive editing of the IR, perhaps using some form of graphical user interface. This would allow the user to enter comments, and non-generic variable and function names. However, these are almost as easily entered in a post decompilation edit. The user may want to change structural aspects, such as converting a &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt; loop to a &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; loop. These are less readily modified with a simple text editor, although source code refactoring tools may assist with this process. The user may need to enter information that failed to be identified during the type analysis phase, e.g. modifying a memory expression to an array or structure expression. Finally, incorrect IR may need to be corrected, or changes made to cause the output code to be more readable.

==Legality==
The majority of computer programs are covered by copyright laws. Although the precise scope of what is covered by copyright differs from region to region, copyright law generally provides the author (the programmer(s) or employer) with a collection of exclusive rights to the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Informtion technology law|first=Diane|last=Rowland|year=2005|edition=3rd|publisher=Cavendish|isbn=1-85941-756-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; These rights include the right to make copies, including copies made into the computer's RAM{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}.
Since the decompilation process involves making multiple such copies, it is generally prohibited without the authorization of the copyright holder. However, because decompilation is often a necessary step in achieving software  interoperability, copyright laws in both the United States and Europe permit decompilation to a limited extent.

In the United States, the copyright fair use defense has been successfully invoked in decompilation cases. For example, in ''[http://digital-law-online.info/cases/24PQ2D1561.htm Sega v. Accolade]'', the court held that Accolade could lawfully engage in decompilation in order to circumvent the software locking mechanism used by Sega's game consoles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.program-transformation.org/Transform/LegalityOfDecompilation |title=The Legality of Decompilation |publisher=Program-transformation.org |date=2004-12-03 |accessdate=2010-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe, the [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31991L0250:EN:HTML 1991 Software Directive] explicitly provides for a right to decompile in order to achieve interoperability. The result of a heated debate between, on the one side, software protectionists, and, on the other, academics as well as independent software developers, Article 6 permits decompilation only if a number of conditions are met:

*First, a person or entity must have a license to use the program to be decompiled.
*Second, decompilation must be necessary to achieve interoperability with the target program or other programs. Interoperability information should therefore not be readily available, such as through manuals or API documentation. This is an important limitation. The necessity must be proven by the decompiler. The purpose of this important limitation is primarily to provide an incentive for developers to document and disclose their products' interoperability information.&lt;ref&gt;B. Czarnota and R.J. Hart, ''Legal protection of computer programs in Europe: a guide to the EC directive''. 1991, London: Butterworths.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Third, the decompilation process must, if possible, be confined to the parts of the target program relevant to interoperability. Since one of the purposes of decompilation is to gain an understanding of the program structure, this third limitation may be difficult to meet. Again, the burden of proof is on the decompiler.

In addition, Article 6 prescribes that the information obtained through decompilation may not be used for other purposes and that it may not be given to others.

Overall, the decompilation right provided by Article 6 codifies what is claimed to be common practice in the software industry. Few European lawsuits are known to have emerged from the decompilation right. This could be interpreted as meaning either one of two things: 1) the decompilation right is not used frequently and the decompilation right may therefore have been unnecessary, or 2) the decompilation right functions well and provides sufficient legal certainty not to give rise to legal disputes. In a [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:52000DC0199:EN:HTML recent report] regarding implementation of the Software Directive by the European member states, the European Commission seems to support the second interpretation.

== Software Design ==
The result of the software requirements analysis (SRA) usually is a specification.  The design helps us turning this specification into a working system.  As we have seen there are different kinds of software designs, the IEEE Std 610.12-1990 Standard Glossary of Software Engineering Terminology&lt;ref&gt;http://standards.ieee.org/findstds/standard/610.12-1990.html the IEEE Std 610.12-1990, IEEE standard glossary of software engineering terminology&lt;/ref&gt; defines the following distinctions:
* Architectural Design: the process of defining a collection of hardware and software components and their interfaces to establish the framework for the development of a computer system.
* Detailed Design: the process of refining and expanding the preliminary design of a system or component to the extent that the design is sufficiently complete to begin implementation.
* Functional Design: the process of defining the working relationships among the components of a system.
* Preliminary Design: the process of analyzing design alternatives and defining the architecture, components, interfaces, and timing/sizing estimates for a system or components.

Hence software design includes architectural views, but also low-level component and algorithm implementation issues.  Depending on the type, a software design may be platform-independent or platform-specific.

=== Design Considerations ===
There are many aspects to consider in the design of a piece of software.  The importance of each should reflect the goals the software is trying to achieve.  Some of these aspects are:

* '''Compatibility''' - The software is able to operate with other products that are designed for interoperability with another product.  For example, a piece of software may be backward-compatible with an older version of itself.
* '''Extensibility''' - New capabilities can be added to the software without major changes to the underlying architecture.
* '''Fault-tolerance''' - The software is resistant to and able to recover from component failure.
* '''Maintainability''' - The software can be restored to a specified condition within a specified period of time.  For example, antivirus software may include the ability to periodically receive virus definition updates in order to maintain the software's effectiveness.
* '''Modularity''' - the resulting software comprises well defined, independent components. That leads to better maintainability. The components could be then implemented and tested in isolation before being integrated to form a desired software system. This allows division of work in a software development project.
* '''Packaging''' - Printed material such as the box and manuals should match the style designated for the target market and should enhance usability. All compatibility information should be visible on the outside of the package. All components required for use should be included in the package or specified as a requirement on the outside of the package.
* '''Reliability''' - The software is able to perform a required function under stated conditions for a specified period of time.
* '''Reusability''' - the software is able to add further features and modification with slight or no modification.
* '''Robustness''' - The software is able to operate under stress or tolerate unpredictable or invalid input.  For example, it can be designed with a resilience to low memory conditions.
* '''Security''' - The software is able to withstand hostile acts and influences.
* '''Usability''' - The software user interface must be usable for its target user/audience. Default values for the parameters must be chosen so that they are a good choice for the majority of the users.

=== Modeling Language ===
Designers are assisted be the existence of modeling languages. They can be used to express information, knowledge or systems in a structure that is defined by a consistent set of rules. A modeling language can be graphical or textual. Examples of graphical modelling languages for software design are:
* Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a general modeling language to describe software both structurally and behaviorally.  It has a graphical notation and allows for extension with a Profile (UML).
* Flowchart is a schematic representation of an algorithm or a stepwise process,
* Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN) is an example of a Process Modeling language.
* Systems Modeling Language (SysML) is a new general-purpose modeling language for systems engineering.

There is quite a few more, but we will concentrate mostly on the UML as we will see in the next chapter.

== Design Patterns ==
If you remember, software engineers speak a common language called UML.  And if we use this analogy of language, then ''design patterns'' are the common stories our culture shares, like for instance fairy tales.  They are stories about commonly occurring problems in software design and their solutions.  And as young children learn about good and evil from fairy tales, beginning software engineers learn about good design (design patterns) and bad design (anti-patterns).  

=== History ===
Patterns originated as an architectural concept by Christopher Alexander (1977/79). In 1987, Kent Beck and Ward Cunningham began experimenting with the idea of applying patterns to programming and presented their results at the OOPSLA conference that year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith1987&quot;&gt;{{cite conference

He pointed out that a written 'pattern language' can significantly improve the selection and application of abstractions. He proposed a 'radical shift in the burden of design and implementation' basing the new methodology on an adaptation of Christopher Alexander's work in pattern languages and that programming-oriented pattern languages developed at Tektronix has significantly aided their software development efforts.&quot;''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Beck1987&quot;&gt;{{cite conference

Design patterns gained popularity in computer science after the book ''Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software'' was published in 1994 &lt;!-- 1994, not 1995. See talk page. --&gt; by the so-called &quot;Gang of Four&quot; (Gamma et al.).&lt;ref name=&quot;GoF&quot;&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, the first Pattern Languages of Programming Conference was held and the following year, the Portland Pattern Repository was set up for documentation of design patterns. 

=== Definition of a Design Pattern ===
In software engineering, a design pattern is a general reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design. A design pattern is not a finished design that can be transformed directly into code. It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations. Object-oriented design patterns typically show relationships and interactions between classes or objects, without specifying the final application classes or objects that are involved. 

Design patterns reside in the domain of modules and interconnections. At a higher level there are architectural patterns that are larger in scope, usually describing an overall pattern followed by an entire system.&lt;ref name=&quot;R.C.Martin&quot;&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/articles/Principles_and_Patterns.pdf
 |title=Design Principles and Design Patterns
 |last=Martin
 |first=Robert C.
 |authorlink=Robert C. Martin
 |accessdate=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many types of design patterns: Structural patterns address concerns related to the high level structure of an application being developed. Computational patterns address concerns related to the identification of key computations. Algorithm strategy patterns address concerns related to high level strategies that describe how to exploit application characteristic on a computation platform. Implementation strategy patterns address concerns related to the realization of the source code to support how the program itself is organized and the common data structures specific to parallel programming. Execution patterns address concerns related to the support of the execution of an application, including the strategies in executing streams of tasks and building blocks to support the synchronization between tasks.

=== Examples of Design Patterns ===
Design patterns are easiest understood when looking at concrete examples.  For beginners the following ten patterns may suffice.  However, you should make it a habit to learn about some of the other patterns mentioned below.  The more patterns you know, the better.

==== Factory Method ====
The Factory pattern creates an object from a set of similar classes, based on some parameter, usually a string.  An example, is the creation of a MessageDigest object in Java:

&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(&quot;SHA-1&quot;); 	
&lt;/source&gt;

If one changes the parameter to &quot;MD5&quot; for instance, one gets an object that calculates the message digest based on the MD5 algorithm instead.  The advantage of using a parameter is that changing the algorithm does not require us to re-compile our code.  Other examples of this pattern are the loading of the database connection driver in Java using &lt;code&gt;Class.forName(&quot;jdbc.idbDriver&quot;)&lt;/code&gt;, which admittedly is some very odd syntax, but the idea is the same.

==== Abstract Factory ====
Where the Factory pattern only affects one class, the Abstract Factory pattern affects a whole bunch of classes.  A well known example from Java is the Swing Look-and-Feel: 

&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
UIManager.setLookAndFeel(&quot;javax.swing.plaf.metal.MetalLookAndFeel&quot;);
&lt;/source&gt;

This looks quite similar to the Factory pattern, but the difference is that now every Swing class that is being loaded is affected, not just one.

==== Singleton ====
This is one of the most dangerous design patterns, when in doubt don't use it. Its main purpose is to guarantee that only one instance of a particular object exists.  Possible applications are a printer manager or a database connection manager.  It is useful when access to a limited resource needs to be controlled.

==== Iterator ====
Nowadays, the Iterator pattern is trivial: it allows you to go through a list of objects, starting at the beginning, iterating through the list one element after the other, until reaching the end.

==== Template Method ====
Also the Template Method pattern is rather simple: as soon as you define an abstract class, that forces its subclasses to implement some method, you are using a simple form of the Template pattern.

==== Command ====
To understand the idea behind the Command pattern consider the following restaurant example: A customer goes to a restaurant and orders some food. The waiter takes the order (command, in this case) and hands it to the cook in the kitchen. In the kitchen the command is executed, and depending on the command different food or drink is being prepared.  

==== Observer ====
The Observer pattern is one of the most popular patterns, and it has many variants.  Assume you have a table in a spreadsheet. That data can be displayed in table form, but also in form of some graph or histogram.  If the underlying data changes, not only the table view has to change, but you also expect the histogram to change. To communicate these changes you can use the Observer pattern: the underlying data is the ''observable'' and the table view as well as the histogram view are ''observers'' that observe the observable.  Another example of the Observer pattern is a button in Swing for instance: here the JButton is the observable, and if something happens to the button (usually this means it was pressed by the user) then the listener (the observer) gets notified.

==== Composite ====
The Composite pattern is very wide spread.  Basically, it is a list that may contain objects, but also lists. A typical example is a file system, which may consist of directories and files.  Here directories may contain files, but also may contain other directories.  Other examples of the Composite pattern are menus that may contain other menus, or in user management one often has users and groups, where groups may contain users, but also other groups.

==== State ====
In the State pattern, an internal state of the object influences its behavior.  Assume you have some drawing program in which you want to be able to draw straight lines and dotted lines.  Instead of creating different classes for lines, you have one Line class that has an internal state called 'dotted' or 'straight' and depending on this internal state either dotted lines or straight lines are drawn.  This pattern is also implicitly used by Java, when setting the font via ’setFont()’ or the color via 'setColor()', for instance.

==== Proxy ====
The idea behind the Proxy pattern is that we have some complex object and we need to make it simpler.  One typical application is an object that exists on another machine, but you want to give the impression as if the user is dealing with a local object.  Another application is when an object would take a long time to create (like loading a large image/video), but the actual object may never be needed.  In this case a proxy represents the object until it is needed.

=== Patterns in Practice ===
Design patterns can speed up the development process by providing tested, proven development paradigms. Effective software design requires considering issues that may not become visible until later in the implementation. Reusing design patterns helps to prevent subtle issues that can cause major problems, and it also improves code readability for coders and architects who are familiar with the patterns.  In addition to this, patterns allow developers to communicate using well-known, well understood names for software interactions. 

In order to achieve flexibility, design patterns usually introduce additional levels of indirection, which in some cases may complicate the resulting designs and hurt application performance.

By definition, a pattern must be programmed anew into each application that uses it. Since some authors see this as a step backward from software reuse as provided by components, researchers have worked to turn patterns into components. Meyer and Arnout were able to provide full or partial componentization of two-thirds of the patterns they attempted.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meyer2006&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Classification and List of Patterns ===
Design patterns were originally grouped into the categories: creational patterns, structural patterns, and behavioral patterns, and described using the concepts of delegation, aggregation, and consultation.  Another classification has also introduced the notion of architectural design pattern that may be applied at the architecture level of the software such as the Model-View-Controller pattern.  The following patterns are taken from ''Design Patterns'' &lt;ref name=&quot;GoF&quot; /&gt; and ''Code Complete'',&lt;ref name=&quot;McConnell2004&quot;&gt;{{cite book
 |title=Code Complete

}}&lt;/ref&gt; unless otherwise stated.


==== Creational patterns ====
* '''Abstract factory:''' Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

* '''Builder:''' Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation allowing the same construction process to create various representations.

* '''Factory method:''' Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.

* '''Lazy initialization:''' Tactic of delaying the creation of an object, the calculation of a value, or some other expensive process until the first time it is needed.&lt;ref name=&quot;PoEAA&quot;&gt;
{{cite book
 | first = Martin
 | last = Fowler
 | authorlink = Martin Fowler
 | year = 2002
 | title = Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture
 | publisher = Addison-Wesley
 | isbn = 978-0321127426
 | url = http://martinfowler.com/
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Multiton:''' Ensure a class has only named instances, and provide global point of access to them.

* '''Object pool:''' Avoid expensive acquisition and release of resources by recycling objects that are no longer in use. Can be considered a generalisation of connection pool and thread pool patterns.

* '''Prototype:''' Specify the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance, and create new objects by copying this prototype.

* '''Resource acquisition is initialization:''' Ensure that resources are properly released by tying them to the lifespan of suitable objects.

* '''Singleton:''' Ensure a class has only one instance, and provide a global point of access to it.


==== Structural Patterns ====
* '''Adapter or Wrapper:''' Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect. Adapter lets classes work together that could not otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.

* '''Bridge:''' Decouple an abstraction from its implementation allowing the two to vary independently.

* '''Composite:''' Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

* '''Decorator:''' Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically keeping the same interface. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

* '''Facade:''' Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. Facade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.

* '''Front Controller:''' Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. Front Controller defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.

* '''Flyweight:''' Use sharing to support large numbers of fine-grained objects efficiently.

* '''Proxy:''' Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.


==== Behavioral Patterns ====
* '''Blackboard:''' Generalized observer, which allows multiple readers and writers. Communicates information system-wide.

* '''Chain of responsibility:''' Avoid coupling the sender of a request to its receiver by giving more than one object a chance to handle the request. Chain the receiving objects and pass the request along the chain until an object handles it.

* '''Command:''' Encapsulate a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize clients with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations.

* '''Interpreter:''' Given a language, define a representation for its grammar along with an interpreter that uses the representation to interpret sentences in the language.

* '''Iterator:''' Provide a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.

* '''Mediator:''' Define an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact. Mediator promotes loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other explicitly, and it lets you vary their interaction independently. 

* '''Memento:''' Without violating encapsulation, capture and externalize an object's internal state allowing the object to be restored to this state later.

* '''Null object:''' Avoid null references by providing a default object.

* '''Observer or Publish/subscribe:''' Define a one-to-many dependency between objects where a state change in one object results with all its dependents being notified and updated automatically.

* '''Servant:''' Define common functionality for a group of classes

* '''Specification:''' Recombinable business logic in a boolean fashion

* '''State:''' Allow an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class.

* '''Strategy:''' Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

* '''Template method:''' Define the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some steps to subclasses. Template Method lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure.

* '''Visitor:''' Represent an operation to be performed on the elements of an object structure. Visitor lets you define a new operation without changing the classes of the elements on which it operates.


==== Concurrency Patterns ====
Most of the following concurrency patterns are taken from ''POSA2''&lt;ref name=&quot;POSA2&quot;&gt;, unless stated otherwise.
{{cite book
 | first = Douglas C.
 | last = Schmidt
 | authorlink = Douglas C. Schmidt
 | coauthors = Michael Stal, Hans Rohnert, Frank Buschmann
 | year = 2000
 | title = Pattern-Oriented Software Architecture, Volume 2: Patterns for Concurrent and Networked Objects
 | publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons
 | isbn = 0-471-60695-2
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Active Object:''' Decouples method execution from method invocation that reside in their own thread of control. The goal is to introduce concurrency, by using asynchronous method invocation and a scheduler for handling requests.

* '''Balking:''' Only execute an action on an object when the object is in a particular state.

* '''Binding Properties:''' Combining multiple observers to force properties in different objects to be synchronized or coordinated in some way.&lt;ref&gt;http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?BindingProperties&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Messaging pattern:''' The messaging design pattern (MDP) allows the interchange of information (i.e. messages) between components and applications.

* '''Double-checked locking:''' Reduce the overhead of acquiring a lock by first testing the locking criterion (the 'lock hint') in an unsafe manner; only if that succeeds does the actual lock proceed.  Can be unsafe when implemented in some language/hardware combinations. It can therefore sometimes be considered an anti-pattern.

* '''Event-based asynchronous:''' Addresses problems with the Asynchronous pattern that occur in multithreaded programs.&lt;ref name=PC#2008&gt;{{cite book|title=Professional C# 2008|author=Christian Nagel, Bill Evjen, Jay Glynn, Karli Watson, and Morgan Skinner|pages=570&amp;ndash;571|publisher=Wiley|year=2008|isbn=0470191376|isbn13=9780470191378|chapter=Event-based Asynchronous Pattern}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Guarded suspension:''' Manages operations that require both a lock to be acquired and a precondition to be satisfied before the operation can be executed.

* '''Lock:''' One thread puts a &quot;lock&quot; on a resource, preventing other threads from accessing or modifying it.&lt;ref&gt;http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?LockPattern&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PoEAA&quot;/&gt;

* '''Monitor object:''' An object whose methods are subject to mutual exclusion, thus preventing multiple objects from erroneously trying to use it at the same time.

* '''Reactor:''' A reactor object provides an asynchronous interface to resources that must be handled synchronously.

* '''Read-write lock:''' Allows concurrent read access to an object but requires exclusive access for write operations.

* '''Scheduler:''' Explicitly control when threads may execute single-threaded code.

* '''Thread pool:''' A number of threads are created to perform a number of tasks, which are usually organized in a queue. Typically, there are many more tasks than threads. Can be considered a special case of the object pool pattern.

* '''Thread-specific storage:''' Static or &quot;global&quot; memory local to a thread.

==== Data Access Patterns ====
Another interesting area where patterns have a wide application is the area of ''data access patterns''.  Clifton Nock &lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book
 | first = Clifton
 | last = Nock
 | year = 2003
 | title = Data Access Patterns: Database Interactions in Object-Oriented Applications
 | publisher = Addison Wesley
 | isbn = 0131401572
}}&lt;/ref&gt; lists the following patterns:
* '''ORM Patterns:''' Domain Object Factory, Object/Relational Map, Update Factory
 
* '''Resource Management Patterns:''' Resource Pool, Resource Timer, Retryer, Paging Iterator

* '''Cache Patterns:''' Cache Accessor, Demand Cache, Primed Cache, Cache Collector, Cache Replicator

* '''Concurrency Patterns:''' Transaction, Optimistic Lock, Pessimistic Lock

 
==== Enterprise Patterns ====
If you deal with J2EE or with .Net Enterprise applications, the problems that occur and the solutions to them are similar.  These solutions are the Enterprise patterns.
The book ''Core J2EE Patterns'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | first = Deepak
 | last = Alur
 | coauthors = John Crupi, Dan Malks
 | year = 2003
 | month = May
 | title = Core J2EE Patterns: Best Practices and Design Strategies (2nd Edition)
 | publisher = Prentice Hall
 | isbn = 0131422464
}}&lt;/ref&gt; lists these patterns:
 
* '''Presentation Tier Patterns:''' Intercepting Filter, Front Controller, View Helper, Composite View, Service to Worker, Dispatcher View

* '''Business Tier Patterns:''' Business Delegate, Value Object, Session Facade, Composite Entity, Value Object Assembler, Value List Handler, Service Locator

* '''Integration Tier Patterns:''' Data Access Object, Service Activator
                                                                                                                

==== Real-Time Patterns ====
Finally, in the area of real-time and embedded software development a vast number of patterns have been identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=== Documenting and Describing Patterns ===
Assume you discovered a new design pattern.  Or your friend wants to explain to you this cool pattern she found in a pattern repository.  How do we describe patterns?  There is no single, standard format for documenting design patterns. Rather, a variety of different formats have been used by different pattern authors.&lt;ref name=&quot;GabrielHillside&quot;&gt;{{cite web
 |first=Dick
 |last=Gabriel
 |authorlink=Richard Gabriel
 |title=A Pattern Definition

 |first=Martin
 |last=Fowler 
 |authorlink=Martin Fowler
 |title=Writing Software Patterns
 |url=http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/writingPatterns.html
 |date=2006-08-01
 |accessdate=2007-03-06
}}&lt;/ref&gt; One example of a commonly used documentation format is the one used by the book ''Design Patterns''.&lt;ref name=&quot;GoF&quot; /&gt; It contains the following sections:
*'''Pattern Name and Classification:''' A descriptive and unique name that helps in identifying and referring to the pattern.
*'''Intent:''' A description of the goal behind the pattern and the reason for using it.
*'''Also Known As:''' Other names for the pattern.
*'''Motivation (Forces):''' A scenario consisting of a problem and a context in which this pattern can be used.
*'''Applicability:''' Situations in which this pattern is usable; the context for the pattern.
*'''Structure:''' A graphical representation of the pattern. Class diagrams and Interaction diagrams may be used for this purpose.
*'''Participants:''' A listing of the classes and objects used in the pattern and their roles in the design.
*'''Collaboration:''' A description of how classes and objects used in the pattern interact with each other.
*'''Consequences:''' A description of the results, side effects, and trade offs caused by using the pattern.
*'''Implementation:''' A description of an implementation of the pattern; the solution part of the pattern.
*'''Sample Code:''' An illustration of how the pattern can be used in a programming language.
*'''Known Uses:''' Examples of real usages of the pattern.
*'''Related Patterns:''' Other patterns that have some relationship with the pattern; discussion of the differences between the pattern and similar patterns.

Of particular interest are the Structure, Participants, and Collaboration sections. These sections describe a ''design motif'': a prototypical ''micro-architecture'' that developers copy and adapt to their particular designs to solve the recurrent problem described by the design pattern. A micro-architecture is a set of program constituents (e.g., classes, methods...) and their relationships. Developers use the design pattern by introducing in their designs this prototypical micro-architecture, which means that micro-architectures in their designs will have structure and organization similar to the chosen design motif.

== Anti-Patterns and Code Smells ==
If design patterns are the good guys, then the anti-patterns are the bad guys.  And sometimes a good guy can turn into a bad guy.  This happens in Hollywood movies, but it also happens in software engineering.  

The &quot;golden hammer&quot; is a favorite notion of this problem: you learned to use a tool in one context (the golden hammer), and now because you are so proud having learned how to use this complicated tool, all of a sudden you see golden nails everywhere.

A good example is the Singleton pattern: it is so easy that it is the first pattern most beginning software engineers understand and henceforth, since presumably it is a good guy, they will use it at every possible occasion.  However, the problem with the Singleton is that it violates ''information hiding''.  Now information hiding is one of the holy cows of modern software engineering, and it should be violated only when there is a really good reason for it.  And just having learned about the Singleton pattern is not!

In software engineering, an ''anti-pattern'' is a pattern that may be commonly used but is ineffective and/or counterproductive in practice.&lt;ref&gt;

inspired by Gang of Four's book ''Design Patterns'', which developed the concept of design patterns in the software field. The term was widely popularized three years later by the book ''AntiPatterns'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

   | isbn = 0471197130
}}&lt;/ref&gt; which extended the use of the term beyond the field of software design and into general social interaction. According to the authors of the latter, there must be at least two key elements present to formally distinguish an actual anti-pattern from a simple bad habit, bad practice, or bad idea:
* Some repeated pattern of action, process or structure that initially appears to be beneficial, but ultimately produces more bad consequences than beneficial results, and 
* A refactored solution exists that is clearly documented, proven in actual practice and repeatable. 
By formally describing repeated mistakes, one can recognize the forces that lead to their repetition and learn how others have refactored themselves out of these broken patterns.

=== Examples of Anti-Patterns ===
To understand anti-patterns a little better, let us take a look at a few examples.  By studying them you may recognize some violation against software engineering principles you may have committed yourself at one point in time.  Some of these anti-patterns have very funny names.

==== Singleton Overuse ==== 
We have talked about this one: the first pattern you understood immediately, and you used it heavily.  But beware it violates information hiding.  Therefore the simple rule: when in doubt don't use it.  My experience is that the larger the project, the more Singletons show up.  

How do you detect Singletons?  This is very easy:  look at the class diagram.  All classes that have references to themselves (or their base class) are potential Singletons.  If you want to get rid of them, Kerievsky shows you the medicine that cures this disease. &lt;ref name=&quot;Kerievsky&quot;&gt;{{cite book 
   | last=Kerievsky 
   | first=Joshua
   | title = Refactoring to Patterns
   | publisher = Addison-Wesley Professional
   | year = 2004
   | isbn = 0321213351
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
==== Functional Decomposition ==== 
Although very popular once, in a modern object-oriented language there is no more space for functional decomposition.  It is a remanent of procedural languages such as C or Pascal.  Usually it indicates old software that was integrated into a new project or migrated.

This anti-pattern reveals itself in three ways: The names of classes sound like function names (e.g. CalculateInterest).  Or the classes only have one action, i.e., they only do one thing.  Or all class attributes are private (which is fine) but they are only used within the class.  To detect this anti-pattern you can use a tool such as SourceMonitor.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.campwoodsw.com/sourcemonitor.html SourceMonitor&lt;/ref&gt;  It lists all class names, and also lists the functions.

==== Poltergeist ==== 
People like this anti-pattern because of its name.  What it is, are classes that briefly appear to only disappear into oblivion.  Either nobody knows what they really do, or they have very limited functionality.  Usually they are not needed or can be absorbed in other classes.

Usually one recognizes this anti-pattern by class names that end in ’*controller’ oder ’*manager’.    Again a tool such as SourceMonitor can help to find this anti-pattern.

Often a consequence of &quot;agile&quot; approaches where cogitating is preferred to Design.

==== Spaghetti ==== 
Spaghetti code is like the noodles: it is very long.  Although the noodles are delicious, code the longer it gets is not.  

SourceMonitor can help you find this pattern, you simply look for methods with many lines of code.    Refactoring is usually is the cure here.
 
==== Blob ==== 
A blob is a class with a lot of attributes and methods.  Quite often these are not even related.  You can detect this smell with your favorite code analysis tool, by listing classes with lots of attributes and methods or many lines of code.  Usually splitting this class into several smaller classes will help here.
 
==== Copy and Paste ==== 
As the name implies, somebody copied some code from some place to another place.  It is the simplest way to duplicate functionality, but it should be avoided for many reasons.  The simplest solution is to turn the code into a method instead, or use inheritance.  

To detect almost identical code you can use a tool like PMD’s Tool Copy/Paste Detector.&lt;ref name=&quot;PMD&quot;&gt;http://pmd.sourceforge.net/cpd.html PMD&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.onjava.com/pub/a/onjava/2003/03/12/pmd_cpd.html Detecting Duplicate Code with PMD’s CPD&lt;/ref&gt;
 
==== Lava Flow ==== 
What is lava flow?  &quot;A lava flow is a moving outpouring of lava, which is created during a non-explosive effusive eruption. When it has stopped moving, lava solidifies to form igneous rock.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lava Lava&lt;/ref&gt; In software engineering it means that the code is ancient, nobody has touched it for eons, and nobody has the guts to touch it (never touch a working class...).  

You can find these classes by using your source control system.  Simply list those classes that have not been checked out and modified for a long time.

=== Code Smells ===
Code smells are similar to anti-patterns, but not quite as formal.  If code smells, then that smell can be o.k. (like some cheese) or it can be bad, possibly indicating a deeper problem.  Kent Beck introduced the idea in the late 1990s and Martin Fowler made it popular in his book  ''Refactoring. Improving the Design of Existing Code''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | first = Martin
 | last = Fowler
 | authorlink = Martin Fowler
 | year = 1999
 | title = Refactoring. Improving the Design of Existing Code
 | publisher = Addison-Wesley
 | isbn = 0-201-48567-2
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  You can use tools, such as FindBugs, Checkstyle or PMD to find bad smells.  Usually refactoring is used to remove the offending odor.  Martin Fowler and Joshua Kerievsky, among others, provide the appropriate refactorings.

==== Duplicate Code ==== 
This smell is very similar to the Copy and Paste anti-pattern.  You use can use the PMD Tool Copy/Paste Detector &lt;ref name=&quot;PMD&quot; /&gt; to find the problematic areas.
 
==== Long Method ==== 
Related to the Spaghetti anti-pattern, you can find it using SourceMonitor when sorting classes according to ’Avg Stmts/Meth’.  Methods that have more then 50 lines are definitely suspicious.
 
==== Indecent Exposure ==== 
In the current Victorian age of information hiding, naturally indecent exposure is a bad thing.  If a class has too many methods, or, god forbid, any public attributes then we talk about indecent exposure.  You find this smell by checking for public methods of classes.  If a class has more than 50% public methods, this may not conform to the information hiding policy.
 
==== Lazy Class ==== 
Reminds me of the Poltergeist anti-pattern:  this is a class that does so little that it has not reason for existence.  Try to absorb into another class.  To detect this smell use SourceMonitor: Sort 'Methods/Class' and look for classes that have fewer than two methods or look for classes with very few lines of code.  They are suspect of being lazy.

==== Large Class ==== 
A large class is the opposite of a lazy class.  You find it similarily, look for classes with too many methods, or too many statements.  Usually a class should not have more than 30 methods or more than 400 statements.  Also class with too many attributes could be large classes.
Kerievsky shows several possible ways of reducing this smell.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kerievsky&quot; /&gt;

Really means not coding to code conventions.  Look up Meyer, MISRA etc.

=== Known Anti-Patterns ===
There are many known anti-patterns.  A list and brief description of some is provided for your entertainment.

====Organizational anti-patterns====
*Analysis paralysis: Devoting disproportionate effort to the analysis phase of a project
*Cash cow: A profitable legacy product that often leads to complacency about new products
*Design by committee: The result of having many contributors to a design, but no unifying vision
*Escalation of commitment: Failing to revoke a decision when it proves wrong
*Management by perkele: Authoritarian style of management with no tolerance of dissent
*Matrix Management: Unfocused organizational structure that results in divided loyalties and lack of direction
*Moral hazard: Insulating a decision-maker from the consequences of his or her decision
*Mushroom management: Keeping employees uninformed and misinformed (kept in the dark and fed manure)
*Stovepipe or Silos: A structure that supports mostly up-down flow of data but inhibits cross organizational communication
*Vendor lock-in: Making a system excessively dependent on an externally supplied component&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.antipatterns.com/vendorlockin.htm Vendor Lock-In] at antipatterns.com&lt;/ref&gt;

====Project management anti-patterns====
*Death march: Everyone knows that the project is going to be a disaster – except the CEO. However, the truth remains hidden and the project is artificially kept alive until the Day Zero finally comes (&quot;Big Bang&quot;). Alternative definition:  Employees are pressured to work late nights and weekends on a project with an unreasonable deadline.
*Groupthink: During groupthink, members of the group avoid promoting viewpoints outside the comfort zone of consensus thinking
*Smoke and mirrors: Demonstrating how unimplemented functions will appear
*Software bloat: Allowing successive versions of a system to demand ever more resources
*Waterfall model: An older method of software development that inadequately deals with unanticipated change

====Analysis anti-patterns====
*Bystander apathy: When a requirement or design decision is wrong, but the people who notice this do nothing because it affects a larger number of people

====Software design anti-patterns====
&lt;span id=&quot;General design anti-patterns&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
*Abstraction inversion: Not exposing implemented functionality required by users, so that they re-implement it using higher level functions
*Ambiguous viewpoint: Presenting a model (usually Object-oriented analysis and design (OOAD)) without specifying its viewpoint
*Big ball of mud: A system with no recognizable structure
*Database-as-IPC: Using a database as the message queue for routine interprocess communication where a much more lightweight mechanism would be suitable
*Gold plating: Continuing to work on a task or project well past the point at which extra effort is adding value
*Inner-platform effect: A system so customizable as to become a poor replica of the software development platform 
*Input kludge: Failing to specify and implement the handling of possibly invalid input
*Interface bloat: Making an interface so powerful that it is extremely difficult to implement
*Magic pushbutton: Coding implementation logic directly within interface code, without using abstraction
*Race hazard: Failing to see the consequence of different orders of events
*Stovepipe system: A barely maintainable assemblage of ill-related components

=====Object-oriented design anti-patterns=====
*Anemic Domain Model: The use of domain model without any business logic.  The domain model's objects cannot guarantee their correctness at any moment, because their validation and mutation logic is placed somewhere outside (most likely in multiple places).
*BaseBean: Inheriting functionality from a utility class rather than delegating to it
*Call super: Requiring subclasses to call a superclass's overridden method
*Circle-ellipse problem: Subtyping variable-types on the basis of value-subtypes
*Circular dependency: Introducing unnecessary direct or indirect mutual dependencies between objects or software modules 
*Constant interface: Using interfaces to define constants
*God object: Concentrating too many functions in a single part of the design (class)
*Object cesspool: Reusing objects whose state does not conform to the (possibly implicit) contract for re-use
*Object orgy: Failing to properly encapsulate objects permitting unrestricted access to their internals
*Poltergeists: Objects whose sole purpose is to pass information to another object
*Sequential coupling: A class that requires its methods to be called in a particular order
*Yo-yo problem: A structure (e.g., of inheritance) that is hard to understand due to excessive fragmentation

====Programming anti-patterns====
*Accidental complexity: Introducing unnecessary complexity into a solution
*Action at a distance: Unexpected interaction between widely separated parts of a system
*Blind faith: Lack of checking of (a) the correctness of a bug fix or (b) the result of a subroutine
*Boat anchor: Retaining a part of a system that no longer has any use
*Busy spin: Consuming CPU while waiting for something to happen, usually by repeated checking instead of messaging
*Caching failure: Forgetting to reset an error flag when an error has been corrected
*Cargo cult programming: Using patterns and methods without understanding why
*Coding by exception: Adding new code to handle each special case as it is recognized
*Error hiding: Catching an error message before it can be shown to the user and either showing nothing or showing a meaningless message
*Hard code: Embedding assumptions about the environment of a system in its implementation
*Lava flow: Retaining undesirable (redundant or low-quality) code because removing it is too expensive or has unpredictable consequences&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.antipatterns.com/lavaflow.htm Lava Flow] at antipatterns.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icmgworld.com/corp/news/Articles/RS/jan_0202.asp |title=Undocumented 'lava flow' antipatterns complicate process |publisher=Icmgworld.com |date=2002-01-14 |accessdate=2010-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Loop-switch sequence: Encoding a set of sequential steps using a switch within a loop statement
*Magic numbers: Including unexplained numbers in algorithms
*Magic strings: Including literal strings in code, for comparisons, as event types etc.
*Soft code: Storing business logic in configuration files rather than source code&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Papadimoulis |first=Alex |url=http://worsethanfailure.com/Articles/Soft_Coding.aspx |title=Soft Coding |publisher=Worsethanfailure.com |date=2007-04-10 |accessdate=2010-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Spaghetti code: Programs whose structure is barely comprehensible, especially because of misuse of code structures

====Methodological anti-patterns====
*Copy and paste programming: Copying (and modifying) existing code rather than creating generic solutions
*Golden hammer: Assuming that a favorite solution is universally applicable (See: Silver Bullet)
*Improbability factor: Assuming that it is improbable that a known error will occur
*Not Invented Here (NIH) syndrome: The tendency towards ''reinventing the wheel'' (Failing to adopt an existing, adequate solution)
*Premature optimization: Coding early-on for perceived efficiency, sacrificing good design,  maintainability, and sometimes even real-world efficiency
*Programming by permutation (or &quot;programming by accident&quot;): Trying to approach a solution by successively modifying the code to see if it works
*Reinventing the wheel: Failing to adopt an existing, adequate solution
*Reinventing the square wheel: Failing to adopt an existing solution and instead adopting a custom solution which performs much worse than the existing one
*Silver bullet: Assuming that a favorite technical solution can solve a larger process or problem
*Tester Driven Development: Software projects in which new requirements are specified in bug reports

====Configuration management anti-patterns====
*Dependency hell: Problems with versions of required products
*DLL hell: Inadequate management of dynamic-link libraries (DLLs), specifically on Microsoft Windows
*Extension conflict: Problems with different extensions to pre-Mac OS X versions of the Mac OS attempting to patch the same parts of the operating system
*JAR hell: Overutilization of the multiple JAR files, usually causing versioning and location problems because of misunderstanding of the Java class loading model

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are a few industry standards related to process improvement models we should mention briefly.    For you as a beginner, it is enough to know they exist.  However, if you start working for large corporations, you will find that many will follow one or the other of these standards. 

=== Capability Maturity Model Integration === 
The [[Wikipedia:Capability Maturity Model Integration|Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI)]] is one of the leading models and based on best practice. Independent assessments grade organizations on how well they follow their defined processes, not on the quality of those processes or the software produced. CMMI has replaced CMM.

=== ISO 9000 === 
[[Wikipedia:ISO 9000|ISO 9000]] describes standards for a formally organized process to manufacture a product and the methods of managing and monitoring progress. Although the standard was originally created for the manufacturing sector, ISO 9000 standards have been applied to software development as well. Like CMMI, certification with ISO 9000 does not guarantee the quality of the end result, only that formalized business processes have been followed.

=== ISO 15504 === 
[[Wikipedia:ISO 15504|ISO 15504]], also known as Software Process Improvement Capability Determination (SPICE), is a &quot;framework for the assessment of software processes&quot;. This standard is aimed at setting out a clear model for process comparison. SPICE is used much like CMMI. It models processes to manage, control, guide and monitor software development. This model is then used to measure what a development organization or project team actually does during software development. This information is analyzed to identify weaknesses and drive improvement. It also identifies strengths that can be continued or integrated into common practice for that organization or team.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Coding conventions''' are a set of guidelines for a specific programming language that recommend programming style, practices and methods for each aspect of a piece program written in this language. These conventions usually cover file organization, indentation, comments, declarations, statements, white space, naming conventions, programming practices, programming principles, programming rules of thumb, etc. Software programmers are highly recommended to follow these guidelines to help improve the readability of their source code and make software maintenance easier. Coding conventions are only applicable to the human maintainers and peer reviewers of a software project. Conventions may be formalized in a documented set of rules that an entire team or company follows, or may be as informal as the habitual coding practices of an individual. Coding conventions are not enforced by compilers. As a result, not following some or all of the rules has no impact on the executable programs created from the source code.

==Software maintenance==
Reducing the cost of software maintenance is the most often cited reason for following coding conventions.  In their introduction to code conventions for the Java Programming Language, Sun Microsystems provides the following rationale:&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web
  | title = Code Conventions for the Java Programming Language : Why Have Code Conventions
  | publisher = Sun Microsystems, Inc.
  | date = 1999-04-20
  | url = http://java.sun.com/docs/codeconv/html/CodeConventions.doc.html#16712 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Code conventions are important to programmers for a number of reasons:
*80% of the lifetime cost of a piece of software goes to maintenance. 
*Hardly any software is maintained for its whole life by the original author. 
*Code conventions improve the readability of the software, allowing engineers to understand new code more quickly and thoroughly. 
*If you ship your source code as a product, you need to make sure it is as well packaged and clean as any other product you create. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Quality===
Software peer review frequently involves reading source code.  This type of peer review is primarily a defect detection activity.  By definition, only the original author of a piece of code has read the source file before the code is submitted for review.  Code that is written using consistent guidelines is easier for other reviewers to understand and assimilate, improving the efficacy of the defect detection process.

Even for the original author, consistently coded software eases maintainability.  There is no guarantee that an individual will remember the precise rationale for ''why'' a particular piece of code was written in a certain way long after the code was originally written.  Coding conventions can help.  Consistent use of whitespace improves readability and reduces the time it takes to understand the software.

===Refactoring===
Refactoring refers to a software maintenance activity where source code is modified to improve readability or improve its structure.  Software is often refactored to bring it into conformance with a team's stated coding standards after its initial release.  Any change that does not alter the behavior of the software can be considered refactoring.  Common refactoring activities are changing variable names, renaming methods, moving methods or whole classes and breaking large methods (or functions) into smaller ones. 

Agile software development methodologies plan for regular (or even continuous) refactoring making it an integral part of the team software development process.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Task automation==
Coding conventions allow to have simple scripts or programs whose job is to process source code for some purpose other than compiling it into an executable. It is common practice to count the software size (Source lines of code) to track current project progress or establish a baseline for future project estimates.  

Consistent coding standards can, in turn, make the measurements more consistent.  Special tags within source code comments are often used to process documentation, two notable examples are javadoc and doxygen.  The tools specifies the use of a set of tags, but their use within a project is determined by convention.

Coding conventions simplify writing new software whose job is to process existing software.  Use of static code analysis has grown consistently since the 1950s.  Some of the growth of this class of development tools stems from increased maturity and sophistication of the practitioners themselves (and the modern focus on safety and security), but also from the nature of the languages themselves.

==Language factors==
All software practitioners must grapple with the problems of organizing and managing very many detailed instructions, each of which will eventually be processed in order to perform the task for which it was written.  For all but the smallest software projects, source code (instructions) are partitioned into separate files and frequently among many directories.  It was natural for programmers to collect closely related functions (behaviors) in the same file and to collect related files into directories.  As software development evolved from purely procedural programming (such as found in FORTRAN) towards more object-oriented constructs (such as found in C++), it became the practice to write the code for a single (public) class in a single file (the 'one class per file' convention).&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://wiki.fifengine.de/index.php?title=Coding_standards FIFE coding standards]&lt;/ref&gt;
Java has gone one step further - the Java compiler returns an error if it finds more than one public class per file.  

A convention in one language may be a requirement in another.  Language conventions also affect individual source files. Each compiler (or interpreter) used to process source code is unique. The rules a compiler applies to the source creates implicit standards. For example, Python code is much more consistently indented than, say Perl, because whitespace (indentation) is actually significant to the interpreter. Python does not use the brace syntax Perl uses to delimit functions.  Changes in indentation serve as the delimiters.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  Tcl, which uses a brace syntax similar to Perl or C/C++ to delimit functions, does not allow the following, which seems fairly reasonable to a C programmer:
&lt;code&gt;
 set i 0
 while {$i &lt; 10} 
 {
    puts &quot;$i squared = [expr $i*$i]&quot;
    incr i
 }
&lt;/code&gt; 
The reason is that in Tcl, curly braces are not used only to delimit functions as in C or Java.  More 
generally, curly braces are used to group words together into a single argument.&lt;ref&gt;

  | url = http://wiki.tcl.tk/8344 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;
In Tcl, the ''word'' '''while''' takes two arguments, a ''condition'' and an ''action''. In the example above, '''while''' is missing its second argument, its ''action'' (because the Tcl also uses the newline character to delimit the end of a command).

==Common conventions==

As mentioned above, common coding conventions may cover the following areas:

* Comment conventions
* Indent style conventions
* Naming conventions
* Programming practices
* Programming principles
* Programming rules of thumb
* Programming style conventions

==Examples==
===Only one statement should occur per line===

For example, in Java this would involve having statements written like this:
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
a++;
b = a;
&lt;/source&gt;

But not like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
a++; b = a;
&lt;/source&gt;

===Boolean values in decision structures===
Some programmers suggest that coding where the result of a decision is merely the computation of a Boolean value, are overly verbose and error prone. They prefer to have the decision in the computation itself, like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
return (hours &lt; 24) &amp;&amp; (minutes &lt; 60) &amp;&amp; (seconds &lt; 60);
&lt;/source&gt;

The difference is entirely stylistic, because optimizing compilers may produce identical object code for both forms. However, stylistically, programmers disagree which form is easier to read and maintain.

Arguments in favor of the longer form include: it is then possible to set a per-line breakpoint on one branch of the decision; further lines of code could be added to one branch without refactoring the return line, which would increase the chances of bugs being introduced; the longer form would always permit a debugger to step to a line where the variables involved are still in scope.

===Left-hand comparisons===
In languages which use one symbol (typically a single equals sign, (&lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt;)) for assignment and another (typically two equals signs, (&lt;code&gt;==&lt;/code&gt;) for comparison (e.g. C/C++, Java, ActionScript 3, PHP, Perl numeric context, and most languages in the last 15 years), and where assignments may be made within control structures, there is an advantage to adopting the left-hand comparison style: to place constants or expressions to the left in any comparison.
&lt;ref name=&quot;phpcook&quot;&gt;
{{cite book 
  | title=PHP Cookbook 
  | last=Sklar 
  | first=David 
  | coauthors=Adam Trachtenberg

&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web
  | title = C Programming FAQs: Frequently Asked Questions
  | publisher = Addison-Wesley, 1995
  | date = Nov. 2010
  | url = http://c-faq.com/style/revtest.html }}
&lt;/ref&gt;


Here are both left and right-hand comparison styles, applied to a line of Perl code. In both cases, this compares the value in the variable &lt;code&gt;$a&lt;/code&gt; against 42, and if it matches, executes the code in the subsequent block.

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
if ( $a == 42 ) { ... }  # A right-hand comparison checking if $a equals 42.
if ( 42 == $a ) { ... }  # Recast, using the left-hand comparison style.
&lt;/source&gt;

The difference occurs when a developer accidentally types &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;==&lt;/code&gt;:

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
if ( $a = 42 ) { ... }  # Inadvertent assignment which is often hard to debug
if ( 42 = $a ) { ... }  # Compile time error indicates source of problem
&lt;/source&gt;

The first (right-hand) line now contains a potentially subtle flaw: rather than the previous behaviour, it now sets the value of &lt;code&gt;$a&lt;/code&gt; to be 42, and then always runs the code in the following block.  As this is syntactically legitimate, the error may go unnoticed by the programmer, and the software may ship with a bug.

The second (left-hand) line contains a semantic error, as numeric values cannot be assigned to. This will result in a diagnostic message being generated when the code is compiled, so the error cannot go unnoticed by the programmer.

Some languages have built-in protections against inadvertent assignment.  Java and C#, for example, do not support automatic conversion to boolean for just this reason.  

The risk can also be mitigated by use of static code analysis tools that can detect this issue.

===Looping and control structures===
The use of logical control structures for looping adds to good programming style as well. It helps someone reading code to better understand the program's sequence of execution (in imperative programming languages). For example, in pseudocode:

&lt;code lang=&quot;pseudo&quot;&gt;
 i = 0
 '' ''
 '''while''' i &lt; 5
   '''print''' i * 2
   i = i + 1
 '''end while'''
 '' ''
 '''print''' &quot;Ended loop&quot;
&lt;/code&gt;

The above snippet obeys the naming and indentation style guidelines, but the following use of the &quot;for&quot; construct may be considered easier to read:

&lt;code lang=&quot;pseudo&quot;&gt;
 '''for''' i = 0, i &lt; 5, i=i+1
   '''print''' i * 2
 '' ''
 '''print''' &quot;Ended loop&quot;
&lt;/code&gt;

In many languages, the often used &quot;for each element in a range&quot; pattern can be shortened to:

&lt;code lang=&quot;pseudo&quot;&gt;
 '''for''' i = 0 '''to''' 5
   '''print''' i * 2
 '' ''
 '''print''' &quot;Ended loop&quot;
&lt;/code&gt;

In programming languages that allow curly brackets, it has become common for style documents to require that even where optional, curly brackets be used with all control flow constructs.

&lt;code lang=&quot;pseudo&quot;&gt;
 '''for''' (i = 0 '''to''' 5) {
   '''print''' i * 2;
 }
 '' ''
 '''print''' &quot;Ended loop&quot;;
&lt;/code&gt;

This prevents program-flow bugs which can be time-consuming to track down, such as where a terminating semicolon is introduced at the end of the construct (a common typo):

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
 for (i = 0; i &lt; 5; ++i);
    printf(&quot;%d\n&quot;, i*2);    /* The incorrect indentation hides the fact 
                               that this line is not part of the loop body. */
 
 printf(&quot;Ended loop&quot;);
&lt;/source&gt;

...or where another line is added before the first:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
 for (i = 0; i &lt; 5; ++i)
    fprintf(logfile, &quot;loop reached %d\n&quot;, i);
    printf(&quot;%d\n&quot;, i*2);    /* The incorrect indentation hides the fact 
                               that this line is not part of the loop body. */
 
 printf(&quot;Ended loop&quot;);
&lt;/source&gt;

===Lists===
Where items in a list are placed on separate lines, it is sometimes considered good practice to add the item-separator after the final item, as well as between each item, at least in those languages where doing so is supported by the syntax (e.g., C, Java)
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
const char *array[] = {
    &quot;item1&quot;,
    &quot;item2&quot;,
    &quot;item3&quot;,  /* still has the comma after it */
};
&lt;/source&gt;

This prevents syntax errors or subtle string-concatenation bugs when the list items are re-ordered or more items are added to the end, without the programmer's noticing the &quot;missing&quot; separator on the line which was previously last in the list. However, this technique can result in a syntax error (or misleading semantics) in some languages. Even for languages that do support trailing commas, not all list-like syntactical constructs in those languages may support it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Software documentation''' or '''source code documentation''' is written text that accompanies computer software.  It either explains how it operates or how to use it, and may mean different things to people in different roles.

== Involvement of people in software life==
Documentation is an important part of software engineering. Types of documentation include:

# Requirements - Statements that identify attributes, capabilities, characteristics, or qualities of a system.  This is the foundation for what shall be or has been implemented.
# Architecture/Design - Overview of softwares. Includes relations to an environment and construction principles to be used in design of software components. 
# Technical - Documentation of code, algorithms, interfaces, and APIs.
# End User - Manuals for the end-user, system administrators and support staff.
# Marketing - How to market the product and analysis of the market demand.

=== Requirements documentation ===
Requirements documentation is the description of what a particular software does or shall do. It is used throughout development to communicate what the software does or shall do. It is also used as an agreement or as the foundation for agreement on what the software shall do. Requirements are produced and consumed by everyone involved in the production of software: end users, customers, product managers, project managers, sales, marketing, software architects, usability engineers, interaction designers, developers, and testers, to name a few. Thus, requirements documentation has many different purposes.

Requirements come in a variety of styles, notations and formality. Requirements can be goal-like (e.g., ''distributed work environment''), close to design (e.g., ''builds can be started by right-clicking a configuration file and select the 'build' function''), and anything in between. They can be specified as statements in natural language, as drawn figures, as detailed mathematical formulas, and as a combination of them all.

The variation and complexity of requirements documentation makes it a proven challenge. Requirements may be implicit and hard to uncover. It is difficult to know exactly how much and what kind of documentation is needed and how much can be left to the architecture and design documentation, and it is difficult to know how to document requirements considering the variety of people that shall read and use the documentation. Thus, requirements documentation is often incomplete (or non-existent). Without proper requirements documentation, software changes become more difficult—and therefore more error prone (decreased software quality) and time-consuming (expensive).

The need for requirements documentation is typically related to the complexity of the product, the impact of the product, and the life expectancy of the software. If the software is very complex or developed by many people (e.g., mobile phone software), requirements can help to better communicate what to achieve. If the software is safety-critical and can have negative impact on human life (e.g., nuclear power systems, medical equipment), more formal requirements documentation is often required. If the software is expected to live for only a month or two (e.g., very small mobile phone applications developed specifically for a certain campaign) very little requirements documentation may be needed. If the software is a first release that is later built upon, requirements documentation is very helpful when managing the change of the software and verifying that nothing has been broken in the software when it is modified.

Traditionally, requirements are specified in requirements documents (e.g. using word processing applications and spreadsheet applications). To manage the increased complexity and changing nature of requirements documentation (and software documentation in general), database-centric systems and special-purpose requirements management tools are advocated.

=== Architecture/Design documentation ===
Architecture documentation is a special breed of design document. In a way, architecture documents are third derivative from the code (design document being second derivative, and code documents being first). Very little in the architecture documents is specific to the code itself. These documents do not describe how to program a particular routine, or even why that particular routine exists in the form that it does, but instead merely lays out the general requirements that would motivate the existence of such a routine. A good architecture document is short on details but thick on explanation. It may suggest approaches for lower level design, but leave the actual exploration trade studies to other documents.

Another breed of design docs is the comparison document, or trade study. This would often take the form of a ''whitepaper''. It focuses on one specific aspect of the system and suggests alternate approaches. It could be at the user interface, code, design, or even architectural level. It will outline what the situation is, describe one or more alternatives, and enumerate the pros and cons of each. A good trade study document is heavy on research, expresses its idea clearly (without relying heavily on obtuse jargon to dazzle the reader), and most importantly is impartial. It should honestly and clearly explain the costs of whatever solution it offers as best. The objective of a trade study is to devise the best solution, rather than to push a particular point of view. It is perfectly acceptable to state no conclusion, or to conclude that none of the alternatives are sufficiently better than the baseline to warrant a change. It should be approached as a scientific endeavor, not as a marketing technique.

A very important part of the design document in enterprise software development is the Database Design Document (DDD). It contains Conceptual, Logical, and Physical Design Elements. The DDD includes the formal information that the people who interact with the database need. The purpose of preparing it is to create a common source to be used by all players within the scene. The potential users are:
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Database Designer
&lt;li&gt;Database Developer
&lt;li&gt;Database Administrator
&lt;li&gt;Application Designer
&lt;li&gt;Application Developer
&lt;/ul&gt;

When talking about Relational Database Systems, the document should include following parts:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Entity - Relationship Schema, including following information and their clear definitions:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Entity Sets and their attributes
&lt;li&gt;Relationships and their attributes
&lt;li&gt;Candidate keys for each entity set
&lt;li&gt;Attribute and Tuple based constraints
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Relational Schema, including following information:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tables, Attributes, and their properties
&lt;li&gt;Views
&lt;li&gt;Constraints such as primary keys, foreign keys, 
&lt;li&gt;Cardinality of referential constraints
&lt;li&gt;Cascading Policy for referential constraints
&lt;li&gt;Primary keys
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

It is very important to include all information that is to be used by all actors in the scene. It is also very important to update the documents as any change occurs in the database as well.

=== Technical documentation ===
This is what most programmers mean when using the term ''software documentation''. When creating software, code alone is insufficient. There must be some text along with it to describe various aspects of its intended operation.  It is important for the code documents to be thorough, but not so verbose that it becomes difficult to maintain them. Several How-to and overview documentation are found specific to the software application or software product being documented by API Writers. This documentation may be used by developers, testers and also the end customers or clients using this software application. Today, we see lot of high end applications in the field of power, energy, transportation, networks, aerospace, safety, security, industry automation and a variety of other domains. Technical documentation has become important within such organizations as the basic and advanced level of information may change over a period of time with architecture changes. Hence, technical documentation has gained lot of importance in recent times, especially in the software field.

Often, tools such as Doxygen, NDoc, javadoc, EiffelStudio, Sandcastle, ROBODoc, POD, TwinText, or Universal Report can be used to auto-generate the code documents&amp;mdash;that is, they extract the comments and software contracts, where available, from the source code and create reference manuals in such forms as text or HTML files. Code documents are often organized into a ''reference guide'' style, allowing a programmer to quickly look up an arbitrary function or class.

The idea of auto-generating documentation is attractive to programmers for various reasons.  For example, because it is extracted from the source code itself (for example, through comments), the programmer can write it while referring to the code, and use the same tools used to create the source code to make the documentation.  This makes it much easier to keep the documentation up-to-date.

Of course, a downside is that only programmers can edit this kind of documentation, and it depends on them to refresh the output (for example, by running a cron job to update the documents nightly). Some would characterize this as a pro rather than a con.

Donald Knuth has insisted on the fact that documentation can be a very difficult afterthought process and has advocated literate programming, writing at the same time and location as the source code and extracted by automatic means.

Elucidative Programming is the result of practical applications of Literate Programming in real programming contexts.
The Elucidative paradigm proposes that source code and documentation be stored separately.
This paradigm was inspired by the same experimental findings that produced [http://kelp.sf.net/ Kelp].
Often, software developers need to be able to create and access information that is not going to be part of the source file itself. Such annotations are usually part of several software development activities, such as code walks and porting, where third party source code is analysed in a functional way. Annotations can therefore help the developer during any stage of software development where a formal documentation system would hinder progress.
[http://kelp.sf.net/ Kelp] stores annotations in separate files, linking the information to the source code dynamically.

=== User documentation ===
Unlike code documents, user documents are usually far more diverse with respect to the source code of the program, and instead simply describe how it is used.  

In the case of a software library, the code documents and user documents could be effectively equivalent and are worth conjoining, but for a general application this is not often true. 

Typically, the user documentation describes each feature of the program, and assists the user in realizing these features.  A good user document can also go so far as to provide thorough troubleshooting assistance.  It is very important for user documents to not be confusing, and for them to be up to date.  User documents need not be organized in any particular way, but it is very important for them to have a thorough index. Consistency and simplicity are also very valuable. User documentation is considered to constitute a contract specifying what the software will do. API Writers are very well accomplished towards writing good user documents as they would be well aware of the software architecture and programming techniques used. See also Technical Writing.

There are three broad ways in which user documentation can be organized. 
# '''Tutorial:''' A tutorial approach is considered the most useful for a new user, in which they are guided through each step of accomplishing particular tasks &lt;ref name=kdp&gt;{{cite web

  | doi =

# '''Thematic:''' A thematic approach, where chapters or sections concentrate on one particular area of interest, is of more general use to an intermediate user.  Some authors prefer to convey their ideas through a knowledge based article to facilitating the user needs.  This approach is usually practiced by a dynamic industry, such as Information technology, where the user population is largely correlated with the troubleshooting demands &lt;ref name=kbad&gt;{{cite web

  | doi =
  | accessdate = 15 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.
# '''List or Reference:''' The final type of organizing principle is one in which commands or tasks are simply listed alphabetically or logically grouped, often via cross-referenced indexes. This latter approach is of greater use to advanced users who know exactly what sort of information they are looking for.

A common complaint among users regarding software documentation is that only one of these three approaches was taken to the near-exclusion of the other two. It is common to limit provided software documentation for personal computers to online help that give only reference information on commands or menu items.  The job of tutoring new users or helping more experienced users get the most out of a program is left to private publishers, who are often given significant assistance by the software developer.

=== Marketing documentation ===
For many applications it is necessary to have some promotional materials to encourage casual observers to spend more time learning about the product.  This form of documentation has three purposes:-

#To excite the potential user about the product and instill in them a desire for becoming more involved with it.
#To inform them about what exactly the product does, so that their expectations are in line with what they will be receiving.
#To explain the position of this product with respect to other alternatives.  

One good marketing technique is to provide clear and memorable ''catch phrases'' that exemplify the point we wish to convey, and also emphasize the interoperability of the program with anything else provided by the manufacturer.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Software testing''' is an investigation conducted to provide stakeholders with information about the quality of the product or service under test.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kaner.com/pdfs/ETatQAI.pdf Exploratory Testing], Cem Kaner, Florida Institute of Technology, ''Quality Assurance Institute Worldwide Annual Software Testing Conference'', Orlando, FL, November 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Software testing also provides an objective, independent view of the software to allow the business to appreciate and understand the risks of software implementation. Test techniques include, but are not limited to, the process of executing a program or application with the intent of finding software bugs.

Software testing can also be stated as the process of validating and verifying that a software program/application/product:
# meets the business and technical requirements that guided its design and development;
# works as expected; and
# can be implemented with the same characteristics.

Software testing, depending on the testing method employed, can be implemented at any time in the development process. However, most of the test effort occurs after the requirements have been defined and the coding process has been completed. As such, the methodology of the test is governed by the software development methodology adopted.

Different software development models will focus the test effort at different points in the development process. Newer development models, such as Agile, often employ test driven development and place an increased portion of the testing in the hands of the developer, before it reaches a formal team of testers. In a more traditional model, most of the test execution occurs after the requirements have been defined and the coding process has been completed.

== Overview ==
Testing can never completely identify all the defects within software. Instead, it furnishes a ''criticism'' or ''comparison'' that compares the state and behavior of the product against oracles&amp;mdash;principles or mechanisms by which someone might recognize a problem. These oracles may include (but are not limited to) specifications, contracts,&lt;ref&gt;Leitner, A., Ciupa, I., Oriol, M., Meyer, B., Fiva, A., [http://se.inf.ethz.ch/people/leitner/publications/cdd_leitner_esec_fse_2007.pdf &quot;Contract Driven Development = Test Driven Development - Writing Test Cases&quot;], Proceedings of ESEC/FSE'07: European Software Engineering Conference and the ACM SIGSOFT Symposium on the Foundations of Software Engineering 2007, (Dubrovnik, Croatia), September 2007&lt;/ref&gt; comparable products, past versions of the same product, inferences about intended or expected purpose, user or customer expectations, relevant standards, applicable laws, or other criteria.

Every software product has a target audience. For example, the audience for video game software is completely different from banking software. Therefore, when an organization develops or otherwise invests in a software product, it can assess whether the software product will be acceptable to its end users, its target audience, its purchasers, and other stakeholders. '''Software testing''' is the process of attempting to make this assessment.

A study conducted by NIST in 2002 reports that software bugs cost the U.S. economy $59.5 billion annually. More than a third of this cost could be avoided if better software testing was performed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abeacha.com/NIST_press_release_bugs_cost.htm Software errors cost U.S. economy $59.5 billion annually], NIST report&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The separation of debugging from testing was initially introduced by Glenford J. Myers in 1979.&lt;ref name=&quot;Myers 1979&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first=Glenford J.|last=Myers|title=The Art of Software Testing|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|year=1979|isbn=0-471-04328-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although his attention was on breakage testing (&quot;a successful test is one that finds a bug&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Myers 1979&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Dr. Dobb's journal of software tools for the professional programmer|publisher=M&amp;amp;T Pub|year=1987|volume=12|issue=1-6|page=116|url=http://books.google.com/?id=7RoIAAAAIAAJ|title=Dr. Dobb's journal of software tools for the professional programmer|author1=Company, People's Computer}}&lt;/ref&gt;) it illustrated the desire of the software engineering community to separate fundamental development activities, such as debugging, from that of verification. Dave Gelperin and William C. Hetzel classified in 1988 the phases and goals in software testing in the following stages:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=D.|last=Gelperin|coauthors=B. Hetzel|title=The Growth of Software Testing|journal=CACM|volume=31|issue=6|year=1988|id=ISSN 0001-0782}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Until 1956 - Debugging oriented&lt;ref&gt;''until 1956 it was the debugging oriented period, when testing was often associated to debugging: there was no clear difference between testing and debugging.'' {{cite journal|first=D.|last=Gelperin|coauthors=B. Hetzel|title=The Growth of Software Testing|journal=CACM|volume=31|issue=6|year=1988|id=ISSN 0001-0782}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1957–1978 - Demonstration oriented&lt;ref&gt;''From 1957–1978 there was the demonstration oriented period where debugging and testing was distinguished now - in this period it was shown, that software satisfies the requirements.'' {{cite journal|first=D.|last=Gelperin|coauthors=B. Hetzel|title=The Growth of Software Testing|journal=CACM|volume=31|issue=6|year=1988|id=ISSN 0001-0782}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1979–1982 - Destruction oriented&lt;ref&gt;''The time between 1979–1982 is announced as the destruction oriented period, where the goal was to find errors.'' {{cite journal|first=D.|last=Gelperin|coauthors=B. Hetzel|title=The Growth of Software Testing|journal=CACM|volume=31|issue=6|year=1988|id=ISSN 0001-0782}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1983–1987 - Evaluation oriented&lt;ref&gt;''1983–1987 is classified as the evaluation oriented period: intention here is that during the software lifecycle a product evaluation is provided and measuring quality.'' {{cite journal|first=D.|last=Gelperin|coauthors=B.

* 1988–2000 - Prevention oriented&lt;ref name=&quot;Gelperin 1988&quot;&gt;''From 1988 on it was seen as prevention oriented period where tests were to demonstrate that software satisfies its specification, to detect faults and to prevent faults.'' {{cite journal|first=D.|last=Gelperin|coauthors=B. Hetzel|title=The Growth of Software Testing|journal=CACM|volume=31|issue=6|year=1988|id=ISSN 0001-0782}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Software testing topics ==
=== Scope ===
A primary purpose of testing is to detect software failures so that defects may be discovered and corrected. This is a non-trivial pursuit. Testing cannot establish that a product functions properly under all conditions but can only establish that it does not function properly under specific conditions.&lt;ref name=Kaner1&gt;{{cite book | last = Kaner | first = Cem | authorlink = Cem Kaner | coauthors =Falk, Jack and Nguyen, Hung Quoc | title = Testing Computer Software, 2nd Ed. | publisher = John Wiley and Sons, Inc. | year = 1999 | location = New York, et al | pages = 480 pages | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-471-35846-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scope of software testing often includes examination of code as well as execution of that code in various environments and conditions as well as examining the aspects of code: does it do what it is supposed to do and do what it needs to do. In the current culture of software development, a testing organization may be separate from the development team. There are various roles for testing team members. Information derived from software testing may be used to correct the process by which software is developed.&lt;ref name=&quot;kolawa&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Kolawa | first = Adam | coauthors = Huizinga, Dorota | title = Automated Defect Prevention: Best Practices in Software Management | url = http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470042125.html | year = 2007 | publisher = Wiley-IEEE Computer Society Press | location =| pages=41–43 | isbn = 0470042125 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Functional vs non-functional testing===
Functional testing refers to activities that verify a specific action or function of the code. These are usually found in the code requirements documentation, although some development methodologies work from use cases or user stories. Functional tests tend to answer the question of &quot;can the user do this&quot; or &quot;does this particular feature work&quot;.

Non-functional testing refers to aspects of the software that may not be related to a specific function or user action, such as scalability or security. Non-functional testing tends to answer such questions as &quot;how many people can log in at once&quot;.

===Defects and failures===
Not all software defects are caused by coding errors. One common source of expensive defects is caused by requirement gaps, e.g., unrecognized requirements, that result in errors of omission by the program designer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Kolawa | first = Adam | coauthors = Huizinga, Dorota | title = Automated Defect Prevention: Best Practices in Software Management | url = http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470042125.html | year = 2007 | publisher = Wiley-IEEE Computer Society Press | location =| page=86| pages =426 | isbn = 0470042125 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A common source of requirements gaps is non-functional requirements such as testability, scalability, maintainability, usability, performance, and security.

Software faults occur through the following processes. A programmer makes an error (mistake), which results in a defect (fault, bug) in the software source code. If this defect is executed, in certain situations the system will produce wrong results, causing a failure.&lt;ref name=&quot;ctfl&quot;&gt;Section 1.1.2, [http://www.istqb.org/downloads/syllabi/SyllabusFoundation.pdf Certified Tester Foundation Level Syllabus], International Software Testing Qualifications Board&lt;/ref&gt; Not all defects will necessarily result in failures. For example, defects in dead code will never result in failures. A defect can turn into a failure when the environment is changed. Examples of these changes in environment include the software being run on a new hardware platform, alterations in source data or interacting with different software.&lt;ref name=&quot;ctfl&quot; /&gt; A single defect may result in a wide range of failure symptoms.

=== Finding faults early ===
It is commonly believed that the earlier a defect is found the cheaper it is to fix it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Kaner | first = Cem | authorlink = Cem_Kaner | coauthors = James Bach, Bret Pettichord | title=Lessons Learned in Software Testing: A Context-Driven Approach | publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|Wiley |year=2001 | isbn = 0-471-08112-4 | page=4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The following table shows the cost of fixing the defect depending on the stage it was found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |
 last = McConnell |
 first = Steve |
 title = Code Complete |
 edition = 2nd |
 publisher = Microsoft Press |year=2004 |
 pages = 960 |
 isbn = 0-7356-1967-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if a problem in the requirements is found only post-release, then it would cost 10–100 times more to fix than if it had already been found by the requirements review.

===Compatibility===
A common cause of software failure (real or perceived) is a lack of compatibility with other application software, operating systems (or operating system versions, old or new), or target environments that differ greatly from the original (such as a terminal or GUI application intended to be run on the desktop now being required to become a web application, which must render in a web browser). For example, in the case of a lack of backward compatibility, this can occur because the programmers develop and test software only on the latest version of the target environment, which not all users may be running. This results in the unintended consequence that the latest work may not function on earlier versions of the target environment, or on older hardware that earlier versions of the target environment was capable of using. Sometimes such issues can be fixed by proactively abstracting operating system functionality into a separate program module or library.

===Input combinations and preconditions===
A very fundamental problem with software testing is that testing under ''all'' combinations of inputs and preconditions (initial state) is not feasible, even with a simple product.&lt;ref name=Kaner1&gt;pp 17–18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Principle 2, Section 1.3, [http://www.bcs.org/upload/pdf/istqbsyll.pdf Certified Tester Foundation Level Syllabus], International Software Testing Qualifications Board&lt;/ref&gt; This means that the number of defects in a software product can be very large and defects that occur infrequently are difficult to find in testing. More significantly, non-functional dimensions of quality (how it is supposed to ''be'' versus what it is supposed to ''do'')—usability, scalability, performance, compatibility, reliability&amp;mdash;can be highly subjective; something that constitutes sufficient value to one person may be intolerable to another.

===Static vs. dynamic testing===
There are many approaches to software testing. Reviews, walkthroughs, or inspections are considered as static testing, whereas actually executing programmed code with a given set of test cases is referred to as dynamic testing. Static testing can be (and unfortunately in practice often is) omitted. Dynamic testing takes place when the program itself is used for the first time (which is generally considered the beginning of the testing stage). Dynamic testing may begin before the program is 100% complete in order to test particular sections of code (modules or discrete functions). Typical techniques for this are either using stubs/drivers or execution from a debugger environment. For example, spreadsheet programs are, by their very nature, tested to a large extent interactively (&quot;on the fly&quot;), with results displayed immediately after each calculation or text manipulation.

===Software verification and validation===
Software testing is used in association with verification and validation:&lt;ref name=&quot;tran&quot;&gt;{{cite book
|last=Tran | first=Eushiuan | editor=Koopman, P. | title=Topics in Dependable Embedded Systems | location=USA | publisher=Carnegie Mellon University | year=1999 | chapter=Verification/Validation/Certification |chapterurl=http://www.ece.cmu.edu/~koopman/des_s99/verification/index.html | accessdate=2008-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Verification: Have we built the software right? (i.e., does it match the specification).
* Validation: Have we built the right software? (i.e., is this what the customer wants).

The terms verification and validation are commonly used interchangeably in the industry; it is also common to see these two terms incorrectly defined. According to the IEEE Standard Glossary of Software Engineering Terminology:
:Verification is the process of evaluating a system or component to determine whether the products of a given development phase satisfy the conditions imposed at the start of that phase.
:Validation is the process of evaluating a system or component during or at the end of the development process to determine whether it satisfies specified requirements.

===The software testing team===
Software testing can be done by software testers. Until the 1980s the term &quot;software tester&quot; was used generally, but later it was also seen as a separate profession. Regarding the periods and the different goals in software testing,&lt;ref&gt;see D. Gelperin and W.C. Hetzel&lt;/ref&gt; different roles have been established: ''manager'', ''test lead'', ''test designer'', ''tester'', ''automation developer'', and ''test administrator''.

=== Software quality assurance (SQA) ===
Though controversial, software testing is a part of the software quality assurance (SQA) process.&lt;ref name=Kaner1&gt;p 347&lt;/ref&gt; In SQA, software process specialists and auditors are concerned for the software development process rather than just the artefacts such as documentation, code and systems. They examine and change the software engineering process itself to reduce the amount of faults that end up in the delivered software: the so-called ''defect rate.''

What constitutes an &quot;acceptable defect rate&quot; depends on the nature of the software; A flight simulator video game would have much higher defect tolerance than software for an actual airplane.

Although there are close links with SQA, testing departments often exist independently, and there may be no SQA function in some companies.

Software testing is a task intended to detect defects in software by contrasting a computer program's expected results with its actual results for a given set of inputs. By contrast, QA (quality assurance) is the implementation of policies and procedures intended to prevent defects from occurring in the first place.

== Testing methods ==
=== The box approach ===
Software testing methods are traditionally divided into white- and black-box testing. These two approaches are used to describe the point of view that a test engineer takes when designing test cases.

==== White box testing ====
'''White box testing''' is when the tester has access to the internal data structures and algorithms including the code that implement these.

;Types of white box testing
:The following types of white box testing exist:
:* API testing (application programming interface) - testing of the application using public and private APIs
:* Code coverage - creating tests to satisfy some criteria of code coverage (e.g., the test designer can create tests to cause all statements in the program to be executed at least once)
:* Fault injection methods - improving the coverage of a test by introducing faults to test code paths
:* Mutation testing methods
:* Static testing - White box testing includes all static testing

;Test coverage
:White box testing methods can also be used to evaluate the completeness of a test suite that was created with black box testing methods. This allows the software team to examine parts of a system that are rarely tested and ensures that the most important function points have been tested.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bullseye.com/coverage.html#intro Introduction], Code Coverage Analysis, Steve Cornett&lt;/ref&gt;

:Two common forms of code coverage are:
:* ''Function coverage'', which reports on functions executed
:* ''Statement coverage'', which reports on the number of lines executed to complete the test

They both return a code coverage metric, measured as a percentage.

==== Black box testing ====
Black box testing treats the software as a &quot;black box&quot;&amp;mdash;without any knowledge of internal implementation. Black box testing methods include: equivalence partitioning, boundary value analysis, all-pairs testing, fuzz testing, model-based testing, exploratory testing and specification-based testing.

:'''Specification-based testing''': Specification-based testing aims to test the functionality of software according to the applicable requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Laycock | first = G. T. | title = The Theory and Practice of Specification Based Software Testing | publisher = Dept of Computer Science, Sheffield University, UK | year = 1993 | url =http://www.mcs.le.ac.uk/people/gtl1/thesis.ps.gz | format = PostScript| accessdate = 2008-02-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the tester inputs data into, and only sees the output from, the test object. This level of testing usually requires thorough test cases to be provided to the tester, who then can simply verify that for a given input, the output value (or behavior), either &quot;is&quot; or &quot;is not&quot; the same as the expected value specified in the test case.

:Specification-based testing is necessary, but it is insufficient to guard against certain risks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:'''Advantages and disadvantages''': The black box tester has no &quot;bonds&quot; with the code, and a tester's perception is very simple: a code ''must'' have bugs. Using the principle, &quot;Ask and you shall receive,&quot; black box testers find bugs where programmers do not. On the other hand, black box testing has been said to be &quot;like a walk in a dark labyrinth without a flashlight,&quot; because the tester doesn't know how the software being tested was actually constructed. As a result, there are situations when (1) a tester writes many test cases to check something that could have been tested by only one test case, and/or (2) some parts of the back-end are not tested at all.

Therefore, black box testing has the advantage of &quot;an unaffiliated opinion&quot;, on the one hand, and the disadvantage of &quot;blind exploring&quot;, on the other.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Savenkov | first = Roman | title=How to Become a Software Tester|publisher=Roman Savenkov Consulting|year=2008|isbn = 978-0-615-23372-7|page=159}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Grey box testing ====
'''Grey box testing''' (American spelling: '''gray box testing''') involves having knowledge of internal data structures and algorithms for purposes of designing the test cases, but testing at the user, or black-box level. Manipulating input data and formatting output do not qualify as grey box, because the input and output are clearly outside of the &quot;black-box&quot; that we are calling the system under test. This distinction is particularly important when conducting integration testing between two modules of code written by two different developers, where only the interfaces are exposed for test. However, modifying a data repository does qualify as grey box, as the user would not normally be able to change the data outside of the system under test. Grey box testing may also include reverse engineering to determine, for instance, boundary values or error messages.

==Testing levels==
Tests are frequently grouped by where they are added in the software development process, or by the level of specificity of the test.

=== Unit testing ===
'''Unit testing''' refers to tests that verify the functionality of a specific section of code, usually at the function level. In an object-oriented environment, this is usually at the class level, and the minimal unit tests include the constructors and destructors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Binder | first = Robert V.|title=Testing Object-Oriented Systems: Objects, Patterns, and Tools|publisher=Addison-Wesley Professional|year=1999|isbn= 0-201-80938-9|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These type of tests are usually written by developers as they work on code (white-box style), to ensure that the specific function is working as expected. One function might have multiple tests, to catch corner cases or other branches in the code. Unit testing alone cannot verify the functionality of a piece of software, but rather is used to assure that the building blocks the software uses work independently of each other.

Unit testing is also called ''component testing''.

=== Integration testing ===
'''Integration testing''' is any type of software testing that seeks to verify the interfaces between components against a software design. Software components may be integrated in an iterative way or all together (&quot;big bang&quot;). Normally the former is considered a better practice since it allows interface issues to be localised more quickly and fixed.

Integration testing works to expose defects in the interfaces and interaction between integrated components (modules). Progressively larger groups of tested software components corresponding to elements of the architectural design are integrated and tested until the software works as a system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Boris|last=Beizer|title=Software Testing Techniques|year=1990|edition=Second|isbn=0-442-20672-0|pages=21,430|publisher=Van Nostrand Reinhold|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== System testing ===
System testing tests a completely integrated system to verify that it meets its requirements.&lt;ref name=&quot;ieee&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=IEEE|title=IEEE Standard Computer Dictionary: A Compilation of IEEE Standard Computer Glossaries|publisher=IEEE|location=New York|year=1990|isbn= 1559370793}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== System integration testing ===
System integration testing verifies that a system is integrated to any external or third-party systems defined in the system requirements.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

=== Regression testing ===
'''Regression testing''' focuses on finding defects after a major code change has occurred. Specifically, it seeks to uncover software regressions, or old bugs that have come back. Such regressions occur whenever software functionality that was previously working correctly stops working as intended. Typically, regressions occur as an unintended consequence of program changes, when the newly developed part of the software collides with the previously existing code. Common methods of regression testing include re-running previously run tests and checking whether previously fixed faults have re-emerged. The depth of testing depends on the phase in the release process and the risk of the added features. They can either be complete, for changes added late in the release or deemed to be risky, to very shallow, consisting of positive tests on each feature, if the changes are early in the release or deemed to be of low risk.

=== Acceptance testing ===
Acceptance testing can mean one of two things:
# A smoke test is used as an acceptance test prior to introducing a new build to the main testing process, i.e. before integration or regression.
# Acceptance testing performed by the customer, often in their lab environment on their own hardware, is known as user acceptance testing (UAT). Acceptance testing may be performed as part of the hand-off process between any two phases of development. {{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

=== Alpha testing ===
''Alpha testing'' is simulated or actual operational testing by potential users/customers or an independent test team at the developers' site. Alpha testing is often employed for off-the-shelf software as a form of internal acceptance testing, before the software goes to beta testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = van Veenendaal | first = Erik | title = Standard glossary of terms used in Software Testing | url=http://www.astqb.org/educational-resources/glossary.php#A | accessdate = 17 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Beta testing ===
''Beta testing'' comes after alpha testing and can be considered a form of external user acceptance testing. Versions of the software, known as beta versions, are released to a limited audience outside of the programming team. The software is released to groups of people so that further testing can ensure the product has few faults or bugs. Sometimes, beta versions are made available to the open public to increase the feedback field to a maximal number of future users.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

==Non-functional testing==
Special methods exist to test non-functional aspects of software. In contrast to functional testing, which establishes the correct operation of the software (correct in that it matches the expected behavior defined in the design requirements), non-functional testing verifies that the software functions properly even when it receives invalid or unexpected inputs. Software fault injection, in the form of fuzzing, is an example of non-functional testing. Non-functional testing, especially for software, is designed to establish whether the device under test can tolerate invalid or unexpected inputs, thereby establishing the robustness of input validation routines as well as error-handling routines. Various commercial non-functional testing tools are linked from the software fault injection page; there are also numerous open-source and free software tools available that perform non-functional testing.

===Software performance testing and load testing===
Performance testing is executed to determine how fast a system or sub-system performs under a particular workload. It can also serve to validate and verify other quality attributes of the system, such as scalability, reliability and resource usage. Load testing is primarily concerned with testing that can continue to operate under a specific load, whether that be large quantities of data or a large number of users. This is generally referred to as software scalability. The related load testing activity of when performed as a non-functional activity is often referred to as ''endurance testing''.

''Volume testing'' is a way to test functionality. ''Stress testing'' is a way to test reliability. ''Load testing'' is a way to test performance. There is little agreement on what the specific goals of load testing are. The terms load testing, performance testing, reliability testing, and volume testing, are often used interchangeably.

===Stability testing===
Stability testing checks to see if the software can continuously function well in or above an acceptable period. This activity of non-functional software testing is often referred to as load (or endurance) testing.

===Usability testing===
Usability testing is needed to check if the user interface is easy to use and understand.It approach towards the use of the application.

===Security testing===
Security testing is essential for software that processes confidential data to prevent system intrusion by hackers.

===Internationalization and localization===
The general ability of software to be internationalized and localized can be automatically tested without actual translation, by using pseudolocalization. It will verify that the application still works, even after it has been translated into a new language or adapted for a new culture (such as different currencies or time zones).&lt;ref&gt;[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/goglobal/bb688148 Globalization Step-by-Step: The World-Ready Approach to Testing. Microsoft Developer Network]&lt;/ref&gt;

Actual translation to human languages must be tested, too. Possible localization failures include:
* Software is often localized by translating a list of strings out of context, and the translator may choose the wrong translation for an ambiguous source string.
* If several people translate strings, technical terminology may become inconsistent.
* Literal word-for-word translations may sound inappropriate, artificial or too technical in the target language.
* Untranslated messages in the original language may be left hard coded in the source code.
* Some messages may be created automatically in run time and the resulting string may be ungrammatical, functionally incorrect, misleading or confusing.
* Software may use a keyboard shortcut which has no function on the source language's keyboard layout, but is used for typing characters in the layout of the target language.
* Software may lack support for the character encoding of the target language.
* Fonts and font sizes which are appropriate in the source language, may be inappropriate in the target language; for example, CJK characters may become unreadable if the font is too small.
* A string in the target language may be longer than the software can handle. This may make the string partly invisible to the user or cause the software to fail.
* Software may lack proper support for reading or writing bi-directional text.
* Software may display images with text that wasn't localized.
* Localized operating systems may have differently-named system configuration files and environment variables and different formats for date and currency.
To avoid these and other localization problems, a tester who knows the target language must run the program with all the possible use cases for translation to see if the messages are readable, translated correctly in context and don't cause failures.

=== Destructive testing ===
Destructive testing attempts to cause the software or a sub-system to fail, in order to test its robustness.

== The testing process ==
===Traditional CMMI or waterfall development model===
A common practice of software testing is that testing is performed by an independent group of testers after the functionality is developed, before it is shipped to the customer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etestinghub.com/testing_lifecycles.php#2 e)Testing Phase in Software Testing:-]&lt;/ref&gt; This practice often results in the testing phase being used as a project buffer to compensate for project delays, thereby compromising the time devoted to testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Glenford J.|last=Myers|title=The Art of Software Testing|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|year=1979|isbn=0-471-04328-1|pages=145–146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another practice is to start software testing at the same moment the project starts and it is a continuous process until the project finishes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Dustin | first = Elfriede | title=Effective Software Testing|publisher=Addison Wesley|year=2002|isbn = 0-20179-429-2|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agile or Extreme development model===
In counterpoint, some emerging software disciplines such as extreme programming and the agile software development movement, adhere to a &quot;test-driven software development&quot; model. In this process, unit tests are written first, by the software engineers (often with pair programming in the extreme programming methodology). Of course these tests fail initially; as they are expected to. Then as code is written it passes incrementally larger portions of the test suites. The test suites are continuously updated as new failure conditions and corner cases are discovered, and they are integrated with any regression tests that are developed. Unit tests are maintained along with the rest of the software source code and generally integrated into the build process (with inherently interactive tests being relegated to a partially manual build acceptance process). The ultimate goal of this test process is to achieve continuous deployment where software updates can be published to the public frequently.

===A sample testing cycle===
Although variations exist between organizations, there is a typical cycle for testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book
|url=http://www.ece.cmu.edu/~koopman/des_s99/sw_testing/
|contribution=Software Testing (18-849b Dependable Embedded Systems)

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sample below is common among organizations employing the Waterfall development model.
* '''Requirements analysis''': Testing should begin in the requirements phase of the software development life cycle. During the design phase, testers work with developers in determining what aspects of a design are testable and with what parameters those tests work.
* '''Test planning''': Test strategy, test plan, testbed creation. Since many activities will be carried out during testing, a plan is needed.
*''' Test development''': Test procedures, test scenarios, test cases, test datasets, test scripts to use in testing software.
* '''Test execution''': Testers execute the software based on the plans and test documents then report any errors found to the development team.
* '''Test reporting''': Once testing is completed, testers generate metrics and make final reports on their test effort and whether or not the software tested is ready for release.
* '''Test result analysis''': Or Defect Analysis, is done by the development team usually along with the client, in order to decide what defects should be treated, fixed, rejected (i.e. found software working properly) or deferred to be dealt with later.
* '''Defect Retesting''': Once a defect has been dealt with by the development team, it is retested by the testing team. AKA Resolution testing.
* '''Regression testing''': It is common to have a small test program built of a subset of tests, for each integration of new, modified, or fixed software, in order to ensure that the latest delivery has not ruined anything, and that the software product as a whole is still working correctly.
* '''Test Closure''': Once the test meets the exit criteria, the activities such as capturing the key outputs, lessons learned, results, logs, documents related to the project are archived and used as a reference for future projects.

== Automated testing ==
Many programming groups are relying more and more on automated testing, especially groups that use
test-driven development. There are many frameworks to write tests in, and continuous integration software will run tests automatically every time code is checked into a version control system.

While automation cannot reproduce everything that a human can do (and all the ways they think of doing it), it can be very useful for regression testing. However, it does require a well-developed test suite of testing scripts in order to be truly useful.

===Testing tools===
Program testing and fault detection can be aided significantly by testing tools and debuggers.
Testing/debug tools include features such as:
* Program monitors, permitting full or partial monitoring of program code including:
** Instruction set simulator, permitting complete instruction level monitoring and trace facilities
** Program animation, permitting step-by-step execution and conditional breakpoint at source level or in machine code
** Code coverage reports
* Formatted dump or symbolic debugging, tools allowing inspection of program variables on error or at chosen points
* Automated functional GUI testing tools are used to repeat system-level tests through the GUI
* Benchmarks, allowing run-time performance comparisons to be made
* Performance analysis (or profiling tools) that can help to highlight hot spots and resource usage

Some of these features may be incorporated into an Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

* A regression testing technique is to have a standard set of tests, which cover existing functionality that result in persistent tabular data, and to compare pre-change data to post-change data, where there should not be differences, using a tool like diffkit.  Differences detected indicate unexpected functionality changes or &quot;regression&quot;.

=== Measurement in software testing ===
Usually, quality is constrained to such topics as correctness, completeness, security,{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} but can also include more technical requirements as described under the ISO standard ISO/IEC 9126, such as capability, reliability, efficiency, portability, maintainability, compatibility, and usability.

There are a number of frequently-used software measures, often called ''metrics'', which are used to assist in determining the state of the software or the adequacy of the testing.

==Testing artifacts==
Software testing process can produce several artifacts.

; Test plan
: A test specification is called a test plan. The developers are well aware what test plans will be executed and this information is made available to management and the developers. The idea is to make them more cautious when developing their code or making additional changes. Some companies have a higher-level document called a test strategy.
; Traceability matrix
: A traceability matrix is a table that correlates requirements or design documents to test documents. It is used to change tests when the source documents are changed, or to verify that the test results are correct.
; Test case
: A test case normally consists of a unique identifier, requirement references from a design specification, preconditions, events, a series of steps (also known as actions) to follow, input, output, expected result, and actual result. Clinically defined a test case is an input and an expected result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=IEEE|title=IEEE standard for software test documentation|publisher=IEEE|location=New York|year=1998|isbn= 0-7381-1443-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be as pragmatic as 'for condition x your derived result is y', whereas other test cases described in more detail the input scenario and what results might be expected. It can occasionally be a series of steps (but often steps are contained in a separate test procedure that can be exercised against multiple test cases, as a matter of economy) but with one expected result or expected outcome. The optional fields are a test case ID, test step, or order of execution number, related requirement(s), depth, test category, author, and check boxes for whether the test is automatable and has been automated. Larger test cases may also contain prerequisite states or steps, and descriptions. A test case should also contain a place for the actual result. These steps can be stored in a word processor document, spreadsheet, database, or other common repository. In a database system, you may also be able to see past test results, who generated the results, and what system configuration was used to generate those results. These past results would usually be stored in a separate table.
; Test script
: The test script is the combination of a test case, test procedure, and test data. Initially the term was derived from the product of work created by automated regression test tools. Today, test scripts can be manual, automated, or a combination of both.
; Test suite
: The most common term for a collection of test cases is a test suite. The test suite often also contains more detailed instructions or goals for each collection of test cases. It definitely contains a section where the tester identifies the system configuration used during testing. A group of test cases may also contain prerequisite states or steps, and descriptions of the following tests.
; Test data
: In most cases, multiple sets of values or data are used to test the same functionality of a particular feature. All the test values and changeable environmental components are collected in separate files and stored as test data. It is also useful to provide this data to the client and with the product or a project.
; Test harness
: The software, tools, samples of data input and output, and configurations are all referred to collectively as a test harness.

== Certifications ==
Several certification programs exist to support the professional aspirations of software testers and quality assurance specialists. No certification currently offered actually requires the applicant to demonstrate the ability to test software. No certification is based on a widely accepted body of knowledge. This has led some to declare that the testing field is not ready for certification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Cem|last=Kaner|year=2001|url=http://www.testingeducation.org/general/nsf_grant.pdf|format=pdf|title=NSF grant proposal to &quot;lay a foundation for significant improvements in the quality of academic and commercial courses in software testing&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certification itself cannot measure an individual's productivity, their skill, or practical knowledge, and cannot guarantee their competence, or professionalism as a tester.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.testingeducation.org/a/mest.pdf|format=pdf|first=Cem|last=Kaner|title=Measuring the Effectiveness of Software Testers|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Software testing certification types

== Controversy ==
Some of the major software testing controversies include:

;What constitutes responsible software testing? : Members of the &quot;context-driven&quot; school of testing&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.context-driven-testing.com context-driven-testing.com]&lt;/ref&gt; believe that there are no &quot;best practices&quot; of testing, but rather that testing is a set of skills that allow the tester to select or invent testing practices to suit each unique situation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.technicat.com/writing/process.html Article on taking agile traits without the agile method.]&lt;/ref&gt;

; Agile vs. traditional : Should testers learn to work under conditions of uncertainty and constant change or should they aim at process &quot;maturity&quot;? The agile testing movement has received growing popularity since 2006 mainly in commercial circles,&lt;ref&gt;[http://stpcollaborative.com/knowledge/272-were-all-part-of-the-story “We’re all part of the story”] by David Strom, July 1, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/login.jsp?url=/iel5/10705/33795/01609838.pdf?temp=x IEEE article about differences in adoption of agile trends between experienced managers vs. young students of the Project Management Institute].

; Exploratory test vs. scripted&lt;ref&gt;[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel5/10351/32923/01541817.pdf?arnumber=1541817 IEEE article on Exploratory vs. Non Exploratory testing]&lt;/ref&gt; : Should tests be designed at the same time as they are executed or should they be designed beforehand?

; Manual testing vs. automated : Some writers believe that test automation is so expensive relative to its value that it should be used sparingly.&lt;ref&gt;An example is Mark Fewster, Dorothy Graham: ''Software Test Automation.'' Addison Wesley, 1999, ISBN 0-201-33140-3.&lt;/ref&gt; More in particular, test-driven development states that developers should write unit-tests of the XUnit type before coding the functionality. The tests then can be considered as a way to capture and implement the requirements.

; Software design vs. software implementation: Should testing be carried out only at the end or throughout the whole process?

;Who watches the watchmen? : The idea is that any form of observation is also an interaction&amp;mdash;the act of testing can also affect that which is being tested.&lt;ref&gt;[http://channel9.msdn.com/forums/Coffeehouse/402611-Are-you-a-Test-Driven-Developer/ Microsoft Development Network Discussion on exactly this topic]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">In computer programming, '''unit testing''' is a method by which individual units of source code are tested to determine if they are fit for use. A unit is the smallest testable part of an application. In procedural programming a unit may be an individual function or procedure. Unit tests are created by programmers or occasionally by white box testers.

Ideally, each test case is independent from the others: substitutes like method stubs, mock objects,&lt;ref name=&quot;mocksarentstubs&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://martinfowler.com/articles/mocksArentStubs.html|title=Mocks aren't Stubs|date=2007-01-02|last=Fowler|first=Martin|authorlink=Martin Fowler|accessdate=2008-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; fakes and test harnesses can be used to assist testing a module in isolation. Unit tests are typically written and run by software developers to ensure that code meets its design and behaves as intended. Its implementation can vary from being very manual (pencil and paper) to being formalized as part of build automation.

== Benefits ==
The goal of unit testing is to isolate each part of the program and show that the individual parts are correct.&lt;ref name=&quot;kolawa&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Kolawa | first = Adam | coauthors = Huizinga, Dorota | title = Automated Defect Prevention: Best Practices in Software Management | url = http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470042125.html | year = 2007 | publisher = Wiley-IEEE Computer Society Press | location =| page=75| pages =426 | isbn = 0470042125 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A unit test provides a strict, written contract that the piece of code must satisfy. As a result, it affords several benefits. Unit tests find problems early in the development cycle.

=== Facilitates change ===
Unit testing allows the programmer to refactor code at a later date, and make sure the module still works correctly (e.g., in regression testing). The procedure is to write test cases for all functions and methods so that whenever a change causes a fault, it can be quickly identified and fixed.

Readily-available unit tests make it easy for the programmer to check whether a piece of code is still working properly.

In continuous unit testing environments, through the inherent practice of sustained maintenance, unit tests will continue to accurately reflect the intended use of the executable and code in the face of any change. Depending upon established development practices and unit test coverage, up-to-the-second accuracy can be maintained.
In unit testing we test each the module separately.

=== Simplifies integration ===
Unit testing may reduce uncertainty in the units themselves and can be used in a bottom-up testing style approach. By testing the parts of a program first and then testing the sum of its parts, integration testing becomes much easier.

An elaborate hierarchy of unit tests does not equal integration testing. Integration with peripheral units should be included in integration tests, but not in unit tests.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} Integration testing typically still relies heavily on humans testing manually; high-level or global-scope testing can be difficult to automate, such that manual testing often appears faster and cheaper.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

=== Documentation ===
Unit testing provides a sort of living documentation of the system. Developers looking to learn what functionality is provided by a unit and how to use it can look at the unit tests to gain a basic understanding of the unit's API.

Unit test cases embody characteristics that are critical to the success of the unit. These characteristics can indicate appropriate/inappropriate use of a unit as well as negative behaviors that are to be trapped by the unit. A unit test case, in and of itself, documents these critical characteristics, although many software development environments do not rely solely upon code to document the product in development.

By contrast, ordinary narrative documentation is more susceptible to drifting from the implementation of the program and will thus become outdated (e.g., design changes, feature creep, relaxed practices in keeping documents up-to-date).

=== Design ===
When software is developed using a test-driven approach, the unit test may take the place of formal design. Each unit test can be seen as a design element specifying classes, methods, and observable behaviour. The following Java example will help illustrate this point.

Here is a test class that specifies a number of elements of the implementation. First, that there must be an interface called Adder, and an implementing class with a zero-argument constructor called AdderImpl. It goes on to assert that the Adder interface should have a method called add, with two integer parameters, which returns another integer. It also specifies the behaviour of this method for a small range of values.

&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
public class TestAdder {
    public void testSum() {
        Adder adder = new AdderImpl();
        assert(adder.add(1, 1) == 2);
        assert(adder.add(1, 2) == 3);
        assert(adder.add(2, 2) == 4);
        assert(adder.add(0, 0) == 0);
        assert(adder.add(-1, -2) == -3);
        assert(adder.add(-1, 1) == 0);
        assert(adder.add(1234, 988) == 2222);
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

In this case the unit test, having been written first, acts as a design document specifying the form and behaviour of a desired solution, but not the implementation details, which are left for the programmer. Following the &quot;do the simplest thing that could possibly work&quot; practice, the easiest solution that will make the test pass is shown below.

&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
interface Adder {
    int add(int a, int b);
}
class AdderImpl implements Adder {
    int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Unlike other diagram-based design methods, using a unit-test as a design has one significant advantage. The design document (the unit-test itself) can be used to verify that the implementation adheres to the design. With the unit-test design method, the tests will never pass if the developer does not implement the solution according to the design.

It is true that unit testing lacks some of the accessibility of a diagram, but UML diagrams are now easily generated for most modern languages by free tools (usually available as extensions to IDEs). Free tools, like those based on the xUnit framework, outsource to another system the graphical rendering of a view for human consumption.

== Separation of interface from implementation ==
Because some classes may have references to other classes, testing a class can frequently spill over into testing another class. A common example of this is classes that depend on a database: in order to test the class, the tester often writes code that interacts with the database. This is a mistake, because a unit test should usually not go outside of its own class boundary, and especially should not cross such process/network boundaries because this can introduce unacceptable performance problems to the unit test-suite. Crossing such unit boundaries turns unit tests into integration tests, and when test cases fail, makes it less clear which component is causing the failure. See also Fakes, mocks and integration tests

Instead, the software developer should create an abstract interface around the database queries, and then implement that interface with their own mock object. By abstracting this necessary attachment from the code (temporarily reducing the net effective coupling), the independent unit can be more thoroughly tested than may have been previously achieved. This results in a higher quality unit that is also more maintainable.

== Unit testing limitations ==
Testing cannot be expected to catch every error in the program: it is impossible to evaluate every execution path in all but the most trivial programs. The same is true for unit testing. Additionally, unit testing by definition only tests the functionality of the units themselves. Therefore, it will not catch integration errors or broader system-level errors (such as functions performed across multiple units, or non-functional test areas such as performance). Unit testing should be done in conjunction with other software testing activities. Like all forms of software testing, unit tests can only show the presence of errors; they cannot show the absence of errors.

Software testing is a combinatorial problem. For example, every boolean decision statement requires at least two tests: one with an outcome of &quot;true&quot; and one with an outcome of &quot;false&quot;. As a result, for every line of code written, programmers often need 3 to 5 lines of test code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cramblitt|first=Bob|author-link=Bob Cramblitt| title=Alberto Savoia sings the praises of software testing|date=2007-09-20| accessdate=2007-11-29|url=http://searchsoftwarequality.techtarget.com/originalContent/0,289142,sid92_gci1273161,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; This obviously takes time and its investment may not be worth the effort. There are also many problems that cannot easily be tested at all &amp;ndash; for example those that are nondeterministic or involve multiple threads. In addition, writing code for a unit test is as likely to be at least as buggy as the code it is testing. Fred Brooks in The Mythical Man-Month quotes: ''never take two chronometers to sea. Always take one or three.'' Meaning, if two chronometers contradict, how do you know which one is correct?

To obtain the intended benefits from unit testing, rigorous discipline is needed throughout the software development process. It is essential to keep careful records not only of the tests that have been performed, but also of all changes that have been made to the source code of this or any other unit in the software. Use of a version control system is essential. If a later version of the unit fails a particular test that it had previously passed, the version-control software can provide a list of the source code changes (if any) that have been applied to the unit since that time.

It is also essential to implement a sustainable process for ensuring that test case failures are reviewed daily and addressed immediately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=daVeiga|first=Nada|author-link=Nada daVeiga| title=Change Code Without Fear: Utilize a regression safety net|date=2008-02-06| accessdate=2008-02-08|url=http://www.ddj.com/development-tools/206105233}}&lt;/ref&gt; If such a process is not implemented and ingrained into the team's workflow, the application will evolve out of sync with the unit test suite, increasing false positives and reducing the effectiveness of the test suite.

== Applications ==
=== Extreme Programming ===

Unit testing is the cornerstone of Extreme Programming, which relies on an automated unit testing framework. This automated unit testing framework can be either third party, e.g., xUnit, or created within the development group.

Extreme Programming uses the creation of unit tests for test-driven development. The developer writes a unit test that exposes either a software requirement or a defect. This test will fail because either the requirement isn't implemented yet, or because it intentionally exposes a defect in the existing code. Then, the developer writes the simplest code to make the test, along with other tests, pass.

Most code in a system is unit tested, but not necessarily all paths through the code. Extreme Programming mandates a &quot;test everything that can possibly break&quot; strategy, over the traditional &quot;test every execution path&quot; method. This leads developers to develop fewer tests than classical methods, but this isn't really a problem, more a restatement of fact, as classical methods have rarely ever been followed methodically enough for all execution paths to have been thoroughly tested.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} Extreme Programming simply recognizes that testing is rarely exhaustive (because it is often too expensive and time-consuming to be economically viable) and provides guidance on how to effectively focus limited resources.

Crucially, the test code is considered a first class project artifact in that it is maintained at the same quality as the implementation code, with all duplication removed. Developers release unit testing code to the code repository in conjunction with the code it tests. Extreme Programming's thorough unit testing allows the benefits mentioned above, such as simpler and more confident code development and refactoring, simplified code integration, accurate documentation, and more modular designs. These unit tests are also constantly run as a form of regression test.

=== Techniques ===

Unit testing is commonly automated, but may still be performed manually. The IEEE does not favor one over the other.&lt;ref&gt;IEEE Standards Board, [http://iteso.mx/~pgutierrez/calidad/Estandares/IEEE%201008.pdf &quot;IEEE Standard for Software Unit Testing: An American National Standard, ANSI/IEEE Std 1008-1987&quot;] in ''IEEE Standards: Software Engineering, Volume Two: Process Standards; 1999 Edition; published by The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.'' Software Engineering Technical Committee of the IEEE Computer Society.&lt;/ref&gt; A manual approach to unit testing may employ a step-by-step instructional document. Nevertheless, the objective in unit testing is to isolate a unit and validate its correctness. Automation is efficient for achieving this, and enables the many benefits listed in this article. Conversely, if not planned carefully, a careless manual unit test case may execute as an integration test case that involves many software components, and thus preclude the achievement of most if not all of the goals established for unit testing.

To fully realize the effect of isolation while using an automated approach, the unit or code body under test is executed within a framework outside of its natural environment. In other words, it is executed outside of the product or calling context for which it was originally created. Testing in such an isolated manner reveals unnecessary dependencies between the code being tested and other units or data spaces in the product. These dependencies can then be eliminated.

Using an automation framework, the developer codes criteria into the test to verify the unit's correctness. During test case execution, the framework logs tests that fail any criterion. Many frameworks will also automatically flag these failed test cases and report them in a summary. Depending upon the severity of a failure, the framework may halt subsequent testing.

As a consequence, unit testing is traditionally a motivator for programmers to create decoupled and cohesive code bodies. This practice promotes healthy habits in software development. Design patterns, unit testing, and refactoring often work together so that the best solution may emerge.

=== Unit testing frameworks ===
Unit testing frameworks are most often third-party products that are not distributed as part of the compiler suite. They help simplify the process of unit testing, having been developed for a wide variety of languages. Examples of testing frameworks include open source solutions such as the various code-driven testing frameworks known collectively as xUnit, and proprietary/commercial solutions such as TBrun, Testwell CTA++ and VectorCAST/C++.

It is generally possible to perform unit testing without the support of a specific framework by writing client code that exercises the units under test and uses assertions, exception handling, or other control flow mechanisms to signal failure. Unit testing without a framework is valuable in that there is a barrier to entry for the adoption of unit testing; having scant unit tests is hardly better than having none at all, whereas once a framework is in place, adding unit tests becomes relatively easy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bullseye.com/coverage.html#intermediate|accessdate=24 March 2009|title=Intermediate Coverage Goals|author=Bullseye Testing Technology|date=2006&amp;ndash;2008|publication-place}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some frameworks many advanced unit test features are missing or must be hand-coded.

=== Language-level unit testing support ===

Some programming languages support unit testing directly (Eg. Java). Their grammar allows the direct declaration of unit tests without importing a library (whether third party or standard). Additionally, the boolean conditions of the unit tests can be expressed in the same syntax as boolean expressions used in non-unit test code, such as what is used for &lt;tt&gt;if&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;while&lt;/tt&gt; statements.

Languages that directly support unit testing include:

* Cobra
* D

In software engineering, '''program profiling''', '''software profiling''' or simply '''profiling''', a form of dynamic program analysis (as opposed to static code analysis), is the investigation of a program's behavior using information gathered as the program executes. The usual purpose of this analysis is to determine which sections of a program to optimize - to increase its overall speed, decrease its memory requirement or sometimes both. 

* A '''(code) profiler''' is a '''performance analysis''' tool that, most commonly, measures only the frequency and duration of function calls, but there are other specific types of profilers (e.g. memory profilers&lt;!--plenty of hist on gbooks for this--&gt;) in addition to more comprehensive profilers, capable of gathering extensive performance data.
* An instruction set simulator which is also &amp;mdash; by necessity &amp;mdash; a profiler, can measure the totality of a program's behaviour from invocation to termination.

== Gathering program events ==
Profilers use a wide variety of techniques to collect data, including hardware interrupts, code instrumentation, instruction set simulation, operating system hooks, and performance counters. The usage of profilers is 'called out' in the performance engineering process.

== Use of profilers ==
''Program analysis tools are extremely important for understanding program behavior. Computer architects need such tools to evaluate how well programs will perform on new architectures. Software writers need tools to analyze their programs and identify critical sections of code. Compiler writers often use such tools to find out how well their instruction scheduling or branch prediction algorithm is performing...'' (ATOM, PLDI, '94)

The output of a profiler may be:- 

* A statistical ''summary'' of the events observed (a '''profile''')
:Summary profile information is often shown annotated against the source code statements where the events occur, so the size of measurement data is linear to the code size of the program.
:&lt;code&gt;
 /* ------------ source------------------------- count */             
 0001             IF X = &quot;A&quot;                     0055
 0002                THEN DO                       
 0003                  ADD 1 to XCOUNT           0032
 0004                ELSE
 0005             IF X = &quot;B&quot;                     0055
&lt;/code&gt;
* A stream of recorded events (a '''trace''')
:For sequential programs, a summary profile is usually sufficient, but performance problems in parallel programs (waiting for messages or synchronization issues) often depend on the time relationship of events, thus requiring a full trace to get an understanding of what is happening.
: The size of a (full) trace is linear to the program's instruction path length, making it somewhat impractical. A trace may therefore be initiated at one point in a program and terminated at another point to limit the output.
* An ongoing interaction with the hypervisor (continuous or periodic monitoring via on-screen display for instance)
: This provides the opportunity to switch a trace on or off at any desired point during execution in addition to viewing on-going metrics about the (still executing) program. It also provides the opportunity to suspend asynchronous processes at critical points to examine interactions with other parallel processes in more detail.

==History==
Performance analysis tools existed on IBM/360 and IBM/370 platforms from the early 1970s, usually based on timer interrupts which recorded the Program status word (PSW) at set timer intervals to detect &quot;hot spots&quot; in executing code. This was an early example of sampling (see below). In early 1974, Instruction Set Simulators permitted full trace and other performance monitoring features.

Profiler-driven program analysis on Unix dates back to at least 1979, when Unix systems included a basic tool &quot;prof&quot; that listed each function and how much of program execution time it used. In 1982, gprof extended the concept to a complete call graph analysis &lt;ref&gt;[http://docs.freebsd.org/44doc/psd/18.gprof/paper.pdf ''gprof: a Call Graph Execution Profiler'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, Amitabh Srivastava and Alan Eustace of Digital Equipment Corporation published a paper describing ATOM.&lt;ref&gt;[http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.119.8540 Atom: A system for building customized program analysis tools,  Amitabh Srivastava and Alan Eustace, 1994] ([http://www.ece.cmu.edu/~ece548/tools/atom/man/wrl_94_2.pdf download])&lt;/ref&gt; ATOM is a platform for converting a program into its own profiler. That is, at compile time, it inserts code into the program to be analyzed. That inserted code outputs analysis data. This technique - modifying a program to analyze itself - is known as &quot;instrumentation&quot;.

In 2004, both the gprof and ATOM papers appeared on the list of the 50 most influential PLDI papers of all time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/mckinley/20-years.html 20 Years of PLDI (1979 - 1999): A Selection, Kathryn S. McKinley, Editor]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Profiler types based on output ==
===Flat profiler ===
Flat profilers compute the average call times, from the calls, and do not break down the call times based on the callee or the context.

===Call-graph profiler===
Call graph profilers show the call times, and frequencies of the functions, and also the call-chains involved based on the callee. However context is not preserved.

==Methods of data gathering==
===Event-based profilers===
The programming languages listed here have event-based profilers:
* Java: the JVMTI (JVM Tools Interface) API, formerly JVMPI (JVM Profiling Interface), provides hooks to profilers, for trapping events like calls, class-load, unload, thread enter leave.
* .NET: Can attach a profiling agent as a COM server to the CLR. Like Java, the runtime then provides various callbacks into the agent, for trapping events like method JIT / enter / leave, object creation, etc. Particularly powerful in that the profiling agent can rewrite the target application's bytecode in arbitrary ways.
* Python: Python profiling includes the profile module, hotshot (which is call-graph based), and using the 'sys.setprofile' function to trap events like c_{call,return,exception}, python_{call,return,exception}.
* Ruby: Ruby also uses a similar interface like Python for profiling. Flat-profiler in profile.rb, module, and ruby-prof a C-extension are present.

===Statistical profilers===
Some profilers operate by sampling. A sampling profiler probes the target program's program counter at regular intervals using operating system interrupts. Sampling profiles are typically less numerically accurate and specific, but allow the target program to run at near full speed. 

The resulting data are not exact, but a statistical approximation. ''The actual amount of error is usually more than one sampling period. In fact, if a value is n times the sampling period, the expected error in it is the square-root of n sampling periods.'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://lgl.epfl.ch/teaching/case_tools/doc/gprof/gprof_12.html Statistical Inaccuracy of &lt;tt&gt;gprof&lt;/tt&gt; Output]&lt;/ref&gt;

In practice, sampling profilers can often provide a more accurate picture of the target program's execution than other approaches, as they are not as intrusive to the target program, and thus don't have as many side effects (such as on memory caches or instruction decoding pipelines). Also since they don't affect the execution speed as much, they can detect issues that would otherwise be hidden. They are also relatively immune to over-evaluating the cost of small, frequently called routines or 'tight' loops. They can show the relative amount of time spent in user mode versus interruptible kernel mode such as system call processing.

Still, kernel code to handle the interrupts entails a minor loss of CPU cycles, diverted cache usage, and is unable to distinguish the various tasks occurring in uninterruptible kernel code (microsecond-range activity).

Dedicated hardware can go beyond this: some recent MIPS processors JTAG interface have a PCSAMPLE register, which samples the program counter in a truly undetectable manner. 

Some of the most commonly used statistical profilers are AMD CodeAnalyst, Apple Inc. Shark, gprof, Intel VTune and Parallel Amplifier (part of Intel Parallel Studio).

===Instrumenting profilers===
Some profilers '''instrument''' the target program with additional instructions to collect the required information. 

Instrumenting the program can cause changes in the performance of the program, potentially causing inaccurate results and heisenbugs. Instrumenting will always have some impact on the program execution, typically always slowing it. However, instrumentation can be very specific and be carefully controlled to have a minimal impact. The impact on a particular program depends on the placement of instrumentation points and the mechanism used to capture the trace. Hardware support for trace capture means that on some targets, instrumentation can be on just one machine instruction. The impact of instrumentation can often be deducted (i.e. eliminated by subtraction) from the results.

gprof is an example of a profiler that uses both instrumentation and sampling. Instrumentation is used to gather caller information and the actual timing values are obtained by statistical sampling.

===Instrumentation ===
* '''Manual''': Performed by the programmer, e.g. by adding instructions to explicitly calculate runtimes, simply count events or calls to measurement APIs such as the Application Response Measurement standard.
* '''Automatic source level''': instrumentation added to the source code by an automatic tool according to an instrumentation policy.
* '''Compiler assisted''': Example: &quot;gcc -pg ...&quot; for gprof, &quot;quantify g++ ...&quot; for Quantify
* '''Binary translation''': The tool adds instrumentation to a compiled binary. Example: ATOM
* '''Runtime instrumentation''': Directly before execution the code is instrumented. The program run is fully supervised and controlled by the tool. Examples: Pin, Valgrind
* '''Runtime injection''': More lightweight than runtime instrumentation. Code is modified at runtime to have jumps to helper functions. Example: DynInst

===Interpreter instrumentation===
* '''Interpreter debug''' options can enable the collection of performance metrics as the interpreter encounters each target statement. A bytecode, control table or JIT interpreters are three examples that usually have complete control over execution of the target code, thus enabling extremely comprehensive data collection opportunities.

===Hypervisor/Simulator===
* '''Hypervisor''': Data are collected by running the (usually) unmodified program under a hypervisor. Example: SIMMON
* '''Simulator''' and '''Hypervisor''': Data collected interactively and selectively by running the unmodified program under an Instruction Set Simulator. Examples: SIMON (Batch Interactive test/debug) and IBM OLIVER (CICS interactive test/debug).

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Test-driven development''' ('''TDD''') is a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle: first the developer writes a failing automated test case that defines a desired improvement or new function, then produces code to pass that test and finally refactors the new code to acceptable standards. Kent Beck, who is credited with having developed or 'rediscovered' the technique, stated in 2003 that TDD encourages simple designs and inspires confidence.&lt;ref name=Beck/&gt;

Test-driven development is related to the test-first programming concepts of extreme programming, begun in 1999,&lt;ref name=&quot;Cworld92&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.computerworld.com/softwaretopics/software/appdev/story/0,10801,66192,00.html |title=Extreme Programming |author=Lee Copeland |date=December 2001 |work= |publisher=Computerworld |accessdate=January 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; but more recently has created more general interest in its own right.&lt;ref name=Newkirk&gt;Newkirk, JW and Vorontsov, AA. ''Test-Driven Development in Microsoft .NET'', Microsoft Press, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Programmers also apply the concept to improving and debugging legacy code developed with older techniques.&lt;ref name=Feathers&gt;Feathers, M. Working Effectively with Legacy Code, Prentice Hall, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

== Requirements ==
Test-driven development requires developers to create automated unit tests that define code requirements (immediately) before writing the code itself. The tests contain assertions that are either true or false. Passing the tests confirms correct behavior as developers evolve and refactor the code. Developers often use testing frameworks, such as xUnit, to create and automatically run sets of test cases.

== Test-driven development cycle ==
The following sequence is based on the book ''Test-Driven Development by Example''&lt;ref name=Beck&gt;Beck, K. Test-Driven Development by Example, Addison Wesley, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Add a test ===
In '''test-driven development''', each new feature begins with writing a test. This test must inevitably fail because it is written before the feature has been implemented. (If it does not fail, then either the proposed “new” feature already exists or the test is defective.) To write a test, the developer must clearly understand the feature's specification and requirements. The developer can accomplish this through use cases and user stories that cover the requirements and exception conditions. This could also imply a variant, or modification of an existing test. This is a differentiating feature of test-driven development versus writing unit tests ''after'' the code is written: it makes the developer focus on the requirements ''before'' writing the code, a subtle but important difference.

=== Run all tests and see if the new one fails ===
This validates that the test harness is working correctly and that the new test does not mistakenly pass without requiring any new code. This step also tests the test itself, in the negative: it rules out the possibility that the new test will always pass, and therefore be worthless.
The new test should also fail for the expected reason. This increases confidence (although it does not entirely guarantee) that it is testing the right thing, and will pass only in intended cases.

=== Write some code ===
The next step is to write some code that will cause the test to pass. The new code written at this stage will not be perfect and may, for example, pass the test in an inelegant way. That is acceptable because later steps will improve and hone it.

It is important that the code written is ''only'' designed to pass the test; no further (and therefore untested) functionality should be predicted and 'allowed for' at any stage.

=== Run the automated tests and see them succeed ===
If all test cases now pass, the programmer can be confident that the code meets all the tested requirements. This is a good point from which to begin the final step of the cycle.

=== Refactor code ===
Now the code can be cleaned up as necessary. By re-running the test cases, the developer can be confident that code refactoring is not damaging any existing functionality. The concept of removing duplication is an important aspect of any software design. In this case, however, it also applies to removing any duplication between the test code and the production code &amp;mdash; for example magic numbers or strings that were repeated in both, in order to make the test pass in step 3.

=== Repeat ===
Starting with another new test, the cycle is then repeated to push forward the functionality. The size of the steps should always be small, with as few as 1 to 10 edits between each test run. If new code does not rapidly satisfy a new test, or other tests fail unexpectedly, the programmer should undo or revert in preference to excessive debugging. Continuous Integration helps by providing revertible checkpoints. When using external libraries it is important not to make increments that are so small as to be effectively merely testing the library itself,&lt;ref name=Newkirk/&gt; unless there is some reason to believe that the library is buggy or is not sufficiently feature-complete to serve all the needs of the main program being written.

== Development style ==
There are various aspects to using test-driven development, for example the principles of &quot;keep it simple, stupid&quot; (KISS) and &quot;You ain't gonna need it&quot; (YAGNI). By focusing on writing only the code necessary to pass tests, designs can be cleaner and clearer than is often achieved by other methods.&lt;ref name=Beck/&gt; In ''Test-Driven Development by Example'' Kent Beck also suggests the principle &quot;Fake it till you make it&quot;.

To achieve some advanced design concept (such as a design pattern), tests are written that will generate that design. The code may remain simpler than the target pattern, but still pass all required tests. This can be unsettling at first but it allows the developer to focus only on what is important.

'''Write the tests first'''. The tests should be written before the functionality that is being tested. This has been claimed to have two benefits. It helps ensure that the application is written for testability, as the developers must consider how to test the application from the outset, rather than worrying about it later. It also ensures that tests for every feature will be written. When writing feature-first code, there is a tendency by developers and the development organisations to push the developer onto the next feature, neglecting testing entirely.

'''First fail the test cases'''. The idea is to ensure that the test really works and can catch an error. Once this is shown, the underlying functionality can be implemented. This has been coined the &quot;test-driven development mantra&quot;, known as red/green/refactor where red means ''fail'' and green is ''pass''. 

Test-driven development constantly repeats the steps of adding test cases that fail, passing them, and refactoring. Receiving the expected test results at each stage reinforces the programmer's mental model of the code, boosts confidence and increases productivity.

Advanced practices of test-driven development can lead to Acceptance Test-driven development (ATDD) where the criteria specified by the customer are automated into acceptance tests, which then drive the traditional unit test-driven development (UTDD) process.&lt;ref name=&quot;Koskela&quot;&gt;Koskela, L. &quot;Test Driven: TDD and Acceptance TDD for Java Developers&quot;, Manning Publications, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; This process ensures the customer has an automated mechanism to decide whether the software meets their requirements. With ATDD, the development team now has a specific target to satisfy, the acceptance tests, which keeps them continuously focused on what the customer really wants from that user story.

== Benefits ==
A 2005 study found that using TDD meant writing more tests and, in turn, programmers that wrote more tests tended to be more productive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

I hope there's a follow-up study because the productivity numbers simply don't add up very well to me. There is an undeniable correlation between productivity and the number of tests, but that correlation is actually stronger in the non-TDD group (which had a single outlier compared to roughly half of the TDD group being outside the 95% band).
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Programmers using pure TDD on new (&quot;greenfield&quot;) projects report they only rarely feel the need to invoke a debugger. Used in conjunction with a version control system, when tests fail unexpectedly, reverting the code to the last version that passed all tests may often be more productive than debugging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Test-driven development offers more than just simple validation of correctness, but can also drive the design of a program. By focusing on the test cases first, one must imagine how the functionality will be used by clients (in the first case, the test cases). So, the programmer is concerned with the interface before the implementation. This benefit is complementary to Design by Contract as it approaches code through test cases rather than through mathematical assertions or preconceptions.

Test-driven development offers the ability to take small steps when required. It allows a programmer to focus on the task at hand as the first goal is to make the test pass. Exceptional cases and error handling are not considered initially, and tests to create these extraneous circumstances are implemented separately. Test-driven development ensures in this way that all written code is covered by at least one test. This gives the programming team, and subsequent users, a greater level of confidence in the code.

While it is true that more code is required with TDD than without TDD because of the unit test code, total code implementation time is typically shorter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Large numbers of tests help to limit the number of defects in the code. The early and frequent nature of the testing helps to catch defects early in the development cycle, preventing them from becoming endemic and expensive problems. Eliminating defects early in the process usually avoids lengthy and tedious debugging later in the project.

TDD can lead to more modularized, flexible, and extensible code. This effect often comes about because the methodology requires that the developers think of the software in terms of small units that can be written and tested independently and integrated together later. This leads to smaller, more focused classes, looser coupling, and cleaner interfaces. The use of the mock object design pattern also contributes to the overall modularization of the code because this pattern requires that the code be written so that modules can be switched easily between mock versions for unit testing and &quot;real&quot; versions for deployment.

Because no more code is written than necessary to pass a failing test case, automated tests tend to cover every code path. For example, in order for a TDD developer to add an &lt;code&gt;else&lt;/code&gt; branch to an existing &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; statement, the developer would first have to write a failing test case that motivates the branch. As a result, the automated tests resulting from TDD tend to be very thorough: they will detect any unexpected changes in the code's behaviour. This detects problems that can arise where a change later in the development cycle unexpectedly alters other functionality.

== Vulnerabilities ==
* Test-driven development is difficult to use in situations where full functional tests are required to determine success or failure. Examples of these are user interfaces, programs that work with databases, and some that depend on specific network configurations. TDD encourages developers to put the minimum amount of code into such modules and to maximise the logic that is in testable library code, using fakes and mocks to represent the outside world.
* Management support is essential. Without the entire organization believing that test-driven development is going to improve the product, management may feel that time spent writing tests is wasted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|format=PDF
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Unit tests created in a test-driven development environment are typically created by the developer who will also write the code that is being tested. The tests may therefore share the same blind spots with the code: If, for example, a developer does not realize that certain input parameters must be checked, most likely neither the test nor the code will verify these input parameters. If the developer misinterprets the requirements specification for the module being developed, both the tests and the code will be wrong. 
* The high number of passing unit tests may bring a false sense of security, resulting in fewer additional software testing activities, such as integration testing and compliance testing.
* The tests themselves become part of the maintenance overhead of a project. Badly written tests, for example ones that include hard-coded error strings or which are themselves prone to failure, are expensive to maintain. There is a risk that tests that regularly generate false failures will be ignored, so that when a real failure occurs it may not be detected. It is possible to write tests for low and easy maintenance, for example by the reuse of error strings, and this should be a goal during the code refactoring phase described above.
* The level of coverage and testing detail achieved during repeated TDD cycles cannot easily be re-created at a later date. Therefore these original tests become increasingly precious as time goes by. If a poor architecture, a poor design or a poor testing strategy leads to a late change that makes dozens of existing tests fail, it is important that they are individually fixed. Merely deleting, disabling or rashly altering them can lead to undetectable holes in the test coverage.

==Code Visibility==
Test suite code clearly has to be able to access the code it is testing. On the other hand normal design criteria such as information hiding, encapsulation and the separation of concerns should not be compromised. Therefore unit test code for TDD is usually written within the same project or module as the code being tested. 

In object oriented design this still does not provide access to &lt;code&gt;private&lt;/code&gt; data and methods. Therefore, extra work may be necessary for unit tests. In Java and other languages, a developer can use reflection to access fields that are marked &lt;code&gt;private&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, an inner class can be used to hold the unit tests so they will have visibility of the enclosing class's members and attributes. In the .NET Framework and some other programming languages, partial classes may be used to expose private methods and data for the tests to access.

It is important that such testing hacks do not remain in the production code. In C and other languages, compiler directives such as &lt;code&gt;#if DEBUG ... #endif&lt;/code&gt; can be placed around such additional classes and indeed all other test-related code to prevent them being compiled into the released code. This then means that the released code is not exactly the same as that which is unit tested. The regular running of fewer but more comprehensive, end-to-end, integration tests on the final release build can then ensure (among other things) that no production code exists that subtly relies on aspects of the test harness.

There is some debate among practitioners of TDD, documented in their blogs and other writings, as to whether it is wise to test private and protected methods and data anyway. Some argue that it should be sufficient to test any class through its public interface as the private members are a mere implementation detail that may change, and should be allowed to do so without breaking numbers of tests. Others say that crucial aspects of functionality may be implemented in private methods, and that developing this while testing it indirectly via the public interface only obscures the issue: unit testing is about testing the smallest unit of functionality possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Fakes, mocks and integration tests==
Unit tests are so named because they each test ''one unit'' of code. A complex module may have a thousand unit tests and a simple one only ten. The tests used for TDD should never cross process boundaries in a program, let alone network connections. Doing so introduces delays that make tests run slowly and discourage developers from running the whole suite. Introducing dependencies on external modules or data also turns ''unit tests'' into ''integration tests''. If one module misbehaves in a chain of interrelated modules, it is not so immediately clear where to look for the cause of the failure.

When code under development relies on a database, a web service, or any other external process or service, enforcing a unit-testable separation is also an opportunity and a driving force to design more modular, more testable and more reusable code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Refactoring - Improving the design of existing code |last=Fowler |first=Martin |year=1999 |publisher=Addison Wesley Longman, Inc. |location=Boston |isbn=0-201-48567-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two steps are necessary:

# Whenever external access is going to be needed in the final design, an interface should be defined that describes the access that will be available. See the dependency inversion principle for a discussion of the benefits of doing this regardless of TDD. 
# The interface should be implemented in two ways, one of which really accesses the external process, and the other of which is a fake or mock. Fake objects need do little more than add a message such as “Person object saved” to a trace log, against which a test assertion can be run to verify correct behaviour. Mock objects differ in that they themselves contain test assertions that can make the test fail, for example, if the person's name and other data are not as expected. Fake and mock object methods that return data, ostensibly from a data store or user, can help the test process by always returning the same, realistic data that tests can rely upon. They can also be set into predefined fault modes so that error-handling routines can be developed and reliably tested. Fake services other than data stores may also be useful in TDD: Fake encryption services may not, in fact, encrypt the data passed; fake random number services may always return 1. Fake or mock implementations are examples of dependency injection.

A corollary of such dependency injection is that the actual database or other external-access code is never tested by the TDD process itself. To avoid errors that may arise from this, other tests are needed that instantiate the test-driven code with the “real” implementations of the interfaces discussed above. These tests are quite separate from the TDD unit tests, and are really integration tests. There will be fewer of them, and they need to be run less often than the unit tests. They can nonetheless be implemented using the same testing framework, such as xUnit.

Integration tests that alter any persistent store or database should always be designed carefully with consideration of the initial and final state of the files or database, even if any test fails. This is often achieved using some combination of the following techniques:
* The &lt;code&gt;TearDown&lt;/code&gt; method, which is integral to many test frameworks. 
* &lt;code&gt;try...catch...finally&lt;/code&gt; exception handling structures where available.
* Database transactions where a transaction atomically includes perhaps a write, a read and a matching delete operation.
* Taking a “snapshot” of the database before running any tests and rolling back to the snapshot after each test run. This may be automated using a framework such as Ant or NAnt or a continuous integration system such as CruiseControl.
* Initialising the database to a clean state ''before'' tests, rather than cleaning up ''after'' them. This may be relevant where cleaning up may make it difficult to diagnose test failures by deleting the final state of the database before detailed diagnosis can be performed.

Frameworks such as Moq, jMock, NMock, EasyMock, Typemock, jMockit, Unitils, Mockito, Mockachino, PowerMock or Rhino Mocks exist to make the process of creating and using complex mock objects easier.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Code refactoring''' is &quot;a disciplined way to restructure code&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Scott Ambler&lt;/ref&gt; undertaken  in order to improve some of the ''nonfunctional'' attributes of the software.
Typically, this is done by applying series of &quot;refactorings&quot;, each of which is a (usually) tiny change in a computer program's source code that does not modify its ''functional requirements''. Advantages include improved code readability and reduced complexity to improve the maintainability of the source code, as well as a more expressive internal architecture or object model to improve extensibility.

{{cquote|''By continuously improving the design of code, we make it easier and easier to work with. This is in sharp contrast to what typically happens: little refactoring and a great deal of attention paid to expediently adding new features. If you get into the hygienic habit of refactoring continuously, you'll find that it is easier to extend and maintain code.''|20px|20px|- Joshua Kerievsky, ''Refactoring to Patterns'' &lt;ref name=kerievsky&gt;{{cite book | last = Kerievsky | first = Joshua | title = Refactoring to Patterns | publisher = Addison Wesley | year = 2004  }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Refactoring does not take place in a vacuum, but typically the refactoring process takes place in a context of adding features to software:
* &quot;... refactoring and adding new functionality are two different but complementary tasks&quot; -- Scott Ambler

==Overview==
Refactoring is usually motivated by noticing a code smell.&lt;ref name=fowler&gt;{{cite book | last = Fowler| first = Martin |title = Refactoring: Improving the design of existing code | publisher = Addison Wesley | year = 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example the method at hand may be very long, or it may be a near duplicate of another nearby method. Once recognized, such problems can be addressed by ''refactoring'' the source code, or transforming it into a new form that behaves the same as before but that no longer &quot;smells&quot;.  For a long routine, extract one or more smaller subroutines. Or for duplicate routines, remove the duplication and utilize one shared function in their place. Failure to perform refactoring can result in accumulating technical debt.

There are two general categories of benefits to the activity of refactoring.
# Maintainability. It is easier to fix bugs because the source code is easy to read and the intent of its author is easy to grasp.&lt;ref name=martin&gt;{{cite book | last = Martin | first = Robert |title = Clean Code | publisher = Prentice Hall | year = 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This might be achieved by reducing large monolithic routines into a set of individually concise, well-named, single-purpose methods. It might be achieved by moving a method to a more appropriate class, or by removing misleading comments.
# Extensibility. It is easier to extend the capabilities of the application if it uses recognizable design patterns, and it provides some flexibility where none before may have existed.&lt;ref name=kerievsky/&gt;

Before refactoring a section of code, a solid set of automatic unit tests is needed. The tests should demonstrate in a few seconds {{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} that the behavior of the module is correct. The process is then an iterative cycle of making a small program transformation, testing it to ensure correctness, and making another small transformation. If at any point a test fails, you undo your last small change and try again in a different way. Through many small steps the program moves from where it was to where you want it to be. Proponents of extreme programming and other agile methodologies describe this activity as an integral part of the software development cycle.

==List of refactoring techniques==
Here are some examples of code refactorings; some of these may only apply to certain languages or language types. A longer list can be found in Fowler's Refactoring book&lt;ref name=fowler/&gt; and on Fowler's Refactoring Website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.refactoring.com/catalog/index.html Refactoring techniques in Fowler's refactoring Website]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Techniques that allow for more abstraction
** Encapsulate Field – force code to access the field with getter and setter methods
** Generalize Type – create more general types to allow for more code sharing
** Replace type-checking code with State/Strategy&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.refactoring.com/catalog/replaceTypeCodeWithStateStrategy.html Replace type-checking code with State/Strategy]&lt;/ref&gt;
** Replace conditional with polymorphism&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.refactoring.com/catalog/replaceConditionalWithPolymorphism.html Replace conditional with polymorphism]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Techniques for breaking code apart into more logical pieces
** Extract Method, to turn part of a larger method into a new method. By breaking down code in smaller pieces, it is more easily understandable. This is also applicable to functions.
** Extract Class moves part of the code from an existing class into a new class.
* Techniques for improving names and location of code
** Move Method or Move Field – move to a more appropriate Class or source file
** Rename Method or Rename Field – changing the name into a new one that better reveals its purpose
** Pull Up – in OOP, move to a superclass
** Push Down – in OOP, move to a subclass

==Hardware refactoring==
While the term ''refactoring'' originally referred exclusively to refactoring of software code, in recent years code written in hardware description languages (HDLs) has also been refactored. The term ''hardware refactoring'' is used as a shorthand term for refactoring of code in hardware description languages. Since HDLs are not considered to be programming languages by most hardware engineers,&lt;ref&gt;Hardware description languages and programming languages&lt;/ref&gt; hardware refactoring is to be considered a separate field from traditional code refactoring.

Automated refactoring of analog hardware descriptions (in VHDL-AMS) has been proposed by Zeng and Huss.&lt;ref&gt;Kaiping Zeng, Sorin A. Huss, &quot;Architecture refinements by code refactoring of behavioral VHDL-AMS models&quot;. ISCAS 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In their approach, refactoring preserves the simulated behavior of a hardware design. The non-functional measurement that improves is that refactored code can be processed by standard synthesis tools, while the original code cannot.
Refactoring of digital HDLs, albeit manual refactoring, has also been investigated by Synopsys fellow Mike Keating.&lt;ref&gt;M. Keating :&quot;Complexity, Abstraction, and the Challenges of Designing Complex Systems&quot;, in DAC'08 tutorial [http://www.dac.com/events/eventdetails.aspx?id=77-130]&quot;Bridging a Verification Gap: C++ to RTL for Practical Design&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Keating, P. Bricaud: ''Reuse Methodology Manual for System-on-a-Chip Designs'', Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; His target is to make complex systems easier to understand, which increases
the designers' productivity.

In the summer of 2008, there was an intense discussion about refactoring of VHDL code on the news://comp.lang.vhdl newsgroup.&lt;ref&gt;http://newsgroups.derkeiler.com/Archive/Comp/comp.lang.vhdl/2008-06/msg00173.html&lt;/ref&gt; The discussion revolved around a specific manual refactoring performed by one engineer, and the question to whether or not automated tools for such refactoring exist.

As of late 2009, Sigasi is offering automated tool support for VHDL refactoring.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eetimes.com/news/latest/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=222001855 www.eetimes.com/news/latest/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=222001855]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In the past refactoring was avoided in development processes. One example of this is that CVS (created in 1984) does not version the moving or renaming of files and directories.

Although refactoring code has been done informally for years, William Opdyke's 1992 Ph.D. dissertation&lt;ref name=&quot;opdyke-thesis&quot; /&gt; is the first known paper to specifically examine refactoring,&lt;ref name=&quot;etymology&quot;&gt;[http://martinfowler.com/bliki/EtymologyOfRefactoring.html Martin Fowler, &quot;MF Bliki: EtymologyOfRefactoring&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; although all the theory and machinery have long been available as program transformation systems.  All of these resources provide a catalog of common methods for refactoring; a refactoring method has a description of how to apply the method and indicators for when you should (or should not) apply the method.

Martin Fowler's book ''Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code''&lt;ref name=&quot;fowler&quot;/&gt;  is the canonical reference.

The first known use of the term &quot;refactoring&quot; in the published literature was in a September, 1990 article by William F. Opdyke and Ralph E. Johnson.&lt;ref name=&quot;opdyke90&quot;&gt;{{cite conference

The term &quot;factoring&quot; has been used in the Forth community since at least the early 1980s{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}.  Chapter Six of Leo Brodie's book ''Thinking Forth'' (1984) is dedicated to the subject.

In extreme programming, the Extract Method refactoring technique has essentially the same meaning as factoring in Forth; to break down a &quot;word&quot; (or function) into smaller, more easily maintained functions.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In the context of software engineering, '''software quality''' measures how well software is designed (''quality of design''), and how well the software conforms to that design (''quality of conformance''),&lt;ref name=&quot;Press746&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Pressman|2005|p=746}}&lt;/ref&gt; although there are several different definitions. It is often described as the 'fitness for purpose' of a piece of software.

Whereas ''quality of conformance'' is concerned with implementation (see Software Quality Assurance), ''quality of design'' measures how valid the design and requirements are in creating a worthwhile product.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pressman|2005|p=388}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==

One of the challenges of software quality is that &quot;everyone feels they understand it&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Crosby, P., ''Quality is Free'', McGraw-Hill, 1979&lt;/ref&gt;

Software quality may be defined as conformance to explicitly stated functional and performance requirements, explicitly documented development standards and implicit characteristics that are expected of all professionally developed software.

The three key points in this definition:
# Software requirements are the foundations from which quality is measured. &lt;blockquote&gt;Lack of conformance to requirement is lack of quality.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
# Specified standards define a set of development criteria that guide the manager is software engineering. &lt;blockquote&gt;If criteria are not followed lack of quality will usually result.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
# A set of implicit requirements often goes unmentioned, for example ease of use, maintainability etc.&lt;blockquote&gt;If software confirms to its explicit requirement but fails to meet implicit requirements, software quality is suspected.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A definition in Steve McConnell's ''Code Complete'' divides software into two pieces: '''internal''' and '''external quality characteristics'''. External quality characteristics are those parts of a product that face its users, where internal quality characteristics are those that do not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McConnell|1993|p=558}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another definition by Dr. Tom DeMarco says &quot;a product's quality is a function of how much it changes the world for the better.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;DeMarco, T., ''Management Can Make Quality (Im)possible'', Cutter IT Summit, Boston, April 1999&lt;/ref&gt; This can be interpreted as meaning that user satisfaction is more important than anything in determining software quality.&lt;ref name=&quot;Press746&quot;/&gt;

Another definition, coined by Gerald Weinberg in ''Quality Software Management: Systems Thinking'', is &quot;Quality is value to some person.&quot; This definition stresses that quality is inherently subjective - different people will experience the quality of the same software very differently. One strength of this definition is the questions it invites software teams to consider, such as &quot;Who are the people we want to value our software?&quot; and &quot;What will be valuable to ''them''?&quot;

== History ==
=== Software product quality ===
* Correctness
* Product quality
** conformance to requirements or program specification; related to Reliability
* Scalability
* Completeness
* Absence of bugs
* Fault-tolerance
** Extensibility
** Maintainability
* Documentation

The Consortium for IT Software Quality (CISQ) was launched in 2009 to standardize the measurement of software product quality. The Consortium's goal is to bring together industry executives from Global 2000 IT organizations, system integrators, outsourcers, and package vendors to jointly address the challenge of standardizing the measurement of IT software quality and to promote a market-based ecosystem to support its deployment.

=== Source code quality ===
A computer has no concept of &quot;well-written&quot; source code. However, from a human point of view source code can be written in a way that has an effect on the effort needed to comprehend its behavior. Many source code programming style guides, which often stress readability and usually language-specific conventions are aimed at reducing the cost of source code maintenance. Some of the issues that affect code quality include:
* Readability
* Ease of maintenance, testing, debugging, fixing, modification and portability
* Low complexity
* Low resource consumption: memory, CPU
* Number of compilation or lint warnings
* Robust input validation and error handling, established by software fault injection

Methods to improve the quality:
* Refactoring
* Code Inspection or software review
* Documenting code

== Software reliability ==
Software '''reliability''' is an important facet of software quality. It is defined as &quot;the probability of failure-free operation of a computer program in a specified environment for a specified time&quot;.&lt;ref&gt; J.D. Musa, A. Iannino, and K. Okumoto, ''Engineering and Managing Software with Reliability Measures'', McGraw-Hill, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

One of reliability's distinguishing characteristics is that it is objective, measurable, and can be estimated, whereas much of software quality is subjective criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pressman|2005|p=762}}&lt;/ref&gt; This distinction is especially important in the discipline of Software Quality Assurance. These measured criteria are typically called software metrics.

=== History ===
With software embedded into many devices today, software failure has caused more than inconvenience. Software errors have even caused human fatalities. The causes have ranged from poorly designed user interfaces to direct programming errors. An example of a programming error that lead to multiple deaths is discussed in Dr. Leveson's paper [http://sunnyday.mit.edu/papers/therac.pdf] (PDF). This has resulted in requirements for development of some types software. In the United States, both the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) have requirements for software development.

=== Goal of reliability ===
The need for a means to objectively determine software reliability comes from the desire to apply the techniques of contemporary engineering fields to the development of software. That desire is a result of the common observation, by both lay-persons and specialists, that computer software does not work the way it ought to. In other words, software is seen to exhibit undesirable behaviour, up to and including outright failure, with consequences for the data which is processed, the machinery on which the software runs, and by extension the people and materials which those machines might negatively affect. The more critical the application of the software to economic and production processes, or to life-sustaining systems, the more important is the need to assess the software's reliability.

Regardless of the criticality of any single software application, it is also more and more frequently observed that software has penetrated deeply into most every aspect of modern life through the technology we use. It is only expected that this infiltration will continue, along with an accompanying dependency on the software by the systems which maintain our society. As software becomes more and more crucial to the operation of the systems on which we depend, the argument goes, it only follows that the software should offer a concomitant level of dependability. In other words, the software should behave in the way it is intended, or even better, in the way it should.

=== Challenge of reliability ===
The circular logic of the preceding sentence is not accidental—it is meant to illustrate a fundamental problem in the issue of measuring software reliability, which is the difficulty of determining, in advance, exactly how the software is intended to operate. The problem seems to stem from a common conceptual error in the consideration of software, which is that software in some sense takes on a role which would otherwise be filled by a human being. This is a problem on two levels. Firstly, most modern software performs work which a human could never perform, especially at the high level of reliability that is often expected from software in comparison to humans. Secondly, software is fundamentally incapable of most of the mental capabilities of humans which separate them from mere mechanisms: qualities such as adaptability, general-purpose knowledge, a sense of conceptual and functional context, and common sense.

Nevertheless, most software programs could safely be considered to have a particular, even singular purpose. If the possibility can be allowed that said purpose can be well or even completely defined, it should present a means for at least considering objectively whether the software is, in fact, reliable, by comparing the expected outcome to the actual outcome of running the software in a given environment, with given data. Unfortunately, it is still not known whether it is possible to exhaustively determine either the expected outcome or the actual outcome of the entire set of possible environment and input data to a given program, without which it is probably impossible to determine the program's reliability with any certainty.

However, various attempts are in the works to attempt to rein in the vastness of the space of software's environmental and input variables, both for actual programs and theoretical descriptions of programs. Such attempts to improve software reliability can be applied at different stages of a program's development, in the case of real software. These stages principally include: requirements, design, programming, testing, and runtime evaluation. The study of theoretical software reliability is predominantly concerned with the concept of correctness, a mathematical field of computer science which is an outgrowth of language and automata theory.

=== Reliability in program development ===
==== Requirements ====
A program cannot be expected to work as desired if the developers of the program do not, in fact, know the program's desired behaviour in advance, or if they cannot at least determine its desired behaviour in parallel with development, in sufficient detail. What level of detail is considered sufficient is hotly debated. The idea of perfect detail is attractive, but may be impractical, if not actually impossible. This is because the desired behaviour tends to change as the possible range of the behaviour is determined through actual attempts, or more accurately, failed attempts, to achieve it.

Whether a program's desired behaviour can be successfully specified in advance is a moot point if the behaviour cannot be specified at all, and this is the focus of attempts to formalize the process of creating requirements for new software projects. In situ with the formalization effort is an attempt to help inform non-specialists, particularly non-programmers, who commission software projects without sufficient knowledge of what computer software is in fact capable. Communicating this knowledge is made more difficult by the fact that, as hinted above, even programmers cannot always know in advance what is actually possible for software in advance of trying.

==== Design ====
While requirements are meant to specify what a program should do, design is meant, at least at a high level, to specify how the program should do it. The usefulness of design is also questioned by some, but those who look to formalize the process of ensuring reliability often offer good software design processes as the most significant means to accomplish it. Software design usually involves the use of more abstract and general means of specifying the parts of the software and what they do. As such, it can be seen as a way to break a large program down into many smaller programs, such that those smaller pieces together do the work of the whole program.

The purposes of high-level design are as follows. It separates what are considered to be problems of architecture, or overall program concept and structure, from problems of actual coding, which solve problems of actual data processing. It applies additional constraints to the development process by narrowing the scope of the smaller software components, and thereby—it is hoped—removing variables which could increase the likelihood of programming errors. It provides a program template, including the specification of interfaces, which can be shared by different teams of developers working on disparate parts, such that they can know in advance how each of their contributions will interface with those of the other teams. Finally, and perhaps most controversially, it specifies the program independently of the implementation language or languages, thereby removing language-specific biases and limitations which would otherwise creep into the design, perhaps unwittingly on the part of programmer-designers.

==== Programming ====
The history of computer programming language development can often be best understood in the light of attempts to master the complexity of computer programs, which otherwise becomes more difficult to understand in proportion (perhaps exponentially) to the size of the programs. (Another way of looking at the evolution of programming languages is simply as a way of getting the computer to do more and more of the work, but this may be a different way of saying the same thing). Lack of understanding of a program's overall structure and functionality is a sure way to fail to detect errors in the program, and thus the use of better languages should, conversely, reduce the number of errors by enabling a better understanding.

Improvements in languages tend to provide incrementally what software design has attempted to do in one fell swoop: consider the software at ever greater levels of abstraction. Such inventions as statement, sub-routine, file, class, template, library, component and more have allowed the arrangement of a program's parts to be specified using abstractions such as layers, hierarchies and modules, which provide structure at different granularities, so that from any point of view the program's code can be imagined to be orderly and comprehensible.

In addition, improvements in languages have enabled more exact control over the shape and use of data elements, culminating in the abstract data type. These data types can be specified to a very fine degree, including how and when they are accessed, and even the state of the data before and after it is accessed..

==== Software Build and Deployment ====
Many programming languages such as C and Java require the program &quot;source code&quot; to be translated in to a form that can be executed by a computer. This translation is done by a program called a compiler. Additional operations may be involved to associate, bind, link or package files together in order to create a usable runtime configuration of the software application. The totality of the compiling and assembly process is generically called &quot;building&quot; the software.

The software build is critical to software quality because if any of the generated files are incorrect the software build is likely to fail. And, if the incorrect version of a program is inadvertently used, then testing can lead to false results.

Software builds are typically done in work area unrelated to the runtime area, such as the application server. For this reason, a deployment step is needed to physically transfer the software build products to the runtime area. The deployment procedure may also involve technical parameters, which, if set incorrectly, can also prevent software testing from beginning. For example, a Java application server may have options for parent-first or parent-last class loading. Using the incorrect parameter can cause the application to fail to execute on the application server.

The technical activities supporting software quality including build, deployment, change control and reporting are collectively known as Software configuration management. A number of software tools have arisen to help meet the challenges of configuration management including file control tools and build control tools.

==== Testing ====
'''Software testing''', when done correctly, can increase overall software ''quality of conformance'' by testing that the product conforms to its requirements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://istqbexamcertification.com/what-is-a-software-testing/ ISTQB] - What is software testing?&lt;/ref&gt; Testing includes, but is not limited to:

# Unit Testing
# Functional Testing
# Regression Testing
# Performance Testing
# Failover Testing
# Usability Testing

A number of agile methodologies use testing early in the development cycle to ensure quality in their products. For example, the test-driven development practice, where tests are written before the code they will test, is used in Extreme Programming to ensure quality.

==== Runtime ====
runtime reliability determinations are similar to tests, but go beyond simple confirmation of behaviour to the evaluation of qualities such as performance and interoperability with other code or particular hardware configurations.

== Software quality factors ==
A software quality factor is a non-functional requirement for a software program which is not called up by the customer's contract, but nevertheless is a desirable requirement which enhances the quality of the software program. Note that none of these factors are binary; that is, they are not “either you have it or you don’t” traits. Rather, they are characteristics that one seeks to maximize in one’s software to optimize its quality. So rather than asking whether a software product “has” factor ''x'', ask instead the ''degree'' to which it does (or does not).

Some software quality factors are listed here:

;Understandability: Clarity of purpose. This goes further than just a statement of purpose; all of the design and user documentation must be clearly written so that it is easily understandable. This is obviously subjective in that the user context must be taken into account: for instance, if the software product is to be used by software engineers it is not required to be understandable to the layman.

;Completeness: Presence of all constituent parts, with each part fully developed. This means that if the code calls a subroutine from an external library, the software package must provide reference to that library and all required parameters must be passed. All required input data must also be available.

;Conciseness: Minimization of excessive or redundant information or processing. This is important where memory capacity is limited, and it is generally considered good practice to keep lines of code to a minimum. It can be improved by replacing repeated functionality by one subroutine or function which achieves that functionality. It also applies to documents.

;Portability: Ability to be run well and easily on multiple computer configurations. Portability can mean both between different hardware—such as running on a PC as well as a smartphone—and between different operating systems—such as running on both Mac OS X and GNU/Linux.

;Consistency: Uniformity in notation, symbology, appearance, and terminology within itself.

;Maintainability: Propensity to facilitate updates to satisfy new requirements. Thus the software product that is maintainable should be well-documented, should not be complex, and should have spare capacity for memory, storage and processor utilization and other resources.

;Testability: Disposition to support acceptance criteria and evaluation of performance. Such a characteristic must be built-in during the design phase if the product is to be easily testable; a complex design leads to poor testability.

;Usability: Convenience and practicality of use. This is affected by such things as the human-computer interface. The component of the software that has most impact on this is the user interface (UI), which for best usability is usually graphical (i.e. a GUI).

;Reliability: Ability to be expected to perform its intended functions satisfactorily. This implies a time factor in that a reliable product is expected to perform correctly over a period of time. It also encompasses environmental considerations in that the product is required to perform correctly in whatever conditions it finds itself (sometimes termed robustness).

;Efficiency: Fulfillment of purpose without waste of resources, such as memory, space and processor utilization, network bandwidth, time, etc.

;Security: Ability to protect data against unauthorized access and to withstand malicious or inadvertent interference with its operations. Besides the presence of appropriate security mechanisms such as authentication, access control and encryption, security also implies resilience in the face of malicious, intelligent and adaptive attackers.

=== Measurement of software quality factors ===
There are varied perspectives within the field on measurement. There are a great many measures that are valued by some professionals—or in some contexts, that are decried as harmful by others. Some believe that quantitative measures of software quality are essential. Others believe that contexts where quantitative measures are useful are quite rare, and so prefer qualitative measures. Several leaders in the field of software testing have written about the difficulty of measuring what we truly want to measure well.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kaner&quot;&gt;Cem Kaner http://www.kaner.com/pdfs/metrics2004.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Douglass Hoffman
http://www.softwarequalitymethods.com/Papers/DarkMets%20Paper.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

One example of a popular metric is the number of faults encountered in the software. Software that contains few faults is considered by some to have higher quality than software that contains many faults. Questions that can help determine the usefulness of this metric in a particular context include:
# What constitutes “many faults?” Does this differ depending upon the purpose of the software (e.g., blogging software vs. navigational software)? Does this take into account the size and complexity of the software?
# Does this account for the importance of the bugs (and the importance to the stakeholders of the people those bugs bug)? Does one try to weight this metric by the severity of the fault, or the incidence of users it affects? If so, how? And if not, how does one know that 100 faults discovered is better than 1000?
# If the count of faults being discovered is shrinking, how do I know what that means? For example, does that mean that the product is now higher quality than it was before? Or that this is a smaller/less ambitious change than before? Or that fewer tester-hours have gone into the project than before? Or that this project was tested by less skilled testers than before? Or that the team has discovered that fewer faults reported is in their interest?

This last question points to an especially difficult one to manage. All software quality metrics are in some sense measures of human behavior, since humans create software.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kaner&quot;/&gt; If a team discovers that they will benefit from a drop in the number of reported bugs, there is a strong tendency for the team to start reporting fewer defects. That may mean that email begins to circumvent the bug tracking system, or that four or five bugs get lumped into one bug report, or that testers learn not to report minor annoyances. The difficulty is measuring what we mean to measure, without creating incentives for software programmers and testers to consciously or unconsciously “game” the measurements.

Software quality factors cannot be measured because of their vague definitions. It is necessary to find measurements, or metrics, which can be used to quantify them as non-functional requirements. For example, reliability is a software quality factor, but cannot be evaluated in its own right. However, there are related attributes to reliability, which can indeed be measured. Some such attributes are mean time to failure, rate of failure occurrence, and availability of the system. Similarly, an attribute of portability is the number of target-dependent statements in a program.

A scheme that could be used for evaluating software quality factors is given below. For every characteristic, there are a set of questions which are relevant to that characteristic. Some type of scoring formula could be developed based on the answers to these questions, from which a measurement of the characteristic can be obtained.

==== Understandability ====
Are variable names descriptive of the physical or functional property represented? Do uniquely recognisable functions contain adequate comments so that their purpose is clear? Are deviations from forward logical flow adequately commented? Are all elements of an array functionally related?....

==== Completeness ====
Are all necessary components available? Does any process fail for lack of resources or programming? Are all potential pathways through the code accounted for, including proper error handling?

==== Conciseness ====
Is all code reachable? Is any code redundant? How many statements within loops could be placed outside the loop, thus reducing computation time? Are branch decisions too complex?

==== Portability ====
Does the program depend upon system or library routines unique to a particular installation? Have machine-dependent statements been flagged and commented? Has dependency on internal bit representation of alphanumeric or special characters been avoided? How much effort would be required to transfer the program from one hardware/software system or environment to another?

==== Consistency ====
Is one variable name used to represent different logical or physical entities in the program? Does the program contain only one representation for any given physical or mathematical constant? Are functionally similar arithmetic expressions similarly constructed? Is a consistent scheme used for indentation, nomenclature, the color palette, fonts and other visual elements?

==== Maintainability ====
Has some memory capacity been reserved for future expansion? Is the design cohesive—i.e., does each module have distinct, recognizable functionality? Does the software allow for a change in data structures (object-oriented designs are more likely to allow for this)? If the code is procedure-based (rather than object-oriented), is a change likely to require restructuring the main program, or just a module?

==== Testability ====
Are complex structures employed in the code? Does the detailed design contain clear pseudo-code? Is the pseudo-code at a higher level of abstraction than the code? If tasking is used in concurrent designs, are schemes available for providing adequate test cases?

==== Usability ====
Is a GUI used? Is there adequate on-line help? Is a user manual provided? Are meaningful error messages provided?

==== Reliability ====
Are loop indexes range-tested? Is input data checked for range errors? Is divide-by-zero avoided? Is exception handling provided?
It is the probability that the software performs its intended functions correctly in a specified period of time under stated operation conditions,
but there could also be a problem with the requirement document...

==== Efficiency ====
Have functions been optimized for speed? Have repeatedly used blocks of code been formed into subroutines? Has the program been checked for memory leaks or overflow errors?

==== Security ====
Does the software protect itself and its data against unauthorized access and use? Does it allow its operator to enforce security policies? Are security mechanisms appropriate, adequate and correctly implemented? Can the software withstand attacks that can be anticipated in its intended environment?

== User's perspective ==
In addition to the technical qualities of software, the end user's experience also determines the quality of software. This aspect of software quality is called usability. It is hard to quantify the usability of a given software product.
Some important questions to be asked are:
* Is the user interface intuitive (self-explanatory/self-documenting)?
* Is it easy to perform simple operations?
* Is it feasible to perform complex operations?
* Does the software give sensible error messages?
* Do widgets behave as expected?
* Is the software well documented?
* Is the user interface responsive or too slow?

Also, the availability of (free or paid) support may factor into the usability of the software.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Static program analysis''' is the analysis of computer software that is performed without actually executing programs built from that software (analysis performed on executing programs is known as dynamic analysis).  In most cases the analysis is performed on some version of the source code and in the other cases some form of the object code.  The term is usually applied to the analysis performed by an automated tool, with human analysis being called program understanding, program comprehension or code review.

The sophistication of the analysis performed by tools varies from those that only consider the behavior of individual statements and declarations, to those that include the complete source code of a program in their analysis.  Uses of the information obtained from the analysis vary from highlighting possible coding errors (e.g., the lint tool) to formal methods that mathematically prove properties about a given program (e.g., its behavior matches that of its specification).

It can be argued that software metrics and reverse engineering are forms of static analysis.

A growing commercial use of static analysis is in the verification of properties of software used in safety-critical computer systems and
locating potentially vulnerable code. For example, medical software is increasing in sophistication and complexity, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has identified the use of static code analysis as a means of improving the quality of software&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Infusion Pump Software Safety Research at FDA | last=FDA| first= | publisher = Food and Drug Administration| date=2010-09-08 | url=http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ProductsandMedicalProcedures/GeneralHospitalDevicesandSupplies/InfusionPumps/ucm202511.htm | accessdate=2010-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Formal methods==
Formal methods is the term applied to the analysis of software (and hardware) whose results are obtained purely through the use of rigorous mathematical methods.  The mathematical techniques used include denotational semantics, axiomatic semantics, operational semantics, and abstract interpretation.

It has been proven that, barring some hypothesis that the state space of programs is finite, finding all possible run-time errors, or more generally any kind of violation of a specification on the final result of a program, is undecidable: there is no mechanical method that can always answer truthfully whether a given program may or may not exhibit runtime errors. This result dates from the works of Church, Kurt Gödel and Turing in the 1930s (see the halting problem and Rice's theorem). As with most{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} undecidable questions, one can still attempt to give useful approximate solutions.

Some of the implementation techniques of formal static analysis include:
*Model checking considers systems that have finite state or may be reduced to finite state by abstraction;
*Data-flow analysis is a lattice-based technique for gathering information about the possible set of values;
*Abstract interpretation models the effect that every statement has on the state of an abstract machine (i.e., it 'executes' the software based on the mathematical properties of each statement and declaration). This abstract machine over-approximates the behaviours of the system: the abstract system is thus made simpler to analyze, at the expense of ''incompleteness'' (not every property true of the original system is true of the abstract system). If properly done, though, abstract interpretation is ''sound'' (every property true of the abstract system can be mapped to a true property of the original system)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Formal Methods-based verification approach to medical device software analysis | last=Jones| first=Paul| publisher= Embedded Systems Design | date=2010-02-09 | url=http://embeddeddsp.embedded.com/design/opensource/222700533 | accessdate=2010-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The Frama-c framework and Polyspace heavily rely on abstract interpretation.
*Use of assertions in program code as first suggested by Hoare logic. There is tool support for some programming languages (e.g., the SPARK programming language (a subset of Ada) and the Java Modeling Language — JML — using ESC/Java and ESC/Java2, ANSI/ISO C Specification Language for the C language).

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''software metric''' is a measure of some property of a piece of software or its specifications. Since quantitative measurements are essential in all sciences, there is a continuous effort by computer science practitioners and theoreticians to bring similar approaches to software development. The goal is obtaining objective, reproducible and quantifiable measurements, which may have numerous valuable applications in schedule and budget planning, cost estimation, quality assurance testing, software debugging, software performance optimization, and optimal personnel task assignments.

== Common software measurements ==
Common software measurements include:
* Balanced scorecard
* Bugs per line of code
* COCOMO
* Code coverage
* Cohesion
* Comment density&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Descriptive Information (DI)  Metric Thresholds|url=http://www.lsec.dnd.ca/qsd_current_version/eng_support/di/metrics.htm|work=Land Software Engineering Centre|accessdate=19 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Connascent software components
* Coupling
* Cyclomatic complexity
* Function point analysis
* Halstead Complexity
* Instruction path length
* Number of classes and interfaces
* Number of lines of code
* Number of lines of customer requirements
* Program execution time
* Program load time
* Binary file|Program size (binary)
* Robert Cecil Martin’s software package metrics
* Weighted Micro Function Points

== Limitations ==
As software development is a complex process, with high variance on both methodologies and objectives, it is difficult to define or measure software qualities and quantities and to determine a valid and concurrent measurement metric, especially when making such a prediction prior to the detail design. Another source of difficulty and debate is in determining which metrics matter, and what they mean.&lt;ref name=&quot;integration_watch&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;when_why_how&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Kolawa|first=Adam|title=When, Why, and How: Code Analysis|url=http://www.codeproject.com/KB/interviews/Code_Review.aspx|work=The Code Project|accessdate=19 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The practical utility of ''software'' measurements has thus been limited to narrow domains where they include:
* Schedule
* Size/Complexity
* Cost
* Quality

Common goal of measurement may target one or more of the above aspects, or the balance between them as indicator of team’s motivation or project performance.

== Acceptance and Public Opinion ==
Some software development practitioners point out that simplistic measurements can cause more harm than good.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Kaner|first=Dr. Cem|title=Software Engineer Metrics: What do they measure and how do we know?|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.1.2542&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others have noted that metrics have become an integral part of the software development process.&lt;ref name=&quot;integration_watch&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Binstock|first=Andrew|title=Integration Watch: Using metrics effectively|url=http://www.sdtimes.com/link/34157|work=SD Times|publisher=BZ Media |accessdate=19 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Impact of measurement on programmers psychology have raised concerns for harmful effects to performance due to stress, performance anxiety, and attempts to cheat the metrics, while others find it to have positive impact on developers value towards their own work, and prevent them being undervalued.&lt;ref&gt;ProjectCodeMeter (2010) &quot;ProjectCodeMeter Users Manual&quot; page 65 [http://www.projectcodemeter.com/cost_estimation/images/files/PCMProManual.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;
Some argue that the definition of many measurement methodologies are imprecise, and consequently it is often unclear how tools for computing them arrive at a particular result,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1=Rüdiger|last1=Lincke|first2=Jonas|last2=Lundberg|first3=Welf|last3=Löwe|title=Comparing software metrics tools|year=2008|work=International Symposium on Software Testing and Analysis 2008|pages=131–142|url=http://www.arisa.se/files/LLL-08.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others argue that imperfect quantification is better than none (“You can’t control what you can't measure.”)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = DeMarco | first = Tom | authorlink = Tom DeMarco | year = | title = Controlling Software Projects: Management, Measurement and Estimation | edition = | pages = | publisher = | isbn = 0-13-171711-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
Evidence shows that software metrics are being widely used by government agencies, the US military, NASA&lt;ref&gt;NASA Metrics Planning and Reporting Working Group (MPARWG) [https://esdswg.eosdis.nasa.gov/wg/mpar/index.html]&lt;/ref&gt;, IT consultants, academic institutions&lt;ref&gt;USC Center for Systems and Software Engineering [http://sunset.usc.edu/csse/research/COCOMOII/cocomo_main.html]&lt;/ref&gt;,  and commercial and academic development estimation software.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This article describes various '''software package metrics'''. They have been mentioned by Robert Cecil Martin in his ''Agile Software Development: Principles, Patterns, and Practices'' book (2002).

The term ''software package'', as it is used here, refers to a group of related classes (in the field of object-oriented programming).

*  '''Number of Classes and Interfaces:''' The number of concrete and abstract classes (and interfaces) in the package is an indicator of the extensibility of the package.
* '''Afferent Couplings (Ca):''' The number of other packages that depend upon classes within the package is an indicator of the package's responsibility.
* '''Efferent Couplings (Ce):''' The number of other packages that the classes in the package depend upon is an indicator of the package's independence.
* '''Abstractness (A):''' The ratio of the number of abstract classes (and interfaces) in the analyzed package to the total number of classes in the analyzed package.  The range for this metric is 0 to 1, with A=0 indicating a completely concrete package and A=1 indicating a completely abstract package.
* '''Instability (I):''' The ratio of efferent coupling (Ce) to total coupling (Ce + Ca) such that I = Ce / (Ce + Ca). This metric is an indicator of the package's resilience to change.  The range for this metric is 0 to 1, with I=0 indicating a completely stable package and I=1 indicating a completely instable package.
* '''Distance from the Main Sequence (D):''' The perpendicular distance of a package from the idealized line A + I = 1. This metric is an indicator of the package's balance between abstractness and stability.  A package squarely on the main sequence is optimally balanced with respect to its abstractness and stability. Ideal packages are either completely abstract and stable (x=0, y=1) or completely concrete and instable (x=1, y=0).  The range for this metric is 0 to 1, with D=0 indicating a package that is coincident with the main sequence and D=1 indicating a package that is as far from the main sequence as possible.
* '''Package Dependency Cycles:''' Package dependency cycles are reported along with the hierarchical paths of packages participating in package dependency cycles.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Software visualization'''&lt;ref&gt;(Diehl, 2002; Diehl, 2007; Knight, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; is the static or animated 2-D or 3-D&lt;ref&gt;(Marcus et al., 2003; Wettel et al., 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; visual representation of information about software systems based on their structure,&lt;ref&gt;(Staples &amp; Bieman, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; size,&lt;ref&gt;(Lanza, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; history,&lt;ref&gt;(Girba et al., 2005, Lopez et al., 2004; Van Rysselberghe et al., 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; or behavior.&lt;ref&gt;(Kuhn et al., 2006, Stasko et al., 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically, the information used for visualization is software metric data from measurement activities or from reverse engineering. Visualization is inherently not a method for software quality assurance but can be used to manually discover anomalies similar to the process of visual data mining.&lt;ref&gt;(Keim, 2002; Soukup, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

The objectives of software visualizations are to support the understanding of software systems (i.e., its structure) and algorithms (e.g., by animating the behavior of sorting algorithms) as well as the analysis of software systems and their anomalies (e.g., by showing classes with high coupling).

== Types ==


=== Single component ===
Tool for software visualization might be used to visualize source code and quality defects during software development and maintenance activities. Their target is the automatic discovery and visualization of quality defects in object-oriented software systems and services. Designed as a plugin for an IDE (e.g., Visual Studio, Eclipse) they visualized the direct relationship of a class and its methods with other classes in the software system and mark potential quality defects to warn the developer. A further benefit is the support for visual navigation through the software system.

=== Whole (sub-)systems ===
Other more powerful tools are used to visualize a whole system or subsystem to explore the architecture or to apply visual data mining or visual analytics techniques for defect discovery.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Code review''' is systematic examination (often as peer review) of computer source code. It is intended to find and fix mistakes overlooked in the initial development phase, improving both the overall quality of software and the developers' skills. Reviews are done in various forms such as pair programming, informal walkthroughs, and formal inspections.&lt;ref name=&quot;best_practices&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Kolawa | first = Adam | coauthors = Huizinga, Dorota | title = Automated Defect Prevention: Best Practices in Software Management | url = http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470042125.html | year = 2007 | publisher = Wiley-IEEE Computer Society Press | location =| page=260 | pages =426 | isbn = 0470042125 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Introduction ==
Code reviews can often find and remove common vulnerabilities such as format string exploits, race conditions, memory leaks and buffer overflows, thereby improving software security. Online software repositories based on Subversion (with Redmine or Trac), Mercurial, Git or others allow groups of individuals to collaboratively review code. Additionally, specific tools for collaborative code review can facilitate the code review process.

Automated code reviewing software lessens the task of reviewing large chunks of code on the developer by systematically checking source code for known vulnerabilities. 

Capers Jones' ongoing analysis of over 12,000 software development projects showed that the latent defect discovery rate of formal inspection is in the 60-65% range. For informal inspection, the figure is less than 50%. {{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} The latent defect discovery rate for most forms of testing is about 30%. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Embedded Software: Facts, Figures, and Future | first1=Capers | last1=Jones | first2=Ebert | last2= Christof | publisher= IEEE Computer Society | date=April 2009 | url=http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/MC.2009.118 | accessdate=2010-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typical code review rates are about 150 lines of code per hour.  Inspecting and reviewing more than a few hundred lines of code per hour for critical software (such as safety critical embedded software) may be too fast to find errors. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Guide to Code Inspections | first=Jack | last=Ganssle | publisher= The Ganssle Group | date=February 2010 | url=http://www.ganssle.com/inspections.pdf | accessdate=2010-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Industry data indicate that code review can accomplish at most an 85% defect removal rate with an average rate of about 65%.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Measuring Defect Potentials and Defect Removal Efficiency | first=Capers | last=Jones | publisher= Crosstalk, The Journal of Defense Software Engineering | date=June 2008 | url=http://www.stsc.hill.af.mil/crosstalk/2008/06/0806jones.html | accessdate=2010-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==
Code review practices fall into three main categories: pair programming, formal code review and lightweight code review.&lt;ref name=&quot;best_practices&quot;/&gt;

Formal code review, such as a Fagan inspection, involves a careful and detailed process with multiple participants and multiple phases. Formal code reviews are the traditional method of review, in which software developers attend a series of meetings and review code line by line, usually using printed copies of the material. Formal inspections are extremely thorough and have been proven effective at finding defects in the code under review.

Lightweight code review typically requires less overhead than formal code inspections, though it can be equally effective when done properly.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} Lightweight reviews are often conducted as part of the normal development process:

* Over-the-shoulder – One developer looks over the author's shoulder as the latter walks through the code.
* Email pass-around – Source code management system emails code to reviewers automatically after checkin is made.
* Pair Programming – Two authors develop code together at the same workstation, such is common in Extreme Programming.
* Tool-assisted code review – Authors and reviewers use specialized tools designed for peer code review. 

Some of these may also be labeled a &quot;Walkthrough&quot; (informal) or &quot;Critique&quot; (fast and informal).

Many teams that eschew traditional, formal code review use one of the above forms of lightweight review as part of their normal development process. A code review case study published in the book ''Best Kept Secrets of Peer Code Review'' found that lightweight reviews uncovered as many bugs as formal reviews, but were faster and more cost-effective.

== Criticism ==
Historically, formal code reviews have required a considerable investment in preparation for the review event and execution time.

Some believe that skillful, disciplined use of a number of other development practices can result in similarly high latent defect discovery/avoidance rates. Further, XP proponents might argue, layering additional XP practices, such as refactoring and test-driven development will result in latent defect levels rivaling those achievable with more traditional approaches, without the investment.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

Use of code analysis tools can support this activity.  Especially tools that work in the IDE as they provide direct feedback to developers of coding standard compliance.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Inspection''' in software engineering, refers to peer review of any work product by trained individuals who look for defects using a well defined process. An inspection might also be referred to as a Fagan inspection after Michael Fagan, the creator of a very popular software inspection process.

== Introduction ==

An inspection is one of the most common sorts of review practices found in software projects. The goal of the inspection is for all of the inspectors to reach consensus on a work product and approve it for use in the project. Commonly inspected work products include software requirements specifications and test plans. In an inspection, a work product is selected for review and a team is gathered for an inspection meeting to review the work product. A moderator is chosen to moderate the meeting. Each inspector prepares for the meeting by reading the work product and noting each defect. '''The goal of the inspection is to identify defects'''. In an inspection, a defect is any part of the work product that will keep an inspector from approving it. For example, if the team is inspecting a software requirements specification, each defect will be text in the document which an inspector disagrees with.

== The process ==

The inspection process was developed by Michael Fagan in the mid-1970s and it has later been extended and modified.

The process should have entry criteria that determine if the inspection process is ready to begin. This prevents unfinished work products from entering the inspection process. The entry criteria might be a checklist including items such as &quot;The document has been spell-checked&quot;.

The stages in the inspections process are: Planning, Overview meeting, Preparation, Inspection meeting, Rework and Follow-up. The Preparation, Inspection meeting and Rework stages might be iterated.

* '''Planning:''' The inspection is planned by the moderator.
* '''Overview meeting:''' The author describes the background of the work product.
* '''Preparation:''' Each inspector examines the work product to identify possible defects.
* '''Inspection meeting:''' During this meeting the reader reads through the work product, part by part and the inspectors point out the defects for every part.
* '''Rework:''' The author makes changes to the work product according to the action plans from the inspection meeting.
* '''Follow-up:''' The changes by the author are checked to make sure everything is correct.

The process is ended by the moderator when it satisfies some predefined exit criteria.

== Inspection roles ==

During an inspection the following roles are used.

* '''Author:''' The person who created the work product being inspected.
* '''Moderator:''' This is the leader of the inspection. The moderator plans the inspection and coordinates it.
* '''Reader:''' The person reading through the documents, one item at a time. The other inspectors then point out defects.
* '''Recorder/Scribe:''' The person that documents the defects that are found during the inspection.
* '''Inspector:''' The person that examines the work product to identify possible defects.

== Related inspection types ==
=== Code review ===

A code review can be done as a special kind of inspection in which the team examines a sample of code and fixes any defects in it. In a code review, a defect is a block of code which does not properly implement its requirements, which does not function as the programmer intended, or which is not incorrect but could be improved (for example, it could be made more readable or its performance could be improved). In addition to helping teams find and fix bugs, code reviews are useful for both cross-training programmers on the code being reviewed and for helping junior developers learn new programming techniques.

=== Peer Reviews ===

Peer Reviews are considered an industry best-practice for detecting software defects early and learning about software artifacts. Peer Reviews are composed of software walkthroughs and software inspections and are integral to software product engineering activities. A collection of coordinated knowledge, skills, and behaviors facilitates the best possible practice of Peer Reviews. The elements of Peer Reviews include the structured review process, standard of excellence product checklists, defined roles of participants, and the forms and reports. 

Software inspections are the most rigorous form of Peer Reviews and fully utilize these elements in detecting defects. Software walkthroughs draw selectively upon the elements in assisting the producer to obtain the deepest understanding of an artifact and reaching a consensus among participants. Measured results reveal that Peer Reviews produce an attractive return on investment obtained through accelerated learning and early defect detection. For best results, Peer Reviews are rolled out within an organization through a defined program of preparing a policy and procedure, training practitioners and managers, defining measurements and populating a database structure, and sustaining the roll out infrastructure.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Software deployment''' is all of the activities that make a software system available for use.

The general deployment process consists of several interrelated activities with possible transitions between them. These activities can occur at the producer site or at the consumer site or both. Because every software system is unique, the precise processes or procedures within each activity can hardly be defined. Therefore, &quot;deployment&quot; should be interpreted as a ''general process'' that has to be customized according to specific requirements or characteristics.  A brief description of each activity will be presented later.

== Deployment activities ==
; Release
: The release activity follows from the completed development process. It includes all the operations to prepare a system for assembly and transfer to the customer site. Therefore, it must determine the resources required to operate at the customer site and collect information for carrying out subsequent activities of deployment process.
; Install and activate
: Activation is the activity of starting up the executable component of software. For simple system, it involves establishing some form of command for execution. For complex systems, it should make all the supporting systems ready to use.
: In larger software deployments, the working copy of the software might be installed on a production server in a production environment.  Other versions of the deployed software may be installed in a test environment, development environment and disaster recovery environment.
; Deactivate
: Deactivation is the inverse of activation, and refers to shutting down any executing components of a system. Deactivation is often required to perform other deployment activities, e.g., a software system may need to be deactivated before an update can be performed.  The practice of removing infrequently used or obsolete systems from service is often referred to as application retirement or application decommissioning.
; Adapt
: The adaptation activity is also a process to modify a software system that has been previously installed. It differs from updating in that adaptations are initiated by local events such as changing the environment of customer site, while updating is mostly started from remote software producer.
; Update
: The update process replaces an earlier version of all or part of a software system with a newer release. 
; Built-In
: Mechanisms for installing updates are built into some software systems. Automation of these update processes ranges from fully automatic to user initiated and controlled. Norton Internet Security is an example of a system with a semi-automatic method for retrieving and installing updates to both the antivirus definitions and other components of the system. Other software products provide query mechanisms for determining when updates are available.
; Version tracking
: Version tracking systems help the user find and install updates to software systems installed on PCs and local networks. 
:* Web based version tracking systems notify the user when updates are available for software systems installed on a local system. For example: VersionTracker Pro checks software versions on a user's computer and then queries its database to see if any updates are available.
:* Local version tracking system notifies the user when updates are available for software systems installed on a local system. For example: Software Catalog stores version and other information for each software package installed on a local system. One click of a button launches a browser window to the upgrade web page for the application, including auto-filling of the user name and password for sites that require a login.
:* Browser based version tracking systems notify the user when updates are available for software packages installed on a local system. For example: wfx-Versions is a Firefox extension which helps the user find the current version number of any program listed on the web.
; Uninstall
: Uninstallation is the inverse of installation. It is the removal of a system that is no longer required. It also involves some reconfiguration of other software systems in order to remove the uninstalled system’s files and dependencies.
; Retire
: Ultimately, a software system is marked as obsolete and support by the producers is withdrawn. It is the end of the life cycle of a software product.

== Deployment roles ==
The complexity and variability of software products has necessitated the creation of specialized roles for coordinating and engineering the deployment process.  For desktop systems, an end user is frequently also the &quot;software deployer&quot; when they install the software package on their machine. For enterprise software, there are many more roles involved.  Additionally, the roles involved typically change as the application progresses from test (pre-production) to production environments.  The typical roles involved in software deployments for enterprise applications are:

* Pre-production environments
** Application developers: see Software development process
** Build and release engineers: see Release engineering
** Release managers: see Release management
** Deployment coordinators: see DevOps
* Production environments
** System administrator
** Database administrator
** Release coordinators: see DevOps
** Operations project managers: see Information Technology Infrastructure Library

==Examples==
* FAI OpenSource Software Linux
* M23 OpenSource Software Linux
* Open PC Server Integration (opsi) OpenSource Software Windows
* RPM with YUM OpenSource Software Linux
* MS SCCM Microsoft Windows
* HP OpenView (Hewlett-Packard)
* Tivoli Provisioning Manager and IBM Tivoli Intelligent Orchestrator
* DX-Union (Materna)
* Novell ZENworks (Novell) Zero Effort Networks
* Garibaldi (Software) (INOSOFT AG)
* Client Management Suite (Baramundi Software AG, Augsburg)
* Blackberry MDS Suite Research In Motion (RIM)
* Intellisync Mobile Suite Nokia
* Mobile Device Manager 2008 Microsoft
* ubi-Suite ubitexx

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Software maintenance''' in software engineering is the modification of a software product after delivery to correct faults, to improve performance or other attributes.&lt;ref name=&quot;iso14764&quot;&gt;[http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=39064 ISO/IEC 14764:2006 Software Engineering — Software Life Cycle Processes — Maintenance]&lt;/ref&gt;

A common perception of maintenance is that it is merely fixing bugs. However, studies and surveys over the years have indicated that the majority, over 80%, of the maintenance effort is used for non-corrective actions (Pigosky 1997). This perception is perpetuated by users submitting problem reports that in reality are functionality enhancements to the system.

Software maintenance and evolution of systems was first addressed by Meir M. Lehman in 1969. Over a period of twenty years, his research led to the formulation of eight Laws of Evolution (Lehman 1997). Key findings of his research include that maintenance is really evolutionary developments and that maintenance decisions are aided by understanding what happens to systems (and software) over time. Lehman demonstrated that systems continue to evolve over time. As they evolve, they grow more complex unless some action such as code refactoring is taken to reduce the complexity.

The key software maintenance issues are both managerial and technical. Key management issues are: alignment with customer priorities, staffing, which organization does maintenance, estimating costs. Key technical issues are: limited understanding, impact analysis, testing, maintainability measurement.

== Software maintenance processes ==
This section describes the six software maintenance processes as:
# The implementation processes contains software preparation and transition activities, such as the conception and creation of the maintenance plan, the preparation for handling problems identified during development, and the follow-up on product configuration management.
# The problem and modification analysis process, which is executed once the application has become the responsibility of the maintenance group. The maintenance programmer must analyze each request, confirm it (by reproducing the situation) and check its validity, investigate it and propose a solution, document the request and the solution proposal, and, finally, obtain all the required authorizations to apply the modifications.
# The process considering the implementation of the modification itself.
# The process acceptance of the modification, by confirming the modified work with the individual who submitted the request in order to make sure the modification provided a solution.
# The migration process (platform migration, for example) is exceptional, and is not part of daily maintenance tasks. If the software must be ported to another platform without any change in functionality, this process will be used and a maintenance project team is likely to be assigned to this task.
# Finally, the last maintenance process, also an event which does not occur on a daily basis, is the retirement of a piece of software.

There are a number of processes, activities and practices that are unique to maintainers, for example:
* Transition: a controlled and coordinated sequence of activities during which a system is transferred progressively from the developer to the maintainer;
* Service Level Agreements (SLAs) and specialized (domain-specific) maintenance contracts negotiated by maintainers;
* Modification Request and Problem Report Help Desk: a problem-handling process used by maintainers to prioritize, documents and route the requests they receive;
* Modification Request acceptance/rejection: modification request work over a certain size/effort/complexity may be rejected by maintainers and rerouted to a developer.

== Categories of maintenance in ISO/IEC 14764==
[http://www.anderson.ucla.edu/x1960.xml E.B. Swanson] initially identified three categories of maintenance: corrective, adaptive, and perfective
&lt;ref&gt;[http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=359522 E. Burt Swanson, The dimensions of maintenance. Proceedings of the 2nd international conference on Software engineering, San Francisco, 1976, pp 492 — 497]&lt;/ref&gt;.
These have since been updated and ISO/IEC 14764 presents:

* Corrective maintenance: Reactive modification of a software product performed after delivery to correct discovered problems.
* Adaptive maintenance: Modification of a software product performed after delivery to keep a software product usable in a changed or changing environment.
* Perfective maintenance: Modification of a software product after delivery to improve performance or maintainability.
* Preventive maintenance: Modification of a software product after delivery to detect and correct latent faults in the software product before they become effective faults.

There is also a notion of pre-delivery/pre-release maintenance which is all the good things you do to lower the total cost of ownership of the software.  Things like compliance with coding standards that includes software maintainability goals. The management of coupling and cohesion of the software.  The attainment of software supportability goals (SAE JA1004, JA1005 and JA1006 for example).  Note also that some academic institutions are carrying out research to quantify the cost to ongoing software maintenance due to the lack of resources such as design documents and system/software comprehension training and resources (multiply costs by approx. 1.5-2.0 where there is no design data available.).

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Software evolution''' is the term used in software engineering (specifically software maintenance) to refer to the process of developing software initially, then repeatedly updating it for various reasons.

==General introduction==

Fred Brooks, in his key book ''The Mythical Man-Month'',&lt;ref&gt;Fred Brooks, ''The Mythical Man-Month''. Addison-Wesley, 1975 &amp; 1995. ISBN
0-201-00650-2 &amp; ISBN 0-201-83595-9.&lt;/ref&gt; states that over 90% of the costs of a typical system arise in the maintenance phase, and that any successful piece of software will inevitably be maintained.

In fact, Agile methods stem from maintenance like activities in and around web based technologies, where the bulk of the capability comes from frameworks and standards.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

Software maintenance address bug fixes and minor enhancements and software evolution focus on adaptation and migration.

==Types of software maintenance==

E.B. Swanson initially identified three categories of maintenance: corrective, adaptive, and perfective. Four categories of software were then catalogued by Lientz and Swanson (1980) &lt;ref&gt;Lientz, B.P. and Swanson, E.B., ''Software Maintenance Management, A Study Of The Maintenance Of Computer Application Software In 487 Data Processing Organizations''. Addison-Wesley, Reading MA, 1980. ISBN 0201042053&lt;/ref&gt;.
These have since been updated and normalized internationally in the ISO/IEC 14764:2006:&lt;ref&gt;ISO/IEC 14764:2006, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Corrective maintenance'': Reactive modification of a software product performed after delivery to correct discovered problems;
* ''Adaptive maintenance'': Modification of a software product performed after delivery to keep a software product usable in a changed or changing environment;
* ''Perfective maintenance'': Modification of a software product after delivery to improve performance or maintainability;
* ''Preventive maintenance'': Modification of a software product after delivery to detect and correct latent faults in the software product before they become effective faults.

All of the preceding take place when there is a known requirement for change.

Although these categories were supplemented by many authors like Warren et al. (1999){{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} and  Chapin (2001){{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}, the ISO/IEC 14764:2006 international standard has kept the basic four categories.

More recently the description of software maintenance and evolution has been done using ontologies (Kitchemham et al.

Prof. Meir M. Lehman, who worked at Imperial College London from 1972 to 2002, and his colleagues have identified a set of behaviours in the evolution of proprietary software. These behaviours (or observations) are known as ''Lehman's Laws'', and there are eight of them:

# Continuing Change
# Increasing Complexity
# Large Program Evolution
# Invariant Work-Rate
# Conservation of Familiarity
# Continuing Growth
# Declining Quality
# Feedback System

It is worth mentioning that the laws are believed to apply mainly to monolithic, proprietary software. For example, some empirical observations coming from the study of open source software development appear to challenge some of the laws {{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}.

The laws predict that change is inevitable and not a consequence of bad programming and that there are limits to what a software evolution team can achieve in terms of safely implementing changes and new functionality.

Maturity Models specific to software evolution have been developed to help improve processes to ensure continuous rejuvenation of the software evolves iteratively.

The &quot;global process&quot; that is made by the many stakeholders (e.g. developers, users, their managers) has many feedback loops. The evolution speed is a function of the feedback loop structure and other characteristics of the global system. Process simulation techniques, such as system dynamics can be useful in understanding and managing such global process.

Software evolution is not likely to be Darwinian, Lamarckian or Baldwinian, but an important phenomenon on its own. Giving the increasing dependence on software at all levels of society and economy, the successful evolution of software is becoming increasingly critical. This is an important topic of research that hasn't received much attention.

The evolution of software, because of its rapid path in comparison to other man-made entities, was seen by Lehman as the &quot;fruit fly&quot; of the study of the evolution of artificial systems.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Software project management''' is the art and science of planning and leading software projects&lt;ref name=&quot;Stellman05&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last=Stellman | first=Andrew | last2=Greene | first2=Jennifer | title=Applied Software Project Management | url=http://www.stellman-greene.com/aspm/ | publisher=O'Reilly Media | year=2005 | isbn=978-0-596-00948-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;. It is a sub-discipline of project management in which software projects are planned, monitored and controlled.

==History==
The history of software project management is closely related to the history of software. Software was developed for dedicated purposes for dedicated machines until the concept of object-oriented programming began to become popular in the 1960's, making ''repeatable solutions'' possible for the software industry. Dedicated systems could be adapted to other uses thanks to component-based software engineering. Companies quickly understood the relative ease of use that software programming had over hardware circuitry, and the software industry grew very quickly in the 1970's and 1980's. To manage new development efforts, companies applied proven project management methods, but project schedules slipped during test runs, especially when confusion occurred in the gray zone between the user specifications and the delivered software. To be able to avoid these problems, software project management methods focused on matching user requirements to delivered products, in a method known now as the waterfall model. Since then, analysis of software project management failures has shown that the following are the most common causes:&lt;ref&gt;[http://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/software/why-software-fails/5 IEEE] magazine article &quot;Why Software Fails&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;
# Unrealistic or unarticulated project goals
# Inaccurate estimates of needed resources
# Badly defined system requirements
# Poor reporting of the project's status
# Unmanaged risks
# Poor communication among customers, developers, and users
# Use of immature technology
# Inability to handle the project's complexity
# Sloppy development practices
# Poor project management
# Stakeholder politics
# Commercial pressures 

The first three items in the list above show the difficulties articulating the needs of the client in such a way that proper resources can deliver the proper project goals. Specific software project management tools are useful and often necessary, but the true art in software project management is applying the correct method and then using tools to support the method. Without a method, tools are worthless. Since the 1960's, several proprietary software project management methods have been developed by software manufacturers for their own use, while computer consulting firms have also developed similar methods for their clients. Today software project management methods are still evolving, but the current trend leads away from the waterfall model to a more cyclic project delivery model that imitates a Software release life cycle.

==Software development process==
A software development process is concerned primarily with the production aspect of software development, as opposed to the technical aspect, such as software tools. These processes exist primarily for supporting the management of software development, and are generally skewed toward addressing business concerns. Many software development processes can be run in a similar way to general project management processes. Examples are:

* Risk management is the process of measuring or assessing risk and then developing strategies to manage the risk. In general, the strategies employed include transferring the risk to another party, avoiding the risk, reducing the negative effect of the risk, and accepting some or all of the consequences of a particular risk. Risk management in software project management begins with the business case for starting the project, which includes a cost-benefit analysis as well as a list of fallback options for project failure, called a contingency plan.
** A subset of risk management that is gaining more and more attention is &quot;Opportunity Management&quot;, which means the same thing, except that the potential risk outcome will have a positive, rather than a negative impact. Though theoretically handled in the same way, using the term &quot;opportunity&quot; rather than the somewhat negative term &quot;risk&quot; helps to keep a team focussed on possible positive outcomes of any given risk register in their projects, such as spin-off projects, windfalls, and free extra resources.
* Requirements management is the process of identifying, eliciting, documenting, analyzing, tracing, prioritizing and agreeing on requirements and then controlling change and communicating to relevant stakeholders. New or altered computer system&lt;ref name=&quot;Stellman05&quot;/&gt; Requirements management, which includes Requirements analysis, is an important part of the software engineering process; whereby business analysts or software developers identify the needs or requirements of a client; having identified these requirements they are then in a position to design a solution.
* Change management is the process of identifying, documenting, analyzing, prioritizing and agreeing on changes to scope (project management) and then controlling changes and communicating to relevant stakeholders. Change impact analysis of new or altered scope, which includes Requirements analysis at the change level, is an important part of the software engineering process; whereby business analysts or software developers identify the altered needs or requirements of a client; having identified these requirements they are then in a position to re-design or modify a solution. Theoretically, each change can impact the timeline and budget of a software project, and therefore by definition must include risk-benefit analysis before approval.
* Software configuration management is the process of identifying, and documenting the scope itself, which is the software product underway, including all sub-products and changes and enabling communication of these to relevant stakeholders.  In general, the processes employed include version control, naming convention (programming), and software archival agreements.
* Release management is the process of identifying, documenting, prioritizing and agreeing on releases of software and then controlling the release schedule and communicating to relevant stakeholders. Most software projects have access to three software environments to which software can be released; Development, Test, and Production. In very large projects, where distributed teams need to integrate their work before release to users, there will often be more environments for testing, called unit testing, system testing, or integration testing, before release to User acceptance testing (UAT). 
** A subset of release management that is gaining more and more attention is Data Management, as obviously the users can only test based on data that they know, and &quot;real&quot; data is only in the software environment called &quot;production&quot;. In order to test their work, programmers must therefore also often create &quot;dummy data&quot; or &quot;data stubs&quot;. Traditionally, older versions of a production system were once used for this purpose, but as companies rely more and more on outside contributors for software development, company data may not be released to development teams. In complex environments, datasets may be created that are then migrated across test environments according to a test release schedule, much like the overall software release schedule.

==Project planning, monitoring and control==
The purpose of project planning is to identify the scope of the project, estimate the work involved, and create a project schedule. Project planning begins with requirements that define the software to be developed. The project plan is then developed to describe the tasks that will lead to completion.

The purpose of project monitoring and control is to keep the team and management up to date on the project's progress. If the project deviates from the plan, then the project manager can take action to correct the problem. Project monitoring and control involves status meetings to gather status from the team. When changes need to be made, change control is used to keep the products up to date.

==Issue==
In computing, the term '''issue''' is a unit of work to accomplish an improvement in a system.  An issue could be a bug, a requested feature, task, missing documentation, and so forth.  The word &quot;issue&quot; is popularly misused in lieu of &quot;problem.&quot;  This usage is probably related. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

For example, OpenOffice.org used to call their modified version of BugZilla IssueZilla.  As of September 2010, they call their system Issue Tracker.

Problems occur from time to time and fixing them in a timely fashion is essential to achieve correctness of a system and avoid delayed deliveries of products.

===Severity levels===

Issues are often categorized in terms of '''severity levels'''. Different companies have different definitions of severities, but some of the most common ones are:

* Critical
* High - The bug or issue affects a crucial part of a system, and must be fixed in order for it to resume normal operation.
* Medium - The bug or issue affects a minor part of a system, but has some impact on its operation. This severity level is assigned when a non-central requirement of a system is affected.
* Low - The bug or issue affects a minor part of a system, and has very little impact on its operation. This severity level is assigned when a non-central requirement of a system (and with lower importance) is affected.
* Cosmetic - The system works correctly, but the appearance does not match the expected one. For example: wrong colors, too much or too little spacing between contents, incorrect font sizes, typos, etc. This is the lowest priority issue.

In many software companies, issues are often investigated by Quality Assurance Analysts when they verify a system for correctness, and then assigned to the developer(s) that are responsible for resolving them. They can also be assigned by system users during the User Acceptance Testing (UAT) phase.

Issues are commonly communicated using Issue or Defect Tracking Systems. In some other cases, emails or instant messengers are used.

==Philosophy==
As a subdiscipline of project management, some regard the management of software development akin to the management of manufacturing, which can be performed by someone with management skills, but no programming skills. John C. Reynolds rebuts this view, and argues that software development is entirely design work, and compares a manager who cannot program to the managing editor of a newspaper who cannot write.&lt;ref&gt;John C. Reynolds, ''Some thoughts on teaching programming and programming languages'', SIGPLAN Notices, Volume 43, Issue 11, November 2008, p.108: &quot;Some argue that one can manage software production without the ability to program. This belief seems to arise from the mistaken view that software production is a form of manufacturing. But manufacturing is the repeated construction of identical objects, while software production is the construction of unique objects, i.e., the entire process is a form of design. As such it is closer to the production of a newspaper — so that a software manager who cannot program is akin to a managing editor who cannot write.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Software development efforts estimation''' is the process of predicting the most realistic use of effort required to develop or maintain software based on incomplete, uncertain and/or noisy input. Effort estimates may be used as input to project plans, iteration plans, budgets, investment analyses, pricing processes and bidding rounds.

== State-of-practice ==

Published surveys on estimation practice suggest that expert estimation is the dominant strategy when estimating software development effort&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web 
  | author = Jørgensen, M.
  | title = A Review of Studies on Expert Estimation of Software Development Effort
  | url = http://simula.no/research/engineering/publications/SE.4.Joergensen.2004.c
 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Typically, effort estimates are over-optimistic and there is a strong over-confidence in their accuracy. The mean effort overrun seems to be about 30% and not decreasing over time. For a review of effort estimation error surveys, see &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web 
  | author = Molokken, K.	Jorgensen, M.
  | title = A review of software surveys on software effort estimation
  | url = http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=1237981
   }}&lt;/ref&gt;. However, the measurement of estimation error is not unproblematic, see Assessing and interpreting the accuracy of effort estimates.
The strong over-confidence in the accuracy of the effort estimates is illustrated by the finding that, on average, if a software professional is 90% confident or “almost sure” to include the actual effort in a minimum-maximum interval, the observed frequency of including the actual effort is only 60-70% &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web 
  | author = Jørgensen, M.	Teigen, K.H.	Ribu, K.	
  | title =  Better sure than safe? Over-confidence in judgement based software development effort prediction intervals
  | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6V0N-49N06GS-5&amp;_user=674998&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000036598&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=674998&amp;md5=36c6383445cf481447d06cb30c1ccb63 }}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Currently the term “effort estimate” is used to denote as different concepts as most likely use of effort (modal value), the effort that corresponds to a probability of 50% of not exceeding (median), the planned effort, the budgeted effort or the effort used to propose a bid or price to the client. This is believed to be unfortunate, because communication problems may occur and because the concepts serve different goals

== History ==

Software researchers and practitioners have been addressing the problems of effort estimation for software development projects since at least the 1960s; see, e.g., work by Farr &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web 
  | author = Farr, L.	Nanus, B.
  | title = Factors that affect the cost of computer programming
  | url = http://stinet.dtic.mil/oai/oai?verb=getRecord&amp;metadataPrefix=html&amp;identifier=AD0603707
 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Nelson &lt;ref&gt;Nelson, E. A. (1966). Management Handbook for the Estimation of Computer Programming Costs. AD-A648750, Systems Development Corp.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Most of the research has focused on the construction of formal software effort estimation models. The early models were typically based on regression analysis or mathematically derived from theories from other domains. Since then a high number of model building approaches have been evaluated, such as approaches founded on case-based reasoning, classification and regression trees, simulation, neural networks, Bayesian statistics, lexical analysis of requirement specifications, genetic programming, linear programming, economic production models, soft computing, fuzzy logic modeling, statistical bootstrapping, and combinations of two or more of these models. The perhaps most common estimation products today, e.g., the formal estimation models COCOMO and SLIM have their basis in estimation research conducted in the 1970s and 1980s. The estimation approaches based on functionality-based size measures, e.g., function points, is also based on research conducted in the 1970s and 1980s, but are re-appearing with modified size measures under different labels, such as “use case points” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web 
  | author = Anda, B.	Angelvik, E.	Ribu, K.	
  | title =  Improving Estimation Practices by Applying Use Case Models
  | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/7lpyel912m5cr654/
  }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the 1990s and [http://www.cosmicon.com COSMIC] in the 2000s.

== Estimation approaches ==

There are many ways of categorizing estimation approaches, see for example &lt;ref&gt;Briand, L. C. and I. Wieczorek (2002). Resource estimation in software engineering. Encyclopedia of software engineering. J. J. Marcinak. New York, John Wiley &amp; Sons: 1160-1196.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web 
  | author = Jørgensen, M.	Shepperd, M.			
  | title =  A Systematic Review of Software Development Cost Estimation Studies
  | url = http://simula.no/research/engineering/publications/Jorgensen.2007.1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;. The top level categories are the following:

* Expert estimation: The quantification step, i.e., the step where the estimate is produced based on judgmental processes.
* Formal estimation model: The quantification step is based on mechanical processes, e.g., the use of a formula derived from historical data.
* Combination-based estimation: The quantification step is based on a judgmental or mechanical combination of estimates from different sources.

== Selection of estimation approach ==

The evidence on differences in estimation accuracy of different estimation approaches and models suggest that there is no “best approach” and that the relative accuracy of one approach or model in comparison to another depends strongly on the context 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web 
  | author = Shepperd, M.	Kadoda, G.			
  | title =   Comparing software prediction techniques using simulation
  | url = http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/login.jsp?url=/iel5/32/20846/00965341.pdf?arnumber=965341 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;. This implies that different organizations benefit from different estimation approaches. Findings, summarized in &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web 
  | author = Jørgensen, M.			
  | title =   Estimation of Software Development Work Effort:Evidence on Expert Judgment and Formal Models
  | url = http://simula.no/research/engineering/publications/Jorgensen.2007.2 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;, that may support the selection of estimation approach based on the expected accuracy of an approach include:

* Expert estimation is on average at least as accurate as model-based effort estimation. In particular, situations with unstable relationships and information of high importance not included in the model may suggest use of expert estimation. This assumes, of course, that experts with relevant experience are available. 
* Formal estimation models not tailored to a particular organization’s own context, may be very inaccurate. Use of own historical data is consequently crucial if one cannot be sure that the estimation model’s core relationships (e.g., formula parameters) are based on similar project contexts.
* Formal estimation models may be particularly useful in situations where the model is tailored to the organization’s context (either through use of own historical data or that the model is derived from similar projects and contexts), and/or it is likely that the experts’ estimates will be subject to a strong degree of wishful thinking.

The most robust finding, in many forecasting domains, is that combination of estimates from independent sources, preferable applying different approaches, will on average improve the estimation accuracy &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;.

In addition, other factors such as ease of understanding and communicating the results of an approach, ease of use of an approach, cost of introduction of an approach should be considered in a selection process.

== Uncertainty assessment approaches ==

The uncertainty of an effort estimate can be described through a prediction interval (PI). An effort PI is based on a stated certainty level and contains a minimum and a maximum effort value. For example, a project leader may estimate that the most likely effort of a project is 1000 work-hours and that it is 90% certain that the actual effort will be between 500 and 2000 work-hours. Then, the interval [500, 2000] work-hours is the 90% PI of the effort estimate of 1000 work-hours. Frequently, other terms are used instead of PI, e.g., prediction bounds, prediction limits, interval prediction, prediction region and, unfortunately, confidence interval. An important difference between confidence interval and PI is that PI refers to the uncertainty of an estimate, while confidence interval usually refers to the uncertainty associated with the parameters of an estimation model or distribution, e.g., the uncertainty of the mean value of a distribution of effort values. The confidence level of a PI refers to the expected (or subjective) probability that the real value is within the predicted interval&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web 
  | author = Armstrong, J. S.			
  | title =  Principles of forecasting: A handbook for researchers and practitioners
  | url = http://www.forecastingprinciples.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

There are several possible approaches to calculate effort PIs, e.g., formal approaches based on regression or bootstrapping &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web 
  | author = Angelis, L.	Stamelos, I.			
  | title =  A simulation tool for efficient analogy based cost estimation
  | url = http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=594467&amp;dl=ACM&amp;coll=portal }}&lt;/ref&gt;, formal or judgmental approaches based on the distribution of previous estimation error

Expert judgments based on the distribution of previous estimation error has been found to systematically lead to more realistic uncertainty assessment than the traditional minimum-maximum effort intervals in several studies, see for example &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web 
  | author = Jørgensen, M.	
  | title =  Realism in assessment of effort estimation uncertainty: It matters how you ask
  | url = http://simula.no/research/engineering/publications/SE.4.Joergensen.2004.e }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Assessing and interpreting the accuracy of effort estimates ==

The most common measures of the average estimation accuracy is the MMRE (Mean Magnitude of Relative Error), where MRE is defined as: 

''MRE'' = |actual effort − estimated effort| / |actual effort|

This measure has been criticized &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

A high estimation error cannot automatically be interpreted as an indicator of low estimation ability. Alternative, competing or complementing, reasons include low cost control of project, high complexity of development work, and more delivered functionality than originally estimated. A framework for improved use and interpretation of estimation error measurement is included in &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Psychological issues related to effort estimation ==

There are many psychological factors potentially explaining the strong tendency towards over-optimistic effort estimates that need to be dealt with to increase accuracy of effort estimates. These factors are essential even when using formal estimation models, because much of the input to these models is judgment-based. Factors that have been demonstrated to be important are: Wishful thinking, anchoring, planning fallacy and cognitive dissonance. A discussion on these and other factors can be found in work by Jørgensen and Grimstad &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve">The ability to accurately estimate the time and/or cost taken for a project to come in to its successful conclusion is a serious problem for software engineers. The use of a repeatable, clearly defined and well understood software development process has, in recent years, shown itself to be the most effective method of gaining useful historical data that can be used for statistical estimation. In particular, the act of sampling more frequently, coupled with the loosening of constraints between parts of a project, has allowed more accurate estimation and more rapid development times.

'''Computer-aided software engineering''' ('''CASE''') is the scientific application of a set of tools and methods to a software system which is meant to result in high-quality, defect-free, and maintainable software products.&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, D.L (1989). &quot;Selecting and effectively using a computer aided software engineering tool&quot;. Annual Westinghouse computer symposium; 6–7 Nov 1989; Pittsburgh, PA (U.S.); DOE Project.&lt;/ref&gt; It also refers to methods for the development of information systems together with automated tools that can be used in the software development process.&lt;ref&gt;P. Loucopoulos and V. Karakostas (1995). ''System Requirements Engineering''. McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
The term &quot;computer-aided software engineering&quot; (CASE) can refer to the software used for the automated development of systems software, i.e., computer code. The CASE functions include analysis, design, and programming. CASE tools automate methods for designing, documenting, and producing structured computer code in the desired programming language.

CASE software supports the software process activities such as requirement engineering, design, program development and testing. Therefore, CASE tools include design editors, data dictionaries, compilers, debuggers, system building tools, etc.

CASE also refers to the methods dedicated to an engineering discipline for the development of information system using automated tools.

CASE is mainly used for the development of quality software which will perform effectively.

== History ==
The ISDOS project at the University of Michigan initiated a great deal of interest in the whole concept of using computer systems to help analysts in the very difficult process of analysing requirements and developing systems. Several papers by Daniel Teichroew fired a whole generation of enthusiasts with the potential of automated systems development. His PSL/PSA tool was a CASE tool although it predated the term. His insights into the power of meta-meta-models was inspiring, particularly to a former student, Dr. Hasan Sayani, currently Professor, Program Director at University of Maryland University College.

Another major thread emerged as a logical extension to the DBMS directory. By extending the range of meta-data held, the attributes of an application could be held within a dictionary and used at runtime. This &quot;active dictionary&quot; became the precursor to the more modern &quot;model driven execution&quot; (MDE) capability. However, the active dictionary did not provide a graphical representation of any of the meta-data. It was the linking of the concept of a dictionary holding analysts' meta-data, as derived from the use of an integrated set of techniques, together with the graphical representation of such data that gave rise to the earlier versions of I-CASE.

The term CASE was originally coined by software company Nastec Corporation of Southfield, Michigan in 1982 with their original integrated graphics and text editor GraphiText, which also was the first microcomputer-based system to use hyperlinks to cross-reference text strings in documents&amp;mdash;an early forerunner of today's web page link.  GraphiText's successor product, DesignAid, was the first microprocessor-based tool to logically and semantically evaluate software and system design diagrams and build a data dictionary.

Under the direction of Albert F. Case, Jr. vice president for product management and consulting, and Vaughn Frick, director of product management, the DesignAid product suite was expanded to support analysis of a wide range of structured analysis and design methodologies, notably Ed Yourdon and Tom DeMarco, Chris Gane &amp; Trish Sarson, Ward-Mellor (real-time) SA/SD and Warnier-Orr (data driven).

The next entrant into the market was Excelerator from Index Technology in Cambridge, Mass.  While DesignAid ran on Convergent Technologies and later Burroughs Ngen networked microcomputers, Index launched Excelerator on the IBM PC/AT platform. While, at the time of launch, and for several years, the IBM platform did not support networking or a centralized database as did the Convergent Technologies or Burroughs machines, the allure of IBM was strong, and Excelerator came to prominence. Hot on the heels of Excelerator were a rash of offerings from companies such as Knowledgeware (James Martin, Fran Tarkenton and Don Addington), Texas Instrument's IEF and Accenture's FOUNDATION toolset (METHOD/1, DESIGN/1, INSTALL/1, FCP).

CASE tools were at their peak in the early 1990s.  At the time IBM had proposed AD/Cycle, which was an alliance of software vendors centered around IBM's Software repository using IBM DB2 in mainframe and OS/2:

:''The application development tools can be from several sources: from IBM, from vendors, and from the customers themselves. IBM has entered into relationships with Bachman Information Systems, Index Technology Corporation, and Knowledgeware, Inc. wherein selected products from these vendors will be marketed through an IBM complementary marketing program to provide offerings that will help to achieve complete life-cycle coverage''.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADC_SAaA&quot;&gt;&quot;AD/Cycle strategy and architecture&quot;, IBM Systems Journal, Vol 29, NO 2, 1990; p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the decline of the mainframe, AD/Cycle and the Big CASE tools died off, opening the market for the mainstream CASE tools of today. Nearly all of the leaders of the CASE market of the early 1990s ended up being purchased by Computer Associates, including IEW, IEF, ADW, Cayenne, and Learmonth &amp; Burchett Management Systems (LBMS).

== Supporting software ==

&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Tasks'' support only specific tasks in the software process.
# ''Workbenches'' support only one or a few activities.
# ''Environments'' support (a large part of) the software process.
Workbenches and environments are generally built as collections of tools. Tools can therefore be either stand alone products or components of workbenches and environments.

=== Tools ===
CASE tools are a class of software that automate many of the activities involved in various life cycle phases. For example, when establishing the functional requirements of a proposed application, prototyping tools can be used to develop graphic models of application screens to assist end users to visualize how an application will look after development. Subsequently, system designers can use automated design tools to transform the prototyped functional requirements into detailed design documents. Programmers can then use automated code generators to convert the design documents into code. Automated tools can be used collectively, as mentioned, or individually. For example, prototyping tools could be used to define application requirements that get passed to design technicians who convert the requirements into detailed designs in a traditional manner using flowcharts and narrative documents, without the assistance of automated design software.&lt;ref name=&quot;FFIEC08&quot;&gt; [http://www.ffiec.gov/ffiecinfobase/booklets/d_a/10.html Software Development Techniques]. In: ''FFIEC InfoBase''. Retrieved 26 Oct 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Existing CASE tools can be classified along 4 different dimensions:
# Life-cycle support
# Integration dimension
# Construction dimension
# Knowledge-based CASE dimension&lt;ref&gt;Software Engineering: Tools, Principles and Techniques by Sangeeta Sabharwal, Umesh Publications&lt;/ref&gt;

Let us take the meaning of these dimensions along with their examples one by one:

; Life-Cycle Based CASE Tools
This dimension classifies CASE Tools on the basis of the activities they support in the information systems life cycle. They can be classified as Upper or Lower CASE tools.

* Upper CASE Tools support strategic planning and construction of concept-level products and ignore the design aspect. They support traditional diagrammatic languages such as ER diagrams, Data flow diagram, Structure charts, Decision Trees, Decision tables, etc.
* Lower CASE Tools concentrate on the back end activities of the software life cycle, such as physical design, debugging, construction, testing, component integration, maintenance, reengineering and reverse engineering.

; Integration dimension
Three main CASE Integration dimensions have been proposed:&lt;ref&gt;Evans R. Rock. ''Case Analyst Workbenches: A Detailed Product Evaluation''. Volume 1, pp. 229–242 by&lt;/ref&gt;
# CASE Framework
# ICASE Tools
# Integrated Project Support Environment(IPSE)

=== Workbenches ===
Workbenches integrate several CASE tools into one application to support specific software-process activities. Hence they achieve:
*a homogeneous and consistent interface (presentation integration).
*easy invocation of tools and tool chains (control integration).
*access to a common data set managed in a centralized way (data integration).

CASE workbenches can be further classified into following 8 classes:&lt;ref name=&quot;AF_93&quot; /&gt;
#Business planning and modeling
#Analysis and design
#User-interface development
#Programming
#Verification and validation
#Maintenance and reverse engineering
#Configuration management
#Project management

=== Environments ===
An environment is a collection of CASE tools and workbenches that supports the software process. CASE environments are classified based on the focus/basis of integration&lt;ref name=&quot;AF_93&quot; /&gt;
#Toolkits
#Language-centered
#Integrated
#Fourth generation
#Process-centered

;Toolkits
Toolkits are loosely integrated collections of products easily extended by aggregating different tools and workbenches. Typically, the support provided by a toolkit is limited to programming, configuration management and project management. And the toolkit itself is environments extended from basic sets of operating system tools, for example, the Unix Programmer's Work Bench and the VMS VAX Set. In addition, toolkits' loose integration requires user to activate tools by explicit invocation or simple control mechanisms. The resulting files are unstructured and could be in different format, therefore the access of file from different tools may require explicit file format conversion. However, since the only constraint for adding a new component is the formats of the files, toolkits can be easily and incrementally extended.&lt;ref name=&quot;AF_93&quot; /&gt;

;Language-centered
The environment itself is written in the programming language for which it was developed, thus enabling users to reuse, customize and extend the environment. Integration of code in different languages is a major issue for language-centered environments. Lack of process and data integration is also a problem. The strengths of these environments include good level of presentation and control integration. Interlisp, Smalltalk, Rational, and KEE are examples of language-centered environments.&lt;ref name=&quot;AF_93&quot; /&gt;

;Integrated
These environments achieve presentation integration by providing uniform, consistent, and coherent tool  and workbench interfaces. Data integration is achieved through the ''repository'' concept: they have a specialized database managing all information produced and accessed in the environment. Examples of integrated environment are IBM AD/Cycle and DEC Cohesion.&lt;ref name=&quot;AF_93&quot; /&gt;

;Fourth-generation
Fourth-generation environments were the first integrated environments. They are sets of tools and workbenches supporting the development of a specific class of program: electronic data processing and business-oriented applications. In general, they include programming tools, simple configuration management tools, document handling facilities and, sometimes, a code generator to produce code in lower level languages. Informix 4GL, and Focus fall into this category.&lt;ref name=&quot;AF_93&quot; /&gt;

;Process-centered
Environments in this category focus on process integration with other integration dimensions as starting points. A process-centered environment operates by interpreting a process model created by specialized tools. They usually consist of tools handling two functions:
*Process-model execution
*Process-model production
Examples are East, Enterprise II, Process Wise, Process Weaver, and Arcadia.&lt;ref name=&quot;AF_93&quot; /&gt;

== Applications ==
All  aspects of the software development life cycle can be supported by software tools, and so the use of tools from across the spectrum can, arguably, be described as CASE; from project management software through tools for business and functional analysis, system design, code storage, compilers, translation tools, test software, and so on.

However, tools that are concerned with analysis and design, and with using design information to create parts (or all) of the software product, are most frequently thought of as CASE tools. CASE applied, for instance, to a database software product, might normally involve:
* Modeling business / real-world processes and data flow
* Development of data models in the form of entity-relationship diagrams
* Development of process and function descriptions

== Risks and associated controls ==
Common CASE risks and associated controls include:

* ''Inadequate standardization'': Linking CASE tools from different vendors (design tool from Company X, programming tool from Company Y) may be difficult if the products do not use standardized code structures and data classifications. File formats can be converted, but usually not economically. Controls include using tools from the same vendor, or using tools based on standard protocols and insisting on demonstrated compatibility. Additionally, if organizations obtain tools for only a portion of the development process, they should consider acquiring them from a vendor that has a full line of products to ensure future compatibility if they add more tools.&lt;ref name=&quot;FFIEC08&quot;/&gt;
* ''Unrealistic expectations'': Organizations often implement CASE technologies to reduce development costs. Implementing CASE strategies usually involves high start-up costs. Generally, management must be willing to accept a long-term payback period. Controls include requiring senior managers to define their purpose and strategies for implementing CASE technologies.&lt;ref name=&quot;FFIEC08&quot;/&gt;
* ''Slow implementation'': Implementing CASE technologies can involve a significant change from traditional development environments. Typically, organizations should not use CASE tools the first time on critical projects or projects with short deadlines because of the lengthy training process. Additionally, organizations should consider using the tools on smaller, less complex projects and gradually implementing the tools to allow more training time.&lt;ref name=&quot;FFIEC08&quot;/&gt;
* ''Weak repository controls'': Failure to adequately control access to CASE repositories may result in security breaches or damage to the work documents, system designs, or code modules stored in the repository. Controls include protecting the repositories with appropriate access, version, and backup controls.&lt;ref name=&quot;FFIEC08&quot;/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Compiler.svg|right|thumb|350px|A diagram of the operation of a typical multi-language, multi-target compiler.]]

A '''compiler''' is a  computer program (or set of programs) that transforms source code written in a programming language (the ''source language'') into another computer language (the ''target language'', often having a binary form known as ''object code'').  The most common reason for wanting to transform source code is to create an executable program.

The name &quot;compiler&quot; is primarily used for programs that translate source code from a high-level programming language to a lower level language (e.g., assembly language or machine code). If the compiled program can run on a computer whose CPU or operating system is different from the one on which the compiler runs, the compiler is known as a cross-compiler. A program that translates from a low level language to a higher level one is a ''decompiler''.  A program that translates between high-level languages is usually called a ''language translator'', ''source to source translator'', or ''language converter''. A ''language rewriter'' is usually a program that translates the form of expressions without a change of language.

A compiler is likely to perform many or all of the following operations: lexical analysis, preprocessing, parsing, semantic analysis (Syntax-directed translation), code generation, and code optimization.

Program faults caused by incorrect compiler behavior can be very difficult to track down and work around; therefore, compiler implementors invest a lot of time ensuring the correctness of their software.

The term compiler-compiler is sometimes used to refer to a parser generator, a tool often used to help create the lexer and parser.

==History==
Software for early computers was primarily written in assembly language for many years. Higher level programming languages were not invented until the benefits of being able to reuse software on different kinds of CPUs started to become significantly greater than the cost of writing a compiler.  The very limited memory capacity of early computers also created many technical problems when implementing a compiler.

Towards the end of the 1950s, machine-independent programming languages were first proposed. Subsequently, several experimental compilers were developed. The first compiler was written by Grace Hopper, in 1952, for the A-0 programming language. The FORTRAN&lt;!-- ###here (only), upper-case FORTRAN is correct, as it was the name used at the time, and on IBM's early compilers ###--&gt; team led by John Backus at IBM is generally credited as having introduced the first complete compiler in 1957. COBOL was an early language to be compiled on multiple architectures, in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.interesting-people.org/archives/interesting-people/199706/msg00011.html |title=IP: The World's First COBOL Compilers |date=12 June 1997 |publisher=interesting-people.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many application domains the idea of using a higher level language quickly caught on.  Because of the expanding functionality supported by newer programming languages and the increasing complexity of computer architectures, compilers have become more and more complex.

Early compilers were written in assembly language. The first ''self-hosting'' compiler &amp;mdash; capable of compiling its own source code in a high-level language &amp;mdash; was created for Lisp by Tim Hart and Mike Levin at MIT in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=ftp://publications.ai.mit.edu/ai-publications/pdf/AIM-039.pdf |author=T. Hart and M. Levin |title=The New Compiler, AIM-39 - CSAIL Digital Archive - Artificial Intelligence Laboratory Series |publisher=publications.ai.mit.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1970s it has become common practice to implement a compiler in the language it compiles, although both Pascal and C have been popular choices for implementation language. Building a self-hosting compiler is a bootstrapping problem—the first such compiler for a language must be compiled either by a compiler written in a different language, or (as in Hart and Levin's Lisp compiler) compiled by running the compiler in an interpreter.

=== Compilers in education ===
Compiler construction and compiler optimization are taught at universities and schools as part of the computer science curriculum. Such courses are usually supplemented with the implementation of a compiler for an educational programming language. A well-documented example is Niklaus Wirth's PL/0 compiler, which Wirth used to teach compiler construction in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.246.dk/pl0.html |title=The PL/0 compiler/interpreter}}&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of its simplicity, the PL/0 compiler introduced several influential concepts to the field:

# Program development by stepwise refinement (also the title of a 1971 paper by Wirth)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.acm.org/classics/dec95/ |title=The ACM Digital Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The use of a recursive descent parser
# The use of EBNF to specify the syntax of a language
# A code generator producing portable P-code
# The use of T-diagrams&lt;ref&gt;T diagrams were first introduced for describing bootstrapping and cross-compiling compilers in McKeeman et al. ''A Compiler Generator'' (1971). Conway described the broader concept before that with his UNCOL in 1958, to which Bratman added in 1961: H. Bratman, “An alternate form of the ´UNCOL diagram´“, Comm. ACM 4 (March 1961) 3, p. 142. Later on, others, including P.D. Terry, gave an explanation and usage of T-diagrams in their textbooks on the topic of compiler construction. Cf. Terry, 1997, [http://scifac.ru.ac.za/compilers/cha03g.htm Chapter 3]. T-diagrams are also now used to describe client-server interconnectivity on the World Wide Web: cf. Patrick Closhen, et al. 1997: [http://pu.rbg.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/docs/HJH-19990217-etal-T-diagrams.doc ''T-Diagrams as Visual Language to Illustrate WWW Technology''], Darmstadt University of Technology, Darmstadt, Germany&lt;/ref&gt; in the formal description of the bootstrapping problem

== Compilation ==

Compilers enabled the development of programs that are machine-independent. Before the development of FORTRAN (FORmula TRANslator), the first higher-level language, in the 1950s, machine-dependent assembly language was widely used. While assembly language produces more reusable and relocatable programs than machine code on the same architecture, it has to be modified or rewritten if the program is to be executed on different hardware architecture.

With the advance of high-level programming languages soon followed after FORTRAN, such as COBOL, C, BASIC, programmers can write machine-independent source programs. A compiler translates the high-level source programs into target programs in machine languages for the specific hardwares. Once the target program is generated, the user can execute the program.

=== The structure of a compiler ===
Compilers bridge source programs in high-level languages with the underlying hardware. A compiler requires 1) determining the correctness of the syntax of programs, 2) generating correct and efficient object code, 3) run-time organization, and 4) formatting output according to assembler and/or linker conventions. A compiler consists of three main parts: the frontend, the middle-end, and the backend.

The '''frontend''' checks whether the program is correctly written in terms of the programming language syntax and semantics. Here legal and illegal programs are recognized. Errors are reported, if any, in a useful way. Type checking is also performed by collecting type information. The frontend then generates an ''intermediate representation'' or ''IR'' of the source code for processing by the middle-end.

The '''middle-end''' is where optimization takes place. Typical transformations for optimization are removal of useless or unreachable code, discovery and propagation of constant values, relocation of computation to a less frequently executed place (e.g., out of a loop), or specialization of computation based on the context. The middle-end generates another IR for the following backend. Most optimization efforts are focused on this part.

The '''backend''' is responsible for translating the IR from the middle-end into assembly code. The target instruction(s) are chosen for each IR instruction. Variables are also selected for the registers. Backend utilizes the hardware by figuring out how to keep parallel FUs busy, filling delay slots, and so on. Although most algorithms for optimization are in NP, heuristic techniques are well-developed.

One classification of compilers is by the platform on which their generated code executes. This is known as the ''target platform.''
  
A ''native'' or ''hosted'' compiler is one which output is intended to directly run on the same type of computer and operating system that the compiler itself runs on. The output of a cross compiler is designed to run on a different platform.  Cross compilers are often used when developing software for embedded systems that are not intended to support a software development environment.

The output of a compiler that produces code for a virtual machine (VM) may or may not be executed on the same platform as the compiler that produced it.  For this reason such compilers are not usually classified as native or cross compilers.

=== Compiled versus interpreted languages ===
Higher-level programming languages are generally divided for convenience into compiled languages and interpreted languages. However, in practice there is rarely anything about a language that ''requires'' it to be exclusively compiled or exclusively interpreted, although it is possible to design languages that rely on re-interpretation at run time. The categorization usually reflects the most popular or widespread implementations of a language &amp;mdash; for instance, BASIC is sometimes called an interpreted language, and C a compiled one, despite the existence of BASIC compilers and C interpreters.

Modern trends toward just-in-time compilation and bytecode interpretation at times blur the traditional categorizations of compilers and interpreters.

Some language specifications spell out that implementations ''must'' include a compilation facility; for example, Common Lisp. However, there is nothing inherent in the definition of Common Lisp that stops it from being interpreted. Other languages have features that are very easy to implement in an interpreter, but make writing a compiler much harder; for example, APL, SNOBOL4, and many scripting languages allow programs to construct arbitrary source code at runtime with regular string operations, and then execute that code by passing it to a special evaluation function. To implement these features in a compiled language, programs must usually be shipped with a runtime library that includes a version of the compiler itself.

=== Hardware compilation ===
The output of some compilers may target hardware at a very low level, for example a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) or structured Application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC).  Such compilers are said to be ''hardware compilers'' or synthesis tools because the source code they compile effectively control the final configuration of the hardware and how it operates; the output of the compilation are not instructions that are executed in sequence - only an interconnection of transistors or lookup tables.
For example, XST is the Xilinx Synthesis Tool used for configuring FPGAs. Similar tools are available from Altera, Synplicity, Synopsys and other vendors.

== Compiler construction ==
In the early days, the approach taken to compiler design used to be directly affected by the complexity of the processing, the experience of the person(s) designing it, and the resources available.

A compiler for a relatively simple language written by one person might be a single, monolithic piece of software.  When the source language is large and complex, and high quality output is required, the design may be split into a number of relatively independent phases.  Having separate phases means development can be parceled up into small parts and given to different people.  It also becomes much easier to replace a single phase by an improved one, or to insert new phases later (e.g., additional optimizations).

The division of the compilation processes into phases was championed by the Production Quality Compiler-Compiler Project (PQCC) at Carnegie Mellon University.  This project introduced the terms ''front end'', ''middle end'', and ''back end''.

All but the smallest of compilers have more than two phases.  However, these phases are usually regarded as being part of the front end or the back end.  The point at which these two ''ends'' meet is open to debate.  The front end is generally considered to be where syntactic and semantic processing takes place, along with translation to a lower level of representation (than source code).

The middle end is usually designed to perform optimizations on a form other than the source code or machine code.  This source code/machine code independence is intended to enable generic optimizations to be shared between versions of the compiler supporting different languages and target processors.

The back end takes the output from the middle.  It may perform more analysis, transformations and optimizations that are for a particular computer.  Then, it generates code for a particular processor and OS.

This front-end/middle/back-end approach makes it possible to combine front ends for different languages with back ends for different CPUs.  Practical examples of this approach are the GNU Compiler Collection, LLVM, and the Amsterdam Compiler Kit, which have multiple front-ends, shared analysis and multiple back-ends.

===One-pass versus multi-pass compilers===
Classifying compilers by number of passes has its background in the hardware resource limitations of computers.  Compiling involves performing lots of work and early computers did not have enough memory to contain one program that did all of this work.  So compilers were split up into smaller programs which each made a pass over the source (or some representation of it) performing some of the required analysis and translations.

The ability to compile in a single pass has classically been seen as a benefit because it simplifies the job of writing a compiler and one pass compilers generally compile faster than multi-pass compilers.  Thus, partly driven by the resource limitations of early systems, many early languages were specifically designed so that they could be compiled in a single pass (e.g., Pascal).

In some cases the design of a language feature may require a compiler to perform more than one pass over the source.  For instance, consider a declaration appearing on line 20 of the source which affects the translation of a statement appearing on line 10.  In this case, the first pass needs to gather information about declarations appearing after statements that they affect, with the actual translation happening during a subsequent pass.

The disadvantage of compiling in a single pass is that it is not possible to perform many of the sophisticated optimizations needed to generate high quality code.  It can be difficult to count exactly how many passes an optimizing compiler makes.  For instance, different phases of optimization may analyse one expression many times but only analyse another expression once.

Splitting a compiler up into small programs is a technique used by researchers interested in producing provably correct compilers.  Proving the correctness of a set of small programs often requires less effort than proving the correctness of a larger, single, equivalent program.

While the typical multi-pass compiler outputs machine code from its final pass, there are several other types:

*A &quot;source-to-source compiler&quot; is a type of compiler that takes a high level language as its input and outputs a high level language.  For example, an automatic parallelizing compiler will frequently take in a high level language program as an input and then  transform the code and annotate it with parallel code annotations (e.g. OpenMP) or language constructs (e.g. Fortran's &lt;code&gt;DOALL&lt;/code&gt; statements).
*Stage compiler that compiles to assembly language of a theoretical machine, like some Prolog implementations
**This Prolog machine is also known as the Warren Abstract Machine (or WAM).
**Bytecode compilers for Java, Python, and many more are also a subtype of this.
*Just-in-time compiler, used by Smalltalk and Java systems, and also by Microsoft .NET's Common Intermediate Language (CIL)
**Applications are delivered in bytecode, which is compiled to native machine code just prior to execution.

=== Front end ===
The front end analyzes the source code to build an internal representation of the program, called the intermediate representation or ''IR''.  It also manages the symbol table, a data structure mapping each symbol in the source code to associated information such as location, type and scope.  This is done over several phases, which includes some of the following:

# '''Line reconstruction'''.  Languages which strop their keywords or allow arbitrary spaces within identifiers require a phase before parsing, which converts the input character sequence to a canonical form ready for the parser.  The top-down, recursive-descent, table-driven parsers used in the 1960s typically read the source one character at a time and did not require a separate tokenizing phase.  Atlas Autocode, and Imp (and some implementations of ALGOL and Coral 66) are examples of stropped languages which compilers would have a ''Line Reconstruction'' phase.
# Lexical analysis breaks the source code text into small pieces called ''tokens''.  Each token is a single atomic unit of the language, for instance a keyword, identifier or symbol name.  The token syntax is typically a regular language, so a finite state automaton constructed from a regular expression can be used to recognize it.  This phase is also called lexing or scanning, and the software doing lexical analysis is called a lexical analyzer or scanner.
# Preprocessing.  Some languages, e.g., C, require a preprocessing phase which supports macro substitution and conditional compilation. Typically the preprocessing phase occurs before syntactic or semantic analysis; e.g. in the case of C, the preprocessor manipulates lexical tokens rather than syntactic forms. However, some languages such as Scheme support macro substitutions based on syntactic forms.
# Syntax analysis involves parsing the token sequence to identify the syntactic structure of the program. This phase typically builds a parse tree, which replaces the linear sequence of tokens with a tree structure built according to the rules of a formal grammar which define the language's syntax. The parse tree is often analyzed, augmented, and transformed by later phases in the compiler.
# Semantic analysis is the phase in which the compiler adds semantic information to the parse tree and builds the symbol table. This phase performs semantic checks such as type checking (checking for type errors), or object binding (associating variable and function references with their definitions), or definite assignment (requiring all local variables to be initialized before use), rejecting incorrect programs or issuing warnings. Semantic analysis usually requires a complete parse tree, meaning that this phase logically follows the parsing phase, and logically precedes the code generation phase, though it is often possible to fold multiple phases into one pass over the code in a compiler implementation.

===Back end===
The term ''back end'' is sometimes confused with ''code generator'' because of the overlapped functionality of generating assembly code. Some literature uses ''middle end'' to distinguish the generic analysis and optimization phases in the back end from the machine-dependent code generators. 

The main phases of the back end include the following:

# Analysis: This is the gathering of program information from the intermediate representation derived from the input. Typical analyses are data flow analysis to build use-define chains, dependence analysis, alias analysis, pointer analysis, escape analysis etc. Accurate analysis is the basis for any compiler optimization. The call graph and control flow graph are usually also built during the analysis phase.
# Optimization: the intermediate language representation is transformed into functionally equivalent but faster (or smaller) forms. Popular optimizations are inline expansion, dead code elimination, constant propagation, loop transformation, register allocation and even automatic parallelization.
# Code generation: the transformed intermediate language is translated into the output language, usually the native machine language of the system. This involves resource and storage decisions, such as deciding which variables to fit into registers and memory and the selection and scheduling of appropriate machine instructions along with their associated addressing modes (see also Sethi-Ullman algorithm).

Compiler analysis is the prerequisite for any compiler optimization, and they tightly work together. For example, dependence analysis is crucial for loop transformation. 

In addition, the scope of compiler analysis and optimizations vary greatly, from as small as a basic block to the procedure/function level, or even over the whole program (interprocedural optimization). Obviously, a compiler can potentially do a better job using a broader view. But that broad view is not free: large scope analysis and optimizations are very costly in terms of compilation time and memory space; this is especially true for interprocedural analysis and optimizations.

Interprocedural analysis and optimizations are common in modern commercial compilers from HP, IBM, SGI, Intel, Microsoft, and Sun Microsystems. The open source GCC was criticized for a long time for lacking powerful interprocedural optimizations, but it is changing in this respect. Another open source compiler with full analysis and optimization infrastructure is Open64, which is used by many organizations for research and commercial purposes.

Due to the extra time and space needed for compiler analysis and optimizations, some compilers skip them by default. Users have to use compilation options to explicitly tell the compiler which optimizations should be enabled.

==Compiler correctness==
Compiler correctness is the branch of software engineering that deals with trying to show that a compiler behaves according to its language specification.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}  Techniques include developing the compiler using formal methods and using rigorous testing (often called compiler validation) on an existing compiler.

== Related techniques ==
Assembly language is a type of low-level language and a program that compiles it is more commonly known as an ''assembler'', with the inverse program known as a ''disassembler''.

A program that translates from a low level language to a higher level one is a ''decompiler''.  

A program that translates between high-level languages is usually called a ''language translator'', ''source to source translator'', ''language converter'', or ''language rewriter''. The last term is usually applied to translations that do not involve a change of language.

== International conferences and organizations ==
Every year, the '''European Joint Conferences on Theory and Practice of Software''' (ETAPS) sponsors the '''International Conference on Compiler Construction''' (CC), with papers from both the academic and industrial sectors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etaps.org/ ETAPS] - European Joint Conferences on Theory and Practice of Software.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''debugger''' or '''debugging tool''' is a computer program that is used to test and debug other programs (the &quot;target&quot; program). The code to be examined might alternatively be running on an ''instruction set simulator'' (ISS), a technique that allows great power in its ability to halt when specific conditions are encountered but which will typically be somewhat slower than executing the code directly on the appropriate (or the same) processor. Some debuggers offer two modes of operation - full or partial simulation, to limit this impact.

A &quot;crash&quot; happens when the program cannot normally continue because of a programming bug. For example, the program might have tried to use an instruction not available on the current version of the CPU or attempted to access unavailable or protected memory. When the program &quot;crashes&quot; or reaches a preset condition, the debugger typically shows the position in the original code if it is a '''source-level debugger''' or '''symbolic debugger''', commonly now seen  in integrated development environments.  If it is a '''low-level debugger''' or a '''machine-language debugger''' it shows the line in the disassembly (unless it also has online access to the original source code and can display the appropriate section of code from the assembly or compilation).

Typically, debuggers also offer more sophisticated functions such as running a program step by step ('''single-stepping''' or program animation), stopping ('''breaking''') (pausing the program to examine the current state) at some event or specified instruction by means of a breakpoint, and tracking the values of some variables.  Some debuggers have the ability to modify the state of the program while it is running, rather than merely to observe it. It may also be possible to continue execution at a different location in the program to bypass a crash or logical error.

The importance of a good debugger cannot be overstated. Indeed, the existence and quality of such a tool for a given language and platform can often be the deciding factor in its use, even if another language/platform is better-suited to the task.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}. The absence of a debugger, having once been accustomed to using one, has been said to &quot;make you feel like a blind man in a dark room looking for a black cat that isn’t there&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.berniecode.com/blog/2007/03/08/how-to-debug-javascript-with-visual-web-developer-express/&lt;/ref&gt; However, software can (and often does) behave differently running under a debugger than normally, due to the inevitable changes the presence of a debugger will make to a software program's internal timing. As a result, even with a good debugging tool, it is often very difficult to track down runtime problems in complex multi-threaded or distributed systems. 

The same functionality which makes a debugger useful for eliminating bugs allows it to be used as a software cracking tool to evade copy protection, digital rights management, and other software protection features. It often also makes it useful as a general testing verification tool test coverage and performance analyzer, especially if instruction path lengths are shown.

Most current mainstream debugging engines, such as gdb and dbx provide console-based command line interfaces. Debugger front-ends are popular extensions to debugger engines that provide IDE integration, program animation, and visualization features. Some early mainframe debuggers such as IBM OLIVER (CICS interactive test/debug) and SIMON (Batch Interactive test/debug) provided this same functionality for the IBM System/360 and later operating systems, as long ago as the 1970s.

== Language dependency==
Some debuggers operate on a single specific language while others can handle multiple languages transparently. For example if the main target program is written in COBOL but CALLs Assembler subroutines and also  PL/1 subroutines, the debugger may dynamically switch modes to accommodate the changes in language as they occur.

== Memory protection ==
Some debuggers also incorporate memory protection to avoid storage violations such as buffer overflow. This may be extremely important in transaction processing environments where memory is dynamically allocated from memory 'pools' on a task by task basis.

== Hardware support for debugging ==

Most modern microprocessors have at least one of these features in their CPU design to make debugging easier:
* hardware support for single-stepping a program, such as the trap flag.
* An instruction set that meets the Popek and Goldberg virtualization requirements makes it easier to write debugger software that runs on the same CPU as the software being debugged; such a CPU can execute the inner loops of the program under test at full speed, and still remain under the control of the debugger.
* In-System Programming allows an external hardware debugger to re-program a system under test (for example, adding or removing instruction breakpoints).  Many systems with such ISP support also have other hardware debug support.
* Hardware support for code and data breakpoints, such as address comparators and data value comparators or, with considerably more work involved, page fault hardware.
* JTAG access to hardware debug interfaces such as those on ARM architecture processors or using the Nexus command set.  Processors used in embedded systems typically have extensive JTAG debug support.
* Microcontrollers with as few as six pins need to use low pin-count substitutes for JTAG, such as BDM, Spy-Bi-Wire, or DebugWire on the Atmel AVR.  DebugWire, for example, uses bidirectional signaling on the RESET pin.

==Debugger front-ends==

Some of the most capable and popular debuggers only implement a simple command line interface (CLI) — often to maximize portability and minimize resource consumption. Debugging via a graphical user interface (GUI) can be considered easier and more productive though. This is the reason for GUI debugger front-ends, that allow users to monitor and control subservient CLI-only debuggers via graphical user interface. Some GUI debugger front-ends are designed to be compatible with a variety of CLI-only debuggers, while others are targeted at one specific debugger.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Anjuta-2.0.0-2.png|thumb|300px|Anjuta, a C and C++ IDE for the GNOME environment]]

An '''integrated development environment (IDE)''' (also known as '''integrated design environment''' or '''integrated debugging environment''') is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development. An IDE normally consists of: 

* a source code editor
* a compiler and/or an interpreter
* build automation tools
* a debugger

Sometimes a version control system and various tools are integrated to simplify the construction of a GUI. Many modern IDEs also have a class browser, an object inspector, and a class hierarchy diagram, for use with object-oriented software development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/tools/intro.html | title = Getting Started with an Integrated Development Environment| accessdate = 2008-09-09| author = Dana Nourie|date =2005-03-24| publisher = Sun Microsystems, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
IDEs are designed to maximize programmer productivity by providing tightly-knit components with similar user interfaces. This should mean that the programmer has to do less mode switching versus using discrete development programs.  However, because an IDE is  a complicated piece of software by its very nature, this higher productivity only occurs after a lengthy learning process.

Typically an IDE is dedicated to a specific programming language, allowing a feature set that most closely matches the programming paradigms of the language. However, there are some multiple-language IDEs, such as Eclipse, ActiveState Komodo, recent versions of NetBeans, Microsoft Visual Studio, WinDev, and Xcode.

IDEs typically present a single program in which all development is done. This program typically provides many features for authoring, modifying, compiling, deploying and debugging software.  The aim is to abstract the configuration necessary to piece together command line utilities in a cohesive unit, which theoretically reduces the time to learn a language, and increases developer productivity.  It is also thought that the tight integration of development tasks can further increase productivity. For example, code can be compiled while being written, providing instant feedback on syntax errors.  While most modern IDEs are graphical, IDEs in use before the advent of windowing systems (such as Microsoft Windows or X11) were text-based, using function keys or hotkeys to perform various tasks (Turbo Pascal is a common example). This contrasts with software development using unrelated tools, such as vi, GCC or make.

== History ==
[[Image:Emacs-screenshot.png|thumb|GNU Emacs, an extensible editor that is commonly used as an IDE on Unix-like systems]]

IDEs initially became possible when developing via a console or terminal.  Early systems could not support one, since programs were prepared using flowcharts, entering programs with punched cards (or paper tape, etc.) before submitting them to a compiler. Dartmouth BASIC was the first language to be created with an IDE (and was also the first to be designed for use while sitting in front of a console or terminal). Its IDE (part of the Dartmouth Time Sharing System) was command-based, and therefore did not look much like the menu-driven, graphical IDEs prevalent today. However it integrated editing, file management, compilation, debugging and execution in a manner consistent with a modern IDE.

Maestro I is a product from Softlab Munich and was the world's first integrated development environment&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.computerwoche.de/heftarchiv/1975/47/1205421/ &quot;Interaktives Programmieren als Systems-Schlager&quot;] from ''Computerwoche'' (German)&lt;/ref&gt; 1975 for software. Maestro I was installed for 22,000 programmers worldwide. Until 1989, 6,000 installations existed in the Federal Republic of Germany. Maestro I was arguably the world leader in this field during the 1970s and 1980s. Today one of the last Maestro I can be found in the Museum of Information Technology at Arlington.

One of the first IDEs with a plug-in concept was Softbench. In 1995 Computerwoche commented that the use of an IDE was not well received by developers since it would fence in their creativity.

== Topics ==
=== Visual programming ===
Visual programming is a usage scenario in which an IDE is generally required. Visual IDEs allow users to create new applications by moving programming building blocks or code nodes to create flowcharts or structure diagrams that are then compiled or interpreted.  These flowcharts often are based on the Unified Modeling Language.

This interface has been popularized with the Lego Mindstorms system, and is being actively pursued by a number of companies wishing to capitalize on the power of custom browsers like those found at Mozilla. KTechlab supports flowcode and is a popular opensource IDE and Simulator for developing software for microcontrollers. Visual programming is also responsible for the power of distributed programming (cf. LabVIEW and EICASLAB software).  An early visual programming system, Max, was modelled after analog synthesizer design and has been used to develop real-time music performance software since the 1980s. Another early example was Prograph, a dataflow-based system originally developed for the Macintosh. The graphical programming environment &quot;Grape&quot; is used to program qfix robot kits.

This approach is also used in specialist software such as Openlab, where the end users want the flexibility of a full programming language, without the traditional learning curve associated with one.

An open source visual programming system is Mindscript, which has extended functionality for cryptology, database interfacing,

=== Language support ===
Some IDEs support multiple languages, such as Eclipse or NetBeans, both based on Java, or MonoDevelop, based on C#.

Support for alternative languages is often provided by plugins, allowing them to be installed on the same IDE at the same time. For example, Eclipse and Netbeans have plugins for C/C++, Ada, Perl, Python, Ruby, and  PHP, among other languages.

=== Attitudes across different computing platforms ===
Many Unix programmers argue that traditional command-line POSIX tools constitute an IDE,{{Who|date=February 2010}} though one with a different style of interface and under the Unix environment. Many programmers still use makefiles and their derivatives. Also, many Unix programmers use Emacs or Vim, which integrates support for many of the standard Unix build tools. Data Display Debugger is intended to be an advanced graphical front-end for many text-based debugger standard tools.

On the various Microsoft Windows platforms, command-line tools for development are seldom used. Accordingly, there are many commercial and non-commercial solutions, however each has a different design commonly creating incompatibilities. Most major compiler vendors for Windows still provide free copies of their command-line tools, including Microsoft (Visual C++, Platform SDK, Microsoft .NET Framework SDK, nmake utility), Embarcadero Technologies (bcc32 compiler, make utility).

Additionally, the free software GNU tools (gcc, gdb, GNU make) are available on many platforms, including Windows etc.

IDEs have always been popular on the Apple Macintosh's Mac OS, dating back to Macintosh Programmer's Workshop, Turbo Pascal, THINK Pascal and THINK C environments in the mid-1980s.  Currently Mac OS X programmers can choose between limited IDEs, including native IDEs like Xcode, older IDEs like CodeWarrior, and open-source tools, such as Eclipse and Netbeans. ActiveState Komodo is a proprietary IDE supported on the Mac OS.

      <comment>/* IDEs with GUI builders */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''graphical user interface builder''' (or '''GUI builder'''), also known as '''GUI designer''', is a software development tool that simplifies the creation of GUIs by allowing the designer to arrange widgets using a drag-and-drop WYSIWYG editor. Without a GUI builder, a GUI must be built by manually specifying each widget's parameters in code, with no visual feedback until the program is run.

User interfaces are commonly programmed using an event-driven architecture, so GUI builders also simplify creating event-driven code. This supporting code connects widgets with the outgoing and incoming events that trigger the functions providing the application logic.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Revision controlled project visualization-2010-24-02.svg|thumb|Example history tree of a revision-controlled project.]]

'''Revision control''', also known as '''version control''' or '''source control''' (and an aspect of '''software configuration management''' or SCM), is the management of changes to documents, programs, and other information stored as computer files. It is most commonly used in software development, where a team of people may change the same files. Changes are usually identified by a number or letter code, termed the &quot;revision number&quot;, &quot;revision level&quot;, or simply &quot;revision&quot;. For example, an initial set of files is &quot;revision 1&quot;. When the first change is made, the resulting set is &quot;revision 2&quot;, and so on. Each revision is associated with a timestamp and the person making the change. Revisions can be compared, restored, and with some types of files, merged.

Version control systems (VCSs – singular VCS) most commonly run as stand-alone applications, but revision control is also embedded in various types of software such as word processors (e.g., Microsoft Word, OpenOffice.org Writer, KWord, Pages, etc.), spreadsheets (e.g.,  Microsoft Excel, OpenOffice.org Calc, KSpread, Numbers, etc.), and in various content management systems (e.g., Drupal, Joomla, WordPress). Integrated revision control is a key feature of wiki software packages such as MediaWiki, DokuWiki, TWiki etc. In wikis, revision control allows for the ability to revert a page to a previous revision, which is critical for allowing editors to track each other's edits, correct mistakes, and defend public wikis against vandalism and spam.

Software tools for revision control are essential for the organization of multi-developer projects.&lt;ref&gt;

|quote=Version management is essential to software development and is considered the most critical component of any development environment.
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Revision control developed from formalized processes based on tracking revisions of early blueprints or bluelines. This system of control implicitly allowed returning to any earlier state of the design, for cases in which an engineering dead-end was reached in the development of the design. Likewise, in computer software engineering, revision control is any practice that tracks and provides control over changes to source code. Software developers sometimes use revision control software to maintain documentation and configuration files as well as source code. Also, version control is widespread in business and law.  Indeed, &quot;contract redline&quot; and &quot;legal blackline&quot; are some of the earliest forms of revision control,{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}&lt;!-- need source for &quot;earliest&quot; --&gt; and are still employed with varying degrees of sophistication.  An entire industry has emerged to service the document revision control needs of business and other users, and some of the revision control technology employed in these circles is subtle, powerful, and innovative.  The most sophisticated techniques are beginning to be used for the electronic tracking of changes to CAD files (see product data management), supplanting the &quot;manual&quot; electronic implementation of traditional revision control.

As teams design, develop and deploy software, it is common for multiple versions of the same software to be deployed in different sites and for the software's developers to be working simultaneously on updates. Bugs or features of the software are often only present in certain versions (because of the fixing of some problems and the introduction of others as the program develops). Therefore, for the purposes of locating and fixing bugs, it is vitally important to be able to retrieve and run different versions of the software to determine in which version(s) the problem occurs. It may also be necessary to develop two versions of the software concurrently (for instance, where one version has bugs fixed, but no new features (branch), while the other version is where new features are worked on (trunk).

At the simplest level, developers could simply retain multiple copies of the different versions of the program, and label them appropriately.  This simple approach has been used on many large software projects. While this method can work, it is inefficient as many near-identical copies of the program have to be maintained.  This requires a lot of self-discipline on the part of developers, and often leads to mistakes.  Consequently, systems to automate some or all of the revision control process have been developed.

Moreover, in software development, legal and business practice and other environments, it has become increasingly common for a single document or snippet of code to be edited by a team, the members of which may be geographically dispersed and may pursue different and even contrary interests.  Sophisticated revision control that tracks and accounts for ownership of changes to documents and code may be extremely helpful or even necessary in such situations.

Revision control may also track changes to configuration files, such as those typically stored in &lt;code&gt;/etc&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;/usr/local/etc&lt;/code&gt; on Unix systems. This gives system administrators another way to easily track changes made and a way to roll back to earlier versions should the need arise.

==Source-management models==
Traditional revision control systems use a centralized model where all the revision control functions take place on a shared server. If two developers try to change the same file at the same time, without some method of managing access the developers may end up overwriting each other's work. Centralized revision control systems solve this problem in one of two different &quot;source management models&quot;: file locking and version merging.

===Atomic operations===
Computer scientists speak of ''atomic'' operations if the system is left in a consistent state even if the operation is interrupted. The ''commit'' operation is usually the most critical in this sense.  Commits are operations which tell the revision control system you want to make a group of changes you have been making final and available to all users.  Not all revision control systems have atomic commits; notably, the widely-used CVS lacks this feature.

===File locking===
The simplest method of preventing &quot;concurrent access&quot; problems involves locking files so that only one developer at a time has write access to the central &quot;repository&quot; copies of those files. Once one developer &quot;checks out&quot; a file, others can read that file, but no one else may change that file until that developer &quot;checks in&quot; the updated version (or cancels the checkout).

File locking has both merits and drawbacks.  It can provide some protection against difficult merge conflicts when a user is making radical changes to many sections of a large file (or group of files).  However, if the files are left exclusively locked for too long, other developers may be tempted to bypass the revision control software and change the files locally, leading to more serious problems.

experiment

===Version merging===
Most version control systems allow multiple developers to edit the same file at the same time. The first developer to &quot;check in&quot; changes to the central repository always succeeds. The system may provide facilities to merge further changes into the central repository, and preserve the changes from the first developer when other developers check in.

Merging two files can be a very delicate operation, and usually possible only if the data structure is simple, as in text files. The result of a merge of two image files might not result in an image file at all. The second developer checking in code will need to take care with the merge, to make sure that the changes are compatible and that the merge operation does not introduce its own logic errors within the files. These problems limit the availability of automatic or semi-automatic merge operations mainly to simple text based documents, unless a specific merge plugin is available for the file types.

The concept of a ''reserved edit'' can provide an optional means to explicitly lock a file for exclusive write access, even when a merging capability exists.

===Baselines, labels and tags===
Most revision control tools will use only one of these similar terms (baseline, label, tag) to refer to the action of identifying a snapshot (&quot;label the project&quot;) or the record of the snapshot (&quot;try it with baseline ''X''&quot;).  Typically only one of the terms ''baseline'', ''label'', or ''tag'' is used in documentation or discussion{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}; they can be considered synonyms.

In most projects some snapshots are more significant than others, such as those used to indicate published releases, branches, or milestones.

When both the term ''baseline'' and either of ''label'' or ''tag'' are used together in the same context, ''label'' and ''tag'' usually refer to the mechanism within the tool of identifying or making the record of the snapshot, and ''baseline'' indicates the increased significance of any given label or tag.

Most formal discussion of configuration management uses the term ''baseline''.

==Distributed revision control==
Distributed revision control (DRCS) takes a peer-to-peer approach, as opposed to the client-server approach of centralized systems. Rather than a single, central repository on which clients synchronize, each peer's working copy of the codebase is a bona-fide repository.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  | last = Wheeler

  | url = http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/scm.html
  | accessdate = May 8, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Distributed revision control conducts synchronization by exchanging patches (change-sets) from peer to peer. This results in some important differences from a centralized system:

* No canonical, reference copy of the codebase exists by default; only working copies.
* Common operations (such as commits, viewing history, and reverting changes) are fast, because there is no need to communicate with a central server.&lt;ref name='OSullivan'&gt;{{cite web

  | title = Distributed revision control with Mercurial
  | url = http://hgbook.red-bean.com/hgbook.html
  | accessdate = July 13, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Rather, communication is only necessary when pushing or pulling changes to or from other peers.
* Each working copy effectively functions as a remote backup of the codebase and of its change-history, providing natural protection against data loss.&lt;ref name='OSullivan'/&gt;

==Integration==
Some of the more advanced revision-control tools offer many other facilities, allowing deeper integration with other tools and software-engineering processes. Plugins are often available for IDEs such as Oracle JDeveloper, IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse and Visual Studio. NetBeans IDE and Xcode come with integrated version control support.

Terminology can vary from system to system, but some terms in common usage include:&lt;ref&gt;

; Baseline : An approved revision of a document or source file from which subsequent changes can be made.  See baselines, labels and tags.
; Branch : A set of files under version control may be '''branched''' or '''forked''' at a point in time so that, from that time forward, two copies of those files may develop at different speeds or in different ways independently of each other.
; Change : A '''change''' (or '''diff''', or '''delta''') represents a specific modification to a document under version control.  The granularity of the modification considered a change varies between version control systems.
; Change list : On many version control systems with atomic multi-change commits, a '''changelist''', '''change set''', or '''patch''' identifies the set of '''changes''' made in a single commit.  This can also represent a sequential view of the source code, allowing the examination of source &quot;as of&quot; any particular changelist ID.
; Checkout : A '''check-out''' (or '''co''') is the act of creating a local working copy from the repository. A user may specify a specific revision or obtain the latest. The term 'checkout' can also used as a noun to describe the working copy.
; Commit : A '''commit''' ('''checkin''', '''ci''' or, more rarely, '''install''', '''submit''' or '''record''') is the action of writing or merging the changes made in the working copy back to the repository. The terms 'commit' and 'checkin' can also used in noun form to describe the new revision that is created as a result of committing.
; Conflict : A conflict occurs when different parties make changes to the same document, and the system is unable to reconcile the changes.  A user must '''resolve''' the conflict by combining the changes, or by selecting one change in favour of the other.
; Delta compression : Most revision control software uses delta compression, which retains only the differences between successive versions of files.  This allows for more efficient storage of many different versions of files.
; Dynamic stream : A stream in which some or all file versions are mirrors of the parent stream's versions.
; Export : '''exporting''' is the act of obtaining the files from the repository. It is similar to '''checking-out''' except that it creates a clean directory tree without the version-control metadata used in a working copy. This is often used prior to publishing the contents, for example.
; Head: Also sometime called '''tip''', this refers to the most recent commit.
; Import : '''importing''' is the act of copying a local directory tree (that is not currently a working copy) into the repository for the first time.
; Label : See '''tag'''.
; Mainline : Similar to ''trunk'', but there can be a mainline for each branch.
; Merge : A '''merge''' or '''integration''' is an operation in which two sets of changes are applied to a file or set of files. Some sample scenarios are as follows:
:* A user, working on a set of files, '''updates''' or '''syncs''' their working copy with changes made, and checked into the repository, by other users.&lt;ref name=&quot;svnbook-merge&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Collins-Sussman|first=Ben|title=Version Control with Subversion|url=http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.5/svn.tour.cycle.html#svn.tour.cycle.resolve|accessdate=8 June 2010|coauthors=Brian W. Fitpatrick, and C. Michael Pilato|quote=The G  stands for merGed, which means that the file had local changes to begin with, but the changes coming from the repository didn't overlap with the local changes.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:* A user tries to '''check-in''' files that have been updated by others since the files were '''checked out''', and the '''revision control software''' automatically merges the files (typically, after prompting the user if it should proceed with the automatic merge, and in some cases only doing so if the merge can be clearly and reasonably resolved).
:* A set of files is '''branched''', a problem that existed before the branching is fixed in one branch, and the fix is then merged into the other branch.
:* A '''branch''' is created, the code in the files is independently edited, and the updated branch is later incorporated into a single, unified '''trunk'''.
; Promote : The act of copying file content from a less controlled location into a more controlled location. For example, from a user's workspace into a repository,  or from a stream to its parent.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book
  | title = Accurev Concepts Manual, Version 4.7
  | publisher = Accurev, Inc.
  | date = July, 2008
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
; Repository : The '''repository''' is where files' current and historical data are stored, often on a server. Sometimes also called a '''depot''' (for example, by SVK, AccuRev and Perforce).
; Resolve : The act of user intervention to address a conflict between different changes to the same document.
; Reverse integration : The process of merging different team branches into the main trunk of the versioning system.
; Revision : Also '''version''': A version is any change in form.  In SVK, a Revision is the state at a point in time of the entire tree in the repository.
; Ring: {{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} See '''tag'''.
; Share: The act of making one file or folder available in multiple branches at the same time. When a shared file is changed in one branch, it is changed in other branches.
; Stream : A container for branched files that has a known relationship to other such containers. Streams form a hierarchy; each stream can inherit various properties (like versions, namespace, workflow rules, subscribers, etc.) from its parent stream.
; Tag : A '''tag''' or '''label''' refers to an important snapshot in time, consistent across many files.  These files at that point may all be tagged with a user-friendly, meaningful name or revision number.  See baselines, labels and tags.
; Trunk: The unique line of development that is not a branch (sometimes also called Baseline or Mainline)
; Update : An '''update''' (or '''sync''') merges changes made in the repository (by other people, for example) into the local '''working copy'''.&lt;ref name=&quot;svnbook-merge&quot;/&gt;
; Working copy: The '''working copy''' is the local copy of files from a repository, at a specific time or revision. All work done to the files in a repository is initially done on a working copy, hence the name. Conceptually, it is a ''sandbox''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Build automation''' is the act of scripting or automating a wide variety of tasks that software developers do in their day-to-day activities including things like:
* compiling computer source code into binary code
* packaging binary code
* running tests
* deployment to production systems
* creating documentation and/or release notes

==History==
Historically, developers used build automation to call compilers and linkers from inside a build script versus attempting to make the compiler calls from the command line.  It is simple to use the command line to pass a single source module to a compiler and then to a linker to create the final deployable object.  However, when attempting to compile and link many source code modules, in a particular order, using the command line process is not a reasonable solution.  The make scripting language offered a better alternative. It allowed a build script to be written to call in a series, the needed compile and link steps to build a software application.  GNU Make &lt;ref&gt;http://www.gnu.org/software/make/&lt;/ref&gt; also offered additional features such as &quot;makedepend&quot; which allowed some source code dependency management as well as incremental build processing. This was the beginning of Build Automation.  Its primary focus was on automating the calls to the compilers and linkers.  As the build process grew more complex, developers began adding pre and post actions around the calls to the compilers such as a check-out from version control to the copying of deployable objects to a test location.  The term &quot;build automation&quot; now includes managing the pre and post compile and link activities as well as the compile and link activities.

==New breed of solutions==

In recent years, build management solutions have provided even more relief when it comes to automating the build process.  Both commercial and open source solutions are available to perform more automated build and workflow processing.  Some solutions focus on automating the pre and post steps around the calling of the build scripts, while others go beyond the pre and post build script processing and drive down into streamlining the actual compile and linker calls without much manual scripting.  These tools are particularly useful for continuous integration builds where frequent calls to the compile process are required and incremental build processing is needed.

==Advanced build automation==

Advanced build automation offers remote agent processing for distributed builds and/or distributed processing.  The term &quot;distributed builds&quot; means that the actual calls to the compiler and linkers can be served out to multiple locations for improving the speed of the build.  This term is often confused with &quot;distributed processing&quot;.  Distributed processing means that each step in a process or workflow can be sent to a different machine for execution. For example, a post step to the build may require the execution of multiple test scripts on multiple machines.  Distributed processing can send the different test scripts to different machines.  Distributed processing is not distributed builds.  Distributed processing cannot take a make, ant or maven script, break it up and send it to different machines for compiling and linking.  The distributed build process must have the machine intelligence to understand the source code dependencies in order to send the different compile and link steps to different machines.  A build automation solution must be able to manage these dependencies in order to perform distributed builds.  Some build tools can discover these relationships programmatically (Rational ClearMake distributed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|url=http://www.ddj.com/architect/184405385|accessdate=2009-04-13|title=Dr. Dobb's Distributed Loadbuilds}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Electric Cloud ElectricAccelerator&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|url=http://www.ddj.com/architect/184415472|title=Dr. Dobb's Take My Build, Please}}&lt;/ref&gt;), while others depend on user-configured dependencies (Platform LSF lsmake&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|url=http://www.lle.rochester.edu/pub/support/lsf/10-lsmake.html|accessdate=2009-04-13|title=LSF User's Guide - Using lsmake}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Build automation that can sort out source code dependency relationships can also be configured to run the compile and link activities in a parallelized mode.  This means that the compiler and linkers can be called in multi-threaded mode using a machine that is configured with more than one core.

Not all build automation tools can perform distributed builds. Most only provide distributed processing support. In addition, most solutions that do support distributed builds can only handle C or C++. Build automation solutions that support distributed processing are often make based and many do not support Maven or Ant.

An example of a distributed build solution is Xoreax's IncrediBuild&lt;ref&gt;{{cite
|url=http://www.xoreax.com/solutions_vs.htm
|accessdate=2009-04-08
|title=Distributed Visual Studio Builds
}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--commercial but not blatant advertising --&gt;
for the Microsoft Visual Studio platform or the open-source  CMake&lt;ref&gt;{{cite
|url=http://www.cmake.org/
|accessdate=2010-03-27
|title=CMake - Cross platform make
}}&lt;/ref&gt;. These may require particular configurations of a product environment so that it can run successfully on a distributed platform—library locations, environment variables, and so forth.

==Advantages==
* Improve product quality
* Accelerate the compile and link processing
* Eliminate redundant tasks
* Minimize &quot;bad builds&quot;
* Eliminate dependencies on key personnel
* Have history of builds and releases in order to investigate issues
* Save time and money - because of the reasons listed above.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.denverjug.org/meetings/files/200410_automation.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
* '''On-Demand automation''' such as a user running a script at the command line
* '''Scheduled automation''' such as a continuous integration server running a nightly build
* '''Triggered automation''' such as a continuous integration server running a build on every commit to a version control system.

==Makefile==

One specific form of build automation is the automatic generation of Makefiles. This is accomplished by tools like
* GNU Automake
* CMake
* imake
* qmake
* nmake
* wmake
* Apache Ant
* Apache Maven
* OpenMake Meister

==Requirements of a build system==
Basic requirements:
# Frequent or overnight builds to catch problems early.&lt;ref&gt;http://freshmeat.net/articles/view/392/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-junitmail/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://buildbot.net/trac&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Software documentation''' or '''source code documentation''' is written text that accompanies computer software.  It either explains how it operates or how to use it, and may mean different things to people in different roles.

== Involvement of people in software life==
Documentation is an important part of software engineering. Types of documentation include:

# Requirements - Statements that identify attributes, capabilities, characteristics, or qualities of a system.  This is the foundation for what shall be or has been implemented.
# Architecture/Design - Overview of softwares. Includes relations to an environment and construction principles to be used in design of software components. 
# Technical - Documentation of code, algorithms, interfaces, and APIs.
# End User - Manuals for the end-user, system administrators and support staff.
# Marketing - How to market the product and analysis of the market demand.

=== Requirements documentation ===
Requirements documentation is the description of what a particular software does or shall do. It is used throughout development to communicate what the software does or shall do. It is also used as an agreement or as the foundation for agreement on what the software shall do. Requirements are produced and consumed by everyone involved in the production of software: end users, customers, product managers, project managers, sales, marketing, software architects, usability engineers, interaction designers, developers, and testers, to name a few. Thus, requirements documentation has many different purposes.

Requirements come in a variety of styles, notations and formality. Requirements can be goal-like (e.g., ''distributed work environment''), close to design (e.g., ''builds can be started by right-clicking a configuration file and select the 'build' function''), and anything in between. They can be specified as statements in natural language, as drawn figures, as detailed mathematical formulas, and as a combination of them all.

The variation and complexity of requirements documentation makes it a proven challenge. Requirements may be implicit and hard to uncover. It is difficult to know exactly how much and what kind of documentation is needed and how much can be left to the architecture and design documentation, and it is difficult to know how to document requirements considering the variety of people that shall read and use the documentation. Thus, requirements documentation is often incomplete (or non-existent). Without proper requirements documentation, software changes become more difficult—and therefore more error prone (decreased software quality) and time-consuming (expensive).

The need for requirements documentation is typically related to the complexity of the product, the impact of the product, and the life expectancy of the software. If the software is very complex or developed by many people (e.g., mobile phone software), requirements can help to better communicate what to achieve. If the software is safety-critical and can have negative impact on human life (e.g., nuclear power systems, medical equipment), more formal requirements documentation is often required. If the software is expected to live for only a month or two (e.g., very small mobile phone applications developed specifically for a certain campaign) very little requirements documentation may be needed. If the software is a first release that is later built upon, requirements documentation is very helpful when managing the change of the software and verifying that nothing has been broken in the software when it is modified.

Traditionally, requirements are specified in requirements documents (e.g. using word processing applications and spreadsheet applications). To manage the increased complexity and changing nature of requirements documentation (and software documentation in general), database-centric systems and special-purpose requirements management tools are advocated.

=== Architecture/Design documentation ===
Architecture documentation is a special breed of design document. In a way, architecture documents are third derivative from the code (design document being second derivative, and code documents being first). Very little in the architecture documents is specific to the code itself. These documents do not describe how to program a particular routine, or even why that particular routine exists in the form that it does, but instead merely lays out the general requirements that would motivate the existence of such a routine. A good architecture document is short on details but thick on explanation. It may suggest approaches for lower level design, but leave the actual exploration trade studies to other documents.

Another breed of design docs is the comparison document, or trade study. This would often take the form of a ''whitepaper''. It focuses on one specific aspect of the system and suggests alternate approaches. It could be at the user interface, code, design, or even architectural level. It will outline what the situation is, describe one or more alternatives, and enumerate the pros and cons of each. A good trade study document is heavy on research, expresses its idea clearly (without relying heavily on obtuse jargon to dazzle the reader), and most importantly is impartial. It should honestly and clearly explain the costs of whatever solution it offers as best. The objective of a trade study is to devise the best solution, rather than to push a particular point of view. It is perfectly acceptable to state no conclusion, or to conclude that none of the alternatives are sufficiently better than the baseline to warrant a change. It should be approached as a scientific endeavor, not as a marketing technique.

A very important part of the design document in enterprise software development is the Database Design Document (DDD). It contains Conceptual, Logical, and Physical Design Elements. The DDD includes the formal information that the people who interact with the database need. The purpose of preparing it is to create a common source to be used by all players within the scene. The potential users are:
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Database Designer
&lt;li&gt;Database Developer
&lt;li&gt;Database Administrator
&lt;li&gt;Application Designer
&lt;li&gt;Application Developer
&lt;/ul&gt;

When talking about Relational Database Systems, the document should include following parts:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Entity - Relationship Schema, including following information and their clear definitions:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Entity Sets and their attributes
&lt;li&gt;Relationships and their attributes
&lt;li&gt;Candidate keys for each entity set
&lt;li&gt;Attribute and Tuple based constraints
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Relational Schema, including following information:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tables, Attributes, and their properties
&lt;li&gt;Views
&lt;li&gt;Constraints such as primary keys, foreign keys, 
&lt;li&gt;Cardinality of referential constraints
&lt;li&gt;Cascading Policy for referential constraints
&lt;li&gt;Primary keys
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

It is very important to include all information that is to be used by all actors in the scene. It is also very important to update the documents as any change occurs in the database as well.

=== Technical documentation ===
This is what most programmers mean when using the term ''software documentation''. When creating software, code alone is insufficient. There must be some text along with it to describe various aspects of its intended operation.  It is important for the code documents to be thorough, but not so verbose that it becomes difficult to maintain them. Several How-to and overview documentation are found specific to the software application or software product being documented by API Writers. This documentation may be used by developers, testers and also the end customers or clients using this software application. Today, we see lot of high end applications in the field of power, energy, transportation, networks, aerospace, safety, security, industry automation and a variety of other domains. Technical documentation has become important within such organizations as the basic and advanced level of information may change over a period of time with architecture changes. Hence, technical documentation has gained lot of importance in recent times, especially in the software field.

Often, tools such as Doxygen, NDoc, javadoc, EiffelStudio, Sandcastle, ROBODoc, POD, TwinText, or Universal Report can be used to auto-generate the code documents&amp;mdash;that is, they extract the comments and software contracts, where available, from the source code and create reference manuals in such forms as text or HTML files. Code documents are often organized into a ''reference guide'' style, allowing a programmer to quickly look up an arbitrary function or class.

The idea of auto-generating documentation is attractive to programmers for various reasons.  For example, because it is extracted from the source code itself (for example, through comments), the programmer can write it while referring to the code, and use the same tools used to create the source code to make the documentation.  This makes it much easier to keep the documentation up-to-date.

Of course, a downside is that only programmers can edit this kind of documentation, and it depends on them to refresh the output (for example, by running a cron job to update the documents nightly). Some would characterize this as a pro rather than a con.

Donald Knuth has insisted on the fact that documentation can be a very difficult afterthought process and has advocated literate programming, writing at the same time and location as the source code and extracted by automatic means.

Elucidative Programming is the result of practical applications of Literate Programming in real programming contexts.
The Elucidative paradigm proposes that source code and documentation be stored separately.
This paradigm was inspired by the same experimental findings that produced [http://kelp.sf.net/ Kelp].
Often, software developers need to be able to create and access information that is not going to be part of the source file itself. Such annotations are usually part of several software development activities, such as code walks and porting, where third party source code is analysed in a functional way. Annotations can therefore help the developer during any stage of software development where a formal documentation system would hinder progress.
[http://kelp.sf.net/ Kelp] stores annotations in separate files, linking the information to the source code dynamically.

=== User documentation ===
Unlike code documents, user documents are usually far more diverse with respect to the source code of the program, and instead simply describe how it is used.  

In the case of a software library, the code documents and user documents could be effectively equivalent and are worth conjoining, but for a general application this is not often true. 

Typically, the user documentation describes each feature of the program, and assists the user in realizing these features.  A good user document can also go so far as to provide thorough troubleshooting assistance.  It is very important for user documents to not be confusing, and for them to be up to date.  User documents need not be organized in any particular way, but it is very important for them to have a thorough index. Consistency and simplicity are also very valuable. User documentation is considered to constitute a contract specifying what the software will do. API Writers are very well accomplished towards writing good user documents as they would be well aware of the software architecture and programming techniques used. See also Technical Writing.

There are three broad ways in which user documentation can be organized. 
# '''Tutorial:''' A tutorial approach is considered the most useful for a new user, in which they are guided through each step of accomplishing particular tasks &lt;ref name=kdp&gt;{{cite web
  | last = Woelz 
  | first = Carlos 
  | authorlink = 
  | coauthors =

  | date = 
  | url = http://i18n.kde.org/docs/doc-primer/index.html
  | doi =
  | accessdate = 15 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;. 
# '''Thematic:''' A thematic approach, where chapters or sections concentrate on one particular area of interest, is of more general use to an intermediate user.  Some authors prefer to convey their ideas through a knowledge based article to facilitating the user needs.  This approach is usually practiced by a dynamic industry, such as Information technology, where the user population is largely correlated with the troubleshooting demands &lt;ref name=kbad&gt;{{cite web

  | url = http://www.adobe.com/devnet/air/flex/articles/flex_air_codebase.html
  | doi =
  | accessdate = 15 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.
# '''List or Reference:''' The final type of organizing principle is one in which commands or tasks are simply listed alphabetically or logically grouped, often via cross-referenced indexes. This latter approach is of greater use to advanced users who know exactly what sort of information they are looking for.

A common complaint among users regarding software documentation is that only one of these three approaches was taken to the near-exclusion of the other two. It is common to limit provided software documentation for personal computers to online help that give only reference information on commands or menu items.  The job of tutoring new users or helping more experienced users get the most out of a program is left to private publishers, who are often given significant assistance by the software developer.

=== Marketing documentation ===
For many applications it is necessary to have some promotional materials to encourage casual observers to spend more time learning about the product.  This form of documentation has three purposes:-

#To excite the potential user about the product and instill in them a desire for becoming more involved with it.
#To inform them about what exactly the product does, so that their expectations are in line with what they will be receiving.
#To explain the position of this product with respect to other alternatives.  

One good marketing technique is to provide clear and memorable ''catch phrases'' that exemplify the point we wish to convey, and also emphasize the interoperability of the program with anything else provided by the manufacturer.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In software engineering, '''program profiling''', '''software profiling''' or simply '''profiling''', a form of dynamic program analysis (as opposed to static code analysis), is the investigation of a program's behavior using information gathered as the program executes. The usual purpose of this analysis is to determine which sections of a program to optimize - to increase its overall speed, decrease its memory requirement or sometimes both. 

* A '''(code) profiler''' is a '''performance analysis''' tool that, most commonly, measures only the frequency and duration of function calls, but there are other specific types of profilers (e.g. memory profilers&lt;!--plenty of hist on gbooks for this--&gt;) in addition to more comprehensive profilers, capable of gathering extensive performance data.
* An instruction set simulator which is also &amp;mdash; by necessity &amp;mdash; a profiler, can measure the totality of a program's behaviour from invocation to termination.

== Gathering program events ==
Profilers use a wide variety of techniques to collect data, including hardware interrupts, code instrumentation, instruction set simulation, operating system hooks, and performance counters. The usage of profilers is 'called out' in the performance engineering process.

== Use of profilers ==
''Program analysis tools are extremely important for understanding program behavior. Computer architects need such tools to evaluate how well programs will perform on new architectures. Software writers need tools to analyze their programs and identify critical sections of code. Compiler writers often use such tools to find out how well their instruction scheduling or branch prediction algorithm is performing...'' (ATOM, PLDI, '94)

The output of a profiler may be:- 

* A statistical ''summary'' of the events observed (a '''profile''')
:Summary profile information is often shown annotated against the source code statements where the events occur, so the size of measurement data is linear to the code size of the program.
:&lt;code&gt;
 /* ------------ source------------------------- count */             
 0001             IF X = &quot;A&quot;                     0055
 0002                THEN DO                       
 0003                  ADD 1 to XCOUNT           0032
 0004                ELSE
 0005             IF X = &quot;B&quot;                     0055
&lt;/code&gt;
* A stream of recorded events (a '''trace''')
:For sequential programs, a summary profile is usually sufficient, but performance problems in parallel programs (waiting for messages or synchronization issues) often depend on the time relationship of events, thus requiring a full trace to get an understanding of what is happening.
: The size of a (full) trace is linear to the program's instruction path length, making it somewhat impractical. A trace may therefore be initiated at one point in a program and terminated at another point to limit the output.
* An ongoing interaction with the hypervisor (continuous or periodic monitoring via on-screen display for instance)
: This provides the opportunity to switch a trace on or off at any desired point during execution in addition to viewing on-going metrics about the (still executing) program. It also provides the opportunity to suspend asynchronous processes at critical points to examine interactions with other parallel processes in more detail.

==History==
Performance analysis tools existed on IBM/360 and IBM/370 platforms from the early 1970s, usually based on timer interrupts which recorded the Program status word (PSW) at set timer intervals to detect &quot;hot spots&quot; in executing code. This was an early example of sampling (see below). In early 1974, Instruction Set Simulators permitted full trace and other performance monitoring features.

Profiler-driven program analysis on Unix dates back to at least 1979, when Unix systems included a basic tool &quot;prof&quot; that listed each function and how much of program execution time it used. In 1982, gprof extended the concept to a complete call graph analysis &lt;ref&gt;[http://docs.freebsd.org/44doc/psd/18.gprof/paper.pdf ''gprof: a Call Graph Execution Profiler'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, Amitabh Srivastava and Alan Eustace of Digital Equipment Corporation published a paper describing ATOM.&lt;ref&gt;[http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.119.8540 Atom: A system for building customized program analysis tools,  Amitabh Srivastava and Alan Eustace, 1994] ([http://www.ece.cmu.edu/~ece548/tools/atom/man/wrl_94_2.pdf download])&lt;/ref&gt; ATOM is a platform for converting a program into its own profiler. That is, at compile time, it inserts code into the program to be analyzed. That inserted code outputs analysis data. This technique - modifying a program to analyze itself - is known as &quot;instrumentation&quot;.

In 2004, both the gprof and ATOM papers appeared on the list of the 50 most influential PLDI papers of all time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/mckinley/20-years.html 20 Years of PLDI (1979 - 1999): A Selection, Kathryn S. McKinley, Editor]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Profiler types based on output ==
===Flat profiler ===
Flat profilers compute the average call times, from the calls, and do not break down the call times based on the callee or the context.

===Call-graph profiler===
Call graph profilers show the call times, and frequencies of the functions, and also the call-chains involved based on the callee. However context is not preserved.

==Methods of data gathering==
===Event-based profilers===
The programming languages listed here have event-based profilers:
* Java: the JVMTI (JVM Tools Interface) API, formerly JVMPI (JVM Profiling Interface), provides hooks to profilers, for trapping events like calls, class-load, unload, thread enter leave.
* .NET: Can attach a profiling agent as a COM server to the CLR. Like Java, the runtime then provides various callbacks into the agent, for trapping events like method JIT / enter / leave, object creation, etc. Particularly powerful in that the profiling agent can rewrite the target application's bytecode in arbitrary ways.
* Python: Python profiling includes the profile module, hotshot (which is call-graph based), and using the 'sys.setprofile' function to trap events like c_{call,return,exception}, python_{call,return,exception}.
* Ruby: Ruby also uses a similar interface like Python for profiling. Flat-profiler in profile.rb, module, and ruby-prof a C-extension are present.

===Statistical profilers===
Some profilers operate by sampling. A sampling profiler probes the target program's program counter at regular intervals using operating system interrupts. Sampling profiles are typically less numerically accurate and specific, but allow the target program to run at near full speed. 

The resulting data are not exact, but a statistical approximation. ''The actual amount of error is usually more than one sampling period. In fact, if a value is n times the sampling period, the expected error in it is the square-root of n sampling periods.'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://lgl.epfl.ch/teaching/case_tools/doc/gprof/gprof_12.html Statistical Inaccuracy of &lt;tt&gt;gprof&lt;/tt&gt; Output]&lt;/ref&gt;

In practice, sampling profilers can often provide a more accurate picture of the target program's execution than other approaches, as they are not as intrusive to the target program, and thus don't have as many side effects (such as on memory caches or instruction decoding pipelines). Also since they don't affect the execution speed as much, they can detect issues that would otherwise be hidden. They are also relatively immune to over-evaluating the cost of small, frequently called routines or 'tight' loops. They can show the relative amount of time spent in user mode versus interruptible kernel mode such as system call processing.

Still, kernel code to handle the interrupts entails a minor loss of CPU cycles, diverted cache usage, and is unable to distinguish the various tasks occurring in uninterruptible kernel code (microsecond-range activity).

Dedicated hardware can go beyond this: some recent MIPS processors JTAG interface have a PCSAMPLE register, which samples the program counter in a truly undetectable manner. 

Some of the most commonly used statistical profilers are AMD CodeAnalyst, Apple Inc. Shark, gprof, Intel VTune and Parallel Amplifier (part of Intel Parallel Studio).

===Instrumenting profilers===
Some profilers '''instrument''' the target program with additional instructions to collect the required information. 

Instrumenting the program can cause changes in the performance of the program, potentially causing inaccurate results and heisenbugs. Instrumenting will always have some impact on the program execution, typically always slowing it. However, instrumentation can be very specific and be carefully controlled to have a minimal impact. The impact on a particular program depends on the placement of instrumentation points and the mechanism used to capture the trace. Hardware support for trace capture means that on some targets, instrumentation can be on just one machine instruction. The impact of instrumentation can often be deducted (i.e. eliminated by subtraction) from the results.

gprof is an example of a profiler that uses both instrumentation and sampling. Instrumentation is used to gather caller information and the actual timing values are obtained by statistical sampling.

===Instrumentation ===
* '''Manual''': Performed by the programmer, e.g. by adding instructions to explicitly calculate runtimes, simply count events or calls to measurement APIs such as the Application Response Measurement standard.
* '''Automatic source level''': instrumentation added to the source code by an automatic tool according to an instrumentation policy.
* '''Compiler assisted''': Example: &quot;gcc -pg ...&quot; for gprof, &quot;quantify g++ ...&quot; for Quantify
* '''Binary translation''': The tool adds instrumentation to a compiled binary. Example: ATOM
* '''Runtime instrumentation''': Directly before execution the code is instrumented. The program run is fully supervised and controlled by the tool. Examples: Pin, Valgrind
* '''Runtime injection''': More lightweight than runtime instrumentation. Code is modified at runtime to have jumps to helper functions. Example: DynInst

===Interpreter instrumentation===
* '''Interpreter debug''' options can enable the collection of performance metrics as the interpreter encounters each target statement. A bytecode, control table or JIT interpreters are three examples that usually have complete control over execution of the target code, thus enabling extremely comprehensive data collection opportunities.

===Hypervisor/Simulator===
* '''Hypervisor''': Data are collected by running the (usually) unmodified program under a hypervisor. Example: SIMMON
* '''Simulator''' and '''Hypervisor''': Data collected interactively and selectively by running the unmodified program under an Instruction Set Simulator. Examples: SIMON (Batch Interactive test/debug) and IBM OLIVER (CICS interactive test/debug).

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Code coverage''' is a measure used in software testing.  It describes the degree to which the source code of a program has been tested.  It is a form of testing that inspects the code directly and is therefore a form of white box testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Kolawa | first = Adam | coauthors = Huizinga, Dorota | title = Automated Defect Prevention: Best Practices in Software Management |  url = http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470042125.html | year = 2007 | publisher = Wiley-IEEE Computer Society Press | location =| page=254| pages =426 | isbn = 0470042125 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In time, the use of code coverage has been extended to the field of digital hardware, the contemporary design methodology of which relies on hardware description languages (HDLs).

Code coverage was among the first methods invented for systematic software testing.  The first published reference was by Miller and Maloney in ''Communications of the ACM'' in 1963.

Code coverage is one consideration in the safety certification of avionics equipment.  The standard by which avionics gear is certified by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is documented in DO-178B.&lt;ref&gt;RTCA/DO-178(b), ''Software Considerations in Airborne Systems and Equipment Certification, Radio Technical Commission for Aeronautics,'' December 1, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coverage criteria==
To measure how well the program is exercised by a test suite, one or more ''coverage criteria'' are used. 

=== Basic coverage criteria ===
There are a number of  coverage criteria, the main ones being:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Glenford J. Myers | title=The Art of Software Testing, 2nd edition |publisher=Wiley | year=2004| id=ISBN 0471469122}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Function coverage''' - Has each function (or subroutine) in the program been called?
* '''Statement coverage''' - Has each node in the program been executed?
* '''Decision coverage''' (not the same as '''branch coverage''' - see Position Paper CAST10.&lt;ref name =&quot;Position Paper CAST10&quot;&gt; [http://www.faa.gov/aircraft/air_cert/design_approvals/air_software/cast/cast_papers/media/cast-10.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;) - Has every edge in the program been executed?  For instance, have the requirements of each branch of each control structure (such as in IF and CASE statements) been met as well as not met?
* '''Condition coverage''' (or predicate coverage) - Has each boolean sub-expression evaluated both to true and false? This does not necessarily imply decision coverage.
* '''Condition/decision coverage''' - Both decision and condition coverage should be satisfied.

For example, consider the following C++ function:
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
int foo(int x, int y)
{
    int z = 0;
    if ((x&gt;0) &amp;&amp; (y&gt;0)) {
        z = x;
    }
    return z;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Assume this function is a part of some bigger program and this program was run with some test suite. 
* If during this execution function 'foo' was called at least once, then ''function coverage'' for this function is satisfied. 
* ''Statement coverage'' for this function will be satisfied if it was called e.g. as &lt;code&gt;foo(1,1)&lt;/code&gt;, as in this case, every line in the function is executed including &lt;code&gt;z = x;&lt;/code&gt;.
* Tests calling &lt;code&gt;foo(1,1)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;foo(1,0)&lt;/code&gt; will satisfy ''decision coverage'', as in the first case the &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; condition is satisfied and &lt;code&gt;z = x;&lt;/code&gt; is executed, and in the second it is not. 
* ''Condition coverage'' can be satisfied with tests that call &lt;code&gt;foo(1,1)&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;foo(1,0)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;foo(0,0)&lt;/code&gt;. These are necessary as in the first two cases &lt;code&gt;(x&gt;0)&lt;/code&gt; evaluates to &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; while in the third it evaluates &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;. At the same time, the first case makes &lt;code&gt;(y&gt;0)&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; while the second and third make it &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;.

In languages, like Pascal, where standard boolean operations are not short circuited, condition coverage does not necessarily imply decision coverage. For example, consider the following fragment of code:
&lt;source lang=&quot;pascal&quot;&gt;
if a and b then
&lt;/source&gt;
Condition coverage can be satisfied by two tests:
* &lt;code&gt;a=true&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;b=false&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;a=false&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;b=true&lt;/code&gt;
However, this set of tests does not satisfy decision coverage as in neither case will the &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; condition be met.

Fault injection may be necessary to ensure that all conditions and branches of exception handling code have adequate coverage during testing.

=== Modified condition/decision coverage ===
For safety-critical applications (e.g. for avionics software) it is often required that '''modified condition/decision coverage (MC/DC)''' is satisifed. This criteria extends condition/decision criteria with requirements that each condition should affect the decision outcome independently. For example, consider the following code:
&lt;source lang=&quot;pascal&quot;&gt;
if (a or b) and c then
&lt;/source&gt;
The condition/decision criteria will be satisfied by the following set of tests:
* a=true, b=true, c=true
* a=false, b=false, c=false
However, the above tests set will not satisfy modified condition/decision coverage, since in the first test, the value of 'b' and in the second test the value of 'c' would not influence the output. So, the following test set is needed to satisfy MC/DC:
* a='''false''', b='''false''', c=true
* a='''true''',  b=false, c='''true'''
* a=false, b='''true''',  c='''true'''
* a=true,  b=true,  c='''false'''
The bold values influence the output, each variable must be present as an influencing value at least once with false and once with true.

=== Multiple condition coverage ===
This criteria requires that all combinations of conditions inside each decision are tested. For example, the code fragment from the previous section will require eight tests:
* a=false, b=false, c=false
* a=false, b=false, c=true
* a=false, b=true, c=false
* a=false, b=true, c=true
* a=true, b=false, c=false
* a=true, b=false, c=true
* a=true, b=true, c=false
* a=true, b=true, c=true

=== Other coverage criteria ===
There are further coverage criteria, which are used less often:
* '''Linear Code Sequence and Jump (LCSAJ) coverage''' - has every LCSAJ been executed?
* '''JJ-Path coverage''' - have all jump to jump paths &lt;ref name=&quot;On the relationship between two control-flow coverage criteria: all JJ-paths and MCDC&quot;&gt;M. R. Woodward, M. A. Hennell, &quot;On the relationship between two control-flow coverage criteria: all JJ-paths and MCDC&quot;, Information and Software Technology 48 (2006) pp. 433-440&lt;/ref&gt; (aka LCSAJs) been executed?
* '''Path coverage''' - Has every possible route through a given part of the code been executed?
* '''Entry/exit coverage''' - Has every possible call and return of the function been executed?
* '''Loop coverage''' - Has every possible loop been executed zero times, once, and more than once?

Safety-critical applications are often required to demonstrate that testing achieves 100% of some form of code coverage.

Some of the coverage criteria above are connected. For instance, path coverage implies decision, statement and entry/exit coverage. Decision coverage implies statement coverage, because every statement is part of a branch.

Full path coverage, of the type described above, is usually impractical or impossible. Any module with a succession of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; decisions in it can have up to &lt;math&gt;2^n&lt;/math&gt; paths within it; loop constructs can result in an infinite number of paths.  Many paths may also be infeasible, in that there is no input to the program under test that can cause that particular path to be executed.  However, a general-purpose algorithm for identifying infeasible paths has been proven to be impossible (such an algorithm could be used to solve the halting problem).&lt;ref&gt;Dorf, Richard C.: ''Computers, Software Engineering, and Digital Devices'', Chapter 12, pg. 15. CRC Press, 2006. ISBN 0849373409, 9780849373404; via [http://books.google.com/books?id=jykvlTCoksMC&amp;pg=PT386&amp;lpg=PT386&amp;dq=%22infeasible+path%22+%22halting+problem%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=WUWz3qMPRv&amp;sig=dSAjrLHBSZJcKWZfGa_IxYlfSNA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result Google Book Search]&lt;/ref&gt;  Methods for practical path coverage testing instead attempt to identify classes of code paths that differ only in the number of loop executions, and to achieve &quot;basis path&quot; coverage the tester must cover all the path classes.

==In practice==
The target software is built with special options or libraries and/or run under a special environment such that every function that is exercised (executed) in the program(s) is mapped back to the function points in the source code. This process allows developers and quality assurance personnel to look for parts of a system that are rarely or never accessed under normal conditions (error handling and the like) and helps reassure test engineers that the most important conditions (function points) have been tested.  The resulting output is then analyzed to see what areas of code have not been exercised and the tests are updated to include these areas as necessary.  Combined with other code coverage methods, the aim is to develop a rigorous, yet manageable, set of regression tests.

In implementing code coverage policies within a software development environment one must consider the following:

*  What are coverage requirements for the end product certification and if so what level of code coverage is required?  The typical level of rigor progression is as follows: Statement, Branch/Decision, Modified Condition/Decision Coverage(MC/DC), LCSAJ (Linear Code Sequence and Jump)
*  Will code coverage be measured against tests that verify requirements levied on the system under test (DO-178B)?
*  Is the object code generated directly traceable to source code statements?  Certain certifications, (ie. DO-178B Level A) require coverage at the assembly level if this is not the case: &quot;Then, additional verification should be performed on the object code to establish the correctness of such generated code sequences&quot; (DO-178B) para-6.4.4.2.&lt;ref name=&quot;DO-178B&quot;&gt;Software Considerations in Airborne System and Equipment Certification-RTCA/DO-178B, RTCA Inc., Washington D.C., December 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

Test engineers can look at code coverage test results to help them devise test cases and input or configuration sets that will increase the code coverage over vital functions. Two common forms of code coverage used by testers are statement (or line) coverage and path (or edge) coverage. Line coverage reports on the execution footprint of testing in terms of which lines of code were executed to complete the test. Edge coverage reports which branches or code decision points were executed to complete the test. They both report a coverage metric, measured as a percentage.  The meaning of this depends on what form(s) of code coverage have been used, as 67% path coverage is more comprehensive than 67% statement coverage.

Generally, code coverage tools and libraries exact a performance and/or memory or other resource cost which is unacceptable to normal operations of the software. Thus, they are only used in the lab. As one might expect, there are classes of software that cannot be feasibly subjected to these coverage tests, though a degree of coverage mapping can be approximated through analysis rather than direct testing.

There are also some sorts of defects which are affected by such tools. In particular, some race conditions or similar real time sensitive operations can be masked when run under code coverage environments; and conversely, some of these defects may become easier to find as a result of the additional overhead of the testing code.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Project management software''' is a term covering many types of software, including estimation and planning, scheduling, cost control and budget management, resource allocation, collaboration software, communication, quality management and documentation or administration systems, which are used to deal with the complexity of large projects.

==Tasks or activities of project management software==
===Scheduling===
One of the most common purposes is to schedule a series of events or tasks and the complexity of the schedule can vary considerably depending on how the tool is used. Some common challenges include:
* Events which depend on one another in different ways or dependencies
* Scheduling people to work on, and resources required by, the various tasks, commonly termed resource scheduling
* Dealing with uncertainties in the estimates of the duration of each task

===Providing information===
Project planning software can be expected to provide information to various people or stakeholders, and can be used to measure and justify the level of effort required to complete the project(s).  Typical requirements might include:
* Tasks lists for people, and allocation schedules for resources
* Overview information on how long tasks will take to complete
* Early warning of any risks to the project
* Information on workload, for planning holidays
* Evidence
* Historical information on how projects have progressed, and in particular, how actual and planned performance are related
* Optimum utilization of available resource

==Approaches to project management software==
===Desktop===
Project management software can be implemented as a program that runs on the desktop of each user.  This typically gives the most responsive and graphically-intense style of interface.

Desktop applications typically store their data in a file, although some have the ability to collaborate with other users (see below), or to store their data in a central database. Even a file-based project plan can be shared between users if it's on a networked drive and only one user accesses it at a time.

Desktop applications ''can'' be written to run in a heterogeneous environment of multiple operating systems, although it's unusual.

===Web-based===
Project management software can be implemented as a Web application, accessed through an intranet, or an extranet using a web browser.  

This has all the usual advantages and disadvantages of web applications:
* Can be accessed from any type of computer without installing software on user's computer
* Ease of access-control
* Naturally multi-user
* Only one software version and installation to maintain
* Centralized data repository
* Typically slower to respond than desktop applications
* Project information not available when the user (or server) is offline
* Some solutions allow the user to go offline with a copy of the data

===Personal===

A personal project management application is one used at home, typically to manage lifestyle or home projects.  There is considerable overlap with ''single user'' systems, although personal project management software typically involves simpler interfaces.  See also ''non-specialised tools'' below.

===Single user===
A single-user system is programmed with the assumption that only one person will ever need to edit the project plan at once.  This may be used in small companies, or ones where only a few people are involved in top-down project planning.  Desktop applications generally fall into this category.

===Collaborative===
A collaborative system is designed to support multiple users modifying different sections of the plan at once; for example, updating the areas they personally are responsible for such that those estimates get integrated into the overall plan.  Web-based tools, including extranets, generally fall into this category, but have the limitation that they can only be used when the user has live Internet access.  To address this limitation, some software tools using client–server architecture provide a rich client that runs on users' desktop computer and replicate project and task information to other project team members through a central server when users connect periodically to the network. Some tools allow team members to check out their schedules (and others' as read only) to work on them while not on the network.  When reconnecting to the database, all changes are synchronized with the other schedules.

===Integrated===
An integrated system combines project management or project planning, with many other aspects of company life.  For example, projects can have bug tracking issues assigned to each project, the list of project customers becomes a customer relationship management module, and each person on the project plan has their own task lists, calendars, and messaging functionality associated with their projects.

Similarly, specialised tools like SourceForge integrate project management software with source control (CVS) software and bug-tracking software, so that each piece of information can be integrated into the same system.

===Non-specialised tools===
While specialised software may be common, and heavily promoted by each vendor, there are a vast range of other software (and non-software) tools used to plan and schedule projects.
* Calendaring software can often handle scheduling as easily as dedicated software
* Spreadsheets are very versatile, and can be used to calculate things not anticipated by the designers.

==Criticisms of project management software==
The following may apply in general, or to specific products, or to some specific functions within products.

* May not be derived from a sound project management method.  For example, displaying the Gantt chart view by default encourages users to focus on timed task scheduling too early, rather than identifying objectives, deliverables and the imposed logical progress of events (dig the trench first to put in the drain pipe).
* May be inconsistent with the type of project management method.  For example, traditional (e.g. Waterfall) vs. agile (e.g. Scrum).
* Focuses primarily on the planning phase and does not offer enough functionality for project tracking, control and in particular plan-adjustment. There may be excessive dependency on the first paper print-out of a project plan, which is simply a snapshot at one moment in time. The plan is dynamic; as the project progresses the plan must change to accommodate tasks that are completed early, late, re-sequenced, etc. Good management software should not only facilitate this, but assist with impact assessment and communication of plan changes.
* Does not make a clear distinction between the planning phase and post planning phase, leading to user confusion and frustration when the software does not behave as expected. For example, shortening the duration of a task when an additional human resource is assigned to it while the project is still being planned.
* Offer complicated features to meet the needs of project management or project scheduling professionals, which must be understood in order to effectively use the product. Additional features may be so complicated as to be of no use to anyone. Complex task prioritization and resource leveling algorithms for example can produce results that make no intuitive sense, and overallocation is often more simply resolved manually.
* Some people may achieve better results using simpler technique, (e.g. pen and paper), yet feel pressured into using project management software by company policy ([http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=00008c&amp;topic_id=1&amp;topic= discussion]).
* Similar to PowerPoint, project management software might shield the manager from important interpersonal contact.
* New types of software are challenging the traditional definition of Project Management. Frequently, users of project management software are not actually managing a discrete project. For instance, managing the ongoing marketing for an already-released product is not a &quot;project&quot; in the traditional sense of the term; it does not involve management of discrete resources working on something with a discrete beginning/end. Groupware applications now add &quot;project management&quot; features that directly support this type of workflow-oriented project management. Classically-trained Project Managers may argue whether this is &quot;sound project management.&quot;  However, the end-users of such tools will refer to it as such, and the de-facto definition of the term Project Management may change.
* When there are multiple larger projects, project management software can be very useful. Nevertheless, one should probably not use management software if only a single small project is involved, as management software incurs a larger time-overhead than is worthwhile.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{mergeto | Software Development with Continuous Integration | We can make a much more comprehensive book on the subject }}

In software engineering, '''continuous integration'''  ('''CI''') implements ''continuous'' processes of applying quality control — small pieces of effort, applied frequently.  Continuous integration aims to improve the quality of software, and to reduce the time taken to deliver it, by replacing the traditional practice of applying quality control ''after'' completing all development.

==Theory==
When embarking on a change, a developer takes a copy of the current code base on which to work. As other developers submit changed code to the code repository, this copy gradually ceases to reflect the repository code. When developers submit code to the repository they must first update their code to reflect the changes in the repository since they took their copy. The more changes the repository contains, the more work developers must do before submitting their own changes.

Eventually, the repository may become so different from the developers' baselines that they enter what is sometimes called &quot;integration hell&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Cunningham, Integration Hell&quot; &gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
where the time it takes to integrate exceeds the time it took to make their original changes. In a worst-case scenario, developers may have to discard their changes and completely redo the work.

Continuous integration involves integrating early and often, so as to avoid the pitfalls of &quot;integration hell&quot;. The practice aims to reduce rework and thus reduce cost and time.

The rest of this article discusses best practice in how to achieve continuous integration, and how to automate this practice. Automation is a best practice itself.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brauneis, [OSLC] Possible new Working Group - Automation&quot; &gt;{{Cite mailing list

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recommended practices==
Continuous integration - as the practice of frequently integrating one's new or changed code with the existing code repository - should occur frequently enough that no intervening window remains between commit and build, and such that no errors can arise without developers noticing them and correcting them immediately.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fowler, Continuous Integration practices&quot; &gt;{{Cite web
  |url=http://martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html#PracticesOfContinuousIntegration
  |title=Continuous Integration
  |accessdate=2009-11-11
  |last=Fowler |first=Martin  |authorlink=Martin Fowler
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Normal practice is to trigger these builds by every commit to a repository, rather than a periodically scheduled build. The practicalities of doing this in a multi-developer environment of rapid commits are such that it's usual to trigger a short timer after each commit, then to start a build when either this timer expires, or after a rather longer interval since the last build. Automated tools such as CruiseControl or Hudson offer this scheduling automatically.

Another factor is the need for a version control system that supports atomic commits, i.e. all of a developer's changes may be seen as a single commit operation. There is no point in trying to build from only half of the changed files.

===Maintain a code repository===
This practice advocates the use of a revision control system for the project's source code.  All artifacts required to build the project should be placed in the repository. In this practice and in the revision control community, the convention is that the system should be buildable from a fresh checkout and not require additional dependencies.  Extreme Programming advocate Martin Fowler also mentions that where branching is supported by tools, its use should be minimised {{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}. Instead, it is preferred that changes are integrated rather than creating multiple versions of the software that are maintained simultaneously.  The mainline (or trunk) should be the place for the working version of the software.

===Automate the build===
A single command should have the capability of building the system.  Many build-tools, such as make, have existed for many years. Other more recent tools like Ant, Maven, MSBuild or IBM Rational Build Forge are frequently used in continuous integration environments.  Automation of the build should include automating the integration, which often includes deployment into a production-like environment. In many cases, the build script not only compiles binaries, but also generates documentation, website pages, statistics and distribution media (such as Windows MSI files, RPM or DEB files).

===Make the build self-testing===
Once the code is built, all tests should run to confirm that it behaves as the developers expect it to behave.

===Everyone commits to the baseline every day===
By committing regularly, every committer can reduce the number of conflicting changes.  Checking in a week's worth of work runs the risk of conflicting with other features and can be very difficult to resolve.  Early, small conflicts in an area of the system cause team members to communicate about the change they are making.

Many programmers recommend committing all changes at least once a day (once per feature built), and in addition performing a nightly build.

===Every commit (to baseline) should be built===
The system should build commits to the current working version in order to verify that they integrate correctly.  A common practice is to use Automated Continuous Integration, although this may be done manually. For many, continuous integration is synonymous with using Automated Continuous Integration where a continuous integration server or daemon monitors the version control system for changes, then automatically runs the build process.

===Keep the build fast===
The build needs to complete rapidly, so that if there is a problem with integration, it is quickly identified.

===Test in a clone of the production environment===
Having a test environment can lead to failures in tested systems when they deploy in the production environment, because the production environment may differ from the test environment in a significant way.  However, building a replica of a production environment is cost prohibitive.  Instead, the pre-production environment should be built to be a scalable version of the actual production environment to both alleviate costs while maintaining technology stack composition and nuances.

===Make it easy to get the latest deliverables===
Making builds readily available to stakeholders and testers can reduce the amount of rework necessary when rebuilding a feature that doesn't meet requirements. Additionally, early testing reduces the chances that defects survive until deployment. Finding errors earlier also, in some cases, reduces the amount of work necessary to resolve them.

===Everyone can see the results of the latest build===
It should be easy to find out where/whether the build breaks and who made the relevant change.

===Automate deployment===
Most CI systems allow the running of scripts after a build finishes.  In most situations, it is possible to write a script to deploy the application to a live test server that everyone can look at. A further advance in this way of thinking is Continuous Deployment, which calls for the software to be deployed directly into production, often with additional automation to prevent defects or regressions&lt;ref&gt;See http://radar.oreilly.com/2009/03/continuous-deployment-5-eas.html and http://timothyfitz.wordpress.com/2009/02/10/continuous-deployment-at-imvu-doing-the-impossible-fifty-times-a-day/&lt;/ref&gt;.

==History==
Continuous Integration emerged in the Extreme Programming (XP) community, and XP advocates Martin Fowler and Kent Beck first wrote about continuous integration circa 1999. Fowler's paper&lt;ref name=&quot;Fowler, Continuous Integration&quot; &gt;{{Cite web
  |last=Fowler |first=Martin  |authorlink=Martin Fowler
  |url=http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html
  |title=Continuous Integration
  |ref=Fowler, Continuous Integration
}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a popular source of information on the subject. Beck's book ''Extreme Programming Explained''&lt;ref name=&quot;Beck, Extreme Programming Explained&quot; &gt;{{Cite book
  |title=Extreme Programming Explained
  |last=Beck  |first=Kent  |authorlink=Kent Beck
  |year=1999

  |ref=Beck, Extreme Programming Explained
}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the original reference for Extreme Programming, also describes the term.

==Advantages and disadvantages==
=== Advantages ===
Continuous integration has many advantages:

* when unit tests fail or a bug emerges, developers might revert the codebase back to a bug-free state, without wasting time debugging
* developers detect and fix integration problems continuously - avoiding last-minute chaos at release dates, (when everyone tries to check in their slightly incompatible versions).
* early warning of broken/incompatible code
* early warning of conflicting changes
* immediate unit testing of all changes
* constant availability of a &quot;current&quot; build for testing, demo, or release purposes
* immediate feedback to developers on the quality, functionality, or system-wide impact of code they are writing
* frequent code check-in pushes developers to create modular, less complex code{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}
* metrics generated from automated testing and CI (such as metrics for code coverage, code complexity, and features complete) focus developers on developing functional, quality code, and help develop momentum in a team{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

===Disadvantages===
* initial setup time required
* well-developed test-suite required to achieve automated testing advantages
* large-scale refactoring can be troublesome due to continuously changing code base
* hardware costs for build machines can be significant

Many teams using CI report that the advantages of CI well outweigh the disadvantages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
The effect of finding and fixing integration bugs early in the development process saves both time and money over the lifespan of a project.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''bug tracking system''' is a software application that is designed to help quality assurance and programmers keep track of reported software bugs in their work. It may be regarded as a type of issue tracking system.

Many bug-tracking systems, such as those used by most open source software projects, allow users to enter bug reports directly. Other systems are used only internally in a company or organization doing software development. Typically bug tracking systems are integrated with other software project management applications. 

Having a bug tracking system is extremely valuable in software development, and they are used extensively by companies developing software products.  Consistent use of a bug or issue tracking system is considered one of the &quot;hallmarks of a good software team&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000029.html |title=Painless Bug Tracking|author=Joel Spolsky|accessdate=29 October 2010|date=November 08 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Components ==

A major component of a bug tracking system is a database that records facts about known bugs. Facts may include the time a bug was reported, its severity, the erroneous program behavior, and details on how to reproduce the bug; as well as the identity of the person who reported it and any programmers who may be working on fixing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://docforge.com/wiki/Bug_report | title=Bug report | author=Multiple (wiki) | work=Docforge | accessdate=2010-03-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typical bug tracking systems support the concept of the life cycle for a bug which is tracked through status assigned to the bug. A bug tracking system should allow administrators to configure permissions based on status, move the bug to another status, or delete the bug. The system should also allow administrators to configure the bug statuses and to what status a bug in a particular status can be moved. Some systems will e-mail interested parties, such as the submitter and assigned programmers, when new records are added or the status changes.

== Usage ==

The main benefit of a bug-tracking system is to provide a clear centralized overview of development requests (including both bugs and improvements, the boundary is often fuzzy), and their state. The prioritized list of pending items (often called backlog) provides valuable input when defining the product roadmap, or maybe just &quot;the next release&quot;.

In a corporate environment, a bug-tracking system may be used to generate reports on the productivity of programmers at fixing bugs. However, this may sometimes yield inaccurate results because different bugs may have different levels of severity and complexity. The severity of a bug may not be directly related to the complexity of fixing the bug. There may be different opinions among the managers and architects.

A ''local bug tracker (LBT)'' is usually a computer program used by a team of application support professionals (often a help desk) to keep track of issues communicated to software developers. Using an LBT allows support professionals to track bugs in their &quot;own language&quot; and not the &quot;language of the developers.&quot; In addition, a LBT allows a team of support professionals to track specific information about users who have called to complain &amp;mdash; this information may not always be needed in the actual development queue. Thus, there are two tracking systems when an LBT is in place.

== Bug tracking systems as a part of integrated project management systems ==
Bug and issue tracking systems are often implemented as a part of integrated project management systems.
This approach allows including bug tracking and fixing in a general product development process, fixing bugs in several product versions, automatic generation of a product knowledge base and release notes.

== Distributed bug tracking ==

Some bug trackers are designed to be used with distributed revision control software. These distributed bug trackers allow bug reports to be conveniently read, added to the database or updated while a developer is offline.&lt;ref name='lwn-distributed'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lwn.net/Articles/281849/ |title=Distributed bug tracking|author=Jonathan Corbet|accessdate=7 January 2009|work=LWN.net|date=May 14 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Distributed bug trackers include Bugs Everywhere, and Fossil.

Recently, commercial bug tracking systems have also begun to integrate with distributed version control.  FogBugz, for example, enables this functionality via the source-control tool, Kiln.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fogcreek.com/FogBugz/learnmore.html | title=FogBugz Features | | work=Fogbugz.com | accessdate=2010-10-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although wikis and bug tracking systems are conventionally viewed as distinct types of software, ikiwiki can also be used as a distributed bug tracker. It can manage documents and code as well, in an integrated distributed manner. However, its query functionality is not as advanced or as user-friendly as some other, non-distributed bug trackers such as Bugzilla.&lt;ref name='ikiwiki'&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.linuxworld.com/news/2007/040607-integrated-issue-tracking-ikiwiki.html |title=Integrated issue tracking with Ikiwiki |accessdate=7 January 2009 |author=Joey Hess|work=LinuxWorld.com |publisher=IDG|date=6 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar statements can be made about org-mode, although it is not wiki software as such.

==Bug tracking and test management==
While traditional test management tools such as HP Quality Center and Rational Software come with their own bug tracking systems. Other tools integrate with popular bug tracking systems.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011|reason=Is it &quot;traditional&quot; or is it &quot;proprietary&quot; vs. Open Source?}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Destructors should not throw exceptions ==

While it's particularly important in RAII, it's a general rule that destructors should not throw exceptions (since apart from anything else, even non-RAII types get their destructors called when exiting a scope due to an active exception, and throwing an exception at this point will be fatal). At the moment the text implies that this is a special case, which I think should be changed. --[[User:Fishpi|Fishpi]] ([[User talk:Fishpi|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Fishpi|contribs]]) 18:44, 18 February 2011 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Circuit Configuration==
:[[File:RL_Series_Open-Closed.svg|100px]]

==Formula==
The total Impedance of the circuit
:&lt;math&gt;Z = Z_R + Z_L&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Z = R + j\omega L&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Z = \frac{1}{R} (1 + j\omega T)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;T = \frac{L}{R}&lt;/math&gt;

The Differential equation of the circuit at equilibrium
:&lt;math&gt;L \frac{di}{dt} + \frac{1}{C} \int i dt = 0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2i}{dt^2} + \frac{1}{LC} = 0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;s^2 + \frac{1}{LC} = 0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;s = \pm j \sqrt{\frac{1}{LC}} t&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;s = \pm j \omega t&lt;/math&gt;

The Natural Response of the circuit
:&lt;math&gt;i = A Sin \omega t&lt;/math&gt;

The Resonance Response of the circuit
:&lt;math&gt;Z_L - Z_C = 0 &lt;/math&gt; . &lt;math&gt;Z_L = Z_C &lt;/math&gt; . &lt;math&gt;\omega L = \frac{1}{\omega C}&lt;/math&gt; . &lt;math&gt;\omega  = \sqrt{\frac{1}{LC}}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;V_L + V_C = 0 &lt;/math&gt; . &lt;math&gt;V_C = -V_L&lt;/math&gt;

==Summary==
Series LC can be characterised by

2nd order Differential Equation
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2i}{dt^2} + \frac{1}{T} = 0&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;T = LC&lt;/math&gt;

With Natural Response of a Wave function
: &lt;math&gt;i = A Sin \omega t&lt;/math&gt;

With Resonance Response of a Standing Wave function
: &lt;math&gt;i = A Sin \omega t&lt;/math&gt;

=== Usage ===
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
{{preload
|1 = 
|2 = 
|3 = 
}}
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
Use this template to provide a link to an automatically '''preloaded''' specific page.  The first parameter is the only required one, and is the title of the page you want to create.  You must provide the full name of the target page, including [[WB:NS|namespace]].  The second input allows you to customize what text the link displays.  If a third parameter is provided, the target page will contain the contents of that third parameter (again, full title including namespace is required).  This only works if the page doesn't already exist.  Thus,

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{preload|1=Special:MyPage/preloadtest|2=This is a test|3=Template:Preload/example}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

Produces:

{{Preload|1=Special:MyPage/preloadtest|2=This is a test|3=Template:Preload/example}}

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;

This is the {{tl|editnotice talkpagename}} meta-template.

It returns the full pagename for the discussion page of the editnotice for the current page. 

Note that this template doesn't produce the editnotice page name for discussion pages, instead it produces the discussion page name for the editnotice.

If you need the editnotice page name itself, then use {{tl|editnotice pagename}} instead.

Note that the main editnotices for a user page and a user discussion page do not have a discussion page, so it will not work there.

=== Usage ===
This template takes no parameters and automatically outputs a proper formatted editnotice discussion page address. Like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{editnotice talkpagename}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Which outputs the discussion page name of the editnotice for this page itself:

:{{editnotice talkpagename}}

This can for instance be used to produce a link to the discussion page of the editnotice for the current page. Like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
[[{{editnotice talkpagename}}]]
&lt;/pre&gt;

:[[{{editnotice talkpagename}}]]

* {{tl|editnotice pagename}} – Returns the full pagename for the editnotice for the current page.

=== Usage ===
This template provides an easy way to link to a page without following a redirect.

&lt;pre&gt;{{no redirect|page name|label}}&lt;/pre&gt;

It accepts two unnamed parameters:
* 1= (required) the name of the page to link.
* 2= (optional) the text to be displayed. If this is omitted then the input of the first parameter is used.

This is the {{tl|editnotice explanation}} template.

It can be placed at the top of talk pages of [[Help:Editnotices|editnotices]]. 

This template takes one optional parameter, which is the CSS class/id name of the editnotice, if one has been set (typically via the &quot;id&quot; and &quot;class&quot; parameters of {{tl|fmbox}}).

* Example: &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{editnotice explanation}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;
* Example: &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{editnotice explanation|idname}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== British spelling ==

I undid the change that Americanised the spelling (organisation -&gt; organization). Obviously we need to be consistent within the book, and I haven't taken the time to find out what the current pattern is. But for a book about the EU, I vote to stick with the European and not the American spelling. --[[User:Fishpi|Fishpi]] ([[User talk:Fishpi|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Fishpi|contribs]]) 08:09, 19 February 2011 (UTC)

:Yes, that is how it is supposed to be, if we take the same conventions that Wikipedia does (and I do, using a notice template that reiterates the same thing).  European topics would get British spellings. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|discuss]]&lt;/small&gt; 13:38, 19 February 2011 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Strings ==
Let's make variable with string as value, we will use string literal. Strings can be enclosed in double and single quotes but I advise using double quotes because in most laguages strings enclosed in double quotes and chars in single quotes.
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
str = &quot;Hello, &quot;;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Concatenation ===
We can concatenate strings using '+' operator. Let's add to string in variable 'a' string &quot;world&quot;.
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
str = str + &quot;world!&quot;; // Hello, world!
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Length of string ===
Any string variable have 'length' property that containg number of chars in string.
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
str.length; // 13
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Split ===
String.split([separator]) - returns array of substrings that was obtained by separate '''String''' by '''separator'''. If '''separator''' not defined then '''separator''' = &quot;,&quot;
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
names = &quot;Artem,Michail,Nicholas,Alexander&quot;;
listOfNames = names.split(','); //Split string to list of strings
twoNames = names.split(',',2); //Split with limit
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Getting substrings and char ===
We can get substring from string using functions substr(index,len) and substring(indexA,indexB). First return substring from 'index' with length equal to len. Second return substring from indexA to indexB.
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
a = &quot;Hello world!&quot;;
first = a.substr(0,5); //Hello
second = a.substring(6,11); // world
&lt;/source&gt;
We can also get a char at some position using charAt function.
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
a = &quot;Hello world!&quot;;
b = a.charAt(2); //e
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Position of substring ===
We can also get a position of some substring in string using indexOf and lastIndexOf functions. Both functions give two arguments but only first required it's a string that function search and second argument it's position from that function search string. indexOf return first position of substring and lastIndexOf return las position of substring. If substring not found both functions return -1
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
a = &quot;Hello world&quot;;
b = a.indexOf('o',5); // 7
c = a.lastIndexOf('l'); // 9
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Sourdough Starter, How should it smell?

Can anyone who has worked with beginning a &quot;Sourdough Bread Starter,&quot; tell us how it should smell?
Our current 2-day-old-starter has a strong Romano cheese odor? Should this be considered as normal or should it be discarded and restarted? 
Please any information on this topic would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you,
g

== Rather wet starter ==

In the &quot;Method&quot; paragraph it is written &quot;1/2 tablespoon to 3 tablespooons of water&quot; to start the starter.

You try mixing half a tablespoon of flour with 3 tablespoons of water and you'll get a fluid that looks much like non-fat milk.

Are you sure about this half a tablespoon of flour to 3 tablespoons of water ratio - to begin the starter?  The results (according to your instructions) seems rather &quot;wet&quot; for a starter.

:It's probably an advanced technique that uses a higher hydration during the motherdough stage, or possibly only during the first three days before the culture has stabilized. I haven't analyzed it, therefore the weasel word, &quot;probably&quot;. Are you perhaps suggesting that a more simplistic approach, or perhaps a second technique that uses a stiffer initial hydration, would be useful and an improvement to the cookbook:sourdough (article) page?

== Interesting but needs help ==
The unnecessary complexity of the text makes it hard to fallow for one that is for the first time looking into the subject. Some information of historical reference should be reduced as much of the unnecessary contextualization (for the purpose of the Cookbook).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 19:32, 12 April 2012 (UTC)
:You're free to delete at will. I'm burned out for now, and have many other tasks which I'm now prioritizing higher. Thank you. Besides some poor grammar that I wrote, There are also some subjects that are not yet covered well in the article, such as temperature, how it relates to organisms' generation times, and even pH.  Creating spontaneous sourdough starter is not a simplistic subject, and I didn't create that section (whatever it's title was before) ... let me make a metaphor! To treat creating spontaneous sour as simplistic is much like asking a kindergärtner to watch the panic button, but not to touch it. If I purchased a cookbook and it didn't cover those subjects, I'd want my money back right now!

:: Delete no, I was only remarking that the prose should be improved. I have not the knowledge to contribute to it meaningfully. My interest in this is simply as an observer that sees this type of basic knowledge that is important to our civilizational structure being lost. That as is it seems only accessible to one that already has knowledge on the subject. I full agree with you that this type of knowledge has structural importance and is often relegated to the use of &quot;black boxed&quot; solutions, mostly demonstrating the lack of knowledge or a commercial interest.   --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 23:44, 12 April 2012 (UTC)

:::Thank you for your feedback and constructive critique. I will try to return in a month, maybe two, and revisit the prose. Self editing is also difficult, and I find dismissing it from the mind for a longish time, followed by returning, helps. Maybe someone else will come by and do some editing in the meantime.

== Intro ==
In the intro when explaining why locality alters cultures, it may be interesting to add why. I'm guessing that temperature, humidity, weather and atmospheric pressure, even altitude and variations of sun light/darkness could be factors for the cultures to diverge.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 03:29, 17 April 2012 (UTC)

The rising and taste in the intro is in relation to the &quot;raw&quot; sourdough starter right? As it ferments it rises, but is the taste important at this time (I ask because it is given importance). When backed the taste will undoubtedly change, even if characteristic is the initial taste so important/noticeable in the final product? For instance in relation to the backing process or what is added to the mixture ?&lt;br&gt;
Can it be said that as it ferments (rises) the cultures enter a state of symbiosis or equilibrium/balance and that is why it is preferred to start with culture that has not only already reached that state but has proven viable in its function ?&lt;br&gt;
Thanks for the work...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 03:43, 17 April 2012 (UTC)</text>

=== Usage ===
* This template provides the [[Help:Editnotices|editnotice]] for all [[Subject:Books by subject|subject]] pages.

=== Hiding the message ===
This template is marked with the CSS id &lt;tt&gt;&quot;subject-namespace-editnotice&quot;&lt;/tt&gt;, so that editors can apply their own CSS customization if they wish, in particular to hide it. To hide the message, add

:&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;#subject-namespace-editnotice{display:none;}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;

into [[Special:MyPage/skin.css]], which redirects to your current skin's CSS file (open in new tab/window to see).
&lt;includeonly&gt;
&lt;!-- CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS HERE, THANKS --&gt;

* '''Contacting''' the photographer or uploader (use the relevant user discussion page)
* '''Requesting corrections''' to the image (try the discussion page of a book that the image is used in.)
* '''Requesting deletion''' of the image (check [[WB:CSD|speedy deletion criteria]] to see if there is a suitable tag to place on the &lt;tt&gt;File:&lt;/tt&gt; page; or failing that go to [[Wikibooks:Requests for deletion|Requests for Deletion]]).
* '''Asking''' about the copyright status of the image; the [[WB:AA|administrative assistance reading room]] is a more widely-viewed location.

I've never heard of this idiom, and I can't find any information about it on the web (the only relevant hits on Google lead back here). Does it have another name?

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Claude Hopkins==
'''Claude Hopkins''' (1866-1932) was a pioneer who wrote the groundbreaking book ''Scientific Advertising''. He developed the concept of &quot;reason why&quot; advertising. He first cut his teeth designing ads for the Bissell Carpet Sweeper Company.
==Helen Lansdowne==
'''Helen Lansdowne''' (1886-1964) was a famous copywriter known for her work for Woodbury's Facial Soaps and Pond's Cold Cream. She was the first woman to present ads to the board of Procter &amp; Gamble.
==Raymond Rubicam==
Raymond Rubicam was the co-founder of prodigious ad firm Young &amp; Rubicam. He managed to get pollster George Gallup to join Y&amp;R, where he formed the first advertising research department.
==Rosser Reeves== 
'''Rosser Reeves''' (10 September 1910–24 January 1984) 
Was a hugely successful American advertising executive and pioneer of television advertising. He believed the purpose of advertising is to sell. He insisted that an advertisement or commercial should show off the value of a product, not the cleverness of a copywriter. His most typical ad is probably that for Anacin, a headache medicine. The ad was considered grating and annoying by almost all viewers but it was remarkably successful, tripling the product's sales. In 7 years the 59-second commercial made more money than the movie Gone With The Wind had in a quarter-century.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Advertisers refer to the standard communications model of a ''source'' transmitting a ''message'' through a ''channel'' (which contains a degree of ''noise'') to a ''target''. ''Feedback'' is received by the source in response to the message. Good feedback typically comes in the form of money spent on the product advertised.

'''Customer Relations Management (CRM)''' is concerned with (among other things) the '''conversion rate''': percentage of customers who &quot;try and buy&quot; the product.

There are three types of appeals in advertising: logical, ethical, and emotional.

[[Image:Marcom matrix.png|right|thumb|300px|The MarCom Matrix.]]
Advertising is just one way to spend your marketing dollar. There are a variety of ways to promote a product, collectively called Marketing Communications (MarCom). They are illustrated by the MarCom Matrix.

'''Marketing Public Relations''' (MPR) is an attractive alternative to advertising. MPR uses public relations techniques as part of a marketing campaign. PR tools used by marketers include newsletters, events, endorsements, demonstrations, contests, and interviews.

There are two main types of promotion: '''trade promotion''' and '''consumer promotion'''. The differences in ad strategies are characterized as &quot;push&quot; and &quot;pull&quot;: trade promotions are designed to ''push'' the product (into the market), and consumer promotions are made to ''pull'' the product (into the shopping cart).

==Promotions==
The three types of promotions are '''Win''', '''Free''', and '''Save'''.
===Win===
Examples of &quot;win&quot;-type promotions are games and contests. Sweepstakes are probably the most popular &quot;win&quot; promotion. According to US law, purchase cannot be necessary to win a sweepstakes. If purchase were necessary, that would make it a lottery; and lotteries can only be conducted by the state.
===Free===
A &quot;free&quot;-type promotion offers the consumer something for no charge. These are '''premiums''' (buy one product, get another for a discount, or for free), '''bonus packs''' (&quot;more for less&quot;), and '''sampling''' (free samples). A '''continuity program''' is a free-type promotion that makes the consumer part of a &quot;club&quot;. An example of this are coffee shops that give their customers a card that is punched or stamped each time they buy coffee; after a certain number of purchases are made, they are given a free coffee.
===Save===
Examples of &quot;save&quot; promotions are coupons, rebates, and other money-saving ads. Another is the FSI (Free-Standing Insert), a sheet of coupons typically inserted into newspapers.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==The Oscillation up and down of a Spring==
:[[File:Simple_harmonic_oscillator.gif|100px]]]]
When apply a force on an object of mass attach to a spring . The spring will move a distance y above and below the equilibrium point and this movement keeps on repeating itself for a period of time . The movement up and down of spring for a period of time is called Oscillation

===1===
The force acts on the object to pull the object down
: F = m a

The Restoring Force of spring to push the object up can be calculated by Hook's Law
: F&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; = - k y

The oscillation stops when 
: F&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; = - F&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;
: m a = - k y
: y = &lt;math&gt;\frac{m a}{k}&lt;/math&gt;
: a = - &lt;math&gt;\frac{k}{m} y&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;t = \frac{k}{m} \frac{y}{v}&lt;/math&gt;

===2===
Any force acting on an object can be expressed in a differential equation
: &lt;math&gt;F = m \frac{d^2y}{dt^2}&lt;/math&gt;

Equilibrium is reached when 
: F&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; = - F&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;F = m \frac{d^2y}{dt^2} = - k y&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;F = \frac{d^2y}{dt^2} + \frac{k}{m} y = 0&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;s^2 + \frac{k}{m} s = 0&lt;/math&gt;
: s = ± j &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} t &lt;/math&gt;
: s = ± j &lt;math&gt;\omega t &lt;/math&gt;
: s =  &lt;math&gt;e^ j\omega t +  e^ -j\omega t&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;y = A Sin \omega t&lt;/math&gt;

      <comment>Self-explanatory.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Simple Regular Expression''' syntax is widely used on Unix based systems for the purposes of backwards compatibility. Most regular-expression-aware Unix utilities, such as ''grep'' and ''sed'', use it by default while providing support for extended regular expressions with command line arguments (see below). This syntax is deprecated on POSIX compliant systems and should not be used by new utilities.

When simple regular expression syntax is being used, most characters, except metacharacters are treated as literal characters and match only themselves (for example, &quot;a&quot; matches &quot;a&quot;, &quot;(bc&quot; matches &quot;(bc&quot;, etc).

{| valign=&quot;top&quot; class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|+ Operators
! Operator
! Effect
|-
|'''.'''
|The dot operator matches any single character.
|- valign=&quot;top&quot;
|[ ]
| boxes enable a single character to be matched against character lists or character ranges.
|- valign=&quot;top&quot;
|[^ ]
|A compliment box enables a single character not within in a character list or character range to be matched.
|- valign=&quot;top&quot;
|^
| A caret anchor matches the start of the line (or any line, when applied in multiline mode)
|- valign=&quot;top&quot;
|$
|A dollar anchor matches the end of the line (or any line, when applied in multiline mode)
|- valign=&quot;top&quot;
|( )
| parentheses are used to define a marked subexpression. The matched text section can be recalled at a later time.
|- valign=&quot;top&quot;
|\''n''
|Where ''n'' is a digit from 1 to 9; matches what the ''n''th marked subexpression matched.  This irregular construct has not been adopted in the extended regular expression syntax.
|- valign=&quot;top&quot;
|*
|A single character expression followed by &quot;*&quot; matches zero or more copies of the expression. For example, &quot;ab*c&quot; matches &quot;ac&quot;, &quot;abc&quot;, &quot;abbbc&quot; etc. &quot;[xyz]*&quot; matches &quot;&quot;, &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, &quot;zx&quot;, &quot;zyx&quot;, and so on.
*\''n''*, where ''n'' is a digit from 1 to 9, matches zero or more iterations of what the ''n''th marked subexpression matched.  For example, &quot;(a.)c\1*&quot; matches &quot;abcab&quot; and &quot;abcabab&quot; but not &quot;abcac&quot;.
*An expression enclosed in &quot;\(&quot; and &quot;\)&quot; followed by &quot;*&quot; is deemed to be invalid. In some cases (e.g. /usr/bin/xpg4/grep of SunOS 5.8), it matches zero or more iterations of the string that the enclosed expression matches.  In other cases (e.g. /usr/bin/grep of SunOS 5.8), it matches what the enclosed expression matches, followed by a literal &quot;*&quot;.
|}

== Examples ==
Examples:
* &quot;^[hc]at&quot;
** Matches ''hat'' and ''cat'' but only at the beginning of a line.
* &quot;[hc]at$&quot;
** Matches ''hat'' and ''cat'' but only at the end of a line.

==Use in Tools==

Tools and languages that utilize this regular expression syntax include:

* [[Grep]]
* [[sed]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''POSIX Basic Regular Expression''' syntax provided extensions to achieve consistency between utility programs such as grep, sed and awk. These extensions are not supported by some traditional implementations of Unix tools.

=== History ===

Traditional Unix regular expression syntax followed common conventions that often differed from tool to tool. The POSIX Basic Regular Expressions syntax was developed by the IEEE, together with an extended variant called [[ERE| Extended Regular Expression]] syntax. These standards were designed mostly to provide backward compatibility with the traditional [[../Simple Regular Expressions/]] syntax, providing a common standard which has since been adopted as the default syntax of many Unix regular expression tools.

=== Syntax ===

In POSIX Basic Regular Expression syntax, most characters are treated as literals — they match only themselves (e.g., &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; matches &quot;''a''&quot;). The exceptions, listed below, are called ''metacharacters'' or ''metasequences''.

|Matches any single character (many applications exclude newlines, and exactly which characters are considered newlines is flavor, character encoding, and platform specific, but it is safe to assume that the line feed character is included). Within POSIX bracket expressions, the dot character matches a literal dot. For example, &lt;code&gt;a.c&lt;/code&gt; matches &quot;''abc''&quot;, etc., but &lt;code&gt;[a.c]&lt;/code&gt; matches only &quot;''a''&quot;, &quot;''.''&quot;, or &quot;''c''&quot;.
|- valign=&quot;top&quot;
|&lt;code&gt;[&amp;nbsp;]&lt;/code&gt;
|A bracket expression. Matches a single character that is contained within the brackets. For example, &lt;code&gt;[abc]&lt;/code&gt; matches &quot;''a''&quot;, &quot;''b''&quot;, or &quot;''c''&quot;. &lt;code&gt;[a-z]&lt;/code&gt; specifies a range which matches any lowercase letter from &quot;''a''&quot; to &quot;''z''&quot;. These forms can be mixed: &lt;code&gt;[abcx-z]&lt;/code&gt; matches &quot;''a''&quot;, &quot;''b''&quot;, &quot;''c''&quot;, &quot;''x''&quot;, &quot;''y''&quot;, or &quot;''z''&quot;, as does &lt;code&gt;[a-cx-z]&lt;/code&gt;.
The &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt; character is treated as a literal character if it is the last or the first (after the &lt;code&gt;^&lt;/code&gt;) character within the brackets: &lt;code&gt;[abc-]&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;[-abc]&lt;/code&gt;.  Note that backslash escapes are not allowed.  The &lt;code&gt;]&lt;/code&gt; character can be included in a bracket expression if it is the first (after the &lt;code&gt;^&lt;/code&gt;) character: &lt;code&gt;[]abc]&lt;/code&gt;.
|- valign=&quot;top&quot;
|&lt;code&gt;[^&amp;nbsp;]&lt;/code&gt;
|Matches a single character that is not contained within the brackets. For example, &lt;code&gt;[^abc]&lt;/code&gt; matches any character other than &quot;''a''&quot;, &quot;''b''&quot;, or &quot;''c''&quot;. &lt;code&gt;[^a-z]&lt;/code&gt; matches any single character that is not a lowercase letter from &quot;''a''&quot; to &quot;''z''&quot;. As above, literal characters and ranges can be mixed.
|- valign=&quot;top&quot;
|&lt;code&gt;^&lt;/code&gt;
|Matches the starting position within the string. In line-based tools, it matches the starting position of any line.
|- valign=&quot;top&quot;
|&lt;code&gt;$&lt;/code&gt;
|Matches the ending position of the string or the position just before a string-ending newline. In line-based tools, it matches the ending position of any line.
|- valign=&quot;top&quot;
|{{nowrap|BRE: &lt;code&gt;\(&amp;nbsp;\)&lt;/code&gt;}}&lt;br /&gt;{{nowrap|ERE: &lt;code&gt;(&amp;nbsp;)&lt;/code&gt;}}
|Defines a marked subexpression. The string matched within the parentheses can be recalled later (see the next entry, &lt;code&gt;\''n''&lt;/code&gt;).  A marked subexpression is also called a block or capturing group.
|- valign=&quot;top&quot;
|&lt;code&gt;\''n''&lt;/code&gt;
|Matches what the ''n''th marked subexpression matched, where ''n'' is a digit from 1 to 9. This construct is theoretically '''irregular''' and was not adopted in the POSIX ERE syntax. Some tools allow referencing more than nine capturing groups.
|- valign=&quot;top&quot;
|&lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt;
|Matches the preceding element zero or more times. For example, &lt;code&gt;ab*c&lt;/code&gt; matches &quot;''ac''&quot;, &quot;''abc''&quot;, &quot;''abbbc''&quot;, etc. &lt;code&gt;[xyz]*&lt;/code&gt; matches &quot;&quot;, &quot;''x''&quot;, &quot;''y''&quot;, &quot;''z''&quot;, &quot;''zx''&quot;, &quot;''zyx''&quot;, &quot;''xyzzy''&quot;, and so on. &lt;code&gt;\(ab\)*&lt;/code&gt; matches &quot;&quot;, &quot;''ab''&quot;, &quot;''abab''&quot;, &quot;''ababab''&quot;, and so on.
|- valign=&quot;top&quot;
|{{nowrap|BRE: &lt;code&gt;\{''m'',''n''\}&lt;/code&gt;}}&lt;br /&gt;{{nowrap|ERE: &lt;code&gt;{''m'',''n''}&lt;/code&gt;}}
|Matches the preceding element at least ''m'' and not more than ''n'' times. For example, &lt;code&gt;a\{3,5\}&lt;/code&gt; matches only &quot;''aaa''&quot;, &quot;''aaaa''&quot;, and &quot;''aaaaa''&quot;. This is not found in a few older instances of regular expressions.
|-
|}

'''Examples:'''
*&lt;code&gt;.at&lt;/code&gt; matches any three-character string ending with &quot;at&quot;, including &quot;''hat''&quot;, &quot;''cat''&quot;, and &quot;''bat''&quot;.
*&lt;code&gt;[hc]at&lt;/code&gt; matches &quot;''hat''&quot; and &quot;''cat''&quot;.
*&lt;code&gt;[^b]at&lt;/code&gt; matches all strings matched by &lt;code&gt;.at&lt;/code&gt; except &quot;''bat''&quot;.
*&lt;code&gt;^[hc]at&lt;/code&gt; matches &quot;''hat''&quot; and &quot;''cat''&quot;, but only at the beginning of the string or line.
*&lt;code&gt;[hc]at$&lt;/code&gt; matches &quot;''hat''&quot; and &quot;''cat''&quot;, but only at the end of the string or line.
*&lt;code&gt;\[.\]&lt;/code&gt; matches any single character surrounded by &quot;[&quot; and &quot;]&quot; since the brackets are escaped, for example: &quot;''[a]''&quot; and &quot;''[b]''&quot;.

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;
{{tl|{{lcfirst:{{BASEPAGENAME}}}}}} &amp;mdash; An information box that indicates that the user is a bot.

== Parameters ==
; 1 : The first unnamed parameter specifies the operator of the bot.
; 2, 3 : The second and third unnamed parameters can be used to specify co-operators of the bot, if required.
; site : The two letter code for those operators that do not have an account on the English language Wikibooks (though having a local account is strongly recommended).
; status : ''active'' (without flag), ''approved'' (with flag), ''inactive'' (but approved), ''trial'', ''unapproved'', or ''globalbot''
; awb : ''yes'' (if this bot uses [[w:Wikipedia:AWB|AWB]]), or omit (if it doesn't).
; codebase: The name of the code (programming or scripting language) used to create the bot (e.g., [[pywikibot|pyWikibot]], [[perlwikibot|perlWikibot]], ...)

'''Cashew Gravy'''

This [[Cookbook:Gravy|gravy]] is a thick cashew-based gravy that tastes great on vegetables--maybe it's more of a sauce than a gravy. I wouldn't put it on potatoes, although brown rice is good.

==Ingredients==

*&amp;frac12; thinly sliced [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]]
*&amp;frac12; thinly sliced [[Cookbook:Bell Pepper|bell pepper]]
*2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|T]] [[Cookbook:Peanut Oil|peanut oil]]
*[[Cookbook:Salt|Salt]] to taste
*[[Cookbook:Pepper|Pepper]] to taste
*2 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|t]] [[Cookbook:White Wine|white wine]]
*1&amp;frac12; [[Cookbook:Cup|C]] [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]] or unsweetened [[Cookbook:Soy Milk|soy milk]]
*&amp;frac12; [[Cookbook:Cup|C]] cashew butter
*1 pinch [[Cookbook:Cayenne pepper|cayenne pepper]]

==Procedure==
Allow the cashew butter to come to room temperature, if refrigerated.

Saut&amp;eacute;e the onion and bell pepper in the peanut oil over low to medium heat with salt and pepper, until the onion begins to turn translucent and the bell pepper is soft. Add the wine and deglaze the pan. Add cayenne pepper.

Add the milk and heat through. Add the cashew butter by the spoonful and stir until incorporated and smooth. Gravy will appear lumpy at first, but will become smooth after a few minutes of stirring and simmering. Adjust the quantity of milk or cashew butter as necessary for desired consistency. Taste and add salt if necessary.

This gravy is excellent on [[Cookbook:Green Beans|green beans]] or other vegetables, or can be served over brown rice.

Cashew gravy is traditionally one way of making a creamy vegan sauce--use unsweetened soy milk instead of milk if a vegan recipe is desired.

Makes about 2 cups gravy.

      <comment>/* Else statements */ missing semicolon added and duplicate javascript tags removed.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== If statements ==
We can do so that some blocks of code should execute only if condition true. For it we should use &quot;if&quot; expression. Let's see example.
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
n = 6;
if(n &gt; 0)print(&quot;n is positive&quot;);
&lt;/source&gt;

== Else statements ==
We also can make code block that should be executed only if condition false. For execute much commands just enclose it in '{' and '}'.
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
n = -5;
if(n &gt; 0){
  print(&quot;n is positive&quot;);
}else{
  print(&quot;n is negative or zero&quot;);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

== Else if statements ==
Also we can set any number conditions and blocks of code for this conditions.
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
n = 0;
if(n &gt; 0){
  print(&quot;n is positive&quot;);
}else if(n == 0){
  print(&quot;n is zero&quot;);
}else{
  print(&quot;n is negative&quot;);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

      <comment>/* Conjugated protein */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Proteins were first described by the Dutch chemist Gerhardus Johannes Mulder and named by the Swedish chemist Jöns Jakob Berzelius in 1838. Early nutritional scientists such as the German Carl von Voit believed that protein was the most important nutrient for maintaining the structure of the body, because it was generally believed that &quot;flesh makes flesh.&quot;

The amino acids in a polypeptide chain are linked by peptide bonds. Once linked in the protein chain, an individual amino acid is called a residue, and the linked series of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen atoms are known as the main chain or protein backbone. The peptide bond has two resonance forms that contribute some double-bond character and inhibit rotation around its axis, so that the alpha carbons are roughly coplanar. The other two dihedral angles in the peptide bond determine the local shape assumed by the protein backbone. The end of the protein with a free carboxyl group is known as the C-terminus or carboxy terminus, whereas the end with a free amino group is known as the N-terminus or amino terminus.

The words protein, polypeptide, and peptide are a little ambiguous and can overlap in meaning. Protein is generally used to refer to the complete biological molecule in a stable conformation, whereas peptide is generally reserved for a short amino acid oligomers often lacking a stable three-dimensional structure. However, the boundary between the two is not well defined and usually lies near 20–30 residues. Polypeptide can refer to any single linear chain of amino acids, usually regardless of length, but often implies an absence of a defined conformation&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Protein&amp;oldid=425576197&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[Image:amino-CORN.png|thumb|right|250px||CO-R-N rule]]

There are''' 22 standard''' amino acids, but only''' 21 are found in eukaryotes'''. Of the 22, 20 are directly encoded by the universal genetic code. Humans can synthesize 11 of these 20 from each other or from other molecules of intermediary metabolism. The other 9 must be consumed in the diet, and so are called essential amino acids; those are ''histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, and valine.'' The remaining two, '''selenocysteine''' and '''pyrrolysine''', are incorporated into proteins by unique synthetic mechanisms.

Each α-amino acid consists of a backbone part that is present in all the amino acid types, and a side chain that is unique to each type of residue. An exception from this rule is proline, where the hydrogen atom is replaced by a bond to the side chain. Because the carbon atom is bound to four different groups it is chiral, however only one of the isomers occur in biological proteins. Glycine however, is not chiral since its side chain is a hydrogen atom. A simple mnemonic for correct L-form is &quot;CORN&quot;: when the Cα atom is viewed with the H in front, the residues read '''&quot;CO-R-N&quot;''' in a clockwise direction&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Proteinogenic_amino_acid&amp;oldid=420804587&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Isomerism'''

The standard '''α-amino acids''', all but glycine can exist in either of two optical isomers, called''' L or D amino acids''', which are mirror images of each other . While L-amino acids represent all of the amino acids found in proteins during translation in the ribosome, D-amino acids are found in some proteins produced by enzyme posttranslational modifications after translation and translocation to the endoplasmic reticulum, as in exotic sea-dwelling organisms such as cone snails. They are also abundant components of the peptidoglycan cell walls of bacteria, and '''D-serine may act as a neurotransmitter in the brain'''. The L and D convention for amino acid configuration refers not to the optical activity of the amino acid itself, but rather to the optical activity of the isomer of glyceraldehyde from which that amino acid can theoretically be synthesized (D-glyceraldehyde is dextrorotary; L-glyceraldehyde is levorotary). Alternatively, the (S) and (R) designators are used to indicate the absolute stereochemistry. Almost all of the amino acids in proteins are (S) at the α carbon, with cysteine being (R) and glycine non-chiral.Cysteine is unusual since it has a sulfur atom at the second position in its side-chain, which has a larger atomic mass than the groups attached to the first carbon which is attached to the α-carbon in the other standard amino acids, thus the (R) instead of (S)&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Amino_acid&amp;oldid=425389108&lt;/ref&gt;.



'''Zwitterions'''

The amine and carboxylic acid functional groups found in amino acids allow it to have amphiprotic properties. At a certain pH, known as the '''isoelectric point''', an amino acid has no overall charge since the number of protonated ammonia groups (positive charges) and deprotonated carboxylate groups (negative charges) are equal. The amino acids all have different '''isoelectric points'''. The ions produced at the isoelectric point have both positive and negative charges and are known as a zwitterion, which comes from the German word Zwitter meaning &quot;hermaphrodite&quot; or &quot;hybrid&quot;. Amino acids can exist as '''zwitterions in solids and in polar solutions such as water''', but '''not in the gas''' phase. Zwitterions have minimal solubility at their isolectric point and an amino acid can be isolated by precipitating it from water by adjusting the pH to its particular isoelectric point&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Amino_acid&amp;oldid=425389108&lt;/ref&gt;.


The 20 naturally occurring amino acids have different physical and chemical properties, including their electrostatic charge, pKa, hydrophobicity, size and specific functional groups. These properties play a major role in molding protein structure. The salient features of amino acids are described below in the table.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
! Amino Acid
! colspan=&quot;2&quot; | Abbrev.
! Remarks
|-
! [[Alanine]][[Image:L-alanine-3D-balls.png|thumb|170px]]
| A
| Ala
| Very abundant, very versatile. More stiff than glycine, but small enough to pose only small steric limits for the protein conformation. It behaves fairly neutrally, and can be located in both hydrophilic regions on the protein outside and the hydrophobic areas inside.
|-
! [[Asparagine]] or [[aspartic acid]]
| B
| Asx
| A placeholder when either amino acid may occupy a position.
|-
! [[Cysteine]][[Image:L-cysteine-3D-balls2.png|thumb|170px]]
| C
| Cys
| The sulfur atom bonds readily to [[heavy metals|heavy metal]] ions. Under oxidizing conditions, two cysteines can join together in a [[disulfide bond]] to form the amino acid [[cystine]]. When cystines are part of a protein, [[insulin]] for example, the [[tertiary structure]] is stabilized, which makes the protein more resistant to [[denaturation (biochemistry)|denaturation]]; therefore, disulfide bonds are common in proteins that have to function in harsh environments including digestive enzymes (e.g., [[pepsin]] and [[chymotrypsin]]) and structural proteins (e.g., [[keratin]]). Disulfides are also found in peptides too small to hold a stable shape on their own (eg. [[insulin]]).
|-
! [[Aspartic acid]][[Image:L-aspartic-acid-3D-balls.png|thumb|170px]]
| D
| Asp
| Behaves similarly to glutamic acid. Carries a hydrophilic acidic group with strong negative charge. Usually is located on the outer surface of the protein, making it water-soluble. Binds to positively-charged molecules and ions, often used in enzymes to fix the metal ion. When located inside of the protein, aspartate and glutamate are usually paired with arginine and lysine.
|-
! [[Glutamic acid]][[Image:L-glutamic-acid-3D-sticks2.png|thumb|170px]]
| E
| Glu
| Behaves similar to aspartic acid. Has longer, slightly more flexible side chain.
|-
! [[Phenylalanine]][[ Image: L-phenylalanine-3D-balls.png|thumb|170px]]
| F
| Phe
| [[essential amino acid|Essential]] for humans. Phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan contain large rigid [[aromaticity|aromatic]] group on the side-chain. These are the biggest amino acids. Like isoleucine, leucine and valine, these are hydrophobic and tend to orient towards the interior of the folded protein molecule. Phenylalanine can be converted into Tyrosine.
|-
! [[Glycine]][[Image:Glycine-3D-balls.png|thumb|170px]]
| G
| Gly
| Because of the two hydrogen atoms at the α carbon, glycine is not [[optical isomerism|optically active]]. It is the smallest amino acid, rotates easily, adds flexibility to the protein chain. It is able to fit into the tightest spaces, e.g., the triple helix of [[collagen]]. As too much flexibility is usually not desired, as a structural component it is less common than alanine.
|-
! [[Histidine]][[Image:L-histidine-zwitterion-from-xtal-1993-3D-balls-B.png|thumb|170px]]
| H
| His
| In even slightly acidic conditions [[protonation]] of the nitrogen occurs, changing the properties of histidine and the polypeptide as a whole.  It is used by many proteins as a regulatory mechanism, changing the conformation and behavior of the polypeptide in acidic regions such as the late [[endosome]] or [[lysosome]], enforcing conformation change in enzymes. However only a few histidines are needed for this, so it is comparatively scarce.
|-
! [[Isoleucine]][[Image:L-isoleucine-3D-balls.png|thumb|170px]]
| I
| Ile
| [[essential amino acid|Essential]] for humans. Isoleucine, leucine and valine have large aliphatic hydrophobic side chains. Their molecules are rigid, and their mutual hydrophobic interactions are important for the correct folding of proteins, as these chains tend to be located inside of the protein molecule.
|-
! [[Leucine]] or [[isoleucine]]
| J
| Xle
| A placeholder when either amino acid may occupy a position
|-
! [[Lysine]][[Image:L-lysine-monocation-from-hydrochloride-dihydrate-xtal-3D-balls.png|thumb|170px]]
| K
| Lys
| [[essential amino acid|Essential]] for humans. Behaves similarly to arginine. Contains a long flexible side-chain with a positively-charged end. The flexibility of the chain makes lysine and arginine suitable for binding to molecules with many negative charges on their surfaces. E.g., [[deoxyribonucleic acid|DNA]]-binding proteins have their active regions rich with arginine and lysine. The strong charge makes these two amino acids prone to be located on the outer hydrophilic surfaces of the proteins; when they are found inside, they are usually paired with a corresponding negatively-charged amino acid, e.g., aspartate or glutamate.
|-
! [[Leucine]][[Image:L-leucine-3D-balls.png|thumb|170px]]
| L
| Leu
| [[essential amino acid|Essential]] for humans. Behaves similar to isoleucine and valine. See isoleucine.
|-
! [[Methionine]][[Image: L-methionine-B-3D-balls.png|thumb|170px]]
| M
| Met
| [[essential amino acid|Essential]] for humans. Always the first amino acid to be incorporated into a protein; sometimes removed after translation. Like cysteine, contains sulfur, but with a [[methyl]] group instead of hydrogen. This methyl group can be activated, and is used in many reactions where a new carbon atom is being added to another molecule.
|-
! [[Asparagine]][[Image: L-asparagine-3D-balls.png|thumb|170px]]
| N
| Asn
| Similar to aspartic acid. Asn contains an [[amide]] group where Asp has a [[carboxyl]].
|-
! [[Pyrrolysine]]
| O
| Pyl
| Similar to [[lysine]], with a [[pyrroline]] ring attached.  
|-
! [[Proline]][[Image: L-proline-3D-balls.png|thumb|170px]]
| P
| Pro
| Contains an unusual ring to the N-end amine group, which forces the CO-NH amide sequence into a fixed conformation. Can disrupt protein folding structures like [[alpha helix|α helix]] or [[beta sheet|β sheet]], forcing the desired kink in the protein chain. Common in [[collagen]], where it often undergoes a [[posttranslational modification]] to [[hydroxyproline]].
|-
! [[Glutamine]][[Image:L-glutamine-3D-sticks.png|thumb|170px]]
| Q
| Gln
| Similar to glutamic acid. Gln contains an [[amide]] group where Glu has a [[carboxyl]]. Used in proteins and as a storage for [[ammonia]]. The most abundant Amino Acid in the body.
|-
! [[Arginine]][[ Image: L-arginine-3D-hztl.png|thumb|170px]]
| R
| Arg
| Functionally similar to lysine.
|-
! [[Serine]][[Image:L-serine-3D-balls.png|thumb|170px]]
| S
| Ser
| Serine and threonine have a short group ended with a [[hydroxyl]] group. Its hydrogen is easy to remove, so serine and threonine often act as hydrogen donors in enzymes. Both are very hydrophilic, therefore the outer regions of soluble proteins tend to be rich with them.
|-
! [[Threonine]][[Image: L-Threonine-3D-balls.png|thumb|170px]]
| T
| Thr
| [[essential amino acid|Essential]] for humans. Behaves similarly to serine.
|-
! [[Selenocysteine]]
| U
| Sec
| [[Selenium|Selenated]] form of cysteine, which replaces [[sulfur]]. 
|-
! [[Valine]][[Image:L-valine-3D-balls.png|thumb|170px]]
| V
| Val
| [[essential amino acid|Essential]] for humans. Behaves similarly to isoleucine and leucine. See isoleucine.
|-
! [[Tryptophan]][[Image: L-tryptophan-3D-balls.png|thumb|170px]]
| W
| Trp
| [[essential amino acid|Essential]] for humans. Behaves similarly to phenylalanine and tyrosine (see phenylalanine). Precursor of [[serotonin]]. Naturally [[fluorescent]].
|-
! Unknown
| X
| Xaa
| Placeholder when the amino acid is unknown or unimportant.
|-
! [[Tyrosine]][[Image: L-tyrosine-3D-sticks.png|thumb|170px]]
| Y
| Tyr
| Behaves similarly to phenylalanine (precursor to Tyrosine) and tryptophan (see phenylalanine). Precursor of [[melanin]], [[epinephrine]], and [[thyroid hormone]]s. Naturally [[fluorescent]], although fluorescence is usually quenched by energy transfer to tryptophans.
|-

===Classification of aminoacids===
The 20 amino acids encoded directly by the genetic code can be divided into several groups based on their properties. Important factors are charge, hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity, size and functional groups.Amino acids are usually classified by the properties of their side chain into four groups. The side chain can make an amino acid a weak acid or a weak base, and a hydrophile if the side chain is polar or a hydrophobe if it is nonpolar.

[[Image:a-amino-acid.png|thumb|150px|An α-amino acid. The C&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;H atom is omitted in the diagram.]]
Protein amino acids are combined into a single [[polypeptide chain]] in a [[condensation reaction]]. This reaction is [[catalysis|catalysed]] by the [[ribosome]] in a process known as [[peptide biosynthesis|translation]].

Additionally, many non-standard amino acids have a specific code. For example, several peptide drugs, such as [[Bortezomib]] or [[MG132]] are [[peptide synthesis|artificially synthesized]] and retain their [[protecting group]]s, which have specific codes. Bortezomib is [[pyrazinoic acid|Pyz]]-Phe-boroLeu and MG132 is [[Carboxybenzyl|Z]]-Leu-Leu-Leu-al. Additionally, To aid in the analysis of protein structure, [[Photo-reactive amino acid analog|photocrosslinking amino acid analogues]] are available. These include photoleucine ('''pLeu''') and photomethionine ('''pMet''').&lt;ref&gt; Photo-leucine and photo-methionine allow identification of protein-protein interactions in living cells.Nature Methods:4,261–7,2005&lt;/ref&gt;

==Peptide bond==

[[Image:Peptidformationball.svg|thumbnail|right|400px|The condensation of two amino acids to form a [[peptide bond]]|alt=Two amino acids are shown next to each other. One loses a hydrogen and oxygen from its carboxyl group (COOH) and the other loses a hydrogen from its amino group (NH2). This reaction produces a molecule of water (H2O) and two amino acids joined by a peptide bond (-CO-NH-). The two joined amino acids are called a dipeptide.]]



A peptide bond (amide bond) is a covalent chemical bond formed between two molecules when the carboxyl group of one molecule reacts with the amino group of the other molecule, thereby releasing a molecule of water (H2O). This is a dehydration synthesis reaction (also known as a condensation reaction), and usually occurs between amino acids. The resulting C(O)NH bond is called a peptide bond, and the resulting molecule is an amide. The four-atom functional group -C(=O)NH- is called a peptide link. Polypeptides and proteins are chains of amino acids held together by peptide bonds, as is the backbone of PNA.



A peptide bond can be broken by amide hydrolysis (the adding of water). The peptide bonds in proteins are metastable, meaning that in the presence of water they will break spontaneously, releasing 2-4 kcal/mol of free energy, but this process is extremely slow. In living organisms, the process is facilitated by enzymes. Living organisms also employ enzymes to form peptide bonds; this process requires free energy. The wavelength of absorbance for a peptide bond is 190-230 nm.

The peptide bond tend to be planar due to the delocalization of the electrons from the double bond. The rigid peptide dihedral angle, ω (the bond between C1 and N) is always close to 180 degrees. The dihedral angles phi φ (the bond between N and Cα) and psi ψ (the bond between Cα and C1) can have a certain range of possible values. These angles are the internal degrees of freedom of a protein, they control the protein's conformation. They are restrained by geometry to allowed ranges typical for particular secondary structure elements, and represented in a Ramachandran plot. A few important bond lengths are given in the table below&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Peptide_bond&amp;oldid=417601014&lt;/ref&gt;.

===β-peptides ===



In α amino acids (molecule at left), both the [[carboxylic acid]] group (red) and the [[amino]] group (blue) are bonded to the same carbon center, termed the α carbon (&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{C}^{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;) because it is one atom away from the carboxylate group.  In β amino acids, the amino group is bonded to the β carbon (&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{C}^{\beta}&lt;/math&gt;), which is found in most of the 20 standard amino acids.  Only [[glycine]] lacks a β carbon, which means that β-glycine is not possible.

The chemical synthesis of β amino acids can be challenging, especially given the diversity of [[functional group]]s bonded to the β carbon and the necessity of maintaining [[Chirality (chemistry)|chirality]]. In the [[alanine]] molecule shown, the β carbon is achiral; however, most larger amino acids have a chiral &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{C}^{\beta}&lt;/math&gt; atom. A number of synthesis mechanisms have been introduced to efficiently form β amino acids and their derivatives&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Basler B, Schuster O, Bach T |title=Conformationally constrained β-amino acid derivatives by intramolecular [2 + 2]-photocycloaddition of a tetronic acid amide and subsequent lactone ring opening |journal=J.

==Enzymes==

Enzymes are generally globular proteins and range from just 62 amino acid residues in size, for the monomer of 4-oxalocrotonate tautomerase, to over 2,500 residues in the animal fatty acid synthase. A small number of RNA-based biological catalysts exist, with the most common being the ribosome; these are referred to as either RNA-enzymes or ribozymes. The activities of enzymes are determined by their three-dimensional structure. However, although structure does determine function, predicting a novel enzyme's activity just from its structure is a very difficult problem that has not yet been solved.

Most enzymes are much larger than the substrates they act on, and only a small portion of the enzyme (around 3–4 amino acids) is directly involved in catalysis. The region that contains these catalytic residues, binds the substrate, and then carries out the reaction is known as the active site. Enzymes can also contain sites that bind cofactors, which are needed for catalysis. Some enzymes also have binding sites for small molecules, which are often direct or indirect products or substrates of the reaction catalyzed. This binding can serve to increase or decrease the enzyme's activity, providing a means for feedback regulation.
Like all proteins, enzymes are long, linear chains of amino acids that fold to produce a three-dimensional product. Each unique amino acid sequence produces a specific structure, which has unique properties. Individual protein chains may sometimes group together to form a protein complex. Most enzymes can be denatured—that is, unfolded and inactivated—by heating or chemical denaturants, which disrupt the three-dimensional structure of the protein. Depending on the enzyme, denaturation may be reversible or irreversible.
Structures of enzymes in complex with substrates or substrate analogs during a reaction may be obtained using Time resolved crystallography methods&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Enzyme&amp;oldid=424282616&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Classification of enzymes===
An enzyme's name is often derived from its substrate or the chemical reaction it catalyzes, with the word ending in -ase. Examples are lactase, alcohol dehydrogenase and DNA polymerase. This may result in different enzymes, called isozymes, with the same function having the same basic name. Isoenzymes have a different amino acid sequence and might be distinguished by their optimal pH, kinetic properties or immunologically. Isoenzyme and isozyme are homologous proteins. Furthermore, the normal physiological reaction an enzyme catalyzes may not be the same as under artificial conditions. This can result in the same enzyme being identified with two different names. E.g. Glucose isomerase, used industrially to convert glucose into the sweetener fructose, is a xylose isomerase in vivo.
 
The '''International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology''' have developed a nomenclature for enzymes, the EC numbers.
The '''Enzyme Commission number (EC number)''' is a numerical classification scheme for enzymes, based on the chemical reactions they catalyze. As a system of enzyme nomenclature, every EC number is associated with a recommended name for the respective enzyme.
Each enzyme is described by a sequence of four numbers preceded by &quot;EC&quot;. The first number broadly classifies the enzyme based on its mechanism.
Strictly speaking, EC numbers do not specify enzymes, but enzyme-catalyzed reactions. If different enzymes (for instance from different organisms) catalyze the same reaction, then they receive the same EC number. By contrast, UniProt identifiers uniquely specify a protein by its amino acid sequence&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Enzyme&amp;oldid=424282616&lt;/ref&gt;.



EC 1 Oxidoreductases: catalyze oxidation/reduction reactions

EC 2 Transferases: transfer a functional group (e.g. a methyl or phosphate group)

EC 3 Hydrolases: catalyze the hydrolysis of various bonds

EC 4 Lyases: cleave various bonds by means other than hydrolysis and oxidation

EC 5 Isomerases: catalyze isomerization changes within a single molecule

EC 6 Ligases: join two molecules with covalent bonds.

===Oxidoreductase===
In molecular biology and biochemistry, an oxidoreductase is an enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of electrons from one molecule (the reductant, also called the hydrogen or electron donor) to another (the oxidant, also called the hydrogen or electron acceptor). This group of enzymes usually utilizes NADP or NAD as cofactors.
In general, polypeptides are unbranched polymers, so their primary structure can often be specified by the sequence of amino acids along their backbone. However, proteins can become cross-linked, most commonly by disulfide bonds, and the primary structure also requires specifying the cross-linking atoms, e.g., specifying the cysteines involved in the protein's disulfide bonds. Other crosslinks include desmosine...
The chiral centers of a polypeptide chain can undergo racemization. In particular, the L-amino acids normally found in proteins can spontaneously isomerize at the Cα atom to form D-amino acids, which cannot be cleaved by most proteases&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Enzyme&amp;oldid=424282616&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Primary structure of protein===
[[Image:Ramachandran plot general 100K.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Ramachandran diagram (φ,ψ plot), with data points for α-helical residues forming a dense diagonal cluster below and left of center, around the global energy minimum for backbone conformation.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | author = Lovell SC et al. | title = Structure validation by Cα geometry: φ,ψ and Cβ deviation | journal = Proteins | volume = 50 | pages = 437–450 | doi = 10.1002/prot.10286 | pmid = 12557186 | year = 2003 | issue = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The proposal that proteins were linear chains of α-amino acids was made nearly simultaneously by two scientists at the same conference in 1902, the 74th meeting of the Society of German Scientists and Physicians, held in Karlsbad. '''Franz Hofmeister made''' the proposal in the morning, based on his observations of the biuret reaction in proteins. Hofmeister was followed a few hours later by '''Emil Fischer''', who had amassed a wealth of chemical details supporting the peptide-bond model. For completeness, the proposal that proteins contained amide linkages was made as early as 1882 by the French chemist '''E. Grimaux'''&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Protein_primary_structure&amp;oldid=415921787&lt;/ref&gt;.

Despite these data and later evidence that proteolytically digested proteins yielded only oligopeptides, the idea that proteins were linear, unbranched polymers of amino acids was not accepted immediately. Some well-respected scientists such as William Astbury doubted that covalent bonds were strong enough to hold such long molecules together; they feared that thermal agitations would shake such long molecules asunder. Hermann Staudinger faced similar prejudices in the 1920s when he argued that rubber was composed of macromolecules.
Thus, several alternative hypotheses arose. The '''colloidal protein hypothesis''' stated that proteins were colloidal assemblies of smaller molecules. This hypothesis was disproved in the 1920s by ultracentrifugation measurements by Theodor Svedberg that showed that proteins had a well-defined, reproducible molecular weight and by electrophoretic measurements by Arne Tiselius that indicated that proteins were single molecules. 

A second hypothesis, the '''cyclol hypothesis''' advanced by Dorothy Wrinch, proposed that the linear polypeptide underwent a chemical cyclol rearrangement C=O + HN  C(OH)-N that crosslinked its backbone amide groups, forming a two-dimensional fabric. Other primary structures of proteins were proposed by various researchers, such as the diketopiperazine model of Emil Abderhalden and the pyrrol/piperidine model of Troensegaard in 1942. Although never given much credence, these alternative models were finally disproved when Frederick Sanger successfully sequenced insulin and by the crystallographic determination of myoglobin and hemoglobin by Max Perutz and John Kendrew.

The primary structure of peptides and proteins refers to the linear sequence of its amino acid structural units. The term &quot;primary structure&quot; was first coined by Linderstrøm-Lang in 1951. By convention, the primary structure of a protein is reported starting from the amino-terminal (N) end to the carboxyl-terminal (C) end. The post-translational modifications of protein such as disulfide formation, phosphorylations and glycosylations are usually also considered a part of the primary structure, and cannot be read from the gene.

===Secondary structure of protein===
[[Image:1GZX Haemoglobin.png|thumb|right|200px|The [[Hemoglobin]] molecule has four heme-binding subunits, each largely made of alpha helices.]]
Secondary structure refers to highly regular local sub-structures. Two main types of secondary structure, the [[alpha helix]] and the [[beta strand]], were suggested in 1951 by '''Linus Pauling'''' and coworkers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pauling1951&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Pauling L, Corey RB, Branson HR |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA |year=1951 |volume=37 |issue=4 |pages=205–211 |title=The structure of proteins; two hydrogen-bonded helical configurations of the polypeptide chain |pmid=14816373 |doi=10.1073/pnas.37.4.205 |pmc=1063337}}&lt;/ref&gt;. These secondary structures are defined by patterns of [[hydrogen bonds]] between the main-chain peptide groups. They have a regular geometry, being constrained to specific values of the dihedral angles ψ and φ on the [[Ramachandran plot]]. Both the alpha helix and the beta-sheet represent a way of saturating all the hydrogen bond donors and acceptors in the peptide backbone. Some parts of the protein are ordered but do not form any regular structures. They should not be confused with [[random coil]], an unfolded polypeptide chain lacking any fixed three-dimensional structure.  Several sequential secondary structures may form a &quot;[[supersecondary structure|supersecondary unit]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ChiangYS2007&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Chiang YS, Gelfand TI, Kister AE, Gelfand IM |title=New classification of supersecondary structures of sandwich-like proteins uncovers strict patterns of strand assemblage. |journal=Proteins. |volume=68 |issue=4 |pages=915–921 |year=2007 |pmid=17557333 |doi=10.1002/prot.21473}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amino acids vary in their ability to form the various secondary structure elements. Proline and glycine are sometimes known as &quot;helix breakers&quot; because they disrupt the regularity of the α helical backbone conformation; however, both have unusual conformational abilities and are commonly found in turns. Amino acids that prefer to adopt helical conformations in proteins include methionine, alanine, leucine, glutamate and lysine (&quot;MALEK&quot; in amino-acid 1-letter codes); by contrast, the large aromatic residues (tryptophan, tyrosine and phenylalanine) and Cβ-branched amino acids (isoleucine, valine, and threonine) prefer to adopt β-strand conformations. However, these preferences are not strong enough to produce a reliable method of predicting secondary structure from sequence alone.Secondary structure in proteins consists of local inter-residue interactions mediated by hydrogen bonds, or not. The most common secondary structures are alpha helices and beta sheets. Other helices, such as the 310 helix and π helix, are calculated to have energetically favorable hydrogen-bonding patterns but are rarely if ever observed in natural proteins except at the ends of α helices due to unfavorable backbone packing in the center of the helix.

{{quotation|A '''Ramachandran plot''' (also known as a ''Ramachandran map or a Ramachandran diagram'' or a [φ,ψ] plot), developed by Gopalasamudram Narayana Ramachandran and Viswanathan Sasisekharan is a way to visualize dihedral angles ψ against φ of amino acid residues in protein structure. &lt;ref&gt; RAMACHANDRAN GN, RAMAKRISHNAN C, SASISEKHARAN V (July 1963). &quot;Stereochemistry of polypeptide chain configurations&quot;. J. Mol. Biol. 7: 95–9&lt;/ref&gt;. It shows the possible conformations of ψ and φ angles for a polypeptide.



Mathematically, the Ramachandran plot is the visualization of a function &lt;math&gt;f: \left[-\pi,\pi\right) \times \left[-\pi,\pi\right) \rightarrow \mathbb{R_{{}+{}}}&lt;/math&gt;. The domain of this function is the torus. Hence, the conventional Ramachandran plot is a projection of the torus on the plane, resulting in a distorted view and the presence of discontinuities.
One would expect that larger side chains would result in more restrictions and consequently a smaller allowable region in the Ramachandran plot. In practice this does not appear to be the case; only the methylene group at the α position has an influence. Glycine has a hydrogen atom, with a smaller van der Waals radius, instead of a methyl group at the α position. Hence it is least restricted and this is apparent in the Ramachandran plot for glycine for which the allowable area is considerably larger.
In contrast, the Ramachandran plot for proline shows only a very limited number of possible combinations of ψ and φ.
The Ramachandran plot was calculated just before the first protein structures at atomic resolution were determined. Forty years later there were tens of thousands of high-resolution protein structures determined by X-ray crystallography and deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). From one thousand different protein chains, Ramachandran plots of over 200 000 amino acids were plotted, showing some significant differences, especially for glycine (Hovmöller et al. 2002). The upper left region was found to be split into two; one to the left containing amino acids in beta sheets and one to the right containing the amino acids in random coil of this conformation.
One can also plot the dihedral angles in polysaccharides and other polymers in this fashion. For the first two protein side-chain dihedral angles a similar plot is the Janin Plot.}}


'''α helix'''

The amino acids in an α helix are arranged in a right-handed helical structure where each amino acid residue corresponds to a 100° turn in the helix (i.e., the helix has 3.6 residues per turn), and a translation of 1.5 Å (0.15 nm) along the helical axis. (Short pieces of left-handed helix sometimes occur with a large content of achiral glycine amino acids, but are unfavorable for the other normal, biological L-amino acids.) The pitch of the alpha-helix (the vertical distance between one consecutive turn of the helix) is 5.4 Å (0.54 nm) which is the product of 1.5 and 3.6. What is most important is that the N-H group of an amino acid forms a hydrogen bond with the C=O group of the amino acid four residues earlier; this repeated  hydrogen bonding is the most prominent characteristic of an α-helix. Official international nomenclature specifies two ways of defining α-helices, rule 6.2 in terms of repeating φ,ψ torsion angles  and rule 6.3 in terms of the combined pattern of pitch and hydrogen bonding. Different amino-acid sequences have different propensities for forming α-helical structure. Methionine, alanine, leucine, uncharged glutamate, and lysine (&quot;MALEK&quot; in the amino-acid 1-letter codes) all have especially high helix-forming propensities, whereas proline and glycine have poor helix-forming propensities. Proline either breaks or kinks a helix, both because it cannot donate an amide hydrogen bond (having no amide hydrogen), and also because its sidechain interferes sterically with the backbone of the preceding turn - inside a helix, this forces a bend of about 30° in the helix axis.[9] However, proline is often seen as the first residue of a helix, presumably due to its structural rigidity. At the other extreme, glycine also tends to disrupt helices because its high conformational flexibility makes it entropically expensive to adopt the relatively constrained α-helical structure&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alpha_helix&amp;oldid=423162580&lt;/ref&gt;.
[[Image:Beta hairpin.png|thumb|right|130px|Representation of a [[beta hairpin]]]]
[[Image:Anthrax toxin protein key motif.svg|right|thumb|200px|Greek-key motif in protein structure.]]
'''β sheet'''
The first β sheet structure was proposed by William Astbury in the 1930s. He proposed the idea of hydrogen bonding between the peptide bonds of parallel or antiparallel extended β strands. However, Astbury did not have the necessary data on the bond geometry of the amino acids in order to build accurate models, especially since he did not then know that the peptide bond was planar. A refined version was proposed by Linus Pauling and Robert Corey in 1951.

The β sheet (also β-pleated sheet) is the second form of regular secondary structure in proteins, only somewhat less common than alpha helix. Beta sheets consist of beta strands connected laterally by at least two or three backbone hydrogen bonds, forming a generally twisted, pleated sheet. A beta strand (also β strand) is a stretch of polypeptide chain typically 3 to 10 amino acids long with backbone in an almost fully extended conformation. 

A very simple [[structural motif]] involving β sheets is the [[beta hairpin|β hairpin]], in which two antiparallel strands are linked by a short loop of two to five residues, of which one is frequently a [[glycine]] or a [[proline]], both of which can assume the unusual dihedral-angle conformations required for a tight [[turn (biochemistry)|turn]]. However, individual strands can also be linked in more elaborate ways with long loops that may contain [[alpha helix|alpha helices]] or even entire protein domains.

''Greek key motif''
The Greek key motif consists of four adjacent antiparallel strands and their linking loops. It consists of three antiparallel strands connected by hairpins, while the fourth is adjacent to the first and linked to the third by a longer loop. This type of structure forms easily during the protein folding process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://swissmodel.expasy.org/course/text/chapter4.htm Tertiary Protein Structure and Folds: section 4.3.2.1].

''The β-&amp;alpha;-β motif''
Due to the chirality of their component amino acids, all strands exhibit a &quot;right-handed&quot; twist evident in most higher-order β sheet structures. In particular, the linking loop between two parallel strands almost always has a right-handed crossover chirality, which is strongly favored by the inherent twist of the sheet. This linking loop frequently contains a helical region, in which case it is called a [[beta-alpha-beta|β-α-β]] motif. A closely related motif called a β-α-β-α motif forms the basic component of the most commonly observed protein [[tertiary structure]], the [[TIM barrel]].


''β-meander motif''
A simple [[structural motif|supersecondary]] protein topology composed of 2 or more consecutive antiparallel β-strands linked together by [[beta hairpin|hairpin]] loops.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scop.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/scop/data/scop.b.c.bbf.html SCOP: Fold: WW domain-like&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cryst.bbk.ac.uk/PPS2/course/section9/sss/super2.html PPS '96 - Super Secondary Structure&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  This motif is common in β-sheets and can be found in several structural architectures including [[beta barrel|β-barrels]] and [[beta propeller|β-propellers]].

''Psi-loop motif''
The psi-loop, Ψ-loop, motif consists of two antiparallel strands with one strand in between that is connected to both by hydrogen bonds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hutchinson |first=E. |authorlink= |coauthors=Thornton, J. |year=1996 |month= |title=PROMOTIF—A program to identify and analyze structural motifs in proteins |journal=Protein Science |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=212–220 |pmid=8745398 |url= |accessdate= |quote= |pmc=2143354 |doi=10.1002/pro.5560050204 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are four possible strand topologies for single Ψ-loops as cited by Hutchinson ''et al.'' (1990).  This motif is rare as the process resulting in its formation seems unlikely to occur during protein folding. The Ψ-loop was first identified in the [[aspartic acid protease|aspartic protease]] family.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid2281084&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hutchinson EG, Thornton JM | title = HERA--a program to draw schematic diagrams of protein secondary structures | journal = Proteins | volume = 8 | issue = 3 | pages = 203–12 | year = 1990 | pmid = 2281084 | doi = 10.1002/prot.340080303 | url = | issn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Coiled coils'''

The possibility of coiled coils for α-keratin was proposed by Francis Crick in 1952 as well as mathematical methods for determining their structure. Remarkably, this was soon after the structure of the alpha helix was suggested in 1951 by Linus Pauling and coworkers.

Coiled coils usually contain a repeated pattern, ''hxxhcxc'', of hydrophobic (h) and charged (c) amino-acid residues, referred to as a heptad repeat. The positions in the heptad repeat are usually labeled abcdefg, where a and d are the hydrophobic positions, often being occupied by isoleucine, leucine or valine. Folding a sequence with this repeating pattern into an alpha-helical secondary structure causes the hydrophobic residues to be presented as a 'stripe' that coils gently around the helix in left-handed fashion, forming an amphipathic structure. The most favorable way for two such helices to arrange themselves in the water-filled environment of the cytoplasm is to wrap the hydrophobic strands against each other sandwiched between the hydrophilic amino acids. It is thus the burial of hydrophobic surfaces, that provides the thermodynamic driving force for the oligomerization. The packing in a coiled-coil interface is exceptionally tight, with almost complete van der Waals contact between the side chains of the a and d residues. This tight packing was originally predicted by '''Francis Crick in 1952''' and is referred to as Knobs into holes packing.
The α-helices may be parallel or anti-parallel, and usually adopt a left-handed super-coil. Although disfavored, a few right-handed coiled coils have also been observed in nature and in designed proteins&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Coiled_coil&amp;oldid=427735447&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[Image:ProteinStructures.png|thumb|The four levels of protein structure, from top to bottom: primary structure, secondary structure (β-sheet left, right α-helix), tertiary and quaternary structure.]]

===Tertiary structure of protein===
Tertiary structure is considered to be largely determined by the protein's primary structure - the sequence of amino acids of which it is composed. Efforts to predict tertiary structure from the primary structure are known generally as protein structure prediction. However, the environment in which a protein is synthesized and allowed to fold are significant determinants of its final shape and are usually not directly taken into account by current prediction methods. 

In globular proteins, tertiary interactions are frequently stabilized by the sequestration of hydrophobic amino acid residues in the protein core, from which water is excluded, and by the consequent enrichment of charged or hydrophilic residues on the protein's water-exposed surface. In secreted proteins that do not spend time in the cytoplasm, disulfide bonds between cysteine residues help to maintain the protein's tertiary structure. A variety of common and stable tertiary structures appear in a large number of proteins that are unrelated in both function and evolution - for example, many proteins are shaped like a TIM barrel, named for the enzyme triosephosphateisomerase. Another common structure is a highly stable dimeric coiled coil structure composed of 2-7 alpha helices.

The majority of protein structures known to date have been solved with the experimental technique of X-ray crystallography, which typically provides data of high resolution but provides no time-dependent information on the protein's conformational flexibility. A second common way of solving protein structures uses NMR, which provides somewhat lower-resolution data in general and is limited to relatively small proteins, but can provide time-dependent information about the motion of a protein in solution. Dual polarisation interferometry is a time resolved analytical method for determining the overall conformation and conformational changes in surface captured proteins providing complementary information to these high resolution methods. More is known about the tertiary structural features of soluble globular proteins than about membrane proteins because the latter class is extremely difficult to study using these methods&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Protein_tertiary_structure&amp;oldid=422486540&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Quaternary structure of proteins===

Several proteins are actually assemblies of more than '''one polypeptide chain''', which in the context of the larger assemblage are known as protein subunits. In addition to the tertiary structure of the subunits, multiple-subunit proteins possess a quaternary structure, which is the arrangement into which the subunits assemble. Enzymes composed of subunits with diverse functions are sometimes called holoenzymes, in which some parts may be known as regulatory subunits and the functional core is known as the catalytic subunit. Examples of proteins with quaternary structure include hemoglobin, DNA polymerase, and ion channels. Other assemblies referred to instead as multiprotein complexes also possess quaternary structure. Examples include '''nucleosomes and microtubules'''. 

Changes in quaternary structure can occur through conformational changes within individual subunits or through reorientation of the subunits relative to each other. It is through such changes, which underlie cooperativity and allostery in &quot;multimeric&quot; enzymes, that many proteins undergo regulation and perform their physiological function.
The above definition follows a classical approach to biochemistry, established at times when the distinction between a protein and a functional, proteinaceous unit was difficult to elucidate. More recently, people refer to protein-protein interaction when discussing quaternary structure of proteins and consider all assemblies of proteins as protein complexes&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_quaternary_structure&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Protein structure determination==
[[File:Myoglobin.png|thumb|left|[[Ribbon diagram]] of the structure of [[myoglobin]], showing colored [[alpha helix|alpha helices]]. Such [[protein]]s are long, linear [[molecule]]s with thousands of atoms; yet the relative position of each atom has been determined with sub-atomic resolution by X-ray crystallography. Since it is difficult to visualize all the atoms at once, the ribbon shows the rough path of the protein [[polymer]] from its N-terminus (blue) to its C-terminus (red).]]
Around 90% of the protein structures available in the Protein Data Bank have been determined by X-ray crystallography. This method allows one to measure the 3D density distribution of electrons in the protein (in the crystallized state) and thereby infer the 3D coordinates of all the atoms to be determined to a certain resolution. Roughly 9% of the known protein structures have been obtained by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance techniques. The secondary structure composition can be determined via circular dichroism or dual polarisation interferometry. Cryo-electron microscopy has recently become a means of determining protein structures to high resolution (less than 5 angstroms or 0.5 nanometer) and is anticipated to increase in power as a tool for high resolution work in the next decade. This technique is still a valuable resource for researchers working with very large protein complexes such as virus coat proteins and amyloid fibers.

===X-ray crystallography===
X-ray crystallography of biological molecules took off with [[Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin]], who solved the structures of [[cholesterol]] (1937), [[vitamin B12]] (1945) and [[penicillin]] (1954), for which she was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] in 1964. In 1969, she succeeded in solving the structure of [[insulin]], on which she worked for over thirty years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Crowfoot Hodgkin D|authorlink=Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin|year = 1935|title=X-ray Single Crystal Photographs of Insulin|journal=Nature|volume=135|page=591|doi=10.1038/135591a0}}&lt;/ref&gt;


X-ray crystallography is a method of determining the arrangement of atoms within a crystal, in which a beam of X-rays strikes a crystal and diffracts into many specific directions.
Crystal structures of proteins (which are irregular and hundreds of times larger than cholesterol) began to be solved in the late 1950s, beginning with the structure of [[sperm whale]] [[myoglobin]] by [[Max Perutz]] and [[John Kendrew|Sir John Cowdery Kendrew]], for which they were awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1038/181662a0|volume=181|issue=4610|page=662|author=Kendrew J.

X-ray crystallography is now used routinely by scientists to determine how a pharmaceutical drug interacts with its protein target and what changes might improve it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Scapin G|title=Structural biology and drug discovery|journal=Curr.

===Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy or NMR===
Protein nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (usually abbreviated protein NMR) is a field of structural biology in which NMR spectroscopy is used to obtain information about the structure and dynamics of proteins. The field was pioneered by Richard R. Ernst and Kurt Wüthrich[1], among others. Protein NMR techniques are continually being used and improved in both academia and the biotech industry. Structure determination by NMR spectroscopy usually consists of several following phases, each using a separate set of highly specialized techniques. The sample is prepared, resonances are assigned, restraints are generated and a structure is calculated and validated

==How to sequence a protein?==

Protein sequencing is a technique to determine the amino acid sequence of a protein, as well as which conformation the protein adopts and the extent to which it is complexed with any non-peptide molecules. Discovering the structures and functions of proteins in living organisms is an important tool for understanding cellular processes, and allows drugs that target specific metabolic pathways to be invented more easily.
The two major direct methods of protein sequencing are '''mass spectrometry''' and the '''Edman degradation reaction'''. It is also possible to generate an amino acid sequence from the DNA or mRNA sequence encoding the protein, if this is known. However, there are a number of other reactions which can be used to gain more limited information about protein sequences and can be used as preliminaries to the aforementioned methods of sequencing or to overcome specific inadequacies within them&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Protein_sequencing&amp;oldid=413170994&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Edman degradation===
[[Image:EdmanDegradation.png|600px|right|Edman Degradation with generic amino acid peptide chain.]]
The Edman degradation is a very important reaction for protein sequencing, because it allows the ordered amino acid composition of a protein to be discovered. Automated Edman sequencers are now in widespread use, and are able to sequence peptides up to approximately 50 amino acids long. A reaction scheme for sequencing a protein by the Edman degradation follows - some of the steps are elaborated on subsequently.
Break any disulfide bridges in the protein with an oxidising agent like '''performic acid''' or reducing agent like '''2-mercaptoethanol'''. A protecting group such as iodoacetic acid may be necessary to prevent the bonds from re-forming.
Separate and purify the individual chains of the protein complex, if there are more than one.

Determine the amino acid composition of each chain.

Determine the terminal amino acids of each chain.

Break each chain into fragments under 50 amino acids long.

Separate and purify the fragments.

Determine the sequence of each fragment.

Repeat with a different pattern of cleavage.

Construct the sequence of the overall protein.

Digestion into peptide fragments Peptides longer than about 50-70 amino acids long cannot be sequenced reliably by the Edman degradation. Because of this, long protein chains need to be broken up into small fragments which can then be sequenced individually. Digestion is done either by endopeptidases such as trypsin or pepsin or by chemical reagents such as cyanogen bromide. Different enzymes give different cleavage patterns, and the overlap between fragments can be used to construct an overall sequence.

[[isothiocyanate|Phenylisothiocyanate]] is reacted with an uncharged terminal amino group, under mildly alkaline conditions, to form a cyclical ''phenylthiocarbamoyl'' derivative. Then, under [[acidic]] conditions, this derivative of the terminal amino acid is cleaved as a thiazolinone derivative. The thiazolinone amino acid is then selectively extracted into an organic solvent and treated with acid to form the more stable phenylthiohydantoin (PTH)- amino acid derivative that can be identified by using [[chromatography]] or [[electrophoresis]]. This procedure can then be repeated again to identify the next amino acid. A major drawback to this technique is that the peptides being sequenced in this manner cannot have more than 50 to 60 residues (and in practice, under 30). The peptide length is limited due to the cyclical derivitization not always going to completion. The derivitization problem can be resolved by cleaving large peptides into smaller peptides before proceeding with the reaction. It is able to accurately [[sequence]] up to 30 [[amino acids]] with modern machines capable of over 99% efficiency per [[amino acid]]. An advantage of the Edman degradation is that it only uses 10 - 100 [[pico]]moles of [[peptide]] for the sequencing process. Edman degradation reaction is automated to speed up the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Niall HD |title=Automated Edman degradation: the protein sequenator |journal=Meth. Enzymol. |volume=27 |issue= |pages=942–1010 |year=1973 |pmid=4773306 |doi= 10.1016/S0076-6879(73)27039-8|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Protein_sequencing&amp;oldid=413170994&lt;/ref&gt;

===N-terminal amino acid analysis===

Determining which amino acid forms the N-terminus of a peptide chain is useful for two reasons: to aid the ordering of individual peptide fragments' sequences into a whole chain, and because the first round of Edman degradation is often contaminated by impurities and therefore does not give an accurate determination of the N-terminal amino acid. A generalised method for N-terminal amino acid analysis follows:
React the peptide with a reagent which will selectively label the terminal amino acid.
Hydrolyse the protein.
Determine the amino acid by chromatography and comparison with standards.
There are many different reagents which can be used to label terminal amino acids. They all react with amine groups and will therefore also bind to amine groups in the side chains of amino acids such as lysine - for this reason it is necessary to be careful in interpreting chromatograms to ensure that the right spot is chosen. Two of the more common reagents are Sanger's reagent (1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene) and dansyl derivatives such as dansyl chloride. Phenylisothiocyanate, the reagent for the Edman degradation, can also be used. The same questions apply here as in the determination of amino acid composition, with the exception that no stain is needed, as the reagents produce coloured derivatives and only qualitative analysis is required, so the amino acid does not have to be eluted from the chromatography column, just compared with a standard. Another consideration to take into account is that, since any amine groups will have reacted with the labelling reagent, ion exchange chromatography cannot be used, and thin layer chromatography or high pressure liquid chromatography should be used instead&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Protein_sequencing&amp;oldid=413170994&lt;/ref&gt;.

===C-terminal amino acid analysis===

The number of methods available for C-terminal amino acid analysis is much smaller than the number of available methods of N-terminal analysis. The most common method is to add carboxypeptidases to a solution of the protein, take samples at regular intervals, and determine the terminal amino acid by analysing a plot of amino acid concentrations against time

===Mass spectrometry=== 

Present day researchers are using Mass spectrometry an important tool for the characterization of proteins. '''Protein mass spectrometry refers to the application of mass spectrometry to the study of proteins'''. The two primary methods for ionization of whole proteins are electrospray ionization (ESI) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI). In keeping with the performance and mass range of available mass spectrometers, two approaches are used for characterizing proteins. In the first, intact proteins are ionized by either of the two techniques described above, and then introduced to a mass analyzer. This approach is referred to as &quot;top-down&quot; strategy of protein analysis. In the second, proteins are enzymatically digested into smaller peptides using a protease such as trypsin. Subsequently these peptides are introduced into the mass spectrometer and identified by peptide mass fingerprinting or tandem mass spectrometry. Hence, this latter approach (also called &quot;bottom-up&quot; proteomics) uses identification at the peptide level to infer the existence of proteins.

Whole protein mass analysis is primarily conducted using either time-of-flight (TOF) MS, or '''Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance''' (FT-ICR). These two types of instrument are preferable here because of their wide mass range, and in the case of FT-ICR, its high mass accuracy. Mass analysis of proteolytic peptides is a much more popular method of protein characterization, as cheaper instrument designs can be used for characterization. Additionally, sample preparation is easier once whole proteins have been digested into smaller peptide fragments. The most widely used instrument for peptide mass analysis are the MALDI time-of-flight instruments as they permit the acquisition of peptide mass fingerprints (PMFs) at high pace (1 PMF can be analyzed in approx. 10 sec). Multiple stage quadrupole-time-of-flight and the quadrupole ion trap also find use in this application.

==Types of protein==
===Conjugated protein===
A conjugated protein is a protein that functions in interaction with other chemical groups attached by covalent bonds or by weak interactions.
Many proteins contain only amino acids and no other chemical groups, and they are called simple proteins. However, other kind of proteins yield, on hydrolysis, some other chemical component in addition to amino acids and they are called conjugated proteins. The nonamino part of a conjugated protein is usually called its prosthetic group. Most prosthetic groups are formed from vitamins. Conjugated proteins are classified on the basis of the chemical nature of their prosthetic groups.
Some examples of conjugated proteins are 

====Lipoproteins====
A lipoprotein is a biochemical assembly that contains both '''proteins''' and '''lipids''' water-bound to the proteins. Many enzymes, transporters, structural proteins, antigens, adhesins and toxins are lipoproteins. Examples include the high density (HDL) and low density (LDL) lipoproteins which enable fats to be carried in the blood stream, the transmembrane proteins of the mitochondrion and the chloroplast, and bacterial lipoproteins. 

====Glycoproteins====
Glycoproteins are proteins that contain oligosaccharide chains (glycans) covalently attached to polypeptide side-chains. The carbohydrate is attached to the protein in a cotranslational or posttranslational modification. This process is known as glycosylation. In proteins that have segments extending extracellularly, the extracellular segments are often glycosylated. Glycoproteins are often important integral membrane proteins, where they play a role in cell-cell interactions. Glycoproteins also occur in the cytosol, but their functions and the pathways producing these modifications in this compartment are less well-understood.'''Glycoproteins are generally the largest and most abundant group of conjugated proteins'''. They range from glycoproteins in cell surface membranes that constitute the glycocalyx, to important antibodies produced by leukocytes.

====phosphoproteins==== 

Phosphoproteins are proteins which are chemically bonded to a substance containing phosphoric acid (see phosphorylation for more). The category of organic molecules that includes Fc receptors, Ulks, Calcineurins, K chips, and urocortins.

====Metalloprotein====

A protein that contains a metal ion ass cofactor known as Metalloprotein. Metalloproteins have many different functions in cells, such as enzymes, transport and storage proteins, and signal transduction proteins. Indeed, about one quarter to one third of all proteins require metals to carry out their functions. The metal ion is usually coordinated by nitrogen, oxygen or sulfur atoms belonging to amino acids in the polypeptide chain and/or a macrocyclic ligand incorporated into the protein. The presence of the metal ion allows metalloenzymes to perform functions such as redox reactions that cannot easily be performed by the limited set of functional groups found in amino acids.

====hemoproteins====



A hemeprotein (or hemoprotein or haemoprotein), or heme protein, is a metalloprotein containing a heme prosthetic group, either covalently or noncovalently bound to the protein itself. The iron in the heme is capable of undergoing oxidation and reduction (usually to +2 and +3, though stabilized Fe+4 and even Fe+5 species are well known in the peroxidases).
Hemoproteins probably evolved from a primordial strategy allowing to incorporate the iron (Fe) atom contained within the protoporphyrin IX ring of heme into proteins. This strategy has been maintained throughout evolution as it makes hemoproteins responsive to molecules that can bind divalent iron (Fe). These molecules included, but are probably not restricted to, gaseous molecules, such as oxygen (O2) nitric oxide (NO), carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S). Once bound to the prosthetic heme groups of hemoproteins these gaseous molecules can modulate the activity/function of those hemoproteins in a way that is said to afford signal transduction. Therefore, when produced in biologic systems (cells), these gaseous molecules are referred to as gasotransmitters.'''Haemoglobin contains the prosthetic group containing iron''', which is the haem. It is with in the haem group that carries the oxygen molecule through the binding of the oxygen molecule to the iron ion (Fe2+) found in the haem group&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hemeprotein&amp;oldid=410476687&lt;/ref&gt;.


'''Hemoglobin'''
Hemoglobin (also spelled haemoglobin and abbreviated Hb or Hgb) is the iron-containing oxygen-transport metalloprotein in the red blood cells of all vertebrates[1] (except the fish family Channichthyidae ) and the tissues of some invertebrates. Hemoglobin in the blood is what transports oxygen from the lungs or gills to the rest of the body (i.e. the tissues) where it releases the oxygen for cell use, and collects carbon dioxide to bring it back to the lungs.
In mammals the protein makes up about 97% of the red blood cells' dry content, and around 35% of the total content (including water)[citation needed]. Hemoglobin has an oxygen binding capacity of 1.34 ml O2 per gram of hemoglobin, which increases the total blood oxygen capacity seventyfold.
Hemoglobin is involved in the transport of other gases: it carries some of the body's respiratory carbon dioxide (about 10% of the total) as carbaminohemoglobin, in which CO2 is bound to the globin protein. The molecule also carries the important regulatory molecule nitric oxide bound to a globin protein thiol group, releasing it at the same time as oxygen.
Hemoglobin is also found outside red blood cells and their progenitor lines. Other cells that contain hemoglobin include the A9 dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, macrophages, alveolar cells, and mesangial cells in the kidney. In these tissues, hemoglobin has a non-oxygen-carrying function as an antioxidant and a regulator of iron metabolism.
Hemoglobin and hemoglobin-like molecules are also found in many invertebrates, fungi, and plants. In these organisms, hemoglobins may carry oxygen, or they may act to transport and regulate other things such as carbon dioxide, nitric oxide, hydrogen sulfide and sulfide. A variant of the molecule, called leghemoglobin, is used to scavenge oxygen, to keep it from poisoning anaerobic systems, such as nitrogen-fixing nodules of leguminous plants.
phytochromes, 

'''Cytochromes''' 
[[Image:Cytochrome c.png|thumb|250px|Cytochrome ''c'' with heme ''c''.]]
Cytochromes are, in general, membrane-bound hemoproteins that contain heme groups and carry out electron transport.
They are found either as monomeric proteins (e.g., cytochrome c) or as subunits of bigger enzymatic complexes that catalyze redox reactions. They are found in the mitochondrial inner membrane and endoplasmic reticulum of eukaryotes, in the chloroplasts of plants, in photosynthetic microorganisms, and in bacteria.

====Opsins====
Opsins are a group of light-sensitive 35-55 kDa membrane-bound G protein-coupled receptors of the retinylidene protein family found in photoreceptor cells of the retina. Five classical groups of opsins are involved in vision, mediating the conversion of a photon of light into an electrochemical signal, the first step in the visual transduction cascade. Another opsin found in the mammalian retina, melanopsin, is involved in circadian rhythms and pupillary reflex but not in image-forming.

====Flavoproteins====
Flavoproteins are proteins that contain a nucleic acid derivative of riboflavin: the flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) or flavin mononucleotide (FMN).
Flavoproteins are involved in a wide array of biological processes, including, but by no means limited to, bioluminescence, removal of radicals contributing to oxidative stress, photosynthesis, DNA repair, and apoptosis. The spectroscopic properties of the flavin cofactor make it a natural reporter for changes occurring within the active site; this makes flavoproteins one of the most-studied enzyme families.

===Simple proteins===
The proteins which upon hydrolysis yield only amino acids are known as simple proteins.

====Albumin====
Albumin (Latin: albus, white) refers generally to any protein that is water soluble, which is moderately soluble in concentrated salt solutions, and experiences heat denaturation. They are commonly found in blood plasma, and are unique to other plasma proteins in that they are not glycosylated. Substances containing albumin, such as egg white, are called albuminoids.

====Globulin====
Globulin is one of the three types of serum proteins, the others being albumin and fibrinogen. Some globulins are produced in the liver, while others are made by the immune system. The term globulin encompasses a heterogeneous group of proteins with typical high molecular weight, and both solubility and electrophoretic migration rates lower than for albumin.

====Histones====
In biology, histones are highly alkaline proteins found in eukaryotic cell nuclei, which package and order the DNA into structural units called nucleosomes. They are the chief protein components of chromatin, acting as spools around which DNA winds, and play a role in gene regulation.

===Derived protein===
====Peptones====
Peptones are derived from animal milk or meat digested by proteolytic digestion. In addition to containing small peptides, the resulting spray-dried material includes fats, metals, salts, vitamins and many other biological compounds. Peptone is used in nutrient media for growing bacteria and fungi

====Proteases====
Proteases occur naturally in all organisms. These enzymes are involved in a multitude of physiological reactions from simple digestion of food proteins to highly-regulated cascades (e.g., the blood-clotting cascade, the complement system, apoptosis pathways, and the invertebrate prophenoloxidase-activating cascade). Proteases can either break specific peptide bonds (limited proteolysis), depending on the amino acid sequence of a protein, or break down a complete peptide to amino acids (unlimited proteolysis). The activity can be a destructive change, abolishing a protein's function or digesting it to its principal components; it can be an activation of a function, or it can be a signal in a signaling pathway.

==Protein data bank or PDB==
Like fuel and flame, two forces converged to initiate the Protein data bank (PDB): 1) a small but growing data base of sets of protein structures determined by X-ray diffraction and 2) the newly available (1968) molecular graphics display, the BRookhaven Raster Display (BRAD), to inspect these structures in 3-D. In 1969, with the sponsorship of Dr. Walter Hamilton at the Brookhaven National Laboratory, Dr. Edgar Meyer (Texas A&amp;M University) began to write software to store atomic coordinate files in a common format to make them available for geometric and graphical evaluation. By 1971 program SEARCH was executed remotely to extract and examine structural data and thereby was instrumental in initiating networking, thus marking the functional beginning of the PDB.

Upon Hamilton's death in 1973, Dr. Tom Koeztle took over direction of the PDB for the subsequent 20 years. In January 1994, [[Dr. Joel Sussman]] of Israel's [[Weizmann Institute of Science]] was appointed head of the PDB. In October 1998,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

the PDB was transferred to the Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics (RCSB); the transfer was completed in June 1999. The new director was [[Dr. Helen M.

The founding members are [http://www.pdbe.org/ PDBe (Europe)], RCSB(USA), and [http://www.pdbj.org/ PDBj (Japan)]. The [http://www.bmrb.wisc.edu BMRB] joined in 2006. Each of the four members of [[Worldwide Protein Data Bank|wwPDB]] can act as deposition, data processing and distribution centers for PDB data. The data processing refers to the fact that wwPDB staff review and annotates each submitted entry. The data are then automatically checked for plausibility (the  source code for this validation software has been made available to the public at no charge).

The Protein Data Bank (PDB) is a repository for the 3-D structural data of large biological molecules, such as proteins and nucleic acids. (See also crystallographic database). The data, typically obtained by X-ray crystallography or NMR spectroscopy and submitted by biologists and biochemists from around the world, are freely accessible on the Internet via the websites of its member organisations (PDBe, PDBj, and RCSB). The PDB is overseen by an organization called the Worldwide Protein Data Bank, wwPDB.

[[Carbon]] is green, [[hydrogen]] white, [[oxygen]] red, and [[nitrogen]] blue. On the right side is a [[ribbon diagram]] of the insulin hexamer, believed to be the stored form. A monomer unit is highlighted with the A chain in blue and the B chain in cyan. Yellow denotes disulfide bonds, and magenta spheres are zinc ions.]]

Within vertebrates, the amino acid sequence of insulin is extremely well preserved. Bovine insulin differs from human in only three amino acid residues, and porcine insulin in one. Even insulin from some species of fish is similar enough to human to be clinically effective in humans. Insulin in some invertebrates is quite similar in sequence to human insulin, and has similar physiological effects. The strong homology seen in the insulin sequence of diverse species suggests that it has been conserved across much of animal evolutionary history. The C-peptide of proinsulin , however, differs much more amongst species; it is also a hormone, but a secondary one.

Insulin is produced and stored in the body as a hexamer (a unit of six insulin molecules), while the active form is the monomer. The hexamer is an inactive form with long-term stability, which serves as a way to keep the highly reactive insulin protected, yet readily available. The hexamer-monomer conversion is one of the central aspects of insulin formulations for injection. The hexamer is far more stable than the monomer, which is desirable for practical reasons, however the monomer is a much faster reacting drug because diffusion rate is inversely related to particle size. A fast reacting drug means that insulin injections do not have to precede mealtimes by hours, which in turn gives diabetics more flexibility in their daily schedule. Insulin can aggregate and form fibrillar interdigitated beta-sheets. This can cause injection amyloidosis, and prevents the storage of insulin for long periods&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Insulin&amp;oldid=425481933&lt;/ref&gt;.


In 1869 Paul Langerhans, a medical student in Berlin, was studying the structure of the pancreas under a microscope when he identified some previously un-noticed tissue clumps scattered throughout the bulk of the pancreas. The function of the &quot;little heaps of cells,&quot; later known as the Islets of Langerhans, was unknown, but Edouard Laguesse later suggested that they might produce secretions that play a regulatory role in digestion. Paul Langerhans' son, Archibald, also helped to understand this regulatory role. The term insulin origins from insula, the Latin word for islet/island.
In 1889, the Polish-German physician Oscar Minkowski in collaboration with Joseph von Mering removed the pancreas from a healthy dog to test its assumed role in digestion. Several days after the dog's pancreas was removed, Minkowski's animal keeper noticed a swarm of flies feeding on the dog's urine. On testing the urine they found that there was sugar in the dog's urine, establishing for the first time a relationship between the pancreas and diabetes. In 1901, another major step was taken by Eugene Opie, when he clearly established the link between the Islets of Langerhans and diabetes: Diabetes mellitus … is caused by destruction of the islets of Langerhans and occurs only when these bodies are in part or wholly destroyed. Before his work, the link between the pancreas and diabetes was clear, but not the specific role of the islets.

The Nobel Prize committee in 1923 credited the practical extraction of insulin to a team at the University of Toronto and awarded the Nobel Prize to two men; Fredericus Bantam and J.J.R. Macleon. They were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1923 for the discovery of insulin. Bantam, insulted that Best was not mentioned, shared his prize with Best, and Macleon immediately shared his with James Collip. The patent for insulin was sold to the University of Toronto for one half-dollar.

The primary structure of insulin was determined by British molecular biologist Frederick Sanger. It was the first protein to have its sequence be determined. He was awarded the 1958 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for this work.
In 1969, after decades of work, Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin determined the spatial conformation of the molecule, the so-called tertiary structure, by means of X-ray diffraction studies. She had been awarded a Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1964 for the development of crystallography.
Rosalyn Sussman Yalow received the 1977 Nobel Prize in Medicine for the development of the radioimmunoassay for insulin&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Insulin&amp;oldid=425481933&lt;/ref&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;Schizophrenia and Related Psychotic Disorders&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;
== Introduction ==
Psychosis, a syndrome with many causes, traditionally refers to an impaired ability to distinguish between false and real perceptions and beliefs. Schizophrenia is the prototypical psychotic disorder. The most common psychotic symptoms are ''positive symptoms'' such as abnormal perceptions (including illusions and hallucinations), false beliefs, including a wide variety of delusional thoughts (e.g., paranoid delusions, delusions of reference, grandiose, somatic, etc.), and disorganized thinking. In addition, patients with schizophrenia might have prominent ''negative symptoms'' such as affective flattening, alogia (decreased thought/speech production), and avolition, together with amotivation, anhedonia and social isolation. Disorganized or bizarre behavior is a separate symptom dimension of the disorder. Affective symptoms can also be present and cognitive and social deficits are common.

This chapter focuses on primary psychotic disorders, as illustrated by schizophrenia, meaning that the clinical picture of psychosis is not deemed to be secondary to other processes. It is important to note that in addition to the primary psychoses a number of psychiatric and somatic conditions affecting the brain homeostasis can produce psychotic symptoms. 

Patients with personality disorders (PDs) can present with overt psychotic symptoms in response to stress (e.g., paranoid PD, schizotypal PD, borderline PD). Schizoid PD is considered a risk factor and might precede Schizophrenia and Delusional Disorder. With regards to mood disorders, severe psychotic depression can present with mood congruent (e.g., nihilistic delusions, delusional guilt) and/or auditory hallucinations making critical and negative comments. At the opposite end of the spectrum, severe mania can present with grandiose and religious delusions, delusions of special powers, and auditory hallucinations (God’s or angelic voices). Late life psychosis can be present in the later stages of dementia disorders. Conditions that affect the brain structure, either acutely [e.g., rapidly growing brain tumors, traumatic brain injury, strokes, infectious/inflammatory processes such as tertiary syphilis, multiple sclerosis or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)], or chronically [e.g., nutrient and vitamin deficiencies such as B12, niacin deficiency (pellagra), etc.] can present with a variety of psychotic symptoms. Last but not least, a number of drugs (prescribed and illicit) can be associated with psychotic symptoms either during treatment/intoxication or withdrawal. 

This chapter will first review the definitions of the different types of psychotic symptoms, as the basis for the discussion about the approach (including initial assessment as well as short and long-term treatment plans) to a patient with a generic psychotic syndrome. For the remainder of the chapter schizophrenia is used as the foundation for the discussion of clinical diagnosis, differential diagnosis, epidemiology, pathophysiology, genetics and treatment.  Pertinent details of schizophrenia-related disorders will be discussed (compared and contrasted whenever the case) within the confines of the broader schizophrenia mainframe.

== Clinical Manifestations and Definition of Terms ==
* '''Positive Symptoms''' are thought of as an excess of normal function. Overvalued misperceptions that become illusions and hallucinations and overvalued ideas that become delusions (fixed ideas) are classical examples of positive symptoms. 

* '''Negative Symptoms''' refer to a lack of what is considered to be normal function. Normally, a degree of volitional ability is expected; therefore decreased or absent volition (avolition) is a negative symptom. Similarly, a lack of motivation (amotivation), a lack of ability to enjoy things (anhedonia), or decreased ability to engage in social activities (social isolation) are other classical negative symptoms.

* '''Catatonia''' refers to two extreme (and fundamentally opposite) states. Agitated catatonia refers to a state of excessive, extreme behavioral agitation (not in response to internal stimuli), while catatonic immobility refers to extreme negativism (the patient actively resists any attempts to have his extremities or whole body moved) or catalepsy (waxy flexibility). Other catatonic symptoms include posturing (assuming strange body postures), grimacing, mannerisms, stereotyped movements, echolalia (where the patient repeats in parrot-like fashion the words of another person), and echopraxia (where the patient imitates in mirror-like fashion the movements of another person).

* '''Disorganized thinking''' ('''formal thought disorder''') refers to an alteration in the thought process. Normally the flow of thinking is coherent, linear and goal directed. In psychotic patients the associations may be loose to the point of being non-existent. The psychotic patient’s thought form may present with tangentiality (ideas are only marginally connected) or circumstantiality (the patient responds to questions moving in gradually more focused, concentric circles until eventually reaching the answer). In extreme cases, even the structure of the sentence might be lost which results in word salad.

* '''Disorganized behavior''' refers to the patient difficulty to complete most goal oriented activities. A range of behaviors have been described: actively responding to inner stimuli (e.g., talking to oneself or shouting for no apparent reason), aimless, repetitive movements and activities, poor ability to maintain one’s basic hygiene and perform routine actives of daily living (which often results in a disheveled appearance, and poor grooming and hygiene), or uncensored public sexual activity (being naked, or masturbating in public).

* '''Active phase''' refers to a period of time when a combination of the above symptoms are prominently manifested.

* '''Prodromal''' and '''residual''' phases refer to periods of time of attenuated symptoms that either precede (prodromal) or follow (residual) the active phase period.

* '''Cognitive Symptoms''': Memory (more specifically working memory), attention, concentration, processing speed, problem solving (executive functioning), and social cognition are a few of the many cognitive domains shown to be impaired in schizophrenia.

* '''Insight''' is a multidimensional concept referring to awareness of illness, specific symptoms and their consequences, as well as need for treatment. Insight refers to the patient’s ability to understand that some of his or her non-reality based experiences (usually hallucinatory experiences and delusional  representations) are secondary to having schizophrenia rather than reality. Awareness and attribution of both current and past symptoms represent specific aspects of insight.   Additional dimensions of insight include a more global understanding of the diagnosis and need for treatment. 

=== Approach to the Patient with Acute Psychosis ===

The following major issues should be kept in the forefront:

#What is the most accurate diagnosis?
#Is there a treatable or reversible component to the psychosis?
#Is the patient safe?
#Can the physician help to alleviate the positive symptoms?
#Can the physician help to alleviate the negative, cognitive symptoms and insight deficits to improve social/functional outcomes?

=== History ===
The history should clarify the onset (acute versus gradual), tempo (slow/protracted versus rapid), chronology, course (persistent versus episodic), and type of symptoms.

'''Onset and tempo'''

An acute or subacute onset of psychosis may represent delirium, psychosis due to a general medical condition, or a substance induced psychosis and should trigger the search for intoxication, infection, or metabolic derangement. 

'''Duration'''

According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) a diagnosis of schizophrenia requires the presence of a combination of prominent positive, negative, disorganized thinking (formal thought disorder), catatonia, or behavior type of symptoms for at least a month (active phase), with a total duration of the episode (including active phase, and some type of prodromal or residual symptoms) for at least 6 months and resulting in social and occupational dysfunction. 

A schizophrenia-like presentation that lasts more than a month but less than 6 months would be more appropriately diagnosed as '''schizophreniform disorder'''. '''Brief psychotic disorder''' should be diagnosed when the total duration of symptoms is shorter than a month. 
'''Schizoaffective disorder''' trumps schizophrenia if in addition to stand alone episodes of psychotic symptoms there is also a long history of affective symptoms, and the affective symptoms occurred for a longer time than the psychotic symptoms.

'''Chronology''' 

Refers to the temporal rapport between the different symptoms. Clarifying what started and what followed are essential in ruling out phenomenologically overlapping disorders. If it is determined that the psychotic symptoms ''followed'' a medical condition or drug (prescribed or illicit) '''psychotic disorder due to a general medical condition''', '''substance induced psychotic disorder''', or '''delirium''' need to be considered first. '''Mood disorder with psychotic symptoms''' is diagnosed if the history shows that psychotic symptoms ''always occurred'' in the context of already present, and most often severe affective (depressive and manic) symptoms.

'''Course'''

A clearly episodic course is most times indicative of a primary affective disorder. Unfortunately, schizophrenia tends to be chronic, with some level of residual symptoms following the active phase for most patients. However, for schizophrenia, after one year since the onset of the acute phase symptoms, DSM allows for a number of course based specifiers including: single episode with partial/total remission, episodic with/without inter-episode residual symptoms, and continuous.

=== Physical and Neurological Examination ===
A thorough general and neurological examination is recommended.  

'''General physical examination'''

Is recommended to first rule out a systemic disease that may be responsible for the psychotic syndrome. A number of non-specific physical abnormalities including an arched palate, narrow or wide–set eyes or subtle ear malformations are more frequently reported in patients with schizophrenia than in the general population. For patients treated with antipsychotics a physical exam will document the general state of health and is important to exclude side effects of medication. Side effects include orthostatic hypotension, hypersalivaton (secondary to clozapine), anticholinergic syndrome (dry mouth, and tachycardia secondary to anticholinergics), hyperprolactinemia (lactation secondary to D2 antagonism), and metabolic syndrome (most common with clozapine and olanzapine). 

'''Neurological examination''' 

Is recommended to rule out neurological conditions that may present with psychotic manifestations; of note, abnormal focal neurological signs are not typically found in primary psychotic disorders. Such findings should prompt the clinician to do a more extensive neurological work-up. In addition, a neurological exam is necessary to exclude the presence of ''soft neurological signs'' and ''abnormal involuntary movements''. ''Soft (neurological) signs'', while not pathognomonic, are frequently seen in schizophrenia, where &quot;soft&quot; denotes the absence of a clearly localized (&quot;hard&quot;) central nervous pathology that can explain the observed deficits. They include: 
*Sensory function integration abnormalities include poor audio—visual integration, astereognosis (the inability to identify an object by touch without visual input), and agraphaesthesia (the inability to recognize writing on the skin purely by the sensation of touch). 
*Motor function integration abnormalities might include balance and gait abnormalities, poor coordination, intention tremor, finger—thumb opposition difficulties. 

In addition, a number of abnormal involuntary movements have been classically described in chronic schizophrenia (before the neuroleptic age) but have been much more prevalent since the introduction of antipsychotic dopamine antagonist drugs.  These include: 
*''Akathisia'', which refers to low amplitude, high frequency movement typically involving the lower extremities. The patient reports a feeling of intolerable restlessness, specifically manifested as a need to continuously move one’s feet. The patient cannot stop pacing (paces in place when asked to sit or stand without walking), 
*''Dystonia'', which refers to a high amplitude, low frequency, spastic type of movement, typically involving an isolated muscle group, e.g., oculopharogyric crisis (eyes turned upwards), torticollis (neck turned sideways), laryngeal spasm (rare but serious as it might result in asphyxia), opisthotonus (arched back, rare, painful)
*''Dyskinesia'', which refers to low amplitude, repetitive, moderate frequency, pseudo-parkinsonian movements that may involve any muscle group but most typically involve the fingers, hands, toes, feet, lips and lower face muscles (including perioral and mandibular muscles)
*''Tremor'', which refers to a low amplitude, high frequency, repetitive movement. Tremor of the hands and fingers can be spontaneous or can be elicited by asking the patient to put his arms in a horizontal position and stretch his fingers. In addition, a parkinsonian pill rolling tremor may also be observed. In patients taking lithium a fine tremor(very low amplitude, very high frequency) may be seen.

=== Mental Status Examination (MSE) ===
*'''Appearance:''' disheveled or bizarre appearance may be a clue to underlying psychosis. Impaired reality testing commonly results in poor grooming and hygiene.
*'''Attitude:''' paranoid patients may be unwilling to co-operate during an interview, while very psychotic patients my be unable to engage with the interviewer.
*'''Motor behavior:''' posturing, repetitive gestures, extreme psychomotor agitation (without any apparent precipitants or retardation) can indicate a catatonic presentation. Alternatively, the patient may present with psychomotor agitation in response to overwhelming internal stimuli (e.g., loud, demeaning voices or threatening visions) or because of severe paranoid ideation.
*'''Mood:''' patient’s reported mood can vary from good to depressed or afraid.
*'''Affect:''' paranoid patients present with guarded affect, eyes scanning the room, and a closed up body language.
*'''Speech/thought process:''' can be vague, circumstantial or overtly disorganized. At times nonsensical neologisms, word salad, clang (rhyming, nonsensical associations) are present.
*'''Thought content:''' may be positive for delusional ideation (most common ideas of references and paranoid delusions). In addition, the patient may harbor suicidal and violent thoughts due to his persistent psychotic symptoms or, at times, related to concomitant depressive symptoms.
*'''Perceptual disturbances:''' auditory hallucinations can be commanding and order the patient to kill himself or other people. When visual hallucinations are present they tend to be unpleasant as a rule and are often overtly terrifying.
*'''Insight and Judgement:''' judgement is mostly impaired and the patient has very limited, if any, insight. 
*'''Cognition:''' with the possible exception of decreased attention, other cognitive deficits may not be obvious during a cursory MSE.

=== Cognitive Examination ===
In schizophrenia neuropsychological testing routinely reveals deficits in working memory, executive functioning, social functioning, processing speed, verbal fluency, and/or reaction time abnormalities. Unfortunately, the ability to test for these deficits routinely in clinical practice is limited by the lack of good, time efficient screening cognitive instruments for schizophrenia and related disorders.

=== Laboratory Tests ===
There are no tests that can rule in a diagnosis of schizophrenia or related disorders. The role of laboratory investigations are to rule out substance induced disorders and general medical conditions that can present with a psychotic syndrome; to establish a baseline and monitor physiological functions that can be affected by, or can affect the metabolism of psychotropic medications; and monitor drug levels when necessary.

'''Investigations to exclude a substance induced disorder or general medical condition:'''
* [http://www.labtestsonline.org/understanding/analytes/drug_abuse/test.html urine] or blood toxicology screen: should be performed routinely in all patients presenting with new onset or exacerbated psychotic symptoms, as a number of illicit drugs can cause/worsen psychosis (e.g., hallucinogens, cocaine, stimulants, marijuana).
* [http://www.labtestsonline.org/understanding/analytes/cbc/test.html Complete blood cell count] (CBC): blood dyscrasias can point to an underlying vitamin deficit that may manifest with psychosis (e.g., pernicious or megaloblastic anaemia as a sign of vitamin B12/folate deficits)
* [http://www.labtestsonline.org/understanding/analytes/syphilis/test.html Rapid plasma reagin] (RPR): done to rule out (tertiary) syphilis
* [http://www.labtestsonline.org/understanding/analytes/thyroid_panel/glance.html Thyroid panel]: indicated when there is a clinical suspicion for hypo or hyperthyroidism
* Brain Imaging:
:* Structural brain imaging (CT or MRI) is indicated to rule out other brain pathologies (e.g., multiple strokes, demyelination, masses). Neuroimaging studies do not show a pattern of findings specific for schizophrenia or related disorders and may be normal early in the course of the disease.  As schizophrenia progresses, enlarged ventricles and diffuse cortical atrophy becomes apparent. MRI scans may also show atrophy of the parahippocampal gyrus, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, mesolimbic system, the anterior cingulate cortex, and planum temporalis asymmetry reversal or generalized reductions in grey and white matter.
:* Functional brain imaging studies (PET and functional MRI) demonstrate abnormalities in the same regions. However, none of these changes are pathognomonic for schizophrenia or related disorders.

A liver function panel and chemistry panel (to document renal function) are recommended to establish a baseline for physiological functions that can affect the metabolism of psychotropic medications. Other tests that may be indicated to monitor side effects of psychotropic medication include a blood glucose level, a lipid panel, and an ECG (as some antipsychotics have the potential of prolonging the QTc interval). A prolactin level should only be measured when prolactinemia is suspected on clinical grounds.

The following drug levels need monitoring: lithium (0.7 to 1.2 mEq/L), carbamazepine (5 to 12 mcg/mL), and valproic acid (50 to 100 mcg/mL). A clozapine level above 350 ng/mL
is recommended to establish compliance and has been shown to correlate with improved efficacy for refractory schizophrenia. There is no clear evidence of a therapeutic range  for other antipsychotics.

== Specific Types of Primary Psychotic Disorders ==

=== General Considerations and Differential Diagnosis ===
When a patient presents with a psychotic syndrome the first order of business is to establish if the presenting symptoms are due to another psychiatric or somatic condition. In other words, a psychotic syndrome is classified as &quot;primary psychosis&quot; only after other possible underlying pathologies have been ruled out.

In terms of somatic contributors, the main suspects should include processes that may affect the brain either acutely or chronically, in which case a diagnosis of psychotic disorder due to a general medical condition is appropriate. A substance induced psychotic disorder should be diagnosed if there is a likely cause and effect relationship between a substance (including medication, OTC products or illicit drugs) and the psychotic presentation. Psychiatric underlying pathologies include severe depressive and bipolar disorder, which may present with mood congruent psychotic features. As discussed, under stress, some personality disorders may present with transient psychotic symptoms. 

The differential diagnosis between different primary psychotic disorders should take into account the type and duration of symptoms. Virtually identical symptoms are seen in schizophrenia, brief psychotic disorder, and schizophreniform disorder. The symptom duration differentiates brief psychotic disorder (1 day to &lt;1 month) from schizophreniform disorder (1 month &lt;6 months) and schizophrenia (&gt;6 months). Delusional disorder is differentiated from schizophrenia based on prominent, non-bizarre delusions without any other associated symptoms. When distinct psychotic episodes are present but affective symptoms account for the majority of the clinical presentation a diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder should be considered.

== Schizophrenia ==

=== Conceptual History and Diagnostic Classification ===

* 1853: Morel’s curious cases of ''Démence Précoce'': [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9n%C3%A9dict_Morel Bénédict Morel] introduces the concept of ''Démence Précoce'',  literally &quot;early dementia&quot;, described  a distinct syndrome affecting teenagers and young adults. The syndrome is characterized by bizarre behavior and mental function, withdrawal and self neglect starting in adolescence. 

* 1868: Kahlbaum’s ''Katatonie'': [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Ludwig_Kahlbaum Karl Ludwig Kahlbaum] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ewald_Hecker Ewald Hecker] publish ''Die Gruppierung der psychischen Krankheiten '' (The Classification of Psychiatric Diseases). By considering the longitudinal course of psychiatric symptoms in addition to the clinical presentation Kahlbaum and Hecker were the first to describe and name a number of psychiatric syndromes including ''cyclothymia'', ''dysthymia'', ''paranoia'', ''catatonia'', and ''hebephrenia''. Kahlbaum’s ''Katatonie'' was characterized by stereotyped movements, outbursts of excitement and stupor.

* 1870: Ewald Hecker’s ''hebephrenia'' and ''cyclothymia'': Hecker differentiates between ''hebephrenia'', a disorder that begins in adolescence with erratic behavior followed by a rapid decline of all mental functions, and ''cyclothymia'', a cyclical mood disorder.

* 1891: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Pick Arnold Pick] reports on a case of a psychotic disorder which he calls ''Dementia Praecox'' 
* 1893: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emil_Kraepelin Emil Kraepelin’s] ''Dementia'' ''Praecox'': Kraepelin new classification of mental disorders distinguishes between ''dementia praecox'' and mood disorder (termed manic depression and including both unipolar and bipolar depression). 
:*''Dementia Praecox'': A &quot;sub-acute development of a peculiar simple condition of mental weakness occurring at a youthful age.&quot; 
:* Distinct from ''catatonia'' and ''dementia paranoides''. 
:* Kraepelin’s concept relied heavily on course (chronic versus episodic) and prognosis
* 1899: ''hebefrenia'', ''catatonia'' and ''dementia paranoides'' as subtypes of ''dementia praecox''. 
* 1919: Kraepelin writes that &quot;it is becoming increasingly clear that we cannot distinguish satisfactorily between these two illnesses and this brings home the suspicion that our formulation of the problem may be incorrect.&quot; 
* 1908: [http://www.answers.com/topic/eugene-bleuler Eugen Bleuler]’s ''Schizophrenia'' gk. skhizein &quot;to split&quot;+ phren (gen. phrenos) &quot;diaphragm, heart, mind&quot;, where &quot;split mind&quot; referred to being split off from reality and unable to distinguish what is real from what is not real. Of note, Bleuler never implied that people with schizophrenia have split personalities; he proposed the term of schizophrenia to describe the separation of function between personality, thinking, memory, and perception. 
:* Bleuler 4 A's: flattened Affect, Autism, impaired Association of ideas and Ambivalence. 
:* Bleuler proposal for a new name also stemmed from his dissatisfaction with the implications of dementia praecox label. Bleuler noted that schizophrenia was NOT a dementia, as some of his patients improved.

* 1887 – 1967: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Schneider Kurt Schneider]  described the first rank symptoms (FRS), thought to be specific for schizophrenia psychosis. He included thought insertion/broadcast/withdrawal, made feelings/impulses/actions/somatic sensations (a type of delusion), third person auditory hallucinations (running commentary or arguments), delusional perception, and thought echo (''echo de la pensee'' or ''gendankenlautwerden'') – a type of hallucination. Only 58% of patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia experience at least one FRS, while 20% never experience FRS. Furthermore, 10% of patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia experience FRS.


*Modern positive and negative symptoms based classification systems: 
::* '''Positive''' symptoms include distortions or excesses of normal functioning such as, hallucinations, delusions, disorganized thinking and speech, and inappropriate affect. Frequently hallucinations are auditory in nature; rarely  they may be visual, tactile or olfactory. Delusions are fixed false beliefs held despite negative evidence, and are not consistent with cultural norms. Types include persecutory, referential, somatic, grandiose, etc. Positive symptoms are generally more responsive to treatment than negative symptoms.
::* '''Negative''' symptoms involve a decrease or absence of normal behavior. They include affective flattening, impoverishment of speech and language, avolition, amotivation, lack of interest, anhedonia, and social isolation.
* Modern classifications: 
::*Andreasen's Positive and Negative Symptoms Type 
::*Crow Type I and II:
:::* Type I – positive symptoms, good response to treatment, relatively better outcome
:::* Type II – negative symptoms, poorer response to treatment, relatively poor outcome, MRI changes.

=== Current classification – ICD 10/ DSM-IV-TR ===
Common ICD/DSM types:&lt;ref name=&quot;DSM&quot;/&gt;
* ''Paranoid'' schizophrenia:
:* Prominent delusions, auditory hallucinations
:* Usually minimal thought disorder or negative symptoms
* ''Catatonic'' schizophrenia is characterized by prominent psychomotor symptoms e.g.,  violent excitement, posturing, waxy flexibility, automatic obedience, perseveration, stupor.
* ''Residual'' schizophrenia or &quot;defect state&quot;, when positive symptoms give way to negative symptoms.
* ''Simple'' schizophrenia refers to insidious development of negative symptoms without positive symptoms
DSM IV only:&lt;ref name=&quot;DSM&quot;/&gt; 
* ''Disorganized'' schizophrenia: mainly thought disorder, and negative symptoms, without prominent positive or affective symptoms.
ICD 10 only:
* ''Hebephrenic'' schizophrenia: affective abnormality, thought disorder, mannerisms. May have chronic course.

=== Epidemiology and Risk Factors ===
The life time prevalence of schizophrenia is between 0.5-1.5% in the general population and is one of the ten leading causes of disability worldwide. Of note, this 1 in 100 rate has been shown to be remarkably constant across different historical periods and across different cultures. The annual incidence is reported to be in the range of 0.5 to 5 per 10,000. The onset of schizophrenia is usually between the ages of 20-45. Most times, the course of the disorder is chronic and characterized by a gradual, progressive deterioration. However partial or complete recovery is reported to occur for 30-60% of patients following a first episode of schizophrenia.* About 20-40% of patients with schizophrenia attempt suicide at least once during their lifetime, and about 10-15% die of suicide. The prevalence in males and females is equal.&lt;ref name=&quot;DSM&quot;&gt;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR. PsychiatryOnline.com Online ISBN 0-89042-334-2. Accessed 03/01/2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The following risk factors have been reported for schizophrenia:
* Men tend to be diagnosed earlier than women (males age 15-25 years, females age 25 – 35 years)
* Seasonality: winter birth excess
* Schizoid and schizotypal personality disorders
* A family history of schizophrenia or major affective disorders
* A family with a high level of expressed emotions (EE)
* Schizophrenia tends to be more frequent in urban areas and in developed countries
* Lower socioeconomic status 
* Schizophrenia is more frequent in recent immigrants (deprivation, stress of immigration may increase risk)

=== Genetic Considerations ===
The rate of schizophrenia is increased in families with affected members. Mode of Transmission is unknown and likely to be multi-factorial, possibly polygenic. 70% of the heritability of schizophrenia is genetic. Adoption studies have shown an 
increased incidence of schizophrenia spectrum disorders among adopted offspring of schizophrenic parents. When one parent has schizophrenia there is a twelve fold increase in the risk of developing the disorder; with one affected sibling there is a 9 fold increase in risk; for monozygotic, identical twins the rate of concordance is around 50%. Working memory appears to be heritable and showed significant associations with DISC1, reelin, and AKT1 in schizophrenia.

=== Pathology ===
While there are no structural or functional brain changes specific to schizophrenia or other psychotic disorders a number of abnormalities are reported. Enlarged ventricles, deep cortical sulci, diffuse gray and white matter loss, increased neuronal density, decreased synapse density, and an overall decrease in brain size have been reported in schizophrenia studies using structural brain imaging (CT, structural and diffusion sensor MRI studies) or postmortem observations. Smaller frontal and temporal lobes, lower volume hippocampus, thalamus, corpus callosum, and anterior cingulate, as well as larger caudate
and putamen have been reported in schizophrenia.

Decreased activation in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (during working memory task), and increased activation of the superior temporal gyrus (during auditory hallucinations) have been also reported in functional brain imaging (fMRI and PET) studies.

=== Etiopathological Theories ===

==== Neurodevelopmental Theories ====
Impaired fetal or neonatal brain development may sow the seeds for the onset of psychotic symptoms in later life. Patients with schizophrenia have a lower than average IQ, and often subtle/soft neurological signs.
A number of parental risk factors have been reported including multiparity, maternal bleeding during pregnancy, small baby size for gestational age, increased paternal age, and severe stress to mother during first trimester. 
In addition, the following environmental risk factors have been associated with increased risk of developing psychotic illness later in life: late winter birth, prenatal exposure to famine, in-utero exposure to analgesics, and cannabis use.

==== Biological factors ====

=====Electrophysiology=====

* P50 sensory gating deficits: following an auditory stimulus schizophrenia patients fail to gate a subsequent stimulus that follows closely (within the normal 50 msec suppression).
* Reduced P300 evoked response potential (ERP) [oddball deficit paradigm]: schizophrenia patients fail to respond to an odd ball stimulus administered during a series of otherwise identical stimuli.
* Prepulse Inhibition (PPI) Paradigm.

=====Neurotransmitters=====

Dopamine (DA)
:* Hypothesis: excessive DA activity in mesolimbic and cortical brain regions. Schizophrenia is the result of a dopaminergic hyper-salient state &lt;ref&gt;Kapur S.Psychosis as a state of aberrant salience: a framework linking biology, phenomenology, and pharmacology in schizophrenia.Am J Psychiatry. 2003 Jan;160(1):13-23&lt;/ref&gt;
:* Supporting evidence:
::* Postmortem studies: increase DA receptors in schizophrenia
::* HVA (dopamine metabolite) in plasma, CSF and severity of psychosis/response to neuroleptics 
::* DA Agonists
:::* Amphetamines release DA at synapses and cause positive symptoms (in people who do not have schizophrenia)
:::* L-dopa increases central DA concentrations and causes positive symptoms
:::* DA Antagonists: All effective antipsychotics are D2 receptor antagonists; efficacy correlates with D2 occupancy
:* Limitations:
::* Amphetamines and L-dopa do not produce negative symptoms
::* Antipsychotics are ineffective in 30% of patients
::* Antipsychotics block D2 receptors instantly but antipsychotic effect not evident for days

Serotonin
:* Hypothesis: serotonin excess
:* LSD and psilocybin are potent 5HT receptor agonists and cause positive symptoms of schizophrenia (in people who do not have schizophrenia)
:* Atypical antipsychotics are potent 5HT2 receptor antagonists
:* Limitations: LSD produces visual hallucinations which are uncommon in schizophrenia

Excitatory amino acids (EAAs): glutamate and aspartate
:* Hypothesis: EAAs deficit
:* Phenylcyclidine (PCP), which antagonizes EAA receptors, can produce positive and negative symptoms in people without schizophrenia
:* Glutamate agonists (e.g., glycine), may be modestly therapeutic in schizophrenia

==== Psychological Factors ====
*Freud: delusions as a way of making sense of a disturbed internal world (&quot;I need to respond with aggression to protect myself as everyone is attacking me&quot;).
*Klein: failure to resolve the paranoid/schizoid position
*Cameron: loss of conceptual boundaries
*Goldstein: concrete thinking
*Difficulties in filtering sensory input (see also electrophysiological findings)

==== Familial/Social Factors ====
*Probably more important in precipitating schizophrenia than causing it
*Lidz’s  marital schism/marital skew
*Bateson’s double bind theory
*High expressed emotion

==== Social Factors ====
*Social adversity in childhood and fetal life associated with risk of developing schizophrenia and other psychoses later in life 
*Risk factors for psychoses later in life (in developed countries):
:*households receiving social welfare benefits 
:*unemployment 
:*single-parent households 
:*low socioeconomic status 
:*rented apartments&lt;ref&gt;Wicks S, Hjern A, Gunnell D, et. Social adversity in childhood and the risk of developing psychosis: a national cohort study. Am J Psychiatry. 2005 Sep;162(9):1652-7&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Clinical Diagnosis ===
According to DSM-IV Schizophrenia is diagnosed when the patient presents with a combination of positive (delusions and hallucinations) and negative symptoms, which have been present for at least 6 months and have resulted in significant dysfunction. It is also accepted that disorganized speech/behavior and/or catatonic symptoms, when combined with other positive or negative symptoms, can count toward a diagnosis of schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is a diagnosis of exclusion; in other words, it is required that there are no other medical, psychiatric, or substance-induced conditions that would explain the patient’s diagnosis better than schizophrenia.&lt;ref name=&quot;DSM&quot;/&gt;

=== Differential Diagnosis ===
Early in the disease course, other etiologies of psychosis should be excluded. These include treatable conditions such as tertiary syphilis, vitamin deficiencies, brain tumor, drug and medication intoxication, chronic infection, and mood disorders. While neuroimaging studies (CT and MRI) do not show a single specific pattern with schizophrenia or related disorders and may be normal early in the course of the disease a screening CT is recommended for patients with a first episode of primary psychosis, especially for late or acute onsets. An affective psychosis (mania or depression with psychotic features) should be ruled out if affective symptoms preceded psychotic symptoms or are dominating the clinical picture at the time of presentation. A diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder is appropriate if historically the course has been dominated by affective symptoms and there are at least some episodes of &quot;pure&quot; psychosis i.e., independent of the affective background. Symptom duration will separate brief psychotic disorder (&lt;1 month), schizophereniform disorder (&lt;6 months), and schizophrenia (&gt;6 months).

=== Treatment ===
Hospitalization is recommended if the acute psychotic symptoms result in danger to self or others or significant impairment. 

==== Biological ====
Traditionally, dopamine 2 (D2) antagonists (blockers), most often labelled as first generation (typical) neuroleptics, have been the pillar of schizophrenia treatment. 
* D2 blockers, by decreasing the presumably excessive mesolimbic dopamine, have established efficacy for positive psychotic symptoms; however, due to concomitant blockade of the frontostriatal dopamine pathway, where dopamine is presumably decreased all along in schizophrenia, they do not improve (and in some cases can worsen) negative, cognitive symptoms, and/or functional/social outcomes. 
* Due to an alteration of the physiological dopamine/acetylcholine ratio in the basal ganglia these drugs also have a number of extra-pyramidal adverse effects (EPSEs) both short term (acute dystonia, dyskinesia, akathisia) and long term (parkinsonism and tardive diskinesia).  
* Finally, following a dopamine blockade in the tuberoinfundibular system, there is a prolactin increase with common sexual side effects, including decreased sexual interest, sexual difficulties, lactation and (in men) gynaecomastia.
* The side effects of typical neuroleptics can be stigmatizing and are a major reason for non-adherence to treatment.
Some of the above issues have been resolved with the advent of the second generation antipsychotics (SGA) or atypical neuroleptics, a drug class that tends to share the mechanism of D2 and 5HT2 (serotonin) antagonism. We say &quot;tends to share&quot; rather than &quot;share the characteristic&quot; as the second generation drugs show a number of differences in terms of both receptor profile and affinities. To illustrate, the prototypical atypical neuroleptic is clozapine, a drug that has strong D4 and 5HT2A antagonism but only partial D2 antagonism. 
* SGAs have fewer EPSEs and tend to be better for negative symptoms than typicals (not increasing negative symptoms).
* Some of the atypicals (e.g., olanzapine, clozapine) increase the risk for metabolic adverse effects including significant weight gain, diabetes and dyslipidemia.
* Clozapine is recommended for treatment resistant schizophrenia.
* Generally SGAs, with the exception of olanzapine and clozapine, are first line treatments. This preference is based more on better tolerability (less EPSEs and cognitive adverse effects) than greater efficacy. On a case by case basis first generation antipsychotics (FGAs) may represent a reasonable alternative.&lt;ref&gt;APA Practice Guidelines Guideline Watch (September 2009): Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia.PsychiatryOnline.com Online ISBN 0-89042-336-9. Accessed 03/01/2011&lt;/ref&gt; Perphenazine and molindone efficacy and overall tolerability has been shown to be similar to SGAs.
General prescribing principles:
* Initial management may include use of sedative medication such as lorazepam.
* IM medication may be required in a very disturbed, involuntary patient. 
* Depot (long-acting) neuroleptics are indicated when treatment adherence is problematic.
* Polypharmacy is common yet not supported by evidence.
* The goal of treatment is stability on monotherapy at the lowest effective dose.

==== Psychological (Individual and Family Interventions) ====
*Good evidence: 
:*Education of patient and carers
:*Reduction of high expressed emotion:  shown to affect relapse rates
:*Supportive, solution oriented psychotherapy
*Unclear benefit:
:*Cognitive behavioral therapy
:*Cognitive and functional rehabilitation
:*Self–help unclear

==== Social ====
* Good evidence: 
:*Regular intensive case management
* Unclear benefit:
:* As needed case management
:* Consumer based organizations

=== Prognosis ===
15-25% of patients diagnosed with schizophrenia have one episode and no residual impairment. 25-40% have recurrent episodes and no residual impairment. 5-10% have recurrent episodes and develop significant non-progressive impairment. 30-40% have recurrent episodes and develop significant progressive impairment. Therefore, the majority of patients do not recover fully BUT DO NOT have a chronic unremitting course. There is little evidence that antipsychotics have altered the course of illness for most patients. However, evidence suggests that prolonged psychosis which is untreated has a bad prognosis. Suicide rate is up to 15%.&lt;ref name=&quot;DSM&quot;/&gt;

Good prognostic factors:
* Female gender
* Older age of onset
* Married
* Higher socioeconomic status
* Living in a developing (as opposed to developed) country
* Good premorbid personality
* No previous psych history
* Good education and employment record
* Acute onset, affective symptoms, good adherence to medication.

Predicting risk of suicide:
* Acute exacerbation of psychosis
* Depressive symptoms
* History of attempted suicide
* Male gender
* Command auditory hallucinations
{{BookCat}}

== Schizophreniform Disorder ==
==== Clinical Manifestations and Diagnosic Considerations ==== 
The clinical presentation is identical to schizophrenia, however impairment in function is not a requirement. The required duration of symptoms is of at least a month but less than 6 months. If symptoms persist for longer than 6 months it is appropriate to change the diagnosis to schizophrenia.&lt;ref name=&quot;DSM&quot;/&gt; The diagnosis requires for other pathologies that may be responsible for the clinical manifestations (e.g., medical and drug use) to be ruled out before a diagnosis of schizophreniform disorder is made. It is not clear if schizophreniform disorder is a different disorder or just a more acute, better prognosis type of schizophrenia.

==== Subtypes/Specifiers ====
'''With good prognostic features''':
* Good premorbid level of function
* Abrupt onset
* Confusion
* Absence of flat affect
'''Without good prognostic features''': when less than 2 of the above features are present&lt;ref name=&quot;DSM&quot;/&gt;

==== Epidemiology ==== 
The prevalence is low overall. There may be differences between developed countries (estimated around 0.2%) and developing countries (estimated around 1%).&lt;ref name=&quot;DSM&quot;/&gt;

==== Treatment Considerations ====
* Hospitalization is recommended if the acute psychotic symptoms result in danger to self or others or significant impairment.
* Acute psychosis should be treated with antipsychotics. Second generation antipsychotics, with the exception of olanzapine, are preferred first line. 
* Treatment should be continued for one year and reassessed after.
* Supportive and solution oriented psychotherapy is beneficial.

==== Prognosis ==== 
About one third of the patients recover. The rest of the patients initially diagnosed with schizophreniform disorder progress to schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.&lt;ref name=&quot;DSM&quot;/&gt;

== Brief Psychotic Disorder ==
==== Clinical Manifestations and Diagnosic Considerations ====
Phenomenologically there is no difference between brief psychotic disorder (BPD), schizophreniform disorder, and schizophrenia. The difference between these three diagnoses is based on symptom duration. As indicated by its name, the duration of symptoms in BPD are brief: more than 1 day but less than 1 month. When the symptoms last longer than a month but less than 6 months the diagnosis changes to schizophreniform disorder. The psychotic symptoms should not be part of a pre-existing medical, drug induced, or primary psychiatric condition (including other psychotic or mood disorders).&lt;ref name=&quot;DSM&quot;/&gt;

==== Subtypes/Specifiers ====
DSM-IV-TR specifiers include:
* With marked stressor(s) (brief reactive psychosis)
* Without marked stressor(s)
* With postpartum onset: when onset of symptoms is within 4 weeks postpartum&lt;ref name=&quot;DSM&quot;/&gt;

==== Epidemiology ==== 
Rare overall but more frequent in developing countries compared to developed countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;DSM&quot;/&gt;

==== Treatment Considerations ==== 
Hospitalization is recommended if the acute psychotic symptoms result in danger to self or others or significant impairment. Neuroleptics for short term treatment should be considered on a case by case basis.

==== Prognosis ==== 
By definition full remission of symptoms and return to prior level of functioning is expected within a month.

== Schizoaffective Disorder ==
==== Clinical Manifestations and Diagnostic Considerations ====
The patient presents with symptoms of schizophrenia, mania, depression or a combination of mood and psychotic symptoms. The history is significant for at least one distinct episode of psychosis not overlapping with mood symptoms and a relative temporal predominance of mood symptoms.

Differential diagnoses should include drug induced and medical conditions with secondary psychotic symptoms. While patients with schizophrenia can experience mood symptoms their duration is relatively short relative to the total duration of illness. When the psychotic symptoms represent a culmination of a severe mood episode a diagnosis of mood disorders (i.e., bipolar and major depression) with psychotic features should also be included in the differential. &lt;ref name=&quot;DSM&quot;/&gt;

==== Epidemiology ==== 
Unclear but possibly less common than schizophrenia.&lt;ref name=&quot;DSM&quot;/&gt;

==== Treatment Considerations ==== 
Hospitalization is recommended if the acute psychotic symptoms result in danger to self or others or significant impairment.

Antipsychotics are recommended for acute psychotic symptoms. Second generation antipsychotics (SGA), excluding olanzepine, should be considered as first line. Mood stabilizers including lithium, valproic acid, and carbamazepine, or SGA are recommended for acute manic symptoms. A neuroleptic-mood stabilizer combination may work better than either agent alone, and augmenting a neuroleptic with lithium or valproic acid should be considered as an augmentation strategy in cases of poor response to neuroleptic monotherapy. Antidepressants should be used conservatively for depressive symptoms. Close monitoring is required as an antidepressant can precipitate a manic switch in a patient with schizoaffective disorder.

==== Prognosis ====
Better than schizophrenia but not as good as mood disorders.&lt;ref name=&quot;DSM&quot;/&gt;

== Delusional Disorder ==
==== Clinical Manifestations and Diagnostic Considerations====
The patient presents with non-bizarre delusional beliefs but most often the mental status examination is otherwise fairly normal. The delusional ideas are restricted to a specific subject and do not contaminate other mental processes. Other psychotic symptoms may include olfactory/gustatory hallucinations, which may be prominent and are closely related to the main delusional themes.  If prominent auditory/visual hallucinations are present a diagnosis of schizophrenia rather than delusional disorder may be more appropriate. Associated symptoms are rare but may include mood or anxiety symptoms. When present, such symptoms are often secondary to the delusional beliefs (e.g., &quot;of course I feel anxious with the NSA following me around the clock&quot;). Other conditions (medical, drug induced, other primary psychiatric disorders, including other psychotic or mood disorders) cannot better explain the clinical picture.&lt;ref name=&quot;DSM&quot;/&gt;

==== Subtypes/Specifiers ====
* Erotomanic type: the patient erroneously believes that another person is in love with him/her
* Grandiose type: the patient erroneously believes that he/she possesses enormous wealth, power, authority, knowledge, or has a special relationship to a deity or famous person 
* Jealous type: the patient erroneously believes that his/her partner is unfaithful 
* Persecutory type: the patient erroneously that he/she is targeted for punishment or retaliation
* Somatic type: the patient erroneously believes that he/she has a medical condition or body deformity that is overlooked or misdiagnosed
* Mixed type: delusions characteristic of more than one of the above types but without any one dominating theme
* Unspecified type&lt;ref name=&quot;DSM&quot;/&gt;

==== Epidemiology ==== 
Rare. According to DSM-IV-TR estimated around 0.03% in the general population; 1-2% of all inpatient psychiatric admissions. The most common subtype is the persecutory type.&lt;ref name=&quot;DSM&quot;/&gt;

==== Treatment Considerations ==== 
Hospitalization is recommended if the acute psychotic symptoms result in danger to self or others or significant impairment. 

==== Prognosis ====
Variable: the jealous type may wane and wax or remit; the persecutory type is often chronic.&lt;ref name=&quot;DSM&quot;/&gt;

== Shared Psychotic Disorder (Folie à Deux) ==
==== Clinical Manifestations and Diagnostic Considerations ====
Mental status examination is significant for non-bizarre delusions but otherwise is within normal limits. There are minimal associated mood or anxiety symptoms; if present such symptoms appear secondary to the tenaciously held delusional beliefs. History is significant for a close relationship with another person who presents with similar delusional beliefs and meets criteria for a psychotic disorder. The patient who first presents with delusional symptoms is designated as the &quot;primary,&quot; the &quot;secondary&quot; follows. Also, usually, the primary is dominant in his/her relationship with the secondary, who acts as a more passive recipient. For example, a parent with schizophrenia and chronic paranoid delusions about FBI surveillance may be the primary while his/her child, who only recently started to believe that indeed there are FBI cameras hidden on their property, is the secondary. Other diagnoses, including medical or drug induced disorders as well as other psychotic or mood disorders, should be excluded if folie à deux is to be diagnosed.&lt;ref name=&quot;DSM&quot;/&gt;

==== Epidemiology ====
Rare overall but statistics may be misleading due to under-reporting. Preliminary data suggest an increased prevalence in women.&lt;ref name=&quot;DSM&quot;/&gt;

==== Treatment Considerations ====
Hospitalization is recommended if the acute psychotic symptoms result in danger to self or others or significant impairment. Usually removing the secondary from the primary's environment is sufficient to promote complete remission of symptoms. In addition, the primary's condition should be treated as indicated. Interestingly, a remission of the primary's symptoms is followed by the remission of the secondary's delusional beliefs.

==== Prognosis ====
When the secondary is separated from the primary the prognosis is good.&lt;ref name=&quot;DSM&quot;/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
When preparing your advertisement, you should first define your product's Unique Selling Proposition (USP). To find the USP, ask yourself &quot;How is this product different?&quot;

Make a list of your product's pros and cons. This will help you think about what message you want your ad to send.

'''Positioning''' is an attempt to place a product into a certain category in consumers' minds: &quot;the best&quot;, for example (best deodorant, best soda, etc.) (&quot;The best&quot; is, however, extremely difficult to establish for a new brand). Types of positioning are '''Against''' (eg, Hertz vs. Avis, 7-up vs. colas), '''Niche''' (a sub-division of a category), '''New''', and '''Traditional'''.

A Brand Character Statement sets the tone for an entire campaign.

A simple way to start preparing your advertisement is with this statement: &quot;Advertising will ____A_____ ____B_____ that ____C_____ is ____D_____. Support will be ____E_____. Tone will be ____F_____.&quot; where A is a verb, B is a target demographic (such as, &quot;girls between 14-18 years old&quot;), C is your product, D is an adjective or phrase. E is what the meat of your ad will be. F is your ad's &quot;attitude&quot;.

For example, &quot;Advertising will ''convince'' ''artistic types age 18-35'' that ''Apple computers'' are ''hip and cool.'' Support will be ''two men discussing Macs and PCs.'' Tone will be ''humorous.''&quot;

Part B of this strategy statement is the target audience. Advertisers use many methods to gain information about this group, including demographics, psychographics (how the target thinks), and focus groups.

Part C is the product itself. Advertisers spend time studying this as well. Important questions to ask are &quot;Why would anybody buy this?&quot; &quot;What's the product's advantage?&quot; and &quot;What is the client's image?&quot; The last one is important to consider in order to make sure that your ad doesn't jar with the public perception the company has created for itself. For example, hip or edgy ads probably won't go over well with a company that has a public image of being &quot;conservative&quot; and/or &quot;family friendly.&quot;

'''Support''' is anything that can demonstrate or otherwise back up the premise presented in the first sentence. Some examples are facts (e.g., statistics), images, or a scenario.
*'''Reason Why''' - How a product delivers a benefit.
*'''Combination''' - Two or more benefits are demonstrated.
*'''Permission to Believe''' - A clever story or character(s) make claim(s) believable.
*'''Nine-Wheel Logic''' - Specious support used when real support would be too awkward.
*'''Image''' - An attitude or lifestyle that advertiser attempts to link to product.

A strong &quot;call to action&quot; is another element used to good effect.

===Exercises===
#Pick 5 products and write up USPs for them.
#Pick 10 products and write a strategic statement for each one using the formula above.
#For each of the 5 types of support mentioned above, find one ad that exemplifies it.
#Choose a brand and reposition it.

==The FCB Grid==
[[Image:Fcb grid.png|right|thumb|300px|The FCB Grid.]]

The FCB Grid was created by Richard Vaughn. With this model, messages are categorized by &quot;thinking&quot; and &quot;feeling&quot;, &quot;low&quot; and &quot;high.&quot;

*Low Think (practicality, pragmatism)
*High Think
*Low Feel (sensuality, pleasure)
*High Feel (product as extension of self)

A '''Low Feel''' commercial demonstrates the pleasure obtained by using the product. This approach is popular for foods.

A '''High Feel''' commercial could emphasize how the product makes the consumer hip or cool. This approach is popular for advertising products like clothing, shoes, or sportscars.
==The Harris Grid==
[[Image:harris grid.png|left|thumb|300px|The Harris Grid.]]

Tom Harris created the Harris Grid for preparing MPR campaigns. It measures a product's level of interest in consumers versus the level of interest in mass media.

Some examples:
*'''High Consumer/High Media'''. Computers, cars, movies, and high-tech gadgets fall into this category. These products ''make'' news, so they should have high-profile campaigns.

*'''Low Consumer/High Media'''. Cereals, vitamins, and medications fall into this category. These products also make news, but are not very interesting to consumers. It is therefore important to highlight new scientific findings that are beneficial to the product's image.

==Y&amp;R Creative Workplan==
The firm of Young &amp; Rubicam have a process called the &quot;Creative Workplan.&quot; This crafts a strategy that plans how to attain an ''objective'', which solves a ''problem'', defined by a '''key fact'''. In other words, the advertising is designed in order to solve a problem. For example, the problem may be low sales, or a need to change the corporation's image.

To start, define the problem and identify the key fact showing the cause of it. Then, state your objective (what to do to solve the problem).

The four parts of the Creative Workplan's Creative Strategy are:
#'''Prospect Definition''' - The &quot;prospect&quot; referred to here is the demographic you are aiming your ad at (also known as a target audience). How is the product used by the prospect? Use demographics and psychographics.
#'''Principal Competition''' - Why would the consumer buy the competition's product instead?
#'''Consumer Benefit or Promise''' - What does the product do for the prospect?
#'''Reason Why''' - Rationale for how a product delivers on its claim (e.g., &quot;Avocados are good for you because they contain 'heart-healthy' fats that help lower cholesterol&quot;)

==GE Focus System==
*'''Focus on the Receiver'''
*'''Focus on the Proposition'''
*'''Dramatize the Proposition''' - &quot;Break the boredom barrier!&quot;

==Return on Investment (ROI) System==
The ROI System was designed the firm of DDB/Needham. While covering the same territory as other systems (the target, a product claim, support for the claim) it also looks at creating a corporate &quot;personality&quot;, as well as personality of individual products. Another important aspect of the ROI System is &quot;aperture&quot;: the timing and placement of the ad to maximize success. The system helps you to determine the cheapest media for the greatest impact.

==The Ladder==

[[Image:Ladder.png|right|thumb]]

Types of advertising messages can be arranged in a hierarchical ladder, based on what perspective they use to discuss the product.

*Values (''This product makes me Y'')
*Consumer Benefit (''This product helps me Y'')
*Product Benefit (''X does Y'')
*Product Feature (''X can do Y'')
*Attribute (''X is Y'')

The further up the ladder you go, the more ''consumer-based'' the message becomes. The further down you go, the more ''product-based'' it becomes. You can see that the first two statements tell how the product helps the consumer (&quot;me&quot;), while the other statements focus more and more on the product (X).

Here are some examples:

*Values (''Axe Body Spray makes me irresistible to women'')
==Try/Keep/Retry==
This strategy works on three types of customers: future, current, and past. Instead of just trying to get new customers, work on maintaining current ones, and find out how to bring former customers back.

*TRY to get new customers
*KEEP current customers
*RETRY former customers

TRY techniques focus on offers to bring in new customers, and something to bring them back (a &quot;bounceback&quot;).

KEEP techniques work on increasing current customers' frequency of purchases and &quot;ticket size&quot; (how much money they spend).

RETRY techniques attempt to figure out why the customer left the company, and how to give them a reason to return.

==Brainstorming==
===Exploding the Dot===
===Learn/Feel/Do Circle===
==The Time/Money/Quality Triangle==
The Time/Money/Quality Triangle illustrates an advertising truism, that &quot;you can't have all three.&quot; If there is little time or money, then ad quality will suffer. The more time and/or money that is available to the project, the higher the quality can be. However, the level of quality must be appropriate to the product...not all products should have high-quality ads!

[[Image:Time-Quality-Money.png|right|thumb|200px|The Time/Money/Quality Triangle. You can't have all three!]]
In her book ''Hitting the Sweet Spot: How Consumer Insights Can Inspire Better Marketing and Advertising'', Lisa Fortini-Campbell argues that an advertising &quot;sweet spot&quot; can be attained by combining consumer insight and brand insight.

A '''concept board''' can be used to demonstrate your ad campaign to your client. These boards (often quite large, so they can be appreciated by a group) outline the core idea of your campaign, a &quot;key visual&quot;, and perhaps some bullet points.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Political==
Tony Schwartz pioneered the concept of &quot;resonance&quot;. Some of his most well-known work are his political ads. One of his TV ads for Lyndon Johnson's 1964 presidential campaign against Barry Goldwater was legendary. As a little girl picked petals off a daisy, a voice counted down from 10, followed by a nuclear explosion. Known as ''Daisy'', this commercial is considered to be instrumental in Johnson's victory.

Another well-known political ad that is believed to have tipped an election are the anti-Dukakis, &quot;Willie Horton&quot; ads during the 1988 presidential campaign of Michael Dukakis and George Bush. Willie Horton was a convict serving time for murder in Massachusetts. When Dukakis was governor of Massachusetts, he escaped while on furlough and raped someone. This incident was alluded to in Republican ads, attempting to convince the public that Horton's escape showed that the Democrats were soft on crime. Like the Daisy ad, it is believed that the ad was instrumental in Bush's victory.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Radio==
Important aspects of a radio ad are duration and tempo. Some ways to use tempo include pausing for emphasis, and making the tone competitive or mellow.
Radio advertisers try to make a &quot;natural rhythm&quot;: using emphasis to create beats in words and phrases.
===Types===
*'''Pitch''' - An announcer talking.
*'''Situation''' - A dramatization, or &quot;story&quot;
*'''Song'''

Other types of radio ads are combinations of these three:
*'''Bed''' - Pitch with a Song background.
*'''Donut''' - A Song with a Pitch in the middle.
*'''Tag''' - A Song with a Pitch at the end.
*'''Vignette''' - A Pitch, followed by a Situation, followed by a Song

The basic structure of a radio ad is Context (beginning), Content (middle), Conclusion (end).

      <comment>/* Direct Marketing */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Print==

There are six types of print ads: '''One-Liner''', '''News''', '''Spiral''', '''Story''', '''Sermon''', and '''Outline.'''

Print ads use a combination of headlines, subheadings, body text and/or images. Often, there is a logo or slug, for brand identification, as well.

To be effective, headlines must be attention-grabbing. They should &quot;draw in&quot; a viewer. A headline should also be a complete message.

Types of headlines are '''News''', '''Questions''', and '''Testimonials'''.

However, it has been estimated that only 10% of readers will actually read an ad. So, make sure the product appears in a picture or is mentioned in the headline.

==Direct Marketing==
'''Direct Marketing''' is mailed to the target audience. One type of mailing is sent in a standard business envelope.  The envelope-mailing has many parts: the '''Insert''', '''Letter''', '''Brochure''', and '''BRE (Business Reply Envelope)''', as well as the '''Envelope''' itself. The mailing may have some of these elements, or all of them.

The first key to a successful envelope mailing is to get your target to open it. Obviously, if the target doesn't open the envelope and read some of the material, your money is wasted. The envelope may have exhortations to get the recipient to open the letter (e.g., &quot;URGENT!&quot;).

The Insert is a small one or two-sided sheet of paper with a summary of the mailing. If you want to use bullet points, here's a good place to put them.

For the Letter, have a good first line that hooks them. Try to hit on a topic of discontent for the reader (which your product will solve). Avoid talking about the company or the product's history. Talk about the reader, and his/her interests. Make sure to sum up the product's main points in the first paragraph. Repeat those benefits often throughout the letter.

The &quot;Lift&quot; Note is a trifold pamphlet, often with testimonials extolling the worthiness of the product. It may end with a closer (&quot;But wait...there's more!&quot;).

The Business Reply Envelope is a postage-paid, pre-addressed envelope to make it easy for the target to reply. You should use a BRE even if you supply a &quot;more convenient&quot; method of reply or payment.

A postcard is the most basic form of direct mail. The size can range from 4.25'' x 6''(minimum allowed by post office) up to a jumbo postcard (6'' x 10''). The larger the postcard the more visible it will appear in the mail. The typical postcard is printed four-color process on the front, and one-color black on the un-coated back side.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Television==
One important thing to remember is that a TV commercial has many more variables than a print or radio ad. This means that there is much more that can go wrong. It is important to decide, during early planning stages, what the job positions for the ad will be (art directors, copywriters, video technicians, etc.), and who will fulfill each one.

To make a rough draft of the ad, storyboards or animatics are used. (Animatics are like an animated storyboard.)

The three stages of making a TV ad are: Planning, Production, and Post-production.

==Types==
The six types of TV commercials are '''Slice''', '''Talking Person''', '''Demo''', '''Visual''', '''Graphic Collage''', and '''Combination'''.

The '''Slice''', or &quot;Slice of Life&quot;, is a dramatization (story). To make an effective Slice, create a situation where the product plays a key role. Make it simple and interesting.

A '''Talking Person''' presents a spokesman for the brand (e.g. Jack-in-the-Box's Jack, or Wendy's Dave Thomas). A testimonial commercial is a type of Talking Person.

A '''Demo''' is a presentation of the product's usage. Typical Demo types are:
*''Side-by-Side'': The product is pitted against its competition (or imaginary competition, such as &quot;Brand X&quot;).
*''Before and After'': Demonstration of the problem and solution.
*''Product Performance'': An exhibition of the product's strengths.
*''In-Use'' and ''New-Use'': In-Use shows the product being used. New-Use shows a new use for an old product.
*''Torture Test'': An (often humorous) demonstration of the product's durability.
A torture test is an &quot;extreme&quot; demonstration of a product performance, not durability.

The '''Visual''' primarily uses imagery to sell the product.

'''Graphic Collage''' is a postmodern style often used in music videos. It appropriates audio and video, and may employ '''supers''' (super-imposition).

A '''Combination''' uses two or more of these types together.

==Planning==
Planning steps:
#Start at the end. Decide what the ad's final impact will be.
#Plan visuals.
#Plan movement.

The beginning provides context. Common mistakes encountered here are overwriting, audience confusion, and irrelevancy.

The middle connects the target to the brand. Here is where the support is given. This part requires extreme clarity.

The end presents the ad's punchline, or final thought. A logo or other brand identification is typically displayed here.

Make pre-production notes. Things to include are 
*Location (''Where will the footage be shot?'')
*Talent (''Who will be acting? Providing music?'')
*Special effects (if any)
*Props (if any)
*Bids &amp; budgeting (''How will we pay for this?'')
*Scheduling

Profiling consumers: Know your audience. Be careful not to offend them!

You're not just selling a product, you're selling an ''image''.

Extreme close-ups of the product are used to create a sense of intimacy.

Sometimes conceptual art (storyboards, etc.) turn out to be unrealistic (such as a winking dog in a dog food commercial). This is called the &quot;Winking Dog Syndrome&quot;. The question to ask is: &quot;Can the final cut meet the expectations made by the design?&quot;

A similar problem, the &quot;Rubber Pencil&quot;, comes about when impossible proportions or angles create problems with the ad during production. It is important to resolve all these issues during the planning stages.

==Production==
Make a &quot;shot list.&quot; Make sure that only one person talks to the director, to avoid confusion.

==Post-Production==
Audio post-production involves &quot;direct voice&quot; (synchronized to video) or &quot;voice tracks&quot; (such as announcers), as well as music and sound effects.

Video post-production includes usage of animation and addition of stock footage. ''Pre-scoring'' is preparing audio before video, and ''post-scoring'' is preparing audio after video.

Direct Response Television (DRTV) often takes the form of infomercials.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Ethics==
Advertisers, like lawyers, are sometimes criticized for the clients they accept, and the messages they send. Advertising is arguably a powerful tool that can be used to influence the masses to a large extent. Therefore, it is important that advertisers be made aware of their responsibilities to the public good.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Feminist Criticism==
Social critics like Jean Kilbourne have blamed many of women's image problems on commercials. In her film series ''Killing Us Softly'', Kilbourne argues that ads deliver powerful messages that shape women's self-images. She claims these ads equate romance and success with normalcy, and make it appear that beauty is the most important concern of women. Furthermore, ads perpetuate a stereotype of the &quot;perfect&quot; woman, implying that this goal is attainable by buying the right beauty products, diet aids, etc. In reality, only about 5% of women have model bodies. Kilbourne also points out that ads containing both sexes often have the male literally looking down on the female, implying a subtle sexism.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Salad Brassicas==
I have found that in Rhode Island, if I broadcast brassica seed for salad and then disc it or rake it in, after September 6th, there is very little weed competition, and I get a better yield for the amount of bed space used.  

==Lettuce==
We get many more cuttings off of direct seeded salad mix when the soul has been amended with generous amounts of compost that if it is planted in poor soil, its usually sweeter as well.

==Melons==
Do well planted onto plastic mulch.

==Asparagus==
We are new to this, but we grew Asparagus from seed this year and transplanted it without digging a big trench, which is usually recommended when planting asparagus, our plants seem to be very healthy, I don't think you really need to dig a big trench.

==Carrots==
Seed carrots after a short bare fallow if you have a lot of weeds, and be sure to give them plenty of compost, then they will grow quickly and the bare fallow will take care of a lot of your weeds.

==Leeks==
We seed our leeks a few to a cell, shooting for 3 to a cell, then transplant them all together in their clumps of 3, with the clumps 9&quot; apart, we then either harvest them or thin out the small ones, selling them as early season baby leeks, and allow the biggest ones to become full size storage leeks.  Because they are competing with each other, they get taller and have longer shanks, we dont have as much trouble with weeds because the plants are easier to hoe and mulch, and we get a better yield out of a bed.

==Garlic==
We have landscapers bring leaves to our farm for us to use as mulch, this year we had one of the landscapers who brings already chopped up leaves (you don't want to use whole leaves because they will blow away) drive onto the field, being careful to drive in the pathway and not smush the bed, and dump the leaves directly on the field, where we could spread them out with a pitch fork, saving us the trouble of moving them our selves.

==Dry Beans==
At our five-acre vegetable farm in Western Washington, the two biggest issues with growing dry beans are 1) getting them to fully mature and dry before the autumn rain and 2) threshing and cleaning.  Some labor saving practices related to #1: Choose appropriate varieties and plant as early as possible.  Weed early and well.  Big weeds late in the season will harbor dew and soil moisture and keep your bean plants green when you want them to dry down.  We use a pretty close in-row spacing of two inches to reduce in-row weeds.  If you are watering, you'll want to cut off irrigation early enough.  NDSU extension recommends stopping irrigation when half of the plants' leaves or three-quarters of the pods are yellowing.  When beans are ready to harvest, we pull plants and windrow them in the field for a few sunny days if possible, flipping them over occasionally.  If only rain is ahead, you can bring plants into a greenhouse or other dry place until pods are crispy.  Burlap sacks work well for transporting and storage at this stage.  As for #2: We use an electric-powered, modified chipper-shredder to thresh the beans.  WSU has designs to make one at http://sustainableseedsystems.wsu.edu/nicheMarket/smallScaleThreshing.html.  I hear that driving over your beans with a truck and/or dancing on top of them will work, too.  After threshing, a good screening system will save you much time down the road.  You can make simple screens with hardware cloth and wooden frames.  I'd use a 1/2&quot; top screen to keep out large trash and an 1/8&quot; bottom screen to let the fines through.  A box fan works well for winnowing.  To cut down on the final cleaning time, leave moldy pods in the field at harvest.  Once moldy beans get mixed in with the rest, it is very tedious to get them out.

      <text xml:space="preserve">An agricultural subsidy is a governmental subsidy paid to farmers to supplement their income, help manage the supply of agricultural commodities, and bolster the supply of such commodities on international markets. Examples of such commodities include wheat, feed grains (grain used as fodder, such as maize, sorghum, barley, and oats), cotton, milk, rice, peanuts, sugar, tobacco, and oilseeds such as soybeans.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture is required by law to subsidize over two dozen commodities. Between 1996 and 2002, an average of $16 billion/year was paid by programs authorized by federal legislation dating back to the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933, the Agricultural Act of 1949, and the Commodity Credit Corporation, among others.

The beneficiaries of the subsidies have changed as U.S. agriculture changes. In the 1930s, about 25% of the U.S. population resided on the nation's 6,000,000 small farms. By 1997, 157,000 large farms accounted for 72% of farm sales, with only 2% of the U.S. population residing on farms.

Proponents of agricultural subsidies argue that they are necessary because of the unusual nature of the agricultural industry. For one, a big part of crop yield, and therefore price, is based upon the weather both at home and abroad in remote parts of the world. Because of the uncertain nature of the weather, price subsidies are necessary to ensure that farmers receive a liveable wage.

One criticism of subsidy comes from conservatives and libertarians arguing that subsidies are against the will of the free market. For example, poor store owners don't receive relief from the market, and therefore neither should poor farmers. Furthermore, justification of subsidies from the uncertain nature of the weather can be countered by considering that many other areas of economy experience equivalent risks for which the free market can provide solutions, e.g. insurance.

Economists strongly rebuke the benefits of reduced retail prices derived from subsidising over-production. If the government were to subsidize car manufacturers to produce more cars then this would indeed lower the showroom price, but it would be the consumer's own money collected through taxes that would be used to fund the over-production. It would be impossible for the lower retail costs to outweigh the additional production costs, otherwise the manufacturers could simply implement this technique themselves.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Agricultural policy describes a set of laws relating to domestic agriculture and imports of foreign agricultural products. Governments usually implement agricultural policies with the goal of achieving a specific outcome in the domestic agricultural product markets. Outcomes can range from guaranteed supply level, price stability, product quality, product selection, land use or employment.

Governments pay subsidies to encourage domestic production of a good. Such subsidies are necessary when a government wants to alter the free-market outcome in product markets. The subsidies transfer some costs of production from producers to the government, allowing production at above-market costs. The effect of Western food subsidies [360$ billion] is overwhelmingly to reduce world prices. For decades the 3rd world has earned only half the free market price for food, its primary product. Consumption subsidies can also be used to alter markets. A consumption subsidy offsets a portion of the purchase price of a product.

Price floors or ceilings set a minimum or maximum price for a product. Price controls alter free-market outcomes by encouraging over-production by a price floor or over-consumption by a price ceiling.

A government can erect trade barriers to limit the quantity of goods imported (in the case of a quota) or enact tariffs to raise the domestic price of imported products. These barriers give preference to domestic producers.

Some argue that nations have an interest in assuring there is sufficient domestic production capability to meet domestic needs in the event of a global supply disruption. Significant dependence on foreign food producers makes a country strategically vulnerable in the event of war, blockade or embargo. Maintaining adequate domestic capability allows for food self-sufficiency that lessens the risk of supply shocks due to geopolitical events. Agricultural policies may be used to support domestic producers as they gain domestic and international market share. This may be a short term way of encouraging an industry until it is large enough to thrive without aid. Or it may be an ongoing subsidy designed to allow a product to compete with or undercut foreign competition. This may produce a net gain for a government despite the cost of interventions because it allows a country to build up an export industry or reduce imports.

Subsidising farming may encourage people to remain on the land and obtain some income. This might be relevant to a third world country with many peasant farmers, but it may also be a consideration to more developed countries such as Poland. This has a very high unemployment rate, much farmland and retains a large rural population growing food for their own use. Price controls may be used to assist poor citizens. Many countries have used this method of welfare support as it delivers cheap food to the poorest without the need to assess people to give them financial aid.

See green economists. Some argue that small gardens and greenhouses should be favored, especially if produce is consumed locally. Some argue for tax, tariff and trade rules to exempt such production for local use, especially family farm or farm co-op production, and strongly deny that agricultural and industrial policy should be linked, or should be subject to the same law. One rationale is that local production of organic produce by families in their own gardens for their own consumption is not taxed or regulated, and that little or no use of the energy-and-land-intensive transport system, or energy-and-labor intensive regulation system is required for these same people to sell the same product to neighbors.
* Safe trade rules to encourage organic farming and self-reliance, led by opponents of genetically modified food and monoculture.
* Fair trade rules to ensure that poor farmers in underdeveloped nations that produce crops primarily for export are not exploited to put local farmers in developing nations out of work - which advocates consider a dangerous &quot;race to the bottom&quot; in agricultural labor and safety standards. Opponents point out that most agriculture in developed nations is produced by industrial corporations (agribusinesses) which are hardly deserving of sympathy, and that the alternative to exploitation is poverty.

When rich countries subsidize domestic production, excess output is often given to the developing world as foreign aid. This process eliminates the domestic market for agricultural products in the developing world, because the products can be obtained for free from western aid agencies. In developing nations where these effects are most severe, small farmers could no longer afford basic inputs and were forced to sell their land.

&quot;Consider a farmer in Ghana who used to be able to make a living growing rice. Several years ago, Ghana was able to feed and export their surplus. Now, it imports rice. From where? Developed countries. Why? Because it's cheaper. Even if it costs the rice producer in the developed world much more to produce the rice, he doesn't have to make a profit from his crop. The government pays him to grow it, so he can sell it more cheaply to Ghana than the farmer in Ghana can. And that farmer in Ghana? He can't feed his family anymore.&quot;(Lyle Vanclief, Canadian Minister of Agriculture)

According to The Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy, corn, soybeans, cotton, wheat and rice are sold below the cost of production, or dumped. Dumping rates are approximately forty percent for wheat, between twenty-five and thirty percent for corn (maize), approximately thirty percent for soybeans, fifty-seven percent for cotton, and approximately twenty percent for rice. For example, wheat is sold for forty percent below cost.

According to Oxfam, &quot;If developed nations eliminated subsidy programs, the export value of agriculture in lesser developed nations would increase by 24 %, plus a further 5.5 % from tariff equilibrium. ... exporters can offer US surpluses for sale at prices around half the cost of production; destroying local agriculture and creating a captive market in the process.&quot;

Free trade advocates desire the elimination of all market distorting mechanisms (subsidies, tariffs, regulations) and argue that, as with free trade in all areas, this will result in aggregate benefit for all. This position is particularly popular in competitive agricultural exporting nations in both the developed and developing world, some of whom have banded together in the Cairns Group lobby. Canada's Department of Agriculture estimates that developing nations would benefit by about $4 billion annually if subsidies in the developed world were halved.

Many countries don't grow enough food to feed their own populations. These nations must buy food from other countries. Lower prices and free food save the lives of millions of starving people, despite the drop in food sales of the local farmers.

A developing nation could use new improved farming methods to grow more food, with the ultimate goal of feeding their nation without outside help. New greenhouse methods, hydroponics, fertilizers, R/O Water Processors, hybrid crops, fast-growing hybrid trees for quick shade, interior temperature control, greenhouse or tent insulation, autonomous building gardens, sun lamps, mylar, fans, and other cheap tech can be used to grow crops on previously unarable land, such as rocky, mountainous, desert, and even arctic lands. More food can be grown, reducing dependency on other countries for food.

Replacement crops can also make nations agriculturally independent. Sugar, for example, comes from sugar cane imported from Polynesia. Instead of buying the sugar from Polynesia, a nation can make sugar from sugar beets, maple sap, or sweetener from stevia plant, keeping the profits circulating within the nation's economy. Paper and clothes can be made of hemp instead of trees and cotton. Tropical foods won't grow in many places in Europe, but they will grow in insulated greenhouses or tents in Europe. Soybean plant cellulose can replace plastic (made from oil). Lemon oil can replace car oil for lubrication. Ethanol from farm waste or hempseed oil can replace gasoline. Rainforest medicine plants grown locally can replace many imported medicines. This is why Thomas Jefferson said that the best thing you can do for your country is to grow a new crop species. Alternates of cash crops, like sugar and oil replacements, allow the farmer to make more money on the real market, reducing the farmer's dependency on subsidies in both developed and developing nations.

The farmer population is approximately five percent of the total population in the E.U. and 1.7 % in the U.S.

The total value of agricultural production amounted to 128 billion euros (1998). About forty-nine percent of this amount was accounted for by political measures: 37 billion euros due to direct payments and 43 billion euros from consumers due to the artificially high price. Eighty percent of European farmers receive a direct payment of 5,000 euros or less, while 2.2 % receive a direct payment above 50,000 euros, totaling forty percent of all direct subsidies.

The average U.S. farmer receives $16,000 in annual subsidies. Two-thirds of farmers receive no direct payments. Of those that do, the average amount amongst the lowest paid eighty percent was $7000 from 1995-2003. (http://www.ewg.org/farm/findings.php) Subsidies are a mix of tax reductions, direct cash payments and below-market prices on water and other inputs. Some claim that these aggregate figures are misleading because large agribusinesses, rather than individual farmers, receive a significant share of total subsidy spending. The Freedom to Farm Act of 1996 reduced farm subsidies, providing fixed payments over a period and replacing price supports and subsidies. The Farm Bill (2002) contains direct and countercyclical payments designed to limit the effects of low prices and yields.

The World Trade Organization (WTO) has extracted commitments from the Philippines government, making it lower import barriers to half their present levels over a span of six years, and allowing in drastically increased competition from the industrialised and heavily subsidised farming systems of North America and Europe. A recent Oxfam report estimated that average household incomes of maize farmers will be reduced by as much as 30% over the six years as cheap imports from the US drive down prices in the local markets. The report estimates that in the absence of trade restrictions, US subsidised maize could be marketed at less than half the price of maize grown on the Philippine island of Mindanao; and that the livelihoods of up to half a million Filipino maize farmers (out of the total 1.2 million) are under immediate threat.

Let's output results of arithmetic operations with these variables.
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
print(a + b);
print(a - b);
print(a * b);
print(a / b);
print(a % b); //Modulo
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Increment, Decrement, Unary operators ===
For enlarging or reducing some variable by one we can use increment and decrement operator. And we can change char of number by unary operator.
Decrement and increment have two types of recording - postfix and prefix.
Prefix - first the value is changed then the new value is returned.
Postfix - first the value is returned then value is changed.
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
a = 5;
b = ++a; // b = 6 , a = 6
b = a--; // b = 6 , a = 5
b = -a; // b = -5
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Standart library functions ===
Also we can apply some functions to numbers. We will consider only most important.
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
c = f.toFixed(b); //Rounding to 'b' digits after  dot
d = Math.abs(-6); //Absolute value (module) of number
e = Math.round(f); //Rounding to integer
g = Math.max(a,b); //Maximum value of variables 'a' and 'b'
h = Math.min(a,b); //Minimum value of variables 'a' and 'b'
k = Math.pow(a,b); //Variable 'a' in power 'b'
t = Math.sqrt(a); //Square root of variable 'a'
w = Math.random(); //Random number from 0 to 1
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Standart library constants ===
Standart library include some math constants. We will consider only the most important.
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
a = Math.PI // π number
b = Math.E // e number
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Special values ===
Numbers in JavaScript also include two special values are Infinity and NaN(Not a Number)
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
a = 1/0 // Infinity
b = Math.sqrt(-1) // NaN
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Making Array ==
For making array it's better to use list literal because it's most popular and simple syntaxis
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
a = []; //Empty list
b = [1,2,3,4,5]; //List with 5 elements
&lt;/source&gt;

== Work with elements ==
And so, we have an array 'b' with five numbers and the empty array 'a'.

&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
a[0] = b[2]; //1
delete b[2]; //2
b[3] = 6; //3
&lt;/source&gt;
# From array b - [1,2,'''3''',4,5] get element with index 2 (Numeration in arrays starts from 0).  Now array a = [2]
# We delete element with index 2 from array b. Now array b = [0,1,'''undefined''',3,4].
# We change value of element with index 3 from array b. Now array b = [0,1,undefined,6,4].

== Work with slices ==
Array.slice(start,end) - returns array with elements of '''Array''' from '''start''' index to '''end''' index without element with index '''end'''.
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
a = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7];
b = a.slice(2,5); //2,3,4
&lt;/source&gt;
If '''start''' or '''end''' is negative number then index of start or end equal (length of array + '''start''' or '''end''').
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
a = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7];
b = a.slice(2,-2); //2,3,4,5 because length = 8 and 8 + (-2) = 6 
&lt;/source&gt;
Array.splice(start,number,elem...) - return slice with '''number''' of elements from '''Array''' from '''start''' and it deletes this elements from '''Array''', and it replaces it's by '''elem'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
a = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7];
b = a.splice(2,3,0,1,0);
print(b); // 2,3,4
print(a); // 0,1,0,1,0,5,6,7
&lt;/source&gt;

== Stack and row ==
You can use any Array as stack or row for it there are 4 function.
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Name !! Action
|-
| Array.pop() || Delete and return last element of '''Array'''
|-
| Array.push(elem...) ||Insert '''elem''' to end of '''Array'''
|-
| Array.shift() || Delete and return first element of '''Array'''
|-
| Array.unshift(elem...) || Insert '''elem''' to start of '''Array'''
|}
For example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
Foo = [1,2,3,4,5];
Bar = Foo.pop(); //Bar = 5 , Foo = [1,2,3,4]
Foo.unshift(Bar); // Foo = [5,1,2,3,4]
&lt;/source&gt;

== Sorting and reverse ==
Also Array.sort([predicate]) - If predicate not defined then sort elements in '''Array''' in lexicographical order else sort element in '''Array''' by results of function '''predicate''' that gets two arguements and returns '''-1''' if first argument less then second or '''1''' if second argument less then first or '''0''' if arguments equal.

Array.reverse() - reverse elements in '''Array'''

&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
arr = [5,3,1,4,2];
arr.sort();
print(arr); //1,2,3,4,5
arr.reverse();
print(arr); //5,4,3,2,1
&lt;/source&gt;

== Concatenate and joining ==
Array.concat(elem1...) - returns array that containg elements from '''Array''' and '''elem''' if elem[n] is array then to the array that returns are added all elements from elem[n].

Array.join([separator]) - returns string with all elements and separator before every, if separator not defined then separator = &quot;,&quot;

&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
arr1 = [0,1,2,3,4]
arr2 = [5,6,7,8,9]
elem = 10;
arr = arr1.concat(arr2,elem); //0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10
str = arr.join(';'); //0;1;2;3;4;5;6;7;8;9;10
print(str);
&lt;/source&gt;

== Length of Array ==
Array.length - number of elements in '''Array'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
arr = [0,1,2,3,4,5]
print(arr.length); // 6
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== While ==
While expression looks so:
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
while(condition){
  codeInCycle
}
&lt;/source&gt;
Here, if the condition is true then the code inside the loop and then the process goes first but if the condition is true then execution continues after the loop. Let's see example.
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
n = 2;
nums = [];
while(n &lt; 16){
  nums.push(n++);
}
print(nums); //2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15
&lt;/source&gt;

== For ==
&quot;For&quot; cycle is a short form of while.
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
for(exp1;exp2;exp3){
  code
}
//Equal for
exp1;
while(exp2){
  code;
  exp3;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Let's rewrite our code.
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
for(n=2,nums=[];n&lt;16;n++){
  nums.push(n);
}
print(nums); // 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Do .. While ==
In this cycle, executing the code in it and then check the condition and if it is true then the loop is executed again, otherwise terminate the loop. Let's see example.
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
names = [&quot;JavaScript&quot;,&quot;Python&quot;,&quot;Ruby&quot;];
i = 0;
do{
  name = names[i];
  i++;
}while(print(name) || i &lt; names.length);
&lt;/source&gt;
Do .. while loop can be used if code inside a loop set some values and in condition you call some function.

== For .. in ==
For .. in loop using if need iterate over all properties of object. For example.
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
obj = {name:&quot;Artem&quot;,
       country:&quot;Russia&quot;,
       interests:&quot;JavaScript&quot;};
for(i in obj){
  print(i + ':' + obj[i] + '\n')
}
&lt;/source&gt;
In this code on every iteration to variable 'i' set value with key of property.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Break ===
Break statement can interrupt the cycle. For example.
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
str = &quot;&quot;;
i = 0;
j = 100;
while(true){
  i++;
  j--;
  if(j==i)break;
  str = str + i + ':' + j + ',';
}
&lt;/source&gt;
This code makes string with list of pairs of numbers while they are not equal.

=== Continue ===
Continue statement makes the transition to the next iteration of the loop.
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
arr = [0,2,4,5,6,1,24,36,12,531,42,49,81];
for(i=0;i&lt;arr.length;i++){
  if((Math.sqrt(arr[i])%1) &gt; 0)continue;
  print(arr[i])
}
&lt;/source&gt;
This script output numbers from array which square roots is integer.

== Labels ==
Labels help use '''break''' and '''continue''' in nested loops.
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
glob:for(i=0;i&lt;10;i++){
  for(j=0;j&lt;10;j++){
    if(i==j)continue glob;
    print(i*10 + j)
  }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Conditional operator ==
If we need just set value for any variable in depent of condition, we can use conditional operator. It's shorter than &quot;if&quot; expression many times. Let's see example.
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
name = &quot;Artiom&quot;;
cond = true;

//If expression
if(cond){
  name = &quot;Tom&quot;;
}else{
  name = &quot;Artem&quot;;
}

//Conditional operator
name = cond?&quot;Tom&quot;:&quot;Artem&quot;;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Nested conditional operator ===
As 'if' expression so and Conditional operator can be multiple.
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
name = &quot;Artiom&quot;;
cond1 = false;
cond2 = true;

//Conditional operator
name = cond1?&quot;Tom&quot;:cond2?&quot;Artem&quot;:&quot;NoName&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Logic operators ==
There are three logical operators in JavaScript. It are &quot;not&quot;,&quot;and&quot;,&quot;or&quot;. Let's see example.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Operator !! Action
|-
| &lt;nowiki&gt;||&lt;/nowiki&gt; || or
|-
| &amp;&amp; || and
|-
| ! || not
|}

&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
!true; // False
!false; // True
false || true; // True
false &amp;&amp; true;// False
&lt;/source&gt;

== Comparison operators ==
In parts of the previous file you've already seen some of these operators, and certainly understand their meaning but in anyway.
There are 8 comparison operators in JavaScript.
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Operator !! Condition
|-
| == || Equal
|-
| != || Not equal
|-
| === || Equal value and type
|-
| !== || Not equal value or type
|-
| &gt; || More
|-
| &lt; || Less
|-
| &lt;= || Less or equal
|-
| &gt;= || More or equal
|}
And for example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
5 == 5; //True
5 === '5'; //False
5 != 3; //True
5 !== '3'; //True
5 &gt; 3; //True
5 &lt; 3; //False
5 &lt;= 5; //True
5 &gt;= 3; //True
&lt;/source&gt;

== XOR Hack ==
In JavaScript there is no operator XOR (also named Exclusive OR). But we can write function that use bitwise XOR and return booleadn XOR of two arguments.
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
xor = function(a,b){
  return Boolean(a ^ b)
}
&lt;/source&gt;
And let's use it.
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
xor(true,false); //True
xor(true,true); //False
xor(false,false); //False
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Splitting Fields ==

Let F be a field and p(x) be a nonconstant polynomial in F(x). We already know that we can find a field extension of F that contains a root of p(x). However, we would like to know whether an extension E of F containing all of the roots of p(x) exists. In other words, can we find a field extension of F such that p(x) factors into a product of linear polynomials? What is the &quot;smallest&quot; extension containing all the roots of p(x)? &lt;br /&gt;

Let F be a field and &lt;math&gt;p(x) = \alpha_0+\alpha_1x+\cdots+\alpha_n x^n&lt;/math&gt; be a nonconstant polynomial in F[x]. An extension field E of F is a '''splitting field''' of p(x) if there exist elements &lt;math&gt;\alpha_1,\cdots,\alpha_n&lt;/math&gt; in E such that &lt;math&gt;E = F(\alpha_1,\cdots,\alpha_n)&lt;/math&gt; and&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;math&gt;p(x) = (x-\alpha_1)(x-\alpha_2)\cdots(x-\alpha_n)&lt;/math&gt; in E[x].&lt;br /&gt;

A polynomial &lt;math&gt;p(x) \in F[x]&lt;/math&gt; ''splits'' in E if it is the product of linear factors in E[x].&lt;br /&gt;

'''Example 1:''' Let &lt;math&gt;p(x) = x^4+2x^2-8&lt;/math&gt; be in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}[x]&lt;/math&gt;. Then p(x) has irreducible factors &lt;math&gt;x^2-2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x^2+4&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, the field &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2},i)&lt;/math&gt; is a splitting field for p(x).&lt;br /&gt;

'''Example 2:''' Let &lt;math&gt;p(x) = x^3-3&lt;/math&gt; be in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}[x]&lt;/math&gt;. Then p(x) has a root in the field &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{3})&lt;/math&gt;. However, this field is not a splitting field for p(x) since the complex cube roots of 3, &lt;math&gt;\frac{-\sqrt[3]{3}\pm(\sqrt[6]{3})^5i}{2}&lt;/math&gt; are not in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{3})&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;

'''Theorem''' ''Let p(x) &lt;math&gt;\in&lt;/math&gt; F(x) be a nonconstant polynomial. Then there exists a splitting field E for p(x).''&lt;br /&gt;

Proof. We will use mathematical induction on the degree of p(x). If &lt;math&gt;deg(p(x)) = 1&lt;/math&gt;, then p(x) is a linear polynomial and &lt;math&gt;E = F&lt;/math&gt;. Assume that the theorem is true for all polynomials of degree k with &lt;math&gt;1 \le k &lt; n&lt;/math&gt; and let &lt;math&gt;deg(p(x)) = n&lt;/math&gt;. We can assume that p(x) is irreducible; otherwise, by our induction hypothesis, we are done. There exists a field K such that p(x) has a zero &lt;math&gt;\alpha_1&lt;/math&gt; in K. Hence, &lt;math&gt;p(x) = (x - \alpha_1)q(x)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;q(x) \in K(x)&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;deg(q(x)) = n - 1&lt;/math&gt;, there exists a splitting field &lt;math&gt; E \supset K&lt;/math&gt; of q(x) that contains the zeros &lt;math&gt; \alpha_2,\cdots,\alpha_n&lt;/math&gt; of p(x) by our induction hypothesis. Consequently,&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;math&gt; E = K(\alpha_2,\cdots,\alpha_n) = F(\alpha_1,\cdots,\alpha_n)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

is a splitting field of p(x).&lt;br /&gt;

The question of uniqueness now arises for splitting fields. This question is answered in the affirmative. Given two splitting fields K and L of a polynomial &lt;math&gt;p(x) \in F(x)&lt;/math&gt;, there exists a field isomorphism &lt;math&gt;\phi : K \to L&lt;/math&gt; that preserves F. In order to prove this result, we must first prove a lemma.&lt;br /&gt;

'''Lemma Theorem''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;\phi : E \to F&lt;/math&gt; be an isomorphism of fields. Let K be an extension field of E and &lt;math&gt;\alpha \in K&lt;/math&gt; be algebraic over E with minimal polynomial p(x). Suppose that L is an extension field of F such that &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; is root of the polynomial in F[x] obtained from p(x) under the image of &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; extends to a unique isomorphism &lt;math&gt;\psi : E(\alpha) \to F(\beta)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\psi(\alpha) = \beta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; agrees with &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; on E.''&lt;br /&gt;

'''Lemma Proof.''' If p(x) has degree n, then we can write any element in &lt;math&gt;E(\alpha)&lt;/math&gt; as a linear combination of &lt;math&gt;1,\alpha,\cdots,\alpha^{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, the isomorphism that we are seeking must be&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\phi(a_0 + a_1\alpha + \cdots + a_{n-1}\alpha^{n-1}) = \psi(a_0) + \psi(a_1)\beta + \cdots + \psi(a_{n-1})\beta^{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;br /&gt;

where&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;math&gt;a_0 + a_1\alpha + \cdots + a_{n-1}\alpha^{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

is an element in &lt;math&gt;E(\alpha)&lt;/math&gt;. The fact that &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is an isomorphism could be checked by direct computation; however, it is easier to observe that &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is a composition of maps that we already know to be isomorphisms.&lt;br /&gt;

We can extend &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; to be an isomorphism from E[x] to F[x], which we will also denote by &lt;math&gt; \psi &lt;/math&gt;, by letting&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\psi(a_0 + a_1x + \cdots + a_nx^n) = \psi(a_1)x + \cdots + \psi(a_n)x^n&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;

This extension agrees with the original isomorphism &lt;math&gt;\psi : E \to F&lt;/math&gt;, since constant polynomials get mapped to constant polynomials. By assumption, &lt;math&gt;\psi(p(x)) = q(x)&lt;/math&gt;; hence, &lt;math&gt; \psi &lt;/math&gt; maps &lt;math&gt;\left \langle p(x) \right \rangle&lt;/math&gt; onto &lt;math&gt;\left \langle q(x) \right \rangle&lt;/math&gt;. Consequently, we have an isomorphism &lt;math&gt;\overline{\psi} : E[x]/\left \langle p(x) \right \rangle \to F[x]/\left \langle q(x) \right \rangle&lt;/math&gt;. We have isomorphisms &lt;math&gt;\sigma : E[x]/\left \langle p(x) \right \rangle \to F(\alpha)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tau : F[x]/\left \langle q(x) \right \rangle \to F(\beta)&lt;/math&gt;, defined by evaluation at &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;, respectively. Therefore, &lt;math&gt;\psi = \tau^{-1}\overline{\phi}\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is the required isomorphism.&lt;br /&gt;

Now write &lt;math&gt;p(x)=(x-\alpha)f(x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q(x)=(x-\beta)g(x)&lt;/math&gt;, where the degrees of f(x) and g(x) are less than the degrees of p(x) and q(x), respectively. The field extension K is a splitting field for f(x) over E(α), and L is a splitting field for g(x) over F(β). By our induction hypotheses there exists an isomorphism &lt;math&gt;\psi : K \to L&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; agrees with &lt;math&gt;\bar{phi}&lt;/math&gt; on E(α). Hence, there exists an isomorphism &lt;math&gt;\psi : K \to L&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; agrees with &lt;math&gt;psi&lt;/math&gt; on E.&lt;br /&gt;

'''Corollary''' ''Let p(x) be a polynomial in F[x]. Then there exists a splitting field K of p(x) that is unique up to isomorphism.''&lt;br /&gt;

== Algebraic Closures ==

Given a field ''F'', the question arises as to whether or not we can find a field ''E'' such that every polynomial ''p(x)'' has a root in ''E''. This leads us to the following theorem.&lt;br /&gt;

'''Theorem 21.11''' ''Let E be an extension field of F. The set of elements in E that are algebraic over F form a field.&lt;br /&gt;

Proof. Let &lt;math&gt;\alpha,\beta\in E&lt;/math&gt; be algebraic over ''F''. Then &lt;math&gt;F(\alpha,\beta)&lt;/math&gt; is a finite extension of ''F''. Since every element of &lt;math&gt;F(\alpha,\beta)&lt;/math&gt; is algebraic over &lt;math&gt;F,\alpha\pm\beta,\alpha\beta&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\alpha/\beta\text{ }(\beta\ne 0)&lt;/math&gt; are all algebraic over ''F''. Consequently, the set of elements in ''E'' that are algebraic over ''F'' forms a field.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br&gt;'''Corollary 21.12''' ''The set of all algebraic numbers forms a field; that is, the set of all complex numbers that are algebraic over'' &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt; ''makes up a field.''&lt;br /&gt;

Let ''E'' be a field extension of a field ''F''. We define the '''''algebraic closure''''' of a field ''F'' in ''E'' to be the field consisting of all elements in ''E'' that are algebraic over ''F''. A field ''F'' is '''''algebraically closed''''' if every nonconstant polynomial in ''F[x]'' has a root in ''F''.&lt;br /&gt;

'''Theorem 21.13''' ''A field F is algebraically closed if and only if every nonconstant polynomial in F[x] factors into linear factors over F[x].''&lt;br /&gt;

Proof. Let ''F'' be an algebraically closed field. If &lt;math&gt;p(x)\in F[x]&lt;/math&gt; is a nonconstant polynomial, then ''p(x)'' has a zero in ''F'', say α. Therefore, &lt;math&gt;x-\alpha&lt;/math&gt; must be a factor of ''p(x)'' and so &lt;math&gt;p(x)=(x-\alpha)q_1(x)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;deg(q_1(x)) = deg(p(x))-1&lt;/math&gt;. Continue this process with &lt;math&gt;q_1(x)&lt;/math&gt; to find a factorization&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;p(x)=(x-\alpha)(x-\beta)q_2(x)&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;deg(q_2(x))= deg(p(x))-2&lt;/math&gt;. The process must eventually stop since the degree of ''p(x)'' is finite.&lt;br /&gt;

Conversely, suppose that every nonconstant polynomial ''p(x)'' in ''F[x]'' factors into linear factors. Let &lt;math&gt;ax-b&lt;/math&gt; be such a factor. Then &lt;math&gt;p(b/a)=0&lt;/math&gt;. Consequently, ''F'' is algebraically closed.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br&gt;'''Corollary 21.14''' ''An algebraically closed field F has no proper algebraic extension E.''&lt;br /&gt;

Proof. Let ''E'' be an algebraic extension of ''F''; then &lt;math&gt;F\subset E&lt;/math&gt;. For &lt;math&gt;\alpha\in E&lt;/math&gt;, the minimal polynomial of α is &lt;math&gt;x-\alpha&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, &lt;math&gt;\alpha\in F&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;F=E&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br&gt;'''Theorem 21.15''' ''Every field F has a unique algebraic closure.''&lt;br /&gt;

It is a nontrivial fact that every field has a unique algebraic closure. The proof is not extremely difficult, but requires some rather sophisticated set theory. We refer the reader to [3], [4], or [8] for a proof of this result.&lt;br /&gt;

We now state the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, first proven by Gauss at the age of 22 in his doctoral thesis. This theorem states that every polynomial with coefficients in the complex numbers has a root in the complex numbers. The proof of this theorem will be given in [[Abstract Algebra/Galois Theory]].&lt;br /&gt;

'''Theorem 21.16 (Fundamental Theorem of Algebra)''' ''The field of complex numbers is algebraically closed.''

- FALSE.

{An occupationally exposed person undergoing fluoroscopy of their abdomen has inadvertently left their personnel dosimeter on in such a way that it is at the point of entry of the primary beam. It would take how many minutes of screening time for the
dosimeter to record his annual maximum permissible whole body dose?
|type=&quot;()&quot;}
+ less than 5.
|| Correct answer.
- ~10.
- ~20.
- ~40.
- more than 60.

{A fluoroscopic system has automatic brightness control in which the kV is adjusted manually and the mA varies as a function of patient thickness. For a given patient thickness, as the kV is decreased:
|type=&quot;()&quot;}
- The mA decreases and patient entrance skin dose increases.
- The mA increases and patient entrance skin dose is constant.
+ The mA increases and patient entrance skin dose increases.
|| Correct answer - see {Basic_Physics_of_Digital_Radiography/The_Image_Receptor#XII-Video_Systems|XII-Video Systems]].
- The mA increases and patient entrance skin dose decreases.

{The radiation risk to a patient can be reduced by using a smaller focal spot.  Is this statement:
|type=&quot;()&quot;}
- TRUE.
+ FALSE.
|| Correct answer - see [[Basic_Physics_of_Digital_Radiography/The_Patient#Subject_Contrast|Subject Contrast]].

{The sievert is a unit of:
|type=&quot;()&quot;}
- Intensity.
- Exposure.
- Absorbed dose.
+ Effective dose.
|| Correct answer - see [[Basic_Physics_of_Digital_Radiography/The_Patient#Radiation_Dose|Radiation Dose]].

{An individual receives a radiation effective dose of 200 Sv of penetrating radiation during the detonation of a nearby nuclear device. The most likely effects are:
|type=&quot;()&quot;}
- None or insignificant.
+ Damage to central nervous system resulting in death within 48 hours.
|| Correct answer.
- Early symptoms of damage to the GI tract followed by a temporary recovery and death after about 2 weeks from irreversible damage to the blood forming organs.
- Skin erythema, depilation and permanent sterility for males. Not life threatening.

{The inverse square law applies well in the primary beam. In regard to radiation scattered from the patient the inverse square law:
|type=&quot;()&quot;}
- Applies approximately only at distances greater than 5 m from the patient.
- Applies approximately only at distances greater than 10 m from the patient.
+ Applies approximately at distances greater than 1 m from the patient.
|| Correct answer.
- Applies approximately as an inverse cube law for up to 2 m, then as the inverse square law thereafter.

{One gray is defined as:
|type=&quot;()&quot;}
- 100 J/kg.
+ 1 J/kg.
|| Correct answer - see [[Basic_Physics_of_Digital_Radiography/The_Patient#Radiation_Dose|Radiation Dose]].
- 0.01 J/kg.
- 1 mJ/kg.

{The effective dose a patient receives from a single PA chest X-ray is about:
|type=&quot;()&quot;}
+ 0.02 mSv.
|| Correct answer - see [[Basic_Physics_of_Digital_Radiography/The_Patient#Radiation_Dose|Radiation Dose]].
- 0.2 mSv.
- 2 mSv.
- 20 mSv.

{Which one of the following has minimal effect on the patient's skin dose?
|type=&quot;()&quot;}
+ The size of the focal spot.
|| Correct answer.
- The irradiated field size.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Let ABC be a triangle, its incentre be I and its three excentres be I&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;, I&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; and I&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;.  Then I&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; is the '''excentral triangle''' of ABC.

A lies on the line I&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; and is the foot of the perpendicular from I&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; to that line, and similarly for B and C.  Thus ABC is the '''pedal triangle''' (see later) of its excentral triangle.  Further, these perpendiculars intersect at I, so I is the orthocentre of the excentral triangle.

I and I&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; lie on the bisector of angle BAC and similarly for the other excentres.

The quadrilaterals IBCI&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;, IACI&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; and IABI&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; are cyclic.

I&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; is the orthocentre of the triangle I&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;I and similarly for the other excentres.

The distance II&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; is 4Rsin({{frac|A|2}}) and similarly for the other excentres.

== Properties of the Excentral Triangle ==
The angles of this triangle are &lt;math&gt;90^0-\frac{A}{2}, 90^0-\frac{B}{2} \text{ and } 90^0-\frac{C}{2}&lt;/math&gt;.

Its sides are &lt;math&gt;4R\cos\left(\frac{A}{2}\right), 4R\cos\left(\frac{B}{2}\right), 4R\cos\left(\frac{C}{2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;.

Its area is  &lt;math&gt;8R^2\cos\left(\frac{A}{2}\right)\cos\left(\frac{B}{2}\right)\cos\left(\frac{C}{2}\right) = 2Rs = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \Delta \text{cosec}\left(\frac{A}{2}\right) \text{cosec}\left(\frac{B}{2}\right) \text{cosec}\left(\frac{C}{2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

where &amp;Delta; is the area of the original triangle.

Its circumradius is 2R.

The contributors to this volume are very cognizant of the Wiki rules that any reader can edit text.  At the same time, consistent with other Wiki textbooks, we would like to retain our names on the chapters.   We would welcome readers who wish to edit text contacting us.  Retaining author names in various Wiki books is important for several reasons. First, readers, particularly practicing clinicians, want to be assured of the expertise of the authors. Second, writers, particularly those in academia, want some acknowledgment of their contributions. It will be interesting so see the quality of future edits, and whether authors are happy with these.

Optinal variables enclosed in square brackets. For example Array.join([separator])

== Variable in description ==
In function description variables are bolded. For example Math.sqrt('''num''') - square root of '''num'''

== Undefined number of arguments ==
Undefined number of arguments in function written as name... and function description name are all these variables in general, and name[n] either name. For example  Array.concat(elements...) - returns array that containg elements from '''Array''' and '''elements''' if '''elements[n]''' is array then to the array that returns are added all elements from '''elements[n]'''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Ethelbert ruled from 860-866. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Ethelbert, the third son of [[A History of the British Monarchy/Saxon Rulers/Ethelwulf|Ethelwulf]] and Osburh, a Jutish princess, was born circa 835. The grandson of [[A History of the British Monarchy/Saxon Rulers/Egbert|Egbert]], first King of the English, he succeeded his brother Ethelbald on 20th December, 860. Ethelbert had previously been sub-king of Kent, the traditional title given to the early heirs to the throne of Wessex. He was crowned at Kingston-upon-Thames in Surrey. Almost immediately, the savage Viking invasions on Wessex were renewed. &lt;br /&gt;
The Vikings merciless raids of pillage, slaughter and rape struck abject terror into Saxon hearts, leaving destruction, desolation and smoking ruins in their wake. The people had good cause to utter the much repeated prayer &quot;From the fury of the Northmen , O Lord, deliver us.&quot; The Vikings who harried Wessex at this time were Danish. A huge Viking fleet landed in East Anglia in 865, under the curiously named Ivar the Boneless, who was for some time the driving force behind the Viking attacks on England. His army remained there for a while, garnering it's resources for a major invasion. The city of Winchester, the ancient capital of Wessex, was burned to the ground.&lt;br /&gt;
A minor victory over the raiding Vikings was achieved by the Saxons of Hampshire and Berkshire under Aldermen Athelwulf and Osric. The Vikings occupied the Isle of Thanet, where they spent the Winter. They were bought off by the men of Kent, but characteristically, did not keep the agreement and began to ravage England with renewed force shortly thereafter. &lt;br /&gt;
Ethelbert died, unmarried and childless, in 866 at around the age of thirty-five. He had reigned for only five years. His body was interred at Sherborne Abbey in Dorset.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Ethelred I ruled England from 866 to 871. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Ethelred I was born around 834 and like his father [[A History of the British Monarchy/Saxon Rulers/Ethelwulf|Ethelwulf]], was a man of great piety, who had been brought up very religiously by his mother, Queen Osburh. Ethelred succeeded his brother [[A History of the British Monarchy/Saxon Rulers/Ethelbert|Ethelbert]]in 866 to a land that was being ravaged mercilessly by the full fury of savage Viking onslaughts. The Danes were beginning to settle in England and in 870 siezed control of York. Ethelred took up the struggle against them with renewed vigour.&lt;br /&gt;
The dynastic ties which allied the House of Wessex to that of Mercia were strengthened. Burghred, King of Mercia had married Ethelswitha, the daughter of Ethelwulf of Wessex. Ethelred's younger brother, Alfred, renewed the bond of alliance when he took his first cousin, Elswitha of Mercia, to be his wife. Ethelred himself married Wulfrida around two years after his accession to the throne of Wessex, they produced two sons Ethelwald, who was born around 868 and Ethelhelm, whose date of birth is unknown.&lt;br /&gt;

In the year prior to Ethelred's accession, a large Viking army had landed in East Anglia, under the leadership of Halfdan and Ivar the Boneless. After a few months it marched up to Northumbria, taking the city of York, the Vikings exacted a terrible vengeance on Aelle, the Northumbrian leader, who suffered a horrific death at their hands, as revenge for his issuing the order to throw the Viking chieftain, Ragnar Lothbrok into a pit of adders some twenty years previously. 
Ragnar's sons, Halfdane and Hingwar, subjected Aelle to the Viking form of execution known as the spreadeagle, or bloodeagle, whereby the victim was pinned face down on the ground and his ribs separated from his spine. The ribs were then forced outwards, forming a pair of wings. The Danes set up their own ruler in Northumbria, before crossing the border into Mercia, advancing into the province and taking the town of Nottingham. King Burghred of Mercia requested aid from his kinsmen, Ethelred and Alfred. They responded with alacrity, marching into Mercia at the head of an army, but the Danes retained possession of the town.&lt;br /&gt;
In 869 the seemingly unstoppable Viking army advanced into East Anglia. The sub-king of the province, Edmund, opposed them valiantly but the East Anglians were defeated and their King taken prisoner whilst fleeing to the town of Hoxne, in Suffolk. Chained and manacled, Edmund was murdered in a ferocious and barbarous fashion, believed to have been sacrificed to the Viking god, Odin. &lt;br /&gt;

He met his end with dignity and courage and was later canonized for remaining steadfast in his Catholic faith. Monasteries were raised to the ground, monks slaughtered and plundering took place on a massive scale.&lt;br /&gt;

By 870, the Vikings, spurred on by their success in Northumbria, prepared to attack the kingdom of Wessex. They were met by a force of Saxons under Ethelred and Alfred, their army blocking the ancient road across the Berkshire downs by an Iron Age hill fort on Whitehorse Hill, at a spot known to the Saxons as Nachededorne or the naked thorn. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, our chief source of information on the period, refers to the spot as Ashdown. Ethelred finally won victory over the Vikings in a bitter and bloody pitched battle which lasted until nightfall, leaving many of the bodies of the Danish leaders littering the battlefield. &lt;br /&gt;

For many centuries it was thought that the 325 feet long White Horse was cut in the hillside to commemorate Ethelred's great victory, but it is now known to be much older. This victory brought no permanent advantage, however, and the conflict continued. The Viking invaders descended again, skirmishing continued and an inconclusive battle was fought at Basing. Ethelred, supported loyally by his brother Alfred, refused to surrender. The raven banner of the Vikings and the dragon of Wessex were hoisted again at Meredune, which is believed to have been either Marden, near Devizes or Martin in Hampshire. In the furious conflict that ensued, the Danes emerged the victors. Ethelred died shortly after at Wimborne, from wounds sustained in the battle, according to one account he died in agony. He was no older than thirty at his death and was buried at nearby Wimborne Minster.&lt;br /&gt;

Ethelred was posthumously refuted as a saint. Although he left two sons he was succeeded by his youngest brother, Alfred known to history as the Great.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Alfred the Great was the monarch of England from 871 to 899.

No other ruler in England's long and varied history has been honored with the title &quot;the Great&quot;. Alfred once declared it his intention &quot;To live worthily as long as I live and after my life to leave to them that should come after, my memory in good works.&quot; Few of the other monarchs have succeeded as spectacularly in their aims as he did.

==Early Life==

Alfred (Old English-Aelfred) was the fifth and youngest son of [[A History of the British Monarchy/Saxon Rulers/Ethelwulf|Ethelwulf of Wessex]] and his Jutish first wife, Osburh. He was born at Wantage between 847 and 849, his birthplace was a palace or vill which lay at the foot of the Berkshire Downs, which has now vanished. Ill health is reported to have marred Alfred's childhood.

One of the few stories that survive from Alfred's early life relates that his mother, Osburh, showed her sons a beautifully illuminated volume of Saxon poetry and promised to make a gift of it to the first of them who was able to read it. Alfred quickly learned to read it aloud, and was made a gift of the book when he was only six years old. His youngest son appears to have been Ethelwulf's favourite, his father took Alfred on pilgrimage to Rome, to receive the blessing of his godfather, Pope Leo IV. It was rumoured that King Ethelwulf wished to make Alfred his successor.

On Ethelwulf's return to England he found his eldest son, [[A History of the British Monarchy/Saxon Rulers/Ethelbald|Ethelbald]], had usurped his throne in his absence. Nobly accepting the status quo in the hope that civil war and the consequent loss of life could be avoided, Ethelwulf retired to Kent, where he reigned as sub-king until his death in 858. Alfred was around eleven when his father died. He was studious as a child and grew to be a man of determination, intelligence and resolution, despite suffering from ill health for much of his life.

Alfred's three elder brothers’ reigned in turn before him. During the reign of the youngest of these, [[A History of the British Monarchy/Saxon Rulers/Ethelred I|Ethelred I]] , Alfred emerges from the mists of obscurity to fight loyally by his side in the struggle against the Danish incursions into Wessex. At the Battle of Ashdown, in the Vale of the White Horse, the pious Ethelred remained so long in his tent praying for victory that Alfred became impatient and lead his men in a furious charge at the enemy without waiting for his brother to finish his prayers.

==The Conflict with the Danes==

The Witangemot, or Saxon council of wise men, met after Ethelred's death from wounds sustained in battle and elected the twenty-one year old Alfred, who had already demonstrated himself a confident leader of men, as King. His brothers between them had lasted barely a decade. In electing Alfred king the Witan passed over the two young sons of Ethelred. The law of primogeniture was not then established in Saxon England and it was normal practice for the King to be elected in this manner. The practice of crowning a successor as royal prince and military commander is well-known among Germanic tribes.

The depressing series of defeats at the hands of the Vikings continued unabated and Alfred was forced into a strategy of buying them off. As a result they ceased their attacks and for a period of five years, peace reigned in Wessex. This peace was not likely to last for any considerable length of time and was at best a temporary measure. The Viking army, after taking Mercia, then divided. One part, under Halfdan, marched north to Yorkshire where they settled permanently. The other, under Guthrum, launched another attack on Wessex in 875. They withdrew again in 877 and began to colonize Mercia.

Wessex was savagely attacked for the third time in 878 and Alfred was driven into hiding at Athelney in the Somerset marshes, he remained there with his ally, Athelnoth, Ealdorman of Somerset and other thegns, biding his time. Legend has it that, in his preoccupation with the defence of his kingdom, he famously burnt some cakes he was supposed to be watching over and was set upon by an angry housewife.&lt;br /&gt;

Bishop Asser informs us that Alfred had a great love of jeweled ornaments. His crown, which unfortunately no longer survives, is listed in an inventory of jewels melted down by Oliver Cromwell at the establishment of the Protectorate, it is described as being studded with emeralds.

In 886, Alfred garnered his resources and managed to retake the city of London, but Viking raids continued. At the battle of Ethendun in 878, Saxon forces soundly defeated the Vikings lead by Guthrum and peace was concluded by the terms of the Treaty of Wedmore. Guthrum converted to Christianity with Alfred standing as godfather to his erstwhile enemy. Alfred accepted the Danish colonisation of much of England. A line was drawn which ran north-westwards from London to Chester, defining an area north of this line which was termed the Danelaw.

Alfred improved his army, making provision for it to be always available at short notice to defend Wessex. Part of the army was always kept in reserve in case of emergency. The navy was similarly improved, building ships which were bigger and better than those possessed by the Vikings.

King Alfred built up defenses and fortified townships to ensure the safety of his people. He established defended settlements, or burhs (from which derives the modern borough) These settlements were recorded in detail in the Burghal Hidage. A network of burhs was established to ensure that no part of Wessex was further than 20 miles from these strongholds. By 897 he had successfully halted the advance of the Vikings, a remarkable achievement.

==Peacetime Achievements==

The King turned his attention to the deterioration of learning in England. Due to the continued pillage of monasteries by the Vikings, which essentially formed a network of rudimentary education at the time, educational standards had diminished. Alfred founded a court school to educate the nobles and encouraged the great scholars of his day to take up residence in England. &quot;It is most needful for men to know&quot; he is recorded as stating &quot;and to bring it to pass, if we have peace, that all the youth now in England-may be devoted to learning.&quot; The royal court was to become a magnet for scholars.

On the insistence of the King, English became the official written language. Alfred personally translated into English 'The History of the Venerable Bede', 'Boethius's Consolation of Philosophy', 'Dialogues of Gregory the Great', Gregory's 'Pastoral Care'. and Orosius' Soliloquies of St. Augustine'. Prior to this, all books had been written in Latin.

Alfred is also noted for beginning the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle in the 890's and had many copies made. The chronicle was written in Anglo-Saxon, rather than the usual Latin. Alfred decreed that these copies be placed in monasteries and churches and frequently updated. The chronicle was updated until the twelfth century, some of the original copies still survive to the present day. It remains one of the few literary sources we possess for English history from the departure of the Romans to the Norman Conquest.

Alfred established a legal code, forming a body of Saxon law, based on the laws of Offa of Mercia, which limited the practice of blood feuding and imposed heavy penalties on those in breach of sworn oath.

:&quot;I ... collected these together and ordered to be written many of them which our forefathers observed, those which I liked; and many of those which I did not like I rejected with the advice of my councilors ... For I dared not presume to set in writing at all many of my own, because it was unknown to me what would please those who should come after us ... Then I ... showed those to all my councilors, and they then said that they were all pleased to observe them&quot; (Laws of Alfred, c.885-99). 

Throughout his life, Alfred had suffered from a mysterious illness, about which little is known with certainty, but which left him incapacitated for long periods. This is one of the most puzzling and often discussed areas of Alfred's life. Bishop Asser informs us that Alfred suffered bouts of depression after each attack. The first attack apparently occurred at his wedding. It has been suggested that Alfred may have suffered from epilepsy, although there is no concrete proof as to what the illness he labored under for a large part of his life actually was.

==The Death of Alfred==

Alfred died at Wantage in 899 at the age of fifty-three. He remains the only English sovereign ever to be given the epithet the Great, which was bestowed on him in the seventeenth century. King Alfred was buried in the Old Minster at Winchester but a few years later, on the completion of the New Minster, which Alfred had founded, his body was translated there, it was soon to be named Hyde Abbey.

On the Dissolution of the Monasteries, Hyde Abbey, in common with other religious houses was despoiled and in an act of historical vandalism, the tombs of the Saxon kings were destroyed. Some of the bones from the tombs, although mixed up, were collected into caskets and placed above the chancel in Winchester Cathedral. Alfred's remains are believed to be amongst these. The fame and reputation of King Alfred, one of the ablest of England's Kings, were never to diminish. Florence of Worcester, writing in the thirteenth century, has left us with a fitting statement on Alfred:

:&quot;Alfred the King of the Anglo-Saxons, the son of the most pious King Ethelwulf, the famous, the warlike, the victorious, the careful provider for the widow, the helpless, the orphan and the poor, the most skilled of Saxon poets, most dear to his own nation, courteous to all, most liberal, endowed with prudence, fortitude, justice and temperance; most patient in the infirmity from which he continually suffered; the most discerning investigator in executing justice, most watchful and devout in the service of God.&quot;

Many Kings could not wish for a finer epitaph.

==Alfred the Great==
===The Alfred Jewel===

In 1693, a remarkable discovery of a Saxon jewel was made near Athelney, now known as the Alfred Jewel and housed in the Ashmolean Museum at Oxford. As the Jewel contains no fastening, it is not thought to be a brooch or a clasp. It is probable that it formed the crown of a writing instrument. 

===The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle===

The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle began to be compiled in around 890 A.D., at the command of King Alfred the Great (871- 899) and consists of a series of annals written in the Old English language. 

Alfred ordered that copies be made of the original manuscripts and distributed to monasteries across the length and breadth of England, which were to be regularly updated. One particular version of the chronicle was still being actively updated in 1154 and dates to the end of King Stephen's reign. 
Nine versions of the chronicle have survived to the present day. Of these seven are written entirely in the Anglo-Saxon language. Another version survives in Old English with a translation of each annal into Latin. The other, known as the Peterborough Chronicle, is recorded in Old English with the exception of the last entry, which is in early Middle English. Six of these copies are kept at the British Library. 

The Chronicle is the oldest history of any European country in a vernacular language. Its early entries are essentially an official history of the Wessex dynasty and it is one of the few literary sources we possess for England's history during the period. Reporting on the reign of King Egbert, it states:- 

'The moon darkened on Christmas Eve. That year King Ecgbryht overcame the Mercian kingdom, and all that was south of the Humber. He was the eighth king who was ruler of Britain; the first was Aelle, king of Sussex, who had done this much. The second was Ceawlin, king of Wessex, the third was Aethelbryht, king of Kent, the fourth was Raedwald, king of East Anglia; the fifth was Edwin, king of Northumbria; the sixth, Oswald, who ruled after him; the seventh was Oswald's brother Oswiu. The eighth was Ecgbryht, king of Wessex, and this Ecgbryht led troops to Dore against the Northumbrians. They offered him submission, and a treaty; with that they parted'

The chronicle records the Battle of Hastings: 

:'Then Count William came from Normandy to Pevensey on Michaelmas Eve, and as soon as they were able to move on they built a castle at Hastings. King Harold was informed of this and he assembled a large army and came against him at the hoary apple tree. And William came against him by surprise before his army was drawn up in battle array. But the king nevertheless fought hard against him, with the men who were willing to support him, and there were heavy casualties on both sides. Then King Harold was killed, and Earl Leofwine his brother, and Earl Grythe his brother, and many good men, and the French remained masters of the field...'

The sufferings of the common people during the Civil War of Stephen and Matilda are also vividly described:

:'In the days of this King there was nothing but strife, evil and robbery, for quickly the great men who were traitors rose against him. When the traitors saw that Stephen was a mild good humored man who inflicted no punishment, then they committed all manner of horrible crimes. They had done him homage and sworn oaths of fealty to him, but not one of their oaths was kept. They were all forsworn and their oaths broken. For every great man built him castles and held them against the king; they sorely burdened the unhappy people of the country with forced labor on the castles; and when the castles were built they filled them with devils and wicked men. By night and by day they seized those they believed to have any wealth, whether they were men or women; and in order to get their gold or silver, they put them into prison and tortured them with unspeakable tortures, for never were martyrs tortured as they were. They hung them up by the feet and smoked them with foul smoke. They strung them up by the thumbs, or by the head, and hung coats of mail on their feet. They tied knotted cords round their heads and twisted it until it entered the brain. they put them in dungeons wherein were adders and snakes and toads and so destroyed them. 
Many thousands they starved to death. I know not how to, nor am I able to tell of, all the atrocities nor all the cruelties which they wrought upon the unhappy people of this country. It lasted throughout the nineteen years that Stephen was king, and always grew worse and worse. Never did a country endure greater misery, and never did the heathen act more vilely than they did. And so it lasted for nineteen long years while Stephen was King, till the land was all undone and darkened with such deeds and men said openly that Christ and his saints slept.'

      <text xml:space="preserve">Edward the Elder ruled England from the year 899 to the year 924.

During the reign of his father Alfred the Great, Edward the Elder had taken an active role in his campaigns against the Vikings. On the great Alfred's death the succession was disputed between Edward or Eadweard and Ethelwald, the son of Alfred's elder brother [[A History of the British Monarchy/Saxon Rulers/Ethelred I|Ethelred I]] . The Witan elected Edward as King.

Ethelwald reacted by seizing the crown estates at Wimborne and Christchurch. Edward was quick to respond to the threat, but his cousin escaped and sought refuge with the Vikings of Northumbria. He returned in 905 at the head of an army, battle ensued at Holme in Essex, during the course of which Ethelwald himself was killed, but the Danes eventually emerged the victors. Edward escaped the battlefield unhurt and later negotiated a treaty with his enemies.

The treaty was broken on the arrival of Reginald, son of Guthred, in Northumbria, who quickly captured the city of York and occupied the northern kingdom of Bernica. At the same time, Mercia was yet again invaded, the Danes advancing as far as the Severn. Edward, leading a joint force from Wessex and Mercia, again encountered them in battle at Tettenhall in Staffordshire and on this occasion won a decisive victory.

Along with his sister Ethelfleda, the widow of King Ethelred of Mercia, who was known as the Lady of Mercia, Edward spent most of the early part of his reign engaged in the intermittent conflict with the Vikings. Ethelfleda embarked on a policy of fortifying towns against the Danes. A true daughter of [[A History of the British Monarchy/Saxon Rulers/Alfred the Great|Alfred the Great]], she defeated them in battle in Wales, from where they had threatened Mercia's western border. Edward slowly gained ground against the Danes, eventually pushing the boundaries of Wessex and Mercia northwards.

Following his sister's example, the King secured his re-conquests by building strong fortifications to defend them. London and Oxford were turned into strong garrisons to support King Edward's campaign against the Danes.

The British princes, including Howel the Good, Prince of Wales, or Wealas (Anglo-Saxon for foreigner) and Cledauc accepted Edward the Elder as their overlord. In the year 920, the Kings of the North, including Sigtrygg Caech (the squinty), Constantine II, King of Scots and Donald Mac Aedh, King of Strathclyde, met King Edward at Bakewell in Derbyshire, fully recognising his overlordship. 
Edward also reorganized the Church in Wessex, creating new bishoprics at Ramsbury and Sonning, Wells and Crediton.

The first mention of Edward's eponym the Elder occurs in the tenth century, when it was used in Wulfstan's Life of St Æthelwold, to distinguish him from the later King of the same name, Edward the Martyr. Unusual for a member of the House of Wessex, Edward does not seem to have been a particularly devout son of the church. On the contrary, the church in Wessex appears to have been neglected in his reign, leading the Pope to deliver a reprimand to the king.

His sister Ethelfleda died in 920 and her daughter and heiress, Elfwina, suceeded to the province, she became known by the title her mother formerly had held, the Lady of Mercia. Elfwina in turn recognised her uncle, Edward, as her overlord. Although Mercia and Wessex remained two separate territories, they were now united under the same ruler.

Edward the Elder died while leading an army to combat a Cambro-Mercian rebellion, on 17 July 924 at Farndon-on-Dee, Mercia, his body was buried at the the New Minster at Winchester, which Edward himself had established. Following the Norman Conquest, the minster was replaced by Hyde Abbey and King Edward's body was transferred there. His grave is currently marked by a cross-inscribed stone slab within the outline of the old abbey marked out in a public park.

He was succeeded by his eldest son, Athelstan whom he had named as his heir.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The following is my ongoing translation of &quot;ЗАДАЧНИК&quot; by &quot;Григорий Остер&quot;.
This is being done as an on going effort to improve my Russian. I have tried to make the translations as close to the text as possible. Grammer was minimally changed to make sense in English.

== Preface ==
''Should I tell you a sadistic anecdote? A children's writer comes to his readers and says: &quot;I wrote you a new book – A collection of problems in mathematics.&quot;''&lt;br /&gt;
''This is almost like on a birthday instead of a cake, one places on a table, a pot of porridge. But to be truthful, the book open in front of you is not really a collection of problems.''

== For Teachers ==
No, no, the problems here are the most real. For second, third, and forth grade. They all have solutions and help strengthen the passing of associated classes of this material. Actually the main problem of the &quot;Problem Collection&quot; is not to strength material; in all, these problems have nothing to do with the naming &quot;busying mathematics.&quot; I think that there will be no professional interest at placing these problems in the finals of a mathematical olympiad. These problems are for people who don't like mathematics, who got used to thinking solutions to problems as dreadful and annoying difficulty. Let them try and figure it out!

== For Students ==
Dear guys, this book is purposely called &quot;Problem Collection,&quot; to be able to read it during math classes and not hide under the table. If the the teacher starts freaking out, say: &quot;I don't know anything - the Ministry of Education allowed it.&quot;

==== 1 ====
Firemen are taught to put on pants within three seconds. How many pants will a well trained fireman have time to put on within five minutes?

=== 2 ===
If one carefully crawls up to grandpa and dad from behind and suddenly shouts &quot;Yey!&quot;, dad will jump up 18 cm. Grandpa lived through hard years and isn't as so similar, jumps up 5 cm. How many centimeters above grandpa does dad jump, hearing the sudden &quot;Yey!&quot;?

=== 3 ===
Two numbers, 5 and 3 once came into a place where thrown everywhere were different differences, and they started looking for their own.
Find the difference of these numbers.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{dewikify}}
Ribonucleic acid is popularly known as RNA. RNA is one of the three major macromolecules (along with DNA and proteins) that are essential for all known forms of life.The chemical structure of RNA is very similar to that of DNA, with two differences--(a) RNA contains the sugar ribose while DNA contains the slightly different sugar deoxyribose (a type of ribose that lacks one oxygen atom), and (b) RNA has the nucleobase uracil while DNA contains thymine (uracil and thymine have similar base-pairing properties).
Messenger RNA (mRNA) is the RNA that carries information from DNA to the ribosome, the sites of protein synthesis (translation) in the cell. The coding sequence of the mRNA determines the amino acid sequence in the protein that is produced. Many RNAs do not code for protein however (about 97% of the transcriptional output is non-protein-coding in eukaryotes ).
These so-called non-coding RNAs (&quot;ncRNA&quot;) can be encoded by their own genes (RNA genes), but can also derive from mRNA introns. The most prominent examples of non-coding RNAs are transfer RNA (tRNA) and ribosomal RNA (rRNA), both of which are involved in the process of translation.There are also non-coding RNAs involved in gene regulation, RNA processing and other roles. Certain RNAs are able to catalyse chemical reactions such as cutting and ligating other RNA molecules, and the catalysis of peptide bond formation in the ribosome;these are known as ribozymes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA RNA]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of RNA==

Nucleic acids were discovered in 1868 by Friedrich Miescher, who called the material 'nuclein' since it was found in the nucleus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Dahm R| title=Friedrich Miescher and the discovery of DNA | journal=Developmental Biology | year=2005| volume=278| issue=2| pages=274–88 | pmid=15680349 | doi = 10.1016/j.ydbio.2004.11.028}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later discovered that prokaryotic cells, which do not have a nucleus, also contain nucleic acids. The role of RNA in protein synthesis was suspected already in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal=Nature | author=Caspersson T, Schultz J | title=Pentose nucleotides in the cytoplasm of growing tissues | year=1939 | volume=143 | doi=10.1038/143602c0 | pages=602–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;Severo Ochoa won the 1959 Nobel Prize in Medicine (shared with Arthur Kornberg) after he discovered an enzyme that can synthesize RNA in the laboratory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Ochoa S| title=Enzymatic synthesis of ribonucleic acid| work=Nobel Lecture |year=1959| url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1959/ochoa-lecture.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ironically, the enzyme discovered by Ochoa (polynucleotide phosphorylase) was later shown to be responsible for RNA degradation, not RNA synthesis. 

The sequence of the 77 nucleotides of a yeast tRNA was found by Robert W. Holley in 1965,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite  journal  | author=Holley RW ''et al.''| title=Structure of a ribonucleic acid | journal=Science| year=1965| volume=147| issue=1664| pages=1462–65| doi=10.1126/science.147.3664.1462 | pmid = 14263761  }}&lt;/ref&gt; winning Holley the 1968 Nobel Prize in Medicine (shared with Har Gobind Khorana and Marshall Nirenberg).

In 1967, Carl Woese hypothesized that RNA might be catalytic and suggested that the earliest forms of life (self-replicating molecules) could have relied on RNA both to carry genetic information and to catalyze biochemical reactions&amp;mdash;an RNA world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Common sequence structure properties and stable regions in RNA secondary structures| author=Siebert S| year=2006| pages=1| url=http://deposit.ddb.de/cgi-bin/dokserv?idn=982323891&amp;dok_var=d1&amp;dok_ext=pdf&amp;filename=982323891.pdf| work=Dissertation, Albert-Ludwigs-Universität, Freiburg im Breisgau}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite  journal  | title=The origin of the genetic code: amino acids as cofactors in an RNA world| author=Szathmáry E| journal=Trends Genet.| year=1999| volume=15| issue=6| pages=223–9| doi=10.1016/S0168-9525(99)01730-8 | pmid = 10354582  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early 1970s, retroviruses and reverse transcriptase were discovered, showing for the first time that enzymes could copy RNA into DNA (the opposite of the usual route for transmission of genetic information). For this work, David Baltimore, Renato Dulbecco and Howard Temin were awarded a Nobel Prize in 1975.
In 1976, Walter Fiers and his team determined the first complete nucleotide sequence of an RNA virus genome, that of bacteriophage MS2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Fiers W ''et al.''| title=Complete nucleotide-sequence of bacteriophage MS2-RNA: primary and secondary structure of replicase gene| journal=Nature| year=1976| volume=260| pages=500–7| pmid=1264203 | doi = 10.1038/260500a0 | last12=Ysebaert | first12=M | issue=5551}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1977, introns and RNA splicing were discovered in both mammalian viruses and in cellular genes, resulting in a 1993 Nobel to Philip Sharp and Richard Roberts.
Catalytic RNA molecules (ribozymes) were discovered in the early 1980s, leading to a 1989 Nobel award to Thomas Cech and Sidney Altman. In 1990 it was found in petunia that introduced genes can silence similar genes of the plant's own, now known to be a result of RNA interference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Napoli C, Lemieux C, Jorgensen R| title=Introduction of a chimeric chalcone synthase gene into petunia results in reversible co-suppression of homologous genes in trans| journal=Plant Cell| year=1990| volume=2| issue=4| pages=279–89| pmid=12354959 | doi = 10.1105/tpc.2.4.279 | pmc=159885}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dafny-Yelin M, Chung SM, Frankman EL, Tzfira T |title=pSAT RNA interference vectors: a modular series for multiple gene down-regulation in plants |journal=Plant Physiol. |volume=145 |issue=4 |pages=1272–81 |year=2007 |month=December |pmid=17766396 |pmc=2151715 |doi=10.1104/pp.107.106062}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

At about the same time, 22 nt long RNAs, now called microRNAs, were found to have a role in the development of ''C. elegans''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite  journal | author=Ruvkun G| title=Glimpses of a tiny RNA world| journal=Science| year=2001| volume=294| issue=5543| pages=797–99| doi=10.1126/science.1066315 | pmid = 11679654}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Studies on RNA interference gleaned a Nobel Prize for Andrew Fire and Craig Mello in 2006, and another Nobel was awarded for studies on transcription of RNA to Roger Kornberg in the same year. The discovery of gene regulatory RNAs has led to attempts to develop drugs made of RNA, such as siRNA, to silence genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite  journal | author=Fichou Y, Férec C| title=The potential of oligonucleotides for therapeutic applications| journal=Trends in Biotechnology| year=2006| volume=24| issue=12| pages=563–70| doi=10.1016/j.tibtech.2006.10.003 | pmid = 17045686}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of RNA==

===RNAs involved in protein synthesis===

====Messenger RNA====
Messenger RNA (mRNA) is a molecule of RNA encoding a chemical &quot;blueprint&quot; for a protein product. mRNA is transcribed from a DNA template, and carries coding information to the sites of protein synthesis: the ribosomes. Here, the nucleic acid polymer is translated into a polymer of amino acids: a protein. In mRNA as in DNA, genetic information is encoded in the sequence of nucleotides arranged into codons consisting of three bases each. Each codon encodes for a specific amino acid, except the stop codons that terminate protein synthesis. This process requires two other types of RNA: transfer RNA (tRNA) mediates recognition of the codon and provides the corresponding amino acid, while ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is the central component of the ribosome's protein manufacturing machinery.

[[File:MRNA structure.svg|thumb|700px|center|The structure of a mature eukaryotic mRNA. A fully processed mRNA includes a 5' cap, 5' UTR, coding region, 3' UTR, and poly(A) tail.]]

====Ribosomal RNA====
Ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) is the RNA component of the ribosome, the organelle that is the site of protein synthesis in all living cells. Ribosomal RNA provides a mechanism for decoding mRNA into amino acids and interacts with tRNAs during translation by providing peptidyl transferase activity. The tRNAs bring the necessary amino acids corresponding to the appropriate mRNA codon.

&lt;gallery&gt;
File:Ribosome shape.png|rRNA
&lt;/gallery&gt;

====tRNA====

Transfer RNA (tRNA) is a small RNA molecule (usually about 73-95 nucleotides) that transfers a specific active amino acid to a growing polypeptide chain at the ribosomal site of protein synthesis during translation. It has a 3' terminal site for amino acid attachment. This covalent linkage is catalyzed by an aminoacyl tRNA synthetase. It also contains a three base region called the anticodon that can base pair to the corresponding three base codon region on mRNA. Each type of tRNA molecule can be attached to only one type of amino acid, but because the genetic code contains multiple codons that specify the same amino acid, tRNA molecules bearing different anticodons may also carry the same amino acid.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===RNAs involved in post-transcriptional===


====Small nuclear ribonucleic acid (snRNA)====
Small nuclear ribonucleic acid (snRNA) is a class of small RNA molecules that are found within the nucleus of eukaryotic cells. They are transcribed by RNA polymerase II or RNA polymerase III and are involved in a variety of important processes such as RNA splicing (removal of introns from hnRNA), regulation of transcription factors (7SK RNA) or RNA polymerase II (B2 RNA), and maintaining the telomeres. They are always associated with specific proteins, and the complexes are referred to as small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNP) or sometimes as snurps. These elements are rich in uridine content.

====Small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs)====
Small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) are a class of small RNA molecules that primarily guide chemical modifications of other RNAs, mainly ribosomal RNAs, transfer RNAs and small nuclear RNAs. There are two main classes of snoRNA, the C/D box snoRNAs which are associated with methylation, and the H/ACA box snoRNAs which are associated with pseudouridylation. snoRNAs are commonly referred to as guide RNAs but should not be confused with the guide RNAs that direct RNA editing in trypanosomes.

After transcription, nascent rRNA molecules (termed pre-rRNA) are required to undergo a series of processing steps in order to generate the mature rRNA molecule. Prior to cleavage by exo- and endonucleases the pre-rRNA undergoes a complex pattern of nucleoside modifications. These include methylations and pseudouridylations, guided by snoRNAs.
Methylation is the attachment or substitution of a methyl group onto various substrates. The rRNA of humans contain approximately 115 methyl group modifications. The majority of these are 2'O-ribose-methylations ( where the methyl group is attached to the ribose group). 
Pseudouridylation is the conversion (isomerisation) of the nucleoside uridine to a different isomeric form pseudouridine(Ψ). Mature human rRNAs contain approximately 95 Ψ modifications.
Each snoRNA molecule acts as a guide for only one (or two) individual modifications in a target RNA. In order to carry out modification, each snoRNA associates with at least four protein molecules in an RNA/protein complex referred to as a small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein (snoRNP). The proteins associated with each RNA depend on the type of snoRNA molecule (see snoRNA guide families below). The snoRNA molecule contains an antisense element (a stretch of 10-20 nucleotides) which are base complementary to the sequence surrounding the base (nucleotide) targeted for modification in the pre-RNA molecule. This enables the snoRNP to recognise and bind to the target RNA. Once the snoRNP has bound to the target site the associated proteins are in the correct physical location to catalyse the chemical modification of the target base.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_nucleolar_RNA Small nucleolar RNA]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ribonuclease P (RNase P)====
Ribonuclease P (RNase P) is a type of Ribonuclease which cleaves RNA. RNase P is unique from other RNases in that it is a ribozyme – a ribonucleic acid that acts as a catalyst in the same way that a protein based enzyme would. Its function is to cleave off an extra, or precursor, sequence of RNA on tRNA molecules

====Telomerase RNA ====
Telomerase RNA component, also known as TERC, is an RNA gene found in eukaryotes, that is a component of telomerase used to extend telomeres. Telomerase RNAs differ greatly in sequence and structure between vertebrates, ciliates and yeasts, but they share a 5' pseudoknot structure close to the template sequence. The vertebrate telomerase RNAs have a 3' H/ACA snoRNA-like domain.

==Regulatory RNAs==
===Antisense RNA===
Antisense RNA is a single-stranded RNA that is complementary to a messenger RNA (mRNA) strand transcribed within a cell. Antisense RNA may be introduced into a cell to inhibit translation of a complementary mRNA by base pairing to it and physically obstructing the translation machinery. This effect is therefore stoichiometric. An example of naturally occurring mRNA antisense mechanism is the hok/sok system of the E.coli R1 plasmid. Antisense RNA has long been thought of as a promising technique for disease therapy; the only such case to have reached the market is the drug fomivirsen. One commentator has characterized antisense RNA as one of &quot;dozens of technologies that are gorgeous in concept, but exasperating in &quot;. Generally, antisense RNA still lack effective design, biological activity, and efficient route of administration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisense_RNA Antisense RNA]&lt;/ref&gt;

===MicroRNAs (miRNAs)===
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short ribonucleic acid (RNA) molecules, on average only 22 nucleotides long and are found in all eukaryotic cells. miRNAs are post-transcriptional regulators that bind to complementary sequences on target messenger RNA transcripts (mRNAs), usually resulting in translational repression and gene silencing. The human genome may encode over 1000 miRNAs, which may target about 60% of mammalian genes and are abundant in many human cell types.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Small interfering RNA (siRNA)===
Small interfering RNA (siRNA), sometimes known as short interfering RNA or silencing RNA, is a class of double-stranded RNA molecules, 20-25 nucleotides in length, that play a variety of roles in biology. Most notably, siRNA is involved in the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway, where it interferes with the expression of a specific gene. In addition to their role in the RNAi pathway, siRNAs also act in RNAi-related pathways, e.g., as an antiviral mechanism or in shaping the chromatin structure of a genome; the complexity of these pathways is only now being elucidated.
siRNAs were first discovered by David Baulcombe's group at the Sainsbury Laboratory in Norwich, England, as part of post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) in plants.&lt;br /&gt;
'''IDENTIFICATION OF SMALL-INTERFERING RNA'''&lt;br /&gt;
By using mapping studies, it showed that target transcript cleavage corresponded to regions that they are complementary to dsRNA and occurred at 21–22-nt intervals which looks like the same size of dsRNA-derived small RNAs. To test if small RNAs mediate RISC activity, 21– 22-nt RNA duplexes with symmetric 2-nt 3′ overhangs were synthesized to mimic dsRNA- processing products. Certainly, these synthetic oligonucleotides induced target mRNA cleavage at sites corresponding to the middle of small RNA. Therefore, these dsRNA-derived small RNAs were designated as small-interfering RNAs (siRNAs). Nevertheless, a most important contribution was made by demonstration of target transcript silencing through transfection of synthetic siRNAs into mammalian cells. This work provided the foundation for numerous RNAi-based applications, including powerful &quot;shut down&quot; function strategy and a new potential therapeutics. As such, these milestone studies provided an spectacular example of the importance of basic science, including traditional biochemistry, in generating new areas for biomedical applications.

==Structure of RNA==
[[Image:Beta-D-Ribofuranose.svg|thumb|left|100px|Ribose.]]
[[Image:Deoxyribose1.PNG|thumb|Right|400px|Chemical equilibrium of deoxyribose in solution.]]
Each nucleotide in RNA contains a ribose sugar, with carbons numbered 1' through 5'. A base is attached to the 1' position, in general, adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), or uracil (U). Adenine and guanine are purines, cytosine, and uracil are pyrimidines. A phosphate group is attached to the 3' position of one ribose and the 5' position of the next. The phosphate groups have a negative charge each at physiological pH, making RNA a charged molecule (polyanion). The bases may form hydrogen bonds between cytosine and guanine, between adenine and uracil and between guanine and uracil.However, other interactions are possible, such as a group of adenine bases binding to each other in a bulge, or the GNRA tetraloop that has a guanine–adenine base-pair.

An important structural feature of RNA that distinguishes it from DNA is the presence of a hydroxyl group at the 2' position of the ribose sugar. The presence of this functional group causes the helix to adopt the A-form geometry rather than the B-form most commonly observed in DNA. This results in a very deep and narrow major groove and a shallow and wide minor groove. A second consequence of the presence of the 2'-hydroxyl group is that in conformationally flexible regions of an RNA molecule (that is, not involved in formation of a double helix), it can chemically attack the adjacent phosphodiester bond to cleave the backbone.

Ribose is an aldopentose, that is a monosaccharide containing five carbon atoms that, in its open chain form, has an aldehyde functional group at one end. In the conventional numbering scheme for monosaccharides, the carbon atoms are numbered from C1' (in the aldehyde group) to C5'. The deoxyribose derivative, found in DNA, differs from ribose by having a hydrogen atom in place of the hydroxyl group in carbon C2'.
Like many monosaccharides, ribose occurs in water as the linear form H-(C=O)-(CHOH)4-H and any of two ring forms: ribofuranose (&quot;C3'-endo&quot;), with a five-membered ring, and ribopyranose (&quot;C2'-endo&quot;), with a six-membered ring. The ribofuranose form is predominant in aqueous solution.
The &quot;D-&quot; in the name D-ribose refers to the stereochemistry of the chiral carbon atom farthest away from the aldehyde group (C4'). In D-ribose, as in all D-sugars, this carbon atom has the same configuration as in D-glyceraldehyde.
Ribose comprises the backbone of RNA, a biopolymer that is the basis of genetic transcription. It is related to deoxyribose, as found in DNA. Once phosphorylated, ribose can become a subunit of ATP, NADH, and several other compounds that are critical to metabolism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA RNA]&lt;/ref&gt;

==RNA base==

'''adenine (A)'''

Adenine (A,) is a nucleobase (a purine derivative) with a variety of roles in biochemistry including cellular respiration, in the form of both the energy-rich adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and the cofactors nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), and protein synthesis, as a chemical component of DNA and RNA. The shape of adenine is complementary to either thymine in DNA or uracil in RNA.
 
&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

'''cytosine (C)'''

Cytosine (C) is one of the four main bases found in DNA and RNA, along with adenine, guanine, and thymine (uracil in RNA). It is a pyrimidine derivative, with a heterocyclic aromatic ring and two substituents attached (an amine group at position 4 and a keto group at position 2). The nucleoside of cytosine is cytidine.

&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;


'''guanine (G)''' 

Guanine (G) is one of the four main nucleobases found in the nucleic acids DNA and RNA, the others being adenine, cytosine, and thymine (uracil in RNA). In DNA, guanine is paired with cytosine. With the formula C5H5N5O, guanine is a derivative of purine, consisting of a fused pyrimidine-imidazole ring system with conjugated double bonds.

Found in [[RNA]], it [[base pair|base-pairs]] with [[adenine]] and replaces [[thymine]] during [[DNA]] transcription. [[Methylation]] of uracil produces [[thymine]].It turns into thymine to protect the DNA and to improve the efficiency of [[DNA replication]]. Uracil can base-pair with any of the bases, depending on how the molecule arranges itself on the [[helix]], but readily pairs with [[adenine]] because the methyl group is repelled into a fixed position.&lt;ref name=&quot;madsci1&quot;&gt;www.madsci.org&lt;/ref&gt; Uracil pairs with adenine through [[hydrogen bonding]].  Uracil is the [[hydrogen bond acceptor]] and can form two hydrogen bonds. Uracil can also bind with a [[ribose]] sugar to form the [[ribonucleoside]] [[uridine]].  When a [[phosphate]] attaches to uridine, uridine 5'-monophosphate is produced.&lt;ref name=&quot;Horton1&quot;&gt;Horton, Robert H.; ''et al.''Principles of Biochemistry. 3rd ed. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Uracil undergoes amide-imidic acid tautomeric shifts because any nuclear instability the molecule may have from the lack of formal [[aromaticity]] is compensated by the cyclic-amidic stability. The amide [[tautomer]] is referred to as the [[lactam]] structure, while the imidic acid tautomer is referred to as the [[lactim]] structure. These tautomeric forms are predominant at [[pH]] 7. The lactam structure is the most common form of uracil.

Uracil also recycles itself to form nucleotides by undergoing a series of [[phosphoribosyltransferase reaction]]s. Degradation of uracil produces the substrates [[aspartate]], [[carbon dioxide]], and [[ammonia]].

:C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;NCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;COO&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; + NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Oxidative degradation of uracil produces urea and maleic acid in the presence of [[hydrogen peroxide|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[Fe]]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; or in the presence of diatomic [[oxygen]] and Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. 

Uracil is a [[weak acid]]; the first site of [[ionization]] of uracil is not known.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zorbach1&quot;&gt;Zorbach, W.W. Synthetic Procedures in Nucleic Acid Chemistry: Physical and Physicochemical Aids in Determination of Structure. Vol 2.

The basic pK&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; = -3.4, while the acidic pK&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; = 9.38&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;. In the gas phase, uracil has 4 sites that are more acidic than water.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lee1&quot;&gt;Lee, J.K.; Kurinovich, Ma. ''J Am Soc Mass Spectrom.'''''13'''(8), 2005, 985-95.&lt;/ref&gt;

Uracil is a common and naturally occurring pyrimidine derivative. Originally discovered in 1900, it was isolated by hydrolysis of yeast nuclein that was found in bovine thymus and spleen, herring sperm, and wheat germ. It is a planar, unsaturated compound that has the ability to absorb light.

==DNA vs RNA==
[[File:RNA-comparedto-DNA thymineAndUracilCorrected.png|thumb|500px|[[RNA]] with its [[nucleobase]]s to the left and [[DNA]] to the right.]]
RNA and DNA are both nucleic acids, but differ in three main ways. 

First, unlike DNA, which is, in general, double-stranded, RNA is a single-stranded molecule in many of its biological roles and has a much shorter chain of nucleotides. 

Second, while DNA contains deoxyribose, RNA contains ribose (in deoxyribose there is no hydroxyl group attached to the pentose ring in the 2' position). These hydroxyl groups make RNA less stable than DNA because it is more prone to hydrolysis. 

Third, the complementary base to adenine is not thymine, as it is in DNA, but rather uracil, which is an unmethylated form of thymine.

Fourth, DNA is generally stable in alkaline conditions while RNA is unstable during alkaline condition.


Like DNA, most biologically active RNAs, including mRNA, tRNA, rRNA, snRNAs, and other non-coding RNAs, contain self-complementary sequences that allow parts of the RNA to fold and pair with itself to form double helices. Structural analysis of these RNAs has revealed that they are highly structured. Unlike DNA, their structures do not consist of long double helices but rather collections of short helices packed together into structures akin to proteins. In this fashion, RNAs can achieve chemical catalysis, like enzymes. For instance, determination of the structure of the ribosome—an enzyme that catalyzes peptide bond formation—revealed that its active site is composed entirely of RNA.
==snRNA and snRNPs==

snRNPs (pronounced &quot;snurps&quot;), or small nuclear ribonucleoproteins, are RNA-protein complexes that combine with unmodified pre-mRNA and various other proteins to form a spliceosome, a large RNA-protein molecular complex upon which splicing of pre-mRNA occurs. The action of snRNPs is essential to the removal of introns from pre-mRNA, a critical aspect of post-transcriptional modification of RNA, occurring only in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells.
The two essential components of snRNPs are protein molecules and RNA. The RNA found within each snRNP particle is known as small nuclear RNA, or snRNA, and is usually about 150 nucleotides in length. The snRNA component of the snRNP gives specificity to individual introns by &quot;recognizing&quot; the sequences of critical splicing signals at the 5' and 3' ends and branch site of introns. The snRNA in snRNPs is similar to ribosomal RNA in that it directly incorporates both an enzymatic and a structural role.
SnRNPs were discovered by Michael R. Lerner and Joan A. Steitz. Thomas R. Cech and Sidney Altman also played a role in the discovery, winning the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1989 for their independent discoveries that RNA can act as a catalyst in cell development.

At least five different kinds of snRNPs join the spliceosome to participate in splicing. They can be visualized by gel electrophoresis and are known individually as: U1, U2, U4, U5, and U6. Their snRNA components are known, respectively, as: U1 snRNA, U2 snRNA, U4 snRNA, U5 snRNA, and U6 snRNA.
In the mid-1990s, it was discovered that a variant class of snRNPs exists to help in the splicing of a class of introns found only in metazoans, with highly-conserved 5' splice sites and branch sites. This variant class of snRNPs includes: U11 snRNA, U12 snRNA, U4atac snRNA, and U6atac snRNA. While different, they perform the same functions as do U1, U2, U4, and U6, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SnRNP SnRNP]&lt;/ref&gt;

The completed core snRNP-snurportin 1 complex is transported into the nucleus via the protein importin β. Inside the nucleus, the core snRNPs appear in the Cajal bodies, where final assembly of the snRNPs take place. This consists of additional proteins and other modifications specific to the particular snRNP (U1, U2, U4, U5). The biogenesis of the U6 snRNP occurs in the nucleus although large amounts of free U6 are found in the cytoplasm. The LSm ring may assemble first, and then associate with the U6 snRNA.

Small nuclear ribonucleic acid (snRNA) is a class of small RNA molecules that are found within the nucleus of eukaryotic cells. They are transcribed by RNA polymerase II or RNA polymerase III and are involved in a variety of important processes such as RNA splicing (removal of introns from hnRNA), regulation of transcription factors (7SK RNA) or RNA polymerase II (B2 RNA), and maintaining the telomeres. They are always associated with specific proteins, and the complexes are referred to as small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNP) or sometimes as snurps. These elements are rich in uridine content.
A large group of snRNAs are known as small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs). These are small RNA molecules that play an essential role in RNA biogenesis and guide chemical modifications of ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) and other RNA genes (tRNA and snRNAs). They are located in the nucleolus and the Cajal bodies of eukaryotic cells (the major sites of RNA synthesis).

==RNA as an enzyme==
[[File:Ribozyme.jpg|thumb|right|600px|Schematic showing ribozyme cleavage of RNA.]]
Before the discovery of ribozymes, [[enzyme]]s, which are defined as catalytic [[protein]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/enzyme Enzyme definition] Dictionary.com Accessed 6 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; were the only known biological [[catalysis|catalysts]]. In 1967, [[Carl Woese]], [[Francis Crick]], and [[Leslie Orgel]] were the first to suggest that RNA could act as a catalyst. This idea was based upon the discovery that RNA can form complex [[secondary structure]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Woese, The Genetic Code (New York: Harper and Row, 1967).&lt;/ref&gt; The first ribozymes were discovered in the 1980s by [[Thomas R. Cech]], who was studying RNA [[splicing (genetics)|splicing]] in the [[cilia]]ted [[protozoan]] ''[[Tetrahymena thermophila]]'' and [[Sidney Altman]], who was working on the bacterial [[RNase P]] complex. These ribozymes were found in the [[intron]] of an RNA transcript, which removed itself from the transcript, as well as in the RNA component of the RNase P complex, which is involved in the maturation of pre-[[tRNA]]s. In 1989, [[Thomas R. Cech]] and [[Sidney Altman]] won the [[Nobel Prize]] in [[chemistry]] for their &quot;discovery of catalytic properties of RNA.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://nobelprize.org/chemistry/laureates/1989/ The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1989] was awarded to [[Thomas R. Cech]] and [[Sidney Altman]] &quot;for their discovery of catalytic properties of RNA&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''ribozyme'' was first introduced by Kelly Kruger ''et al.'' in 1982 in a paper published in ''[[Cell (journal)|Cell]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid6297745&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kruger K, Grabowski PJ, Zaug AJ, Sands J, Gottschling DE, Cech TR | title = Self-splicing RNA: autoexcision and autocyclization of the ribosomal RNA intervening sequence of Tetrahymena | journal = Cell | volume = 31 | issue = 1 | pages = 147–57 | year = 1982 | month = November | pmid = 6297745 | doi = | url = | issn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

RNA enzymes, or ribozymes, are still found in today's DNA-based life and could be examples of [[living fossil]]s. Ribozymes play vital roles, such as those in the [[ribosome]], which is vital for protein synthesis. Many other ribozyme functions exist, for example: the [[Hammerhead ribozyme]] performs self-cleavage&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0092-8674(87)90562-9 |author=Forster AC, Symons RH |title=Self-cleavage of plus and minus RNAs of a virusoid and a structural model for the active sites |journal=Cell |volume=49 |issue=2 |pages=211–220 |year=1987 |pmid=2436805 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and an [[RNA polymerase]] ribozyme can [[autocatalysis|autocatalyse]] its own synthesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Johnston W, Unrau P, Lawrence M, Glasner M, Bartel D |title=RNA-catalyzed RNA polymerization: accurate and general RNA-templated primer extension |journal=Science |volume=292 |issue=5520 |pages=1319–25 |year=2001 |url=http://web.wi.mit.edu/bartel/pub/publication_reprints/Johnston_Science01.pdf |format=PDF|pmid=11358999 |doi=10.1126/science.1060786}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the enzymatic properties important for the beginning of life are:
*The ability to self-duplicate, or duplicate other RNA molecules. Relatively short RNA molecules that can duplicate others have been artificially produced in the lab. The shortest was 165-base long, though it has been estimated that only part of the bases were crucial for this function. One version, 189-base long, had fidelity of 98.9%,&lt;ref&gt;W. K.

Although most ribozymes are quite rare in the cell, their roles are sometimes essential to life. For example, the functional part of the ribosome, the molecular machine that translates RNA into proteins, is fundamentally a ribozyme, composed of RNA tertiary structural motifs that are often coordinated to metal ions such as Mg2+ as cofactors. There is no requirement for divalent cations in a five-nucleotide RNA that can catalyze trans-phenylalanation of a four-nucleotide substrate which has three base complementary sequence with the catalyst. The catalyst and substrate were devised by truncation of the C3 ribozyme.

[[Image:RNase H fix.png|thumb|right|400px|Structure the ''E.coli'' RNAse H]]

Ribonuclease (commonly abbreviated RNase) is a type of nuclease that catalyzes the degradation of RNA into smaller components. Ribonucleases can be divided into endoribonucleases and exoribonucleases, and comprise several sub-classes within the EC 2.7 (for the phosphorolytic enzymes) and 3.1 (for the hydrolytic enzymes) classes of enzymes.

''Endoribonuclease''  A Endoribonuclease is a ribonuclease endonuclease. It cleaves either single or double stranded RNA depending on the enzyme. Example includes both single proteins like RNase III, RNase A, RNase T1 and RNase H but also, complexes of proteins like RNase P and the RNA-induced silencing complex.

''Exoribonuclease'' An exoribonuclease is an exonuclease ribonuclease, which are enzymes that degrade RNA by removing terminal nucleotides from either the 5' end or 3' end of the RNA molecule. Enzymes that remove nucleotides from the 5' end are called 5'-3' exoribonucleases and enzymes that remove nucleotides from the 3' end are called 3'-5' exoribonucleases.

Exoribonucleases can use either water to cleave the nucleotide-nucleotide bond (which is called hydrolytic activity) or inorganic phosphate (which is called phosphorolytic activity). Hydrolytic exoribonucleases are classified under EC number 3.1 and phosphorolytic exoribonucleases under EC number 2.7.7. As the phosphorolytic enzymes use inorganic phosphate to cleave bonds they release nucleotide disphosphates), whereas the hydrolytic enzymes (which use water) release nucleotide monosphosphates).
Exoribonucleases exist in all kingdoms of life, the bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. Exoribonucleases are involved in the degradation of many different RNA species, including messenger RNA, transfer RNA, ribosomal RNA and miRNA. Exoribonucleases can be single proteins (like RNase D or RNase PH) but also can be complexes of multiple proteins, like the exosome complex (in which four of the major exoribonuclease families are represented)&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribonuclease Ribonuclease]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''RNase A''' 
RNase A is a relatively small protein (124 residues, ~13.7 kDa). It can be characterized as a two-layer α + β protein that is folded in half to resemble a taco, with a deep cleft for binding the RNA substrate. The first layer is composed of three alpha helices (residues 3-13, 24-34 and 50-60) from the N-terminal half of the protein. The second layer consist of three β-hairpins (residues 61-74, 79-104 and 105-124 from the C-terminal half) arranged in two β-sheets. The hairpins 61-74 and 105-124 form a four-stranded, antiparallel β-sheet that lies on helix 3 (residues 50-60). The longest β-hairpin 79-104 mates with a short β-strand (residues 42-45) to form a three-stranded, antiparallel β-sheet that lies on helix 2 (residues 24-34).
RNase A has four disulfide bonds in its native state: Cys26-Cys84, Cys58-110, Cys40-95 and Cys65-72. The first two (26-84 and 58-110) are essential for conformational folding; each joins an alpha helix of the first layer to a beta sheet of the second layer, forming a small hydrophobic core in its vicinity. The latter two disulfide bonds (40-95 and 65-72) are less essential for folding; either one can be reduced (but not both) without affecting the native structure under physiological conditions. These disulfide bonds connect loop segments and are relatively exposed to solvent. Interestingly, the 65-72 disulfide bond has an extraordinarily high propensity to form, significantly more than would be expected from its loop entropy, both as a peptide and in the full-length protein. This suggests that the 61-74 β-hairpin has a high propensity to fold conformationally.
RNase A is a basic protein (pI =8.63); its many positive charges are consistent with its binding to RNA (a poly-anion). More generally, RNase A is unusually polar or, rather, unusually lacking in hydrophobic groups, especially aliphatic ones. This may account for its need of four disulfide bonds to stabilize its structure. The low hydrophobic content may also serve to reduce the physical repulsion between highly charged groups (its own and those of its substrate RNA) and regions of low dielectric constant (the nonpolar residues).
The N-terminal α-helix of RNase A (residues 3-13) is connected to the rest of RNase A by a flexible linker (residues 16-23). As shown by F. M. Richards, this linker may be cleaved by subtilisin between residues 20 and 21 without causing the N-terminal helix to dissociate from the rest of RNase A. The peptide-protein complex is called RNase S, the peptide (residues 1-20) is called the S-peptide and the remainder (residues 21-124) is called the S-protein. The dissociation constant of the S-peptide for the S-protein is roughly 30 pM; this tight binding can be exploited for protein purification by attaching the S-peptide to the protein of interest and passing a mixture over an affinity column with bound S-protein. [A smaller C-peptide (residues 1-13) also works.] The RNase S model system has also been used for studying protein folding by coupling folding and association. The S-peptide was the first peptide from a native protein shown to have (flickering) secondary structure in isolation (by Klee and Brown in 1967)&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ribonuclease_A&amp;oldid=417169401&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''RNase H'''
In a molecular biology laboratory, as RNase H specifically degrades the RNA in RNA:DNA hybrids and will not degrade DNA or unhybridized RNA, it is commonly used to destroy the RNA template after first-strand complementary DNA (cDNA) synthesis by reverse transcription, as well as procedures such as nuclease protection assays. RNase H can also be used to degrade specific RNA strands when the cDNA oligo is hybridized, such as the removal of the poly(A) tail from mRNA hybridized to oligo(dT), or the destruction of a chosen non-coding RNA inside or outside the living cell. To terminate the reaction, a chelator, such as EDTA, is often added to sequester the required metal ions in the reaction mixture.The enzyme RNase H is a non-specific endonuclease and catalyzes the cleavage of RNA via a hydrolytic mechanism. Members of the RNase H family can be found in nearly all organisms, from archaea and prokaryota and eukaryota.

The 3-D structure of RNase H commonly consists of a 5-stranded β-sheet surrounded by a distribution of α-helices. In some RNase H, such as the one found in HIV-1, the enzyme is missing one of the helices known as the C-helix, a positively charged α-helix whose protrusive shape increases substrate binding capacity. The active site of the enzyme is centered around a conserved DEDD motif (composed of residues: D443, E478, D498, and D549) which performs the hydrolysis of the RNA substrate. A magnesium ion is commonly used as a cofactor during the hydrolysis step. It is also a potential but unconfirmed mechanism in which multiple ions are necessary for to perform the hydrolysis. The enzyme also contains a nucleic acid binding cleft about 60 Å in length that can encompass a region of 18 bound RNA/DNA base pairs.
RNase H’s ribonuclease activity cleaves the 3’-O-P bond of RNA in a DNA/RNA duplex to produce 3’-hydroxyl and 5‘-phosphate terminated products. In DNA replication, RNase H is responsible for removing the RNA primer, allowing completion of the newly synthesized DNA&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=RNase_H&amp;oldid=422163070&lt;/ref&gt;.

Not long after, plant [[virologist]]s working on improving plant resistance to viral diseases observed a similar unexpected phenomenon. While it was known that plants expressing virus-specific proteins showed enhanced tolerance or resistance to viral infection, it was not expected that plants carrying only short, non-coding regions of viral RNA sequences would show similar levels of protection. Researchers believed that viral RNA produced by transgenes could also inhibit viral replication.&lt;ref name=Covey_1997&gt;{{cite journal | author = Covey S, Al-Kaff N, Lángara A, Turner D | title = Plants combat infection by gene silencing | journal = Nature | year = 1997 | volume = 385 | pages = 781&amp;ndash;2 | doi= 10.1038/385781a0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reverse experiment, in which short sequences of plant genes were introduced into viruses, showed that the targeted gene was suppressed in an infected plant.

After these initial observations in plants, many laboratories around the world searched for the occurrence of this phenomenon in other organisms.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guo&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Guo S, Kemphues K |title=par-1, a gene required for establishing polarity in C. elegans embryos, encodes a putative Ser/Thr kinase that is asymmetrically distributed |journal=Cell |volume=81 |issue=4 |pages=611–20 |year=1995 |pmid=7758115 |doi=10.1016/0092-8674(95)90082-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pal-Bhadra&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pal-Bhadra M, Bhadra U, Birchler J |title=Cosuppression in Drosophila: gene silencing of Alcohol dehydrogenase by white-Adh transgenes is Polycomb dependent |journal=Cell |volume=90 |issue=3 |pages=479–90 |year=1997 |pmid=9267028 |doi=10.1016/S0092-8674(00)80508-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Craig C. Mello]] and [[Andrew Fire]]'s 1998 ''Nature'' paper reported a potent gene silencing effect after injecting double stranded RNA into ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans|C. elegans]]''. In investigating the regulation of muscle protein production, they observed that neither mRNA nor [[antisense RNA]] injections had an effect on protein production, but double-stranded RNA successfully silenced the targeted gene. As a result of this work, they coined the term ''RNAi''.  Fire and Mello's discovery was particularly notable because it represented the first identification of the causative agent for the phenomenon. Fire and Mello were awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 2006 for their work.

RNAi is an RNA-dependent [[gene silencing]] process that is controlled by the [[RNA-induced silencing complex]] (RISC) and is initiated by short double-stranded RNA molecules in a cell's [[cytoplasm]], where they interact with the catalytic RISC component [[argonaute]]. When the dsRNA is exogenous (coming from infection by a [[virus]] with an RNA genome or laboratory manipulations), the RNA is imported directly into the cytoplasm and cleaved to short fragments by the enzyme [[Dicer]]. The initiating dsRNA can also be endogenous (originating in the cell), as in pre-[[microRNA]]s expressed from [[non-coding RNA|RNA-coding gene]]s in the genome. The primary transcripts from such genes are first processed to form the characteristic [[stem-loop]] structure of pre-miRNA in the [[cell nucleus|nucleus]], then exported to the cytoplasm to be cleaved by Dicer. Thus, the two dsRNA pathways, exogenous and endogenous, converge at the RISC complex.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15614608&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

'''dsRNA cleavage'''

Endogenous dsRNA initiates RNAi by activating the ribonuclease protein Dicer, which binds and cleaves double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) to produce double-stranded fragments of 20–25 base pairs with a 2 nucleotide overhang at 3' end. Bioinformatics studies on the genomes of multiple organisms suggest this length maximizes target-gene specificity and minimizes non-specific effects.[10] These short double-stranded fragments are called small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). These siRNAs are then separated into single strands and integrated into an active RISC complex. After integration into the RISC, siRNAs base-pair to their target mRNA and induce cleavage of the mRNA, thereby preventing it from being used as a translation template.

'''RISC'''

RNA-Induced Silencing Complex, or RISC, is a multiprotein complex that incorporates one strand of a small interfering RNA (siRNA) or micro RNA (miRNA). RISC uses the siRNA or miRNA as a template for recognizing complementary mRNA. When it finds a complementary strand, it activates RNase and cleaves the RNA. This process is important both in gene regulation by microRNAs and in defense against viral infections, which often use double-stranded RNA as an infectious vector.

The active components of an RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) are endonucleases called argonaute proteins, which cleave the target mRNA strand complementary to their bound siRNA. As the fragments produced by dicer are double-stranded, they could each in theory produce a functional siRNA. However, only one of the two strands, which is known as the guide strand, binds the argonaute protein and directs gene silencing. The other anti-guide strand or passenger strand is degraded during RISC activation.

'''Dicer''' 

Dicer is an [[endoribonuclease]] in the [[RNase III]] family that cleaves [[dsRNA|double-stranded RNA]] (dsRNA) and pre-[[microRNA]] (miRNA) into short double-stranded RNA fragments called [[small interfering RNA]] (siRNA) about 20-25 [[nucleotide]]s long, usually with a two-base overhang on the 3' end. Dicer contains two RNase III domains and one PAZ domain; the distance between these two regions of the molecule is determined by the length and angle of the connector helix and determines the length of the siRNAs it produces. Dicer catalyzes the first step in the [[RNA interference]] pathway and initiates formation of the [[RNA-induced silencing complex]] (RISC), whose catalytic component [[argonaute]] is an [[endonuclease]] capable of degrading [[messenger RNA]] (mRNA) whose sequence is complementary to that of the siRNA guide strand.&lt;ref name=Jaronczyk_2005&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jaronczyk K, Carmichael J, Hobman T |title=Exploring the functions of RNA interference pathway proteins: some functions are more RISCy than others? |journal=Biochem J |volume=387 |issue=Pt 3 |pages=561–71 |year=2005 | url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&amp;pubmedid=15845026 | pmid=15845026 |doi=10.1042/BJ20041822 |pmc=1134985}}&lt;/ref&gt; The human version of this gene is [[DICER1]].



===RNAi and Disease control===

It may be possible to exploit RNA interference in therapy. Although it is difficult to introduce long dsRNA strands into mammalian cells due to the interferon response, the use of short interfering RNA mimics has been more successful. Among the first applications to reach clinical trials were in the treatment of macular degeneration and respiratory syncytial virus, RNAi has also been shown to be effective in the reversal of induced liver failure in mouse models.

Other proposed clinical uses center on antiviral therapies, including topical microbicide treatments that use RNAi to treat infection (at Harvard University Medical School; in mice, so far) by herpes simplex virus type 2 and the inhibition of viral gene expression in cancerous cells, knockdown of host receptors and coreceptors for HIV, the silencing of hepatitis A and hepatitis B genes, silencing of influenza gene expression,and inhibition of measles viral replication. Potential treatments for neurodegenerative diseases have also been proposed, with particular attention being paid to the polyglutamine diseases such as Huntington's disease. RNA interference is also often seen as a promising way to treat cancer by silencing genes differentially upregulated in tumor cells or genes involved in cell division. A key area of research in the use of RNAi for clinical applications is the development of a safe delivery method, which to date has involved mainly viral vector systems similar to those suggested for gene therapy.

==MicroRNA (miRNA)==
MicroRNAs were discovered in 1993 by Victor Ambros, Rosalind Lee and Rhonda Feinbaum during a study of the gene lin-14 in C. elegans development.They found that LIN-14 protein abundance was regulated by a short RNA product encoded by the lin-4 gene. A 61 nucleotide precursor from lin-4 gene matured to a 22 nucleotide RNA containing sequences partially complementary to multiple sequences in the 3’ UTR of the lin-14 mRNA. This complementarity was sufficient and necessary to inhibit the translation of lin-14 mRNA into LIN-14 protein. Retrospectively, the lin-4 small RNA was the first microRNA to be identified, though at the time, it was thought to be a nematode idiosyncrasy. Only in 2000 was a second RNA characterized: let-7, which repressed lin-41, lin-14, lin-28, lin-42, and daf-12 expression during developmental stage transitions in C. elegans. let-7 was soon found to be conserved in many species, indicating the existence of a wider phenomenon.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short ribonucleic acid (RNA) molecules, on average only 22 nucleotides long and are found in all eukaryotic cells. miRNAs are post-transcriptional regulators that bind to complementary sequences on target messenger RNA transcripts (mRNAs), usually resulting in translational repression and gene silencing.

The function of miRNAs appears to be in gene regulation. For that purpose, a miRNA is complementary to a part of one or more messenger RNAs (mRNAs). Animal miRNAs are usually complementary to a site in the 3' UTR whereas plant miRNAs are usually complementary to coding regions of mRNAs. Perfect or near perfect base pairing with the target RNA promotes cleavage of the RNA. This is the primary mode of plant microRNAs.In animals, microRNAs more often only partially base pair and inhibit protein translation of the target mRNA (this exists in plants as well but is less common).MicroRNAs that are partially complementary to a target can also speed up deadenylation, causing mRNAs to be degraded sooner. For partially complementary microRNAs to recognise their targets, nucleotides 2–7 of the miRNA (its 'seed region') still have to be perfectly complementary.[68] miRNAs occasionally also cause histone modification and DNA methylation of promoter sites, which affects the expression of target genes.
Animal microRNAs target in particular developmental genes. In contrast, genes involved in functions common to all cells, such as gene expression, have very few microRNA target sites and seem to be under selection to avoid targeting by microRNAs.
dsRNA can also activate gene expression, a mechanism that has been termed &quot;small RNA-induced gene activation&quot; or RNAa. dsRNAs targeting gene promoters can induce potent transcriptional activation of associated genes. This was demonstrated in human cells using synthetic dsRNAs termed small activating RNAs (saRNAs), but has also been demonstrated for endogenous microRNA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroRNA MicroRNA]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''miRNA and disease'''

Just as miRNA is involved in the normal functioning of eukaryotic cells, so has dysregulation of miRNA been associated with disease. A manually curated, publicly available database miR2Disease documents known relationships between miRNA dysregulation and human disease.

'''miRNA and cancer'''
Several miRNAs have been found to have links with some types of cancer.
A study of mice altered to produce excess c-Myc — a protein with mutated forms implicated in several cancers — shows that miRNA has an effect on the development of cancer. Mice that were engineered to produce a surplus of types of miRNA found in lymphoma cells developed the disease within 50 days and died two weeks later. In contrast, mice without the surplus miRNA lived over 100 days. Leukemia can be caused by the insertion of a viral genome next to the 17-92 array of microRNAs leading to increased expression of this microRNA.
Another study found that two types of miRNA inhibit the E2F1 protein, which regulates cell proliferation. miRNA appears to bind to messenger RNA before it can be translated to proteins that switch genes on and off.
By measuring activity among 217 genes encoding miRNA, patterns of gene activity that can distinguish types of cancers can be discerned. miRNA signatures may enable classification of cancer. This will allow doctors to determine the original tissue type which spawned a cancer and to be able to target a treatment course based on the original tissue type. miRNA profiling has already been able to determine whether patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia had slow growing or aggressive forms of the cancer.
Transgenic mice that over-express or lack specific miRNAs have provided insight into the role of small RNAs in various malignancies.
A novel miRNA-profiling based screening assay for the detection of early-stage colorectal cancer has been developed and is currently in clinical trials. Early results showed that blood plasma samples collected from patients with early, resectable (Stage II) colorectal cancer could be distinguished from those of sex-and age-matched healthy volunteers. Sufficient selectivity and specificity could be achieved using small (less than 1 mL) samples of blood. The test has potential to be a cost-effective, non-invasive way to identify at-risk patients who should undergo colonoscopy.

'''miRNA and heart disease'''
The global role of miRNA function in the heart has been addressed by conditionally inhibiting miRNA maturation in the murine heart, and has revealed that miRNAs play an essential role during its development. miRNA expression profiling studies demonstrate that expression levels of specific miRNAs change in diseased human hearts, pointing to their involvement in cardiomyopathies. Furthermore, studies on specific miRNAs in animal models have identified distinct roles for miRNAs both during heart development and under pathological conditions, including the regulation of key factors important for cardiogenesis, the hypertrophic growth response, and cardiac conductance.

'''miRNA and the nervous system'''
miRNAs appear to regulate the nervous system. Neural miRNAs are involved at various stages of synaptic development, including dendritogenesis (involving miR-132, miR-134 and miR-124), synapse formation and synapse maturation (where miR-134 and miR-138 are thought to be involved). Some studies find altered miRNA expression in schizophrenia.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The templating system uses Python string formatting

Create a template called page.tmpl :

&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;title&gt;{title}&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
Hello {name}
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;&lt;/source&gt;

then edit index.py and add this function :

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;def bar(name):
    return Template('page.tmpl',title='template test',name=name)&lt;/source&gt;

Enter &lt;i&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://localhost/index.py/bar?name=Joe&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/i&gt; to see how the templating engine replaced the placeholders {title} and {name} by the values passed to the function Template

      <text xml:space="preserve">If you have a document (image, JavaScript, CSS stylesheet) and you want to load them in a page, you pass an argument &quot;src&quot; or &quot;href&quot; to the tags &amp;lt;IMG&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;SCRIPT&amp;gt; or &amp;lt;LINK rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot;&amp;gt;

If this argument is a &lt;em&gt;relative&lt;/em&gt; URL, remember that the script URL has the form &lt;i&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://host/myscript.py/func&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/i&gt;. So if the document to load is in the same folder as the script, the relative URL must begin with &lt;i&gt;../&lt;/i&gt; : the relative URL &lt;i&gt;../foo.js&lt;/i&gt; will be resolved as the absolute URL &lt;i&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://host/foo.js&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/i&gt;

If you forget the leading &lt;i&gt;../&lt;i&gt;, the relative URL &lt;i&gt;foo.js&lt;/i&gt; would have been resolved as the absolute URL &lt;i&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://host/myscript.py/foo.js&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, resulting in a &quot;File not found&quot; error

The same goes for images and stylesheets :

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;def index():
    style = LINK(rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot;,href=&quot;../default.css&quot;)
    body = IMG(src=&quot;../images/books.png&quot;)
    return HTML(HEAD(style)+BODY(body))&lt;/source&gt;

By default, protection lasts indefinitely. To specify an expiry, enter a length of time (e.g. &quot;31 hours&quot;, &quot;5 days&quot; or &quot;1 week&quot;) or an expiration date (e.g. &quot;1 {{#switch:{{CURRENTMONTH}}|1=February|2=March|3=April|4=May|5=June|6=July|7=August|8=September|9=October|10=November|11=December|12=January}}  {{#ifeq:{{CURRENTMONTH}}|12|{{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}+1}}|{{CURRENTYEAR}} }}&quot;) in [http://www.gnu.org/software/tar/manual/html_node/Date-input-formats.html GNU standard format]. Expiry times for move-protection and edit-protection can be set for different lengths of time. This allows pages to be protected from editing for a definite period of time while move-protection can remain indefinitely.

{{Editprotected|answered=yes}}

Some of the links given here are out of date.  Specifically:
* &lt;code &gt;&lt;nowiki &gt;[http://toolserver.org/%7Eluxo/contributions/contributions.php?user={{urlencode:{{{1|$1}}}}}&amp;blocks=true Global contributions]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; may be changed to just &lt;code &gt;&lt;nowiki &gt;[[luxo:{{{1|$1}}}|Global contributions]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; (as per [[Special:Interwiki]]);
* judging per [[w:Template:Sp-contributions-footer]], &lt;code &gt;&lt;nowiki &gt;https://tools.wmflabs.org/xtools/pcount/index.php?name={{urlencode:{{{1|$1}}}}}&amp;lang=en&amp;wiki=wikibooks&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; should be changed to &lt;code &gt;&lt;nowiki &gt;//tools.wmflabs.org/supercount/index.php?user={{urlencode:{{{1|Example}}}}}&amp;project=en.wikibooks&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;;
* &lt;code &gt;&lt;nowiki &gt;http://toolserver.org/~vvv/sulutil.php?user={{urlencode:{{{1|$1}}}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; may be changed &lt;code &gt;&lt;nowiki &gt;//tools.wmflabs.org/quentinv57-tools/tools/sulinfo.php?username={{urlencode:{{{1|Example}}}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; (which the former currently redirects to.)

(Generally, http://toolserver.org/ should be changed to //toolserver.org/ to allow for HTTPS access, but should the changes above be applied, there’d be no http://toolserver.org/ links anymore.)

TIA.

: Done.  I think. I hope.  Didn't work at first but then I realised that I was supposed to change all instances of &quot;example&quot; to $1.  Tested it from my own Contribs and it seems to be fine now.--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Estonia.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 20:44, 28 March 2014 (UTC)</text>

* In case of redaction of log entries, please also check if any report pages need to have some revisions redacted.
**In case of grossly offensive usernames please report the user to oversight who can reblock the user with 'hideuser' enabled, removing all logged occurrences of their name. Please also check the user's contributions and any edit summaries where they were reverted or reported.
**In case of a page move, check the history of the page, since the move leaves edit summaries in the history. If an offensive title was used also consider the log of the title it was moved to. Additionally, if the page has any protection, check the protection log, since moving a protected page creates move log entries for the target.

      <comment>moved [[Micronations/Micronatonal war/Molossian-East German War]] to [[Micronations/Micronational war/Molossian-East German War]]</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==History==
On 2 November 1983, at a time when when the current President of Molossia, then still Prime Minister of Vuldstein, was stationed with the United States Army in (West) Germany, he wrote a declaration of war against East Germany for reasons including &quot;the disruption of sleep.&quot;  The declaration of war was rediscovered in September 2008 during a cleanout of the closets in the house of Kevin Baugh, President of Molossia.  The war was never formally ended.

Although it would seem that the end of East Germany, which took place on 3 October 1990, would also mark the end of the Molossian war with that nation, Molossia has claimed that East Germany lives on in an unlikely place, and thus the war lives on as well. The last remaining remnant of East German sovereignty, according to Molossia, is tiny Ernst Thälmann Island (Cayo Ernesto Thaelmann), off the coast of Cuba. The island is 15 kilometers long, but only 500 meters wide and is uninhabited except for the iguanas and birds that are indigenous there, and the occasional tourists stopping by. During a state visit to East Germany in June 1972 Fidel Castro made the island, then called Cayo Blanco del Sur, a gift to East Germany. The island was renamed in honor of German Communist politician Ernst Thälmann, who was the leader of the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) during much of the Weimar Republic and was later imprisoned and murdered during the Nazi regime. In August 1972, the East German ambassador to Cuba erected a bust of Ernst Thälmann on communist Germany’s one and only foothold in the tropics. The island wasn’t mentioned in the treaty unifying both Germanys, which makes it arguably the last remaining piece of East German territory.

Thus, claims Molossia, East Germany lives on on Ernst Thälmann Island. As the island is uninhabited, there is no one with whom to negotiate a peace treaty. Molossia is thus still at war with East Germany, with no end in sight. In response to this, the government of Molossia re-opened the War Department, closed since the successful prosecution of their 2005 war with the Sultanate of Mustachistan.

==[[Micronations/List of wars between or involving micronations/Molossian-East German War/2009 Ernst Thälmann Island Expedition|2009 Ernst Thälmann Island Expedition]]==

On 11 February 2009, a covert team of operatives from the Principality of Vikesland, headed by Prince Christopher of that nation, landed on Ernst Thälmann Island to conduct reconnaissance operations there. The purpose, claimed the expedition, was to determine the extent of East German activities on the island. Among other evidence of East German activities, the expedition discovered a massive communications tower and a fine specimen of the East German flag.

May I ask why you moved a complete wikibook because of a question asked 3 years ago and to which no-one responded favourably?
Furthermore I removed the banner about &quot;the no longer featured&quot; because it isn't necessary to remind users of something from years ago.

:&lt;[[w:WP:TPS|Talk page stalking]]&gt; Swift is a respected member of the Wikibooks community. As no one has opposed the proposition that the book is related to Neo-Quenya, I would have moved the book too. However, as you are the creator of the book and are disputing the move, I shall move it back in a jiffy.
:You also mentioned the no longer featured banner. While it may not be significant to you that a book was demoted from featured status years ago, it may to some others and in any case I don't think it's common to remove the banner. I have undone your edit, but you may start a discussion concerning such banners in the [[WB:RR|reading rooms]] (or any other place) if you wish. [[::User:Kayau|Kayau]] {{toolbar|separator=dot

::The tag is merely informative and it's use is limited in time. I would substitute the tag by a post in the book's talk page, similar to what we do with surviving a RfD, in fact tagging the work with that tag without going deeply into why it was added in the talk page is not very useful, if we do indeed intent in keeping people working and improving the works...
::Also regarding the reversal of the move by Adrignola February 2011 executing Swift request from October 2008 my opinion is that it was wrong to undo the move without addressing Swift opinion (since the user is active and present) even if [[User:Dirk math]] is the creator, he failed to oppose the proposal in the proper way (talk page of the work or by talking to Swift directly) and time (2008 to 2011).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 09:56, 4 February 2011 (UTC)

:::I am not advocating Dirk math's opinions by reverting the move. Simply because another user disputes the move is reason enough to move it back because consensus is not reached, and if consensus is not reached the status quo should be maintained. [[::User:Kayau|Kayau]] {{toolbar|separator=dot

::::Take a look at Darklama's statements in the recent RFD on the book (which Dirk math, one edit in Dec 2009 and hiatus in Dec 2007, did not participate in) for the rationale as to why Neo-Quenya is the more accurate descriptor of the book's content.  It was my hope that under the new name we wouldn't see a ''third'' RFD, thus avoiding putting the content in jeopardy again.  If Dirk math was opposed to the move, a statement should have been made there (as noted above, present since 2008), rather than simply removing tags I applied without even so much as an edit summary to explain.  Statements noting opposition would have been taken seriously, but as it stands this appears to be a case of [[WB:OWN|ownership]]. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|discuss]]&lt;/small&gt; 13:56, 4 February 2011 (UTC)

:::::DL's statements make sense, but I would like to see Dirk math's. Since he's opposing it, surely he has a reason. If he doesn't soon, or he 'loses' to DL's or other's arguments, then I see no reason why the book cannot be moved to Neo-Quenya, but I'd prefer to give him the benefit of doubt right now.

::::::Some thoughts about these statements:
::::::* Why should I have to change something in a book that I'm satisfied with? I didn't see any reason to change anything after its completion in 2007. So it seems a strange kind of reproach to say that someone didn't edit a book, to my knowledge continuous reworking isn't a requirement.
::::::* Neo-Quenya is the name given to all versions of Quenya that date from after the death of Tolkien. So just like a book about Modern English wouldn't be called Modern English (as opposed to e.g. a book about Middle English), it is strange to use the title Neo-Quenya when there is no Quenya without the Neo prefix (maybe the difference would be relevant if Quenya was restricted to describe Tolkien's research and not the language as it nowadays used by its fans).
::::::* And I didn't know that you have to reply to a remark someone makes on a talk page or somehow after three years it gets promoted to general opinion....
::::::* The RFD, I thought, was based upon the principle that invented languages aren't suitable for wikibooks. I don't want to become part of that discussion, but the reason I wrote the book was that I get a lot of questions about Quenya and it would be good to have the present state of the language all in one place. If wikibooks isn't the right place for invented languages, so be it.

FYI. The edit notice code you removed from [[MediaWiki:Clearyourcache‎]] was being used in limited capacity for [[MediaWiki:Common.js]] and its subpages with [[MediaWiki:Editnotices/Common.js]]. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 18:54, 12 February 2011 (UTC)

== MerlLinkBot ==

Hi, why is my bot now unapproved again? [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=User%3AMerlLinkBot&amp;action=historysubmit&amp;diff=2051353&amp;oldid=1964593]. I think the bot was approved to run without flag. The bot flag discussion in 2009 was archived to [[Wikibooks:Requests for permissions/Archive 8#MerlLinkBot.C2.A0.28_talk.C2.A0.7C.C2.A0_email.C2.A0.7C.C2.A0_contribs.C2.A0.7C.C2.A0logs.29_.28Bot.29]] but this page was deleted, so i cannot give you a working link. But perhaps you can browse the archive. [[User:Merlissimo|Merlissimo]] ([[User talk:Merlissimo|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Merlissimo|contribs]]) 14:41, 22 February 2011 (UTC)

:The archive is at [[Wikibooks:Requests_for_permissions/MerlLinkBot]].  You misunderstand the parameter.  It indicates that the bot is ''unapproved'' for the bot flag itself.  That is not to say that it cannot actually operate.  It just hasn't been ''approved'' for the flag. If you read the wording on the template as it appears on the bot page you'll see that it simply states that same information.  I just revised the template to distinguish between bots without the flag and those with, as well as those that had been approved for the flag but had it removed due to inactivity. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|discuss]]&lt;/small&gt; 15:26, 22 February 2011 (UTC)

== Thoughts on the main page! ==

I love it.  Who was working on the new code behind it?  I wish there were a better cross-Project wikicode crew that could share some of these techniques more readily.  Here we really need some way to help people page through or visaulize books the way Wikisource does it, especially when one is converting a sourcebook to a wikibook for editing.  It could be 'faux' page thumbnails, simply guessed at by some script by rendering the wikitext in longer Chapter-length wikipages... or one thumbnail per top level section... or? [[User:Sj|Sj]] ([[User talk:Sj|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Sj|contribs]]) 08:24, 24 February 2011 (UTC)
:I give credit to [[User:Darklama|Darklama]] for the actual visual design.  Regarding code behind it, I used some templates imported from Wikipedia that were used to show random links over the recent changes there for wanted articles and modified their use to instead pull featured book templates.  While the code has some complexity to it, those wanting to feature new books don't have to know the details, as instructions are shown on [[Template:Goodbook]] and the other first-level templates shown in the wikicode for the Main Page.  This system is quite easier to get ahold of than the previous one where there were a bunch of parser functions right in the main page code, bewildering any admins trying to figure it out.  Now if we could only feature some more books... &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|discuss]]&lt;/small&gt; 01:05, 25 February 2011 (UTC)

== On CK12 ==

My friend Josh Gay was one of their techies and author-community organizers before leaving (he couldn't bear to stay after the license change) and he has some software that will complete the book conversions to mediawiki in a way that is compatible with wikibooks; you and he should perhaps work together on making the rest of the books better-formatted here.  

There's also a lot of work to be done to properly format the Light and Matter bokos and to keep them up to date; I Wuold like nothign better than to have some of thsoe atuhros use wikibooks (with suitable client software, perhaps) to update their works year over year.  When authors are able to actually use WB as their platform, the community will be able to grow more reasonably.

:I found his LinkedIn page but I don't know if he's got an account with Wikimedia.  If so, then we could get in touch.  There are several feature requests for Wikibooks/Wikisource in place at Bugzilla, but they have not gotten the attention they deserve.  This would be in line with MZMcBride's [http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/foundation-l/2011-February/064123.html comments] that the Wikimedia Foundation is stringing the other projects along, &quot;pretending as though one day they'll get the attention they desperately need to grow&quot;. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|discuss]]&lt;/small&gt; 01:11, 25 February 2011 (UTC)

== No Fiction at Wikibooks?! ==

No fiction or poetry on WikiBooks?

But, they're books....??!!!

A book is a book.

There are wikibooks covering many topics which could be categorized as fiction.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Religion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Political Science&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Economic Theory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Various Cooking Instructions  &lt;strong&gt;(YUCK!)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Why not something obviously listed as fiction?

Then we'd have a place to categorize all of those as well. Life would be less confusing for many, I'm sure.

Best Regards,

Pete

:I am a humble servant to policy.  [[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks?]] defines fiction as out of scope.  There were many in the past that liked strategy guides here as well, but they were deemed out of scope and removed.  Fiction can be especially poisonous to our reputation.  Having information that is not verifiable (based on facts) would lead readers to believe that nothing on Wikibooks can be taken seriously.  We are already quite lax in terms of not requiring references for information that appears to be reasonable on the surface.  But fiction would be over the line.  Books on religion can at least reference theological materials that represent the cornerstones of followers' beliefs, such as the Bible or Koran.  Political science books can reference real-life events and people and the campaigns and behaviors they have engaged in.  I'm not a fan of the Cookbook to be honest, but it's here to stay and is at least verifiable in that you can cook the recipe yourself and make corrections.  Fiction is not something you can verify, it is not textbook material, and it is something that would be deleted on sight.  I know the official slogan is &quot;open books for an open world&quot;, but as you'll read in our policy document linked above, we deal with textbooks in a much stricter definition of the word. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|discuss]]&lt;/small&gt; 22:52, 26 February 2011 (UTC)

Hello,

No sweat, I'll move it over to creative commons or something.

== Thank you for help with the Public Policy and Citizen Participation Book! ==

Wow. Import the history. I have no clue how that might work. 

I wonder how the copyright things works on print outs. Also, do User ID's have attribution rights, ''per se'', or is it just a courtesy?

I suppose it is covered by the link.

So if I edit over everything, I wonder if I still am required to cite? Probably no simple answer, 

but Wikibooks policies probably cover most issues.

Just a little food for thought.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Given any triangle ABC, let the altitudes through each vertex meet the opposite sides at G, H, K respectively.  As already noted, the altitudes intersect at the orthocentre O of the triangle.  The triangle GHK is the '''pedal triangle''' of ABC.  O is its incentre, and ABC is its excentral triangle.  If ABC is right-angled, the altitudes all pass through the right angle and the pedal triangle is a single point.

In the quadrilateral BKOG, the angles at K and G are by definition right angles, hence BKOG is cyclic; similarly, so are AHOK and CGOH.

If ABC is not an obtuse triangle and its sides are a, b and c, the angles of GHK are 180º-2A, 180º-2B and 180º-2C and its sides are a.cos(A), b.cos(B) and c.cos(C).  If the circumradius of ABC is R, we can write the sides as Rsin(2A), Rsin(2B) and Rsin(2A).  If ABC is an obtuse triangle, C being the obtuse angle, the angles of GHK are 2A, 2B and 2C-180º, and the third side is -c.cos(C).

== Properties of the pedal triangle ==
The area of GHK is {{frac|1|2}}(product of two sides)(sine of included angle) = {{frac|1|2}}Rsin(2B).Rsin(2C).Rsin(180-2A) = {{frac|1|2}}R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.sin(2A).sin(2B).sin(2C).

The circumradius of GHK is  &lt;math&gt;{HK \over {2\sin(HGK)}} = {{R\sin(2A)} \over {2\sin(180^0-2A)}} = {R \over 2}.&lt;/math&gt;

The circumcircle of GHK is the '''nine point circle''' of ABC.

The perimeter is 4Rsin(A)sin(B)sin(C).  The inradius is 2Rcos(A)cos(B)cos(C) and the three exradii are  2Rcos(A)sin(B)sin(C),  2Rsin(A)cos(B)sin(C) and 2Rsin(A)sin(B)cos(C).

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{OG}{AG} + \frac{OH}{BH} + \frac{OK}{CK} = 1&lt;/math&gt;.

If the sides are ''g'', ''h'' and ''j'', then

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{g}{a^2} + \frac{h}{b^2} + \frac{j}{c^2} = \frac{a^2+b^2+c^2}{2abc}&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A question for the editor,
 I am interested in learning the concepts on this page. However, I am unsure with which lesson I should start, 
because it would make learning calculus much more different if the lessons were not in an orderly fashion. 
Should I just take each lesson alphabetically? Or is there another recommended method for learning them? 
Thank you very much for your time spent answering.
   Sincerely,

      <text xml:space="preserve">The encoding of a page can be set by the built-in name &lt;code&gt;ENCODING&lt;/code&gt;. It will define the Content-type header sent by the server

It affects both the encoding used to encode the data submitted by a form, and the encoding used to transform the bytestring received on the network connection to a string printed in the browser

Here is an example :

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;ENCODING = &quot;utf-8&quot;

def index(**kw):
    form = FORM(action=&quot;show&quot;,method=&quot;POST&quot;)
    form &lt;= INPUT(name=&quot;src&quot;)
    form &lt;= INPUT(Type=&quot;submit&quot;,value=&quot;Ok&quot;)
    return HTML(BODY(form))

def show(src):
    return src&lt;/source&gt;

By default, &lt;code&gt;ENCODING&lt;/code&gt; is set to &lt;code&gt;sys.getdefaultencoding()&lt;/code&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Cookies are managed by two variables available in the scripts :
* &lt;code&gt;COOKIE&lt;/code&gt; is a dictionary-like object holding the cookies sent by the browser and received by the script
* &lt;code&gt;SET_COOKIE&lt;/code&gt; is a dictionary-like object used by the script to set cookies values, path, expiry date etc. and send them to the browser

Here is a simple script, cookies.py, that shows how to set, read and erase cookies :

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def index(**kw):
    body = 'Received cookies'
    for cookie in COOKIE:
        body += BR()+B(cookie)+'&amp;nbsp;'+COOKIE[cookie].value
        body += A('Erase',href=&quot;erase?name=%s&quot; %cookie)
    form = FORM(action =&quot;set_cookie&quot;,method=&quot;post&quot;)
    form &lt;= 'Name'+INPUT(name=&quot;name&quot;)+BR()
    form &lt;= 'Value' + INPUT(name=&quot;value&quot;)+BR()
    form &lt;= INPUT(Type=&quot;submit&quot;,value=&quot;Ok&quot;)
    return HTML(BODY(body+form))

def set_cookie(name,value):
    SET_COOKIE[name] = value
    SET_COOKIE[name]['path'] = '/'
    raise HTTP_REDIRECTION('index')

def cookie_expiry_date(numdays): 
    &quot;&quot;&quot; Returns a cookie expiry date in the required format.
    `expires` should be a string in the format &quot;Wdy, DD-Mon-YY HH:MM:SS GMT&quot;
    &quot;&quot;&quot; 
    from datetime import date, timedelta 
    new = date.today() + timedelta(days = numdays) 
    return new.strftime(&quot;%a, %d-%b-%Y 23:59:59 GMT&quot;) 
    
def erase(name):
    SET_COOKIE[name] = ''
    SET_COOKIE[name]['path'] = '/'
    SET_COOKIE[name]['expires'] = cookie_expiry_date(-10)
    SET_COOKIE[name]['max-age'] = 0
    raise HTTP_REDIRECTION('index')
&lt;/source&gt;

In &lt;code&gt;index()&lt;/code&gt;, the cookies sent by the browser are printed. Then a form allows the user to set another cookie, with a specified name and value

This form is submitted to the function &lt;code&gt;set_cookie(name,value)&lt;/code&gt;. In this function, a new entry is created in &lt;code&gt;SET_COOKIE&lt;/code&gt; with the submitted data. The key 'path' of this entry is set to the server root. Then a redirection is performed to the &lt;code&gt;index()&lt;/code&gt; function

When this redirection is done, the newly created cookie is sent to the browser. The browser stores the value and its attribute ; then it sends a request to the url &lt;i&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://host/cookies.py/index&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

When this request is sent, the request headers include this cookie, received by the script in the variable &lt;code&gt;COOKIE&lt;/code&gt; : so the cookie name and value are printed at the top of the page

To erase the cookie, a link is provided, leading to the function &lt;code&gt;erase(name)&lt;/code&gt; where &lt;em&gt;name&lt;/em&gt; is the cookie name. The function &lt;code&gt;erase()&lt;/code&gt; uses &lt;code&gt;SET_COOKIE&lt;/code&gt; to erase the value, and set the expiry date to the past (10 days before today), using the function &lt;code&gt;cookie_expiry_date()&lt;/code&gt; to transform a datetime object to the format supported by the cookie specifications

At last, when these values are set for the cookie, another redirection is performed to &lt;code&gt;index()&lt;/code&gt; : the browser receives the new information about the specified cookie. Since the expiry date is reached, it erases it. When it sends a request to &lt;i&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://host/cookies.py/index&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, it does not send a header for this cookie, which does not appear in the received cookies list

      <text xml:space="preserve">
== Algorithm package ==

The algorithm package is not available.
Perhaps one of these should be used?
algorithm2e: Floating algorithm environment with algorithmic keywords. 
algorithmicx: The algorithmic style you always wanted. 
algorithms: A suite of tools for typesetting algorithms in pseudo-code. 
context-algorithmic: Algorithm handling. 

I am not sure which one is referred to so i hope someone can shed some light on it.

This is not correct.  \usepackage{algorithm} works just find on my Ubuntu 11.04 system.  Perhaps it is simply not installed on your machine? [[User:Karategeek6|Karategeek6]] ([[User talk:Karategeek6|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Karategeek6|contribs]])

== The naming of bundles/packages/environments appears wrong ==

On my ageing Ubuntu 10.04 system, I have the following packages:

* algorithms
* algorithmics
* algorithm2e

The first (algorithms) offers the environments:

* algorithmic
* algorithm

This page, as it stands, is not sufficiently clear on the distinction between bundles, packages, and environments.
Indeed, it is probably outright wrong in many places.
I am afraid I haven't the time to sort this out, but the issue is worth flagging.

== Some guideline ==

There should be some guideline which of the packages should be used as default, which is the best.

I am getting lost while deciding which one to use.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==What does it look like?==

Predacious diving beetles belong to the Order Coleoptera and the Family Dytiscidae. Thermonectus is their species name. 

They are aquatic beetles having a streamlined convex body. They are smooth and shiny—usually 1/8 to 1 inch long. Most species are dark brown or black in color. Some have distinctive patterns of spots, lines or mottling on the elytra (wing covers). They have filiform (thin and hairlike) antennae. Their flat hind legs are fringed with hairs to help them swim in water. The tarsi (hind legs) have claws at the end. Larvae are long with well-developed legs and large curved mandibles (jaws).
  
Acilius semisulcatus is a medium-sized predacious diving beetle with a black-margined square on the yellow prothorax. There are curved bands crossing the back of the elytra.
Predacious diving beetle larvae are called “water tigers.” They are shaped like a rounded rod tapering toward each end. They have long curved mandibles. There are openings on the back end for getting air at the water surface. They can also breathe through their skin or long gills in the abdomen.

==Where does it live?==

There are about 3500 Predacious diving beetle species worldwide and about 500 in North America. Different species live in a variety of aquatic habitats. Shallow, weedy ponds are good places to find them. They are also found in streams, lakes, ponds, and puddles. Sometimes they are found in salt water ponds. They do not live in fast-moving water. 

Adults and larvae can be seen in spring, summer and fall. Adults of some species move to deeper lakes in the winter, where they remain active under the ice.

==What does it eat?==

Adults and larvae are predators of other insects. They eat frogs, toads, salamanders and small fish. The larvae, called “water tigers,” have fierce appetites. They use their large, needle-like mandibles to inject digestive enzymes into prey to dissolve body tissue. The liquid is then sucked up through channels in the larvae’s jaws. 

Giant Diving Beetles are members of the Predacious diving beetle family. They belong to the genus Dytiscus. They are voracious aquatic predators that often take prey as large as or larger than themselves.

==How does it defend itself?==

Predaceous diving beetles are prey to birds and mammals. They are slow moving when on land, but in water they are fast swimmers. They are able to move through the water and quickly dive to avoid predators.

Larvae are smaller and hard to catch because of their fast movement. In a small pond, they may be at the top of the food chain without predators.

==What stages of metamorphosis does it go through?==
Predaceous diving beetles undergo complete metamorphosis. They grow from an egg to a larva, then to a pupa, and finally to an adult. 

Females cut slits in water plants to lay their eggs inside stems. Development time for many species is unknown. Larvae pupate in cells dug into wet soil under logs or rocks near the water. The soft-bodied, pale (teneral) adults stay inside their pupal cells to harden before emerging after the final molt.

==What special behavior does it exhibit?==

To swim, predaceous diving beetles move their hind legs simultaneously (at the same time) rather than alternately (one at a time). They hold the tip of the abdomen up to the water surface to obtain air. When they are under water, they breathe using stored air under the elytra. 

Adults leave the water at night to fly around. They use the moon to navigate. In populated areas, they are attracted to porch lights, street lights and gas station lights.

==How does this bug affect people?==

Predaceous diving beetles are beneficial because they eat harmful insects. They are capable of biting, but are generally harmless to people. 

They become a nuisance when too many fly around bright lights where people live and work.

They are sometimes harmful in fish hatcheries because they eat young fry (newly hatched fish).

      <text xml:space="preserve">Plasmids are considered extrachromosomal DNA which are capable of self replication within a suitable host. Plasmids can be found in all three major organism, ''Archea, Bacteria and Eukaryote''. A plasmid is a DNA molecule that is separate from, and can replicate independently of, the chromosomal DNA. They are double stranded and, in many cases, circular. Plasmids usually occur naturally in bacteria, but are sometimes found in eukaryotic organisms (e.g., the 2-micrometre-ring in Saccharomyces cerevisiae).
Plasmid size varies from 1 to over 1,000 kilobase pairs (kbp). The number of identical plasmids within a single cell can range anywhere from one to even thousands under some circumstances. Plasmids can be considered to be part of the mobilome, since they are often associated with conjugation, a mechanism of horizontal gene transfer.
The term plasmid was first introduced by the American molecular biologist '''Joshua Lederberg''' in 1952.

Similar to viruses, plasmids are not considered a form of &quot;life&quot; as it is currently defined. Unlike viruses, plasmids are &quot;naked&quot; DNA and do not encode genes necessary to encase the genetic material for transfer to a new host, though some classes of plasmids encode the sex pilus necessary for their own transfer. Plasmid host-to-host transfer requires direct, mechanical transfer by conjugation or changes in host gene expression allowing the intentional uptake of the genetic element by transformation. Microbial transformation with plasmid DNA is neither parasitic nor symbiotic in nature, since each implies the presence of an independent species living in a commensal or detrimental state with the host organism. Rather, plasmids provide a mechanism for horizontal gene transfer within a population of microbes and typically provide a selective advantage under a given environmental state. Plasmids may carry genes that provide resistance to naturally occurring antibiotics in a competitive environmental niche, or alternatively the proteins produced may act as toxins under similar circumstances. Plasmids also can provide bacteria with an ability to fix elemental nitrogen or to degrade recalcitrant organic compounds which provide an advantage under conditions of nutrient deprivation.

      <text xml:space="preserve">If you want to load a module in the Python standard distribution, or in a third-party package installed in the distribution, just use the usual

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;import mymodule&lt;/source&gt;

You might also want to import a module specifically designed for your web application. In this case ''you can't use &lt;code&gt;import&lt;/code&gt;'', because of the algorithm used by the Python interpreter to find a module by its name : the interpreter searches for a module of the specified name in a list of folders, and you can't reliably modify this list to add your application folder, because in a multithreaded server you have no control on it

So for this kind of module, you should use a different syntax :

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;mymodule = Import('mymodule.py')&lt;/source&gt;

The argument of &lt;code&gt;Import()&lt;/code&gt; is the url for the module, it is resolved by the server as for all other urls

This module can use all the built-in names defined by Karrigell : this means that an imported module can itself import other user-defined modules by &lt;code&gt;Import()&lt;/code&gt;, use the names in HTMLTags, etc

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Growing Bacterial culture ==
Plasmids are almost always purified from liquid bacteria cultures, usually E. coli, which have been transformed and isolated. Virtually all plasmid vectors in common use encode one or more antibiotic resistance genes as a selectable marker (Ex :kanamycin, Ampicillin), which allows bacteria that have been successfully transformed to multiply uninhibited.

== Harvesting and lysis of the bacteria ==
When bacteria are lysed under alkaline conditions both DNA and proteins are precipitated. Some scientists reduce the concentration of NaOH used to 0.1M in order to reduce the occurrence of ssDNA. After the addition of acetate-containing neutralization buffer the large and less supercoiled chromosomal DNA and proteins precipitate, but the small bacterial DNA plasmids can renature and stay in solution.

== Preparations of plasmid DNA ==
Kits are available from varying manufacturers to purify plasmid DNA, which are named by size of bacterial culture and corresponding plasmid yield. In increasing order, these are the miniprep, midiprep, maxiprep, megaprep, and gigaprep. The plasmid DNA yield will vary depending on the plasmid copy number, type and size, the bacterial strain, the growth conditions, and the kit.

=== Minipreparation ===
Minipreparation of plasmid DNA is a rapid, small-scale isolation of plasmid DNA from bacteria. It is based on the alkaline lysis method invented by the researchers Birnboim and Doly in 1979. The extracted plasmid DNA resulting from performing a miniprep is itself often called a &quot;miniprep&quot;. Minipreps are used in the process of molecular cloning to analyze bacterial clones. A typical plasmid DNA yield of a miniprep is 20 to 30 µg depending on the cell strain.
==== Miniprep Protocols ====

The protocol is described below.

=== Midipreparation ===
The starting E. coli culture volume is 15-25 ml of LB broth and the expected DNA yield is 100-350&amp;nbsp;µg.

=== Maxipreparation ===
The starting E. coli culture volume is 100-200 ml of LB broth and the expected DNA yield is 500-850&amp;nbsp;µg.
==Small scale preparation of plasmid DNA or Miniprep ==

Inoculate single colony of E. coli DH5- bearing the plasmid in 5 ml of LB medium containing 100 µg/ml ampicillin and  incubate overnight at 37C with shaking at 200 rpm. was Resuspende the Bacterial pellet from 3 ml of the overnight culture in 100 µl of ice-cold solution I (50 mM glucose, 25 mM Tris.HCl pH 8.0, 10 mM EDTA pH 8.0) by vortexing. Add 200 µl of freshly prepared solution II (0.2 N NaOH, 1% SDS) and the mix the contents  by inverting the tube 4-6 times. Then 150 µl of ice-cold solution III (3 M potassium- 5 M acetate) was added and mixed by inverting the tube 4-6 times. Incubate the tube  on ice for 5 min and centrifuged at 12,000g for 10 min at room temperature. The clear supernatant containing the plasmid DNA was collected into a fresh 1.5 ml eppendorf tube leaving the cellular debris behind and precipitated with two volumes of 95% ethanol for 5 min on ice. The precipitated plasmid DNA was pelleted by centrifugation at 12,000g for 20 min at room temperature, washed with 70% ethanol, air-dried and dissolved in 20 µl of water or TE pH 8.0 containing 20 µg/ml of DNase-free pancreatic RNase A (prepared by boiling RNase A for 20 min). The plasmid DNA was then checked on a 0.8% agarose gel and stored at -20C. The typical yield for a high copy plasmid from 3 ml of culture was about 12-16 μg and the DNA was suitable for routine procedures such as restriction enzyme digestion and preparation of radiolabelled probe.

==Solution==
Solution I 

50 mM glucose,
 
25 mM Tris.HCl pH 8.0

10 mM EDTA pH 8.0

Solution II 

0.2 N NaOH

1% SDS or SLS

Solution III 

3 M potassium- 5 M acetate

RNase A


Ampicillin: A stock solution of 100 mg/ml ampicillin was made in sterile double-distilled water. Working concentration was 100 µg/ml. (concentration may vary lab to lab)

Kanamycin: A stock solution of 50 mg/ml ampicillin was made in sterile double-distilled water. Working concentration was 50 µg/ml.(concentration may vary lab to lab)

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Where to shift development of MINC=

This book/page is an attempt to record the history of the big MINC2.0
CVS change of 2011 with perhaps a well written rationale for the
choice that is to be made. For now it is nothing more than a bunch of
headings that need content added in them but I hope that others will
fill in more things so that we can all make a reasonably informed
choice.

Add your vote by adding your name and perhaps a reason why. If you have other choices, feel free to add them.

===Leave it at the BIC===

The BIC uses a CVS system that requires the user to have a BIC login (and be part of the coders group) in order to commit to CVS. This is done exclusively via SSH logins. There is no strictly used bug tracking system although mantis.bic.mni.mcgill.ca was proposed and used a little. Most of the tracking is still done via the minc-users and minc-development mailing lists.

Pros
* nothing changes
* CVS

Cons
* nothing changes
* CVS

===NITRC - http://www.nitrc.org/===

NITRC is a NIH funded initiative that was designed to host projects such as MINC, you can make a choice of CVS or SVN and nothing else that I can see. The bug tracking and others things are done via eForge.

Pros
* Made for the Neuroimaging community
* Uses eForge? for issue tracking/lists/etc
* GIT/SVN/CVS

Cons
* not as pretty of a code interface as github/others

Votes
* Andrew Janke

===Don't care as long as it's public and DVCS===

Options are:
* Github (Git), Sourceforge (Git), Launchpad (Bazaar), Google Code (Mercurial?), NITRC (Git)

Votes
* Jason Lerch

===NITRC + DVCS wherever===

NITRC : for users (mailing list, forum, MINC wiki books as a plugin ?)

Anything public and DVCS : for developpers (nice bug tracking &amp; project management a +, not too good on NITRC).

Votes 
* Pierre Bellec 

===GIThub===
Pros
* DVCS
* Awesome UI 
* Bug Tracking included
* Large Open Source community

Cons
*

*

===launchpad===
Pros
* DVCS (Bazaar)
* makes package building for Ubuntu easier.

Cons

I am aware that this book, and its module [[Relationships/Sex]] have survived [[Wikibooks:Requests_for_deletion/Relationships|1]], [[Wikibooks:Requests_for_deletion/Relationships/Sex|2]], [[Wikibooks:Requests for deletion/Relationships/Sex (2)|3]], requests for deletion in the past. This book does not satisfy [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|NPOV]] policy. One look at the [[:Category:NPOV disputes]] speaks volumes about the content of this book.

Everything from the basic structure of the book to the content breathes sexist, heterosexist, and pseudo-scientific opinions. Content is tangled with rude or misogynist anecdotes. It is offensive, and it is un-salvageable. I strongly believe it should be deleted. --[[User:Thereen|Thereen]] ([[User talk:Thereen|talk]]) 05:50, 10 January 2011 (UTC)

: All 3 past nominations were based on NPOV issues and failed. POV alone is usually not enough reason to delete because with heavy edited it can be improved. Do you have anything new to add which hasn't already been thoroughly discussed before? I propose speedy keeping this if not. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 16:28, 10 January 2011 (UTC)

:[[File:Symbol delete vote.svg|15px|alt=|link=]] '''Delete''' The theory behind not deleting a POV book is that just because it's POV now doesn't mean it has to stay that way.  That's a healthy attitude to take in most cases, but it breaks down when there's reason to think that the material cannot possibly ever be transformed into something NPOV.  I agree this is unsalvagable; and we ''do'' have objective evidence to support this that was not available to those who '''failed to reach consensus''' on the earlier book deletion nom: we have the lack of repair during the ensuing three plus years.  The problem is, as Thereen mentions, structural.  Symptomatically (as well as contributively), the [[Relationships/About This Book|About This Book]] section is focused on the author, is written in the first person, is signed, and promotes a view of the book as fixed except for formatting &amp;mdash; all violating the meta-principle of collaborativity.  It claims, note, that this was a published book that wasn't very successful and &quot;[m]any people were extremely offended by&quot;, whose author decided to make it available &quot;free as a Wikibook&quot;.  ''Hearts and Minds: How Our Brains Are Hardwired for Relationships''.  Speaking of which,
:[[File:Symbol question.svg|15px|alt=|link=]] '''Question''' I don't deal with copyright issues much, but is there confirmation that the registered user involved really is the author of the published book, so that the whole thing isn't one massive copyvio?  It seems pretty weird to make it a wikibook and then charge fifteen bucks to get it on Kindle (though that doesn't mean it wasn't done, of course).
:--[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 17:23, 10 January 2011 (UTC)
:: Copyright issues were discussed previously as well. Apparently the person that started the book here is also listed as the publisher at Amazon for the book. AFAIK the names being the same was the only confirmation that I know of that was done. I previously proposed moving this book to Wikisource as a solution upon that discovery. People believed Wikisource policy wouldn't allow its inclusion due to being self-published, though I wonder if that wasn't a stretch or misinterpretation of their policy. I would assume Wikisource policy was meant to exclude using Wikisource as a means to self publish rather than to exclude works that have already been published by a person. I do acknowledge this would likely mean any contributions to the book since being added to Wikibooks could not be kept. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 18:45, 10 January 2011 (UTC)
:: I've now edited the [[Relationships/About This Book|About This Book]] page to deal with the first-person perspective issue, the sense that the book is fixed, and the tone to be a bit more neutral. I think that should serve as a good example illustrating how the POV issues could be fixed by anyone at any time. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 19:15, 10 January 2011 (UTC)
::: The more I think about the copyright situation here, the worse it seems.  The sentiment in the previous discussion, I read as &quot;well, we can't prove it's a copyvio&quot; &amp;mdash; but the registered user who originally wrote it ''claimed'' that it's the same as the published book, and I think we should be taking xyr word as our default position on the sameness of the books.  And if the books are the same, our default position on copyright has to be that it's a copyvio unless we have better proof of permission than the contributor's choice of user name and unsubstantiated claim of identity.

::: I noticed a flub in your rewrite of the &quot;About&quot; section:  all four parts of the book are from the published version.  I'd had trouble being sure about that when I read the &quot;About&quot; myself, so I checked the Amazon page for the print book &amp;mdash; and there, in a customer review, is the complete list of parts and chapters of the book as it occurs on Wikibooks.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 20:13, 10 January 2011 (UTC)

:::: The attitude about copyright could possibility have to do with the fact that there is an wikimedia essay that advices to [[meta:avoid copyright paranoia|avoid copyright paranoia]]. Maybe you (or someone else) can find a way to get in contact with Thomas David Kehoe to get the concern addressed? --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 22:07, 10 January 2011 (UTC)

:{{comment}} - Under  '''[[Wikibooks:WIW]]''',  &quot;Wikibooks is not a mirror or a text repository&quot; seems to sum up another important point about this wikibook. The original author dumped this sexist work into Wikibooks because few people bought it, and most were offended by its content. This is the authors own statement. Does wikibooks need this work? Does wikibooks as a community want to accept work which is admittedly offensive? The standard counter to an NPOV-centred RfD is that it may be dealt with down the line, in some unforeseeable future. As a person who went through the [[Relationships]] book with the intention to deal with the POV issues, I can say that the book itself is an NPOV issue. Every page. The structure. The anecdotes. If I was to sort out the NPOV issues entirely, I would be starting from scratch. Deleting the book would make more sense than taking out 95% of the content, renaming most of the pages, and entirely refocusing the book. --[[User:Thereen|Thereen]] ([[User talk:Thereen|talk]]) 07:31, 11 January 2011 (UTC)

::Under certain circumstances Wikibooks can be a mirror and it is certainly a text repository (it all depends on the educational value of the text and the context). I really think that you are removing the WIW wording out of its intended context.  
::I think Darklama's views are to the point and that this RfD is without merit if it only centered on the NPOV rational and any of the already previously discussed issues. Nothing seems to have changed.
::I would on the other hand support a move to Wikisource, as proposed by Darklama, (that would result in losing any changes made to the original text so far) and would support anyone taking the context to create a better book, but that is not on the table and goes beyond simply deleting content. NPOV issues aren't resolved by deletions but by content that provides a balanced or neutral view point over the issues.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 12:51, 11 January 2011 (UTC)

:: Arguments that this book isn't NPOV, both now and in the past, seem to be based on personal beliefs rather than objectivity. I think it is important to remember that NPOV and verifiability are linked. Wikibookians should attempt to teach/explain facts objectively without including their own opinions or commentary, and should cite sources for any viewpoints expressed. This book cites sources, which means to begin with there are a few possible objective questions to answer:

::* '''Q''': Are the cited sources reliable?
::* '''Q''': Were the sources accurately cited?
::* '''Q''': Was the citations complete?
::* '''Q''': Are there any other major opinions in the field? (cite sources)

:: I suggest before continuing down the line that this book in its entirety isn't NPOV, people must verify the answers to the above questions, and cite sources for other major opinions in the field to prove lack of NPOV. Facts are not always politically correct, neutral, covenant, or non-controversial, nor are facts required to be so. If for example a fact is controversial in the field than a book should explain this and cite a reliable source that mentions that the fact is controversial. Removing reliable and verified citations can actually bias a book further. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 13:52, 11 January 2011 (UTC)

::: When a text is POV, the people most likely to ''notice'' that it's POV are those who disagree most strongly with that POV; likewise, the people most likely to ''object'' to its being POV.  If you only listen to objections of POV from people who ''agree'', you would conclude that FOX News is fair and balanced.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 14:34, 11 January 2011 (UTC)

:::: I don't expect people to agree, and I agree with you. My only hope, like you above, is to rely/expect objective reasoning and evidence to be used. We don't allow people to include their personal opinions in books just because they happen to disagree, we expect people to cite sources. We should also expect people to cite sources if they are going to use lack of NPOV as the main argument for deletion in order to keep discussion objective and productive. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 14:46, 11 January 2011 (UTC)

::::: I don't think that we should (on Wikibooks) rely heavily in sources (and that hasn't been done so far, but I have noted that you defended that they should have a greater importance also in previous discussion, hence this counterbalancing post).
::::: We, the community, have already established that this is necessarily a gray zone of the Wikibooks project in regards to original ideas, sources are important, but unlike Wikipedia, here they are not an end on themselves as to establish validity to the content. We do support &quot;personal&quot; interpretation (and some times projects focus exclusively on that), what we should focus is on permitting divergent opinions to be constructively expressed and enable, even promote, people to use critical thinking over the information presented and to express it freely, protecting works that have violations of the NPOV from deletion. This is a necessity due to the project relying on volunteer work. People will mostly only contribute content that they see as valid, even if others find it erroneous or skewed, this is why NPOV issues arise and a consideration that should be kept in mind when discussing the subject. Sources (among other factors, like even a prof of credentials) may be important to establish a valid common ground, but some leeway must be provided if we intend on keeping contributors, as every one has its own special view or opinion on a multitude of subjects. Minority opinions are extremely important and educative, we can even say that a NPOV violation issue in itself is educative as it demonstrate, even if sometimes in an uncomfortable way, that not everyone sees the issue in the same light and that may permit to have more valuable and abrangent content.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 16:37, 11 January 2011 (UTC)

::::::Though I resent the idea that keeping a 'minority opinion' that expounds sexist and and relies on stereotypes because it is educational (in fact, my feminist bias says it's counter-educational), I would definitely support a '''transwiki''' to Wikisource with it's original content intact. That does seem to be the most logical solution. Also, as a note to [[User:Panic2k4|Panic]], with the utmost respect, I do not believe I am using WIW out of its intended context, as it can be manipulated in what one would perceive as the educational value of the text. I would consider it to have none.--[[User:Thereen|Thereen]] ([[User talk:Thereen|talk]]) 17:50, 11 January 2011 (UTC)

::::::: I'm concerned removing content solely on the basis of the potential to offend would set a bad precedent that we shouldn't want. What researchers learn from doing research can sometimes be offensive, or sound sexist, racist, etc. What is learned from sampling of research subjects is often generalized and statistics used to explain what percentage of or group of people in a populations are likely to fit into a specific classification. People should be able to refer to and cite peer reviewed research where that is the case in books at Wikibooks regardless if it may offend some people or sounds sexist, racist, etc. as part of any objective coverage of a topic. If there are other peer reviewed studies that found different results I think those results should be included too. I'm aware of studies where I personally find the results offensive, but I still think people should be able to cite them because it is what is currently known. BTW I'm against deletion, if Wikisource won't accept it. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 18:42, 11 January 2011 (UTC)

:::::::Opinions or bias only have problems when used to oppose, suppress or disregard alternative views, I don't see any other way that acknowledging the existence of minority opinions, especially if they aren't conventional, as beneficial and educative, the only alternative would be dismissal and suppression, in Wikibooks that can only occur by exerting editorial control or by the deletion of content, and that will always, in general terms, be objected to. Even if most of us at one time or another recognized or even supported silently or by inaction those actions, as I said is in our nature to act mostly on self interest, hence the need for protecting works that are tagged as NPOV violations, of course within reason...
:::::::I recall editing some of the pages on that work and there is indeed a post of mine on the book's talk page. I remember preventing the exacerbation of some o the sexist views and contributing some small content to it. I'm also a feminist, but I'm also a realist. Feminism to the extreme erodes and challenges the structures of society, with hopefully short term negative impact, it even contradicts biological imperatives and the evolutionary specification of the sexes, and in that respect I also have to state that I view most societies as flawed, unsustainable artificial social structures, that have imperatively to continue evolving as to be beneficent. In any case I have no bias (that word can have a broad interpretation) on the subject and do recognize that other views exist, that the subject is not black and white. One shouldn't intentionally or with awareness skew information to promote a view point or go out exclusively to promote it as the absolute truth by suppressing different view points. Have you contributed to the work, engaged its contributors before promoting the deletion?
:::::::My opinion is that any view point can only be defended if contrasted with an alternative, that this contrast is what is intended by providing a NPOV. In fact in this subject I also defend that a specific point of view could be implemented, to the exclusion of others, if clearly stated as part of the subject of a work (as a way to inform readers and contributors), in some regards this is already done in several works as a way to define what and how a subject should be covered.
:::::::Taking for instance the most objected page Relationships/Sex I see some minor issues but I would define it as having intrinsic educational value.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 19:39, 11 January 2011 (UTC)

:::::: Your comments have nothing to do with what was actually written. I never suggested anything about a heavy reliance on sources. Interpretations are different from opinions. [[WB:NPOV]] mentions that NPOV is not necessary all encompassing, that non-mainstream views are almost always irrelevant, and there is a limit to what POVs are worth mentioning. I suggest the idea that minority opinions must be included/covered in our books might almost always go against NPOV. I think what is a minority opinion depends on the subject, scope, and audience. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 17:53, 11 January 2011 (UTC)

::::::: Your wording could be (and I have) interpreted that way, that is why I have seen the need to provide a counterbalance, since this was not the first time I've read your position as promoting a heavier reliance upon sources on the Wikibooks project, am sorry if I got your position wrong and glad you made it clearer.
::::::: I also am having difficulty in understanding the last section of the above post, because of the use of the word &quot;must&quot;, did you mean &quot;if&quot;? or are you supporting the need for an imperative inclusion. I agree they &lt;u&gt;may&lt;/u&gt; be included and should be welcomed, but not as an obligation and disagree that by doing so &quot;might almost always go against NPOV&quot;, except in controversial issues, especially in relation to contemporaneous subjects (we had several issue regarding politics and prominent figures), it also depends on the level of activity on the work, doing so doesn't directly signify increasing tensions and conflicts and are beneficial to permit complete coverage of the subjects. (See also the above post on defining a specific view point on a book's subject).   --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 19:39, 11 January 2011 (UTC)

:::::::: No I'm not suggesting a need for an imperative inclusion. I interpreted what you wrote as there being a need for an imperative inclusion of minority views. I consider an imperative to include minority views to almost always go against NPOV and to contradict NPOV. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 21:35, 11 January 2011 (UTC)

==Topics ==

===What is the goal of MINC? What is our goal?===

* MINC is a complex, powerful image file format that is self documenting, self describing, extensible, portable and specific for n-dimensional medical images.  MINC has a standard API to ensure that files are read/written always conform to the MINC definition.
* Our goal is to guarantee a future for MINC (and the MINC tools) in the face of competing file formats and software packages by simplifying the installation and use of the MINC libraries and tools.

=== From the users – the main request is simplicity: ===
*	Simple installation, single point of contact for progs/docs
*	Up-to-date documentation
*	Example software
*	Example analyses
*	A user interface 

===Software Distributions/ Computer systems supported===
*	Linux ( Debian, ubuntu, redhat, )
*	Mac
*	Windows	
:This could open up a large user-base
:but have issues with effort/resources.  related to GUI
*	One package vs many small packages
*	License issues – what can be bundled and what can’t (MINC vs GPL license)
*	Testing 
** Comprehensive testing is required for each release
** Dashboard-style testing/reporting?

===I/O===
* Bindings for 
**	R (Jason’s RMINC and Jim's newer and better mincIO)
**	Python (Jason’s https://launchpad.net/pyminc)
**	Octave, Matlab( Pierre’s NIAK)
**	C/C++ 
***	Vlad’s EZminc, 
***	David’s volumeIO
***	CImg supports minc (http://cimg.sourceforge.net/)
* MINC1 vs MINC2 API support and use
*	ITK &amp; VTK – currently with limited support.
*	NIFTI support? 
**	Lots of advantages from user’s perspective at first glance, but…
**	Disadvantages: 
***	Viewer-centric definition of data ordering (radiological vs neurological) without this information in the file header
***	lack of robust coordinate system information
***	lack of intensity mapping info
***	will the users rise up and bite us?

===What to link/association with===
*	Neurodebian (Michael Hanke's neuro.debian.net)

===Integration with other software tools===
*	Osirix, ITK-snap, Elastix, ANTs

===Software development tools===
*	Needs:
**	include/integrate external developers (who can submit/ who do we trust?)
**	proper bug tracking
::(Jim): real, live minc bugs can make sure that the bug has been noted by minc-dev and have some idea WRT fix status. Perhaps such a system could be integrated with a compensation model in which fixes or (approved) feature requests would be assigned a monetary value and then devs would be free to &quot;sign-up&quot; to work on a given request?
**	distributed version control systems yet? (git, hg, bzr, etc.)
**	Possibilities:
***	CVS repository @ MNI (or elsewhere)
***	NITRC (www.nitrc.org, they are keen to have us join + do they have git?).

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Extraction of Genomic DNA from Eukaryotic cells==

Large scale isolation of genomic DNA from cells grown as monolayers in tissue culture flasks or tissue samples (e.g. liver) from sacrificed animals. Briefly, to 10 ml of extraction buffer (10 mM Tris.Cl pH 8.0, 0.1M EDTA pH 8.0, 20 g/ml pancreatic RNase, 0.5% SDS) in a polypropylene tube 2.5 x 107 PCC4 cells (trypsinised and suspended in TE pH 8.0) or 100 mg tissue (frozen in liquid nitrogen and powdered by crushing) was added. The contents were mixed completely by inversion and incubated for 1 hr at 37C. To the lysed cells 1 mg of proteinase K was added at a final concentration of 100 g/ml (from a 20 mg/ml stock) mixed gently by inversion and incubated at 37C for 3-5 hr or overnight with frequent mixing during incubations. After proteinase K digestion, a viscous solution completely free of debris was observed. The solution was cooled, an equal volume of Tris-saturated phenol was added, mixed on a roto-torque to mix the two phases and then centrifuged at 10,000g for 5 min at room temperature. The upper clear aqueous viscous phase was transferred using a 5 ml pipette with a cut tip. The aqueous phase was further subjected to two rounds of phenol-chloroform and one round of chloroform extraction. The aqueous phase was then transferred to a clean polypropylene tube, 0.1 volume of 3 M sodium acetate (pH 4.2) and 2 volumes of absolute ethanol were added at room temperature and the contents mixed. The genomic DNA precipitate was spooled using a 1 ml pipette tip and transferred to 1.5 ml eppendorf tube containing 70% ethanol and centrifuged briefly. The resultant pellet was washed further with two more rounds of 70% ethanol, briefly air-dried, 1 ml of fresh autoclaved water was added and the samples were stored at 4C overnight for the genomic DNA to dissolve. DNA was checked on a 0.7% agarose gel and the total yield was determined to be 100 g each for both PCC4 cells and tissue.

Extraction buffer 

10 mM Tris.Cl pH 8.0, 

0.1M EDTA pH 8.0, 

20 g/ml pancreatic RNase,

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Initial List of action items to improve MINC=

==Make list of code/programs/packages available==

We need to generate a list of all software tools written with MINC that have been created (in the BIC or elsewhere).  For each item in the list, we need to know at least
* the name of the software
* a short description of what is does, list of functions, list of parameters
* who is the author of the software
* who maintains the software
* is the software publicly available? and if not, can if be made available?
* is documentation available? and if so, where is it
* is the software stable or still in development (if the former it could potentially be in a massive MINC bundle).
* what are the software's dependencies
* minc1/minc2 compatibility

* need makefile for all of minc tools (Vlad has a build all makefile)
* need makefile to build minc library only (subset of Vlad's makefile)

an initial [[/minctoollist/|list of minc tools]] is here

==Make a list of documentation available==

For each piece of documentation, 
* what software or process does it document
* who wrote the doc, who maintains the documentation
* user doc or tech doc
* rating for the documentation (quality control, reviewed by pro)

==Need plan for future documentation==

* wiki.bic.mni.mcgill - should be open to the outside (I think)
:: I am not adverse to using a BIC hosted site for documentation but would prefer a most &quot;neutral&quot; hosted site to encourage others to contribute. - AJ
:: If we are to use NITRC as the main host of MINC, why not use the NITRC wiki as a developer's wiki for technical stuff, early stubs of documentation and discussion pages like &quot;the future of MINC&quot;. I suggest that the MINC wiki book should be reserved to clean, stable and user-oriented documentation. BTW, it would be good to be able to produce a PDF as well. - PB
* need examples of good documentation to use as a guide
:: FSL has good docs
:: SPM on wikibooks - http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/SPM - AJ
:: Check out the NIAK pdf overview - http://www.nitrc.org/frs/downloadlink.php/2726 - PB 
:: any other examples?
* API docs vs USER guides
:: they serve very different purposes.  users could be engaged to write user manuals
* need to find out what documentation already exists
* Training / courseware
:: a first step would be a workshop for existing minc users &amp; developpers. I volunteer to help set that up in June soon after or before HBM (probably after). We would probably need better documentation and a clear idea of what softwares can be considered part of the MINC suite before organizing an actual minc course, but this clearly could happen in the near future. - PB
* need a good MINC preamble
:: why is MINC worth the trouble? what makes it so good?
:: there are two &quot;introduction&quot; and &quot;history&quot; section on the wiki book. It might be better to merge those. - PB

== Evaluate NITRC as a host of MINC tool development ==

We need to evaluate NITRC ( http://www.nitrc.org ) to host the MINC development project.  We need to know 

* does NITRC use a distributed version control system
:: Yes, GIT.  I have already done a little test project with mincmorph and it works well. GIT is not yet integrated into their source code viewer thing but it is planned. At least with GIT you can clone to multiple repositories.  (https://github.com/andrewjanke/mincmorph)
* does it allow a forum? a wiki?
:: Yes and Yes.  And the wiki on NITRC would be a very good place to host discussions like this -AJ Agreed - PB
* any licensing issues?
:: Not that I can see. In addition, there is no restriction on the license you use for your own package -AJ
* does it have a long future?
:: I have been recently involved in a conference call re the future of NITRC. They are definitely going to be around for the next couple of years. It seems that the NIH is not ready to support them fully in the long term, but they are actively working on an alternative economic model (maybe involving fees or ads) for the future. They are apparently very much commited to exist as a long-term resource. - PB
* any issues wrt NeuroDebian ( http://neuro.debian.net )
:: None, you will note a number of MINC packages in there already (N3, mni_autoreg, minc, classify?) I helped Michael with these many years ago and have always meant to get back to it in deference to my own packaging.  I see neurodebian as the way forward for minc packaging at least for debian/ubuntu. My plan was then to use alien to convert these to RPM's for the distro impaired. (CentOS, RedHat, Fedora) - AJ

== Basic strategy for MINC tools development ==

* development of code / potential need for coding guidelines
* documentation for code
* testing suite
* packaging
* MINC1 vs MINC2 support

== Multiplatform development ==

* Platforms to be supported
** Linux (ubuntu, debian, redhat?, what else?)
** MAC 
** Windows (see below, next item)
:: I dont think native windows packages are worth the pain they invoke. It's all fine to get the core packages working but we will suddenly find ourselves re-packing parts of CPAN for ActiveState Perl (Perl on windows) to make all the various perl scripts work. That and things like grid engine is just not possible. The only real alternative here is Cygwin, but the packaging system leaves things to be desired. For one there is no way to automate an install with a script, it HAS to be point and click in the first instance. You can then install apt-cyg manually and script the rest from there. The approach of other major packages has been to suggest that windows users use a virtual machine. Most CPU's are now plenty powerfull enough to do this and it will make things a LOT easier for us. We can also piggyback on the neurodebian efforts in this area. -AJ

* how to achieve multiplatform support
** CMAKE? Cpack?
:: MINC already supports CMAKE, I will admit its a bit of a pain to keep both CMakeLists.txt and Makefile.am/Configure.ac up to date in parallel but I have been doing it. -AJ
** what are the options?
:: None. automake/CMAKE is the choice.  I still prefer automake as it integrates with deb a whole lot better. -AJ
::: If you want to support Windows, to any extent, CMake is a much better choice, because you only need to maintain the one CMakeLists.txt file, and from that CMake can generate Visual Studio project files (and Xcode projects on Mac OS X). --anon

* resulting packages must be easy to install
* resulting packages must not conflict with existing software
:: On this note, there are other packages out there (I'm looking at you freesurfer) that install a whole minc &quot;distribution&quot; as part of their install and cause all sorts of grief for users as they often contain older versions of the MINC. We have no real way of controlling this. The only &quot;fix&quot; is to add /usr/local/bic/bin after freesurfers path.  Still perhaps if we make our own install a whole lot easier then freesurfer would just use our packages. -AJ

== Evaluate pertinence of a MINC Windows .dll ==

* basic MINC API should be supported on windows
* we probably don't have the resources to support windows
* Bert has already done this. See Makefile.msvc-win32 in MINC CVS. It still works with Visual Studio but with Bert now gone I dont see us having the local expertise. (Bert was an ex-windows programmer, we did what we could for him). Still I question the motive of getting the minc API working in Windows. The only use I can see is so that a windows viewer could load MINC files. -AJ
:: re use of minc in windows : if we want minc to be widely used as a file format, it should be easy to interact with on a variety of plateform. For Matlab, it's either I have access to mincheader, rawtominc and minctoraw, or I code something directly based on netcdf/hdf5, which raise some concerns about full compliance to the MINC API.

==Determine how CBRAIN fits in==
I can't speak for Alan, but I would rather say that MINC fits in Cbrain. Cbrain offers a distributed platform for neurimaging analysis. MINC-based pipelines should be available in there (CIVET already does, NIAK fmri pipelines soon will). But Cbrain is not limited to the MINC tools (SPM for example is already integrated to some extent, maybe PLS and NPAIRS too, I am not sure. There are some talks about FSL-based pipelines). I believe there may be ways in which the Cbrain infrastructure could contribute in the future to the development of MINC-related software. This will depend very much on the type of funding that will be found to continue supporting Cbrain, and this is not settled at this stage. - PB

==Evaluate level of NIFTI support within MINC API and MINC Tools==

We need to evaluate the pros and cons of supporting NIFTI files within the MINC environment

points:

* need to verify/test nii2mnc to make sure floats properly supported
* do we want to read NIFTI files with MINC{1,2} API
* conversion nii-&gt;mnc and mnc-&gt;nii is not a serious overhead; but still a pain for some click&amp;point users

pros:
* could give minc access to lots of users
* There is already a stub function in volume_io to do this.

cons:
* issues with file compatibility in intensity mapping
* issues with spatial coordinate mapping
* MAJOR issues with user understanding of how they can control L-R neuro/radio mapping in their files. I do not want MINC to enter or indeed even entertain the thought of entering this world of pain and gnashing of teeth. I already have users telling that they &quot;dont like MINC because the images display 'funny'&quot;. ie: in neuro orientation.. -AJ

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Closure vs. nested function definition ==

I thought a closure was a more specific term than a nested function, specifically meaning a nested function that inherits some lexical bindings from the enclosing scope. Is it accurate to say that they are one and the same thing? --[[User:Fishpi|Fishpi]] ([[User talk:Fishpi|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Fishpi|contribs]]) 21:53, 23 February 2011 (UTC)

:I thought a closure was an inner function that is defined and returned by the outer function, but I'm still new to Python, so I may be wrong. But the definition given would include functions that use Yield to return the next iteration. I'm not sure those are considered closures. The example given is much more specific than the definition. We either need to refine the definition or come up with a more general example. --[[User:MiguelMunoz|MiguelMunoz]] ([[User talk:MiguelMunoz|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/MiguelMunoz|contribs]]) 19:30, 27 November 2012 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The &quot;life cycle&quot; of an '''mRNA''' in a eukaryotic cell. RNA is transcribed in the nucleus; processed, it is transported to the cytoplasm and translated by the ribosome.  At the end of its life, the mRNA is degraded.

In transcription, the codons of a gene are copied into messenger RNA by RNA polymerase.In simple word or formation of RNA from DNA is known as transcription. This RNA copy is then decoded by a ribosome that reads the RNA sequence by base-pairing the messenger RNA to transfer RNA, which carries amino acids. Since there are 4 bases in 3-letter combinations, there are 64 possible codons (43 combinations). These encode the twenty standard amino acids, giving most amino acids more than one possible codon. There are also three 'stop' or 'nonsense' codons signifying the end of the coding region; these are the TAA, TGA and TAG codons.

==Transcription==

Transcription can be explained easily in 4 or 5 simple steps, each moving like a wave along the DNA.

Unwinding of DNA /&quot;unzips&quot; as the Hydrogen Bonds Break.

The free nucleotides of the RNA, pair with complementary DNA bases.

RNA sugar-phosphate backbone forms. (Aided by RNA Polymerase.)

Hydrogen bonds of the untwisted RNA+DNA &quot;ladder&quot; break, freeing the new RNA.

If the cell has a nucleus, the RNA is further processed and then moves through the small nuclear pores to the cytoplasm.
The major steps of transcription process are:

# Formation of Pre-initiation complex
# Initiation of transcription
# Promoter clearance
# Elongation of RNA
# Termination

==Formation of Pre-initiation complex==

In eukaryotes, [[w:RNA polymerase|RNA polymerase]], and therefore the initiation of transcription, requires the presence of a core '''promoter'''  sequence in the DNA. Promoters are regions of DNA that promote transcription and, in eukaryotes, are found at -30, -75, and -90 base pairs upstream from the start site of transcription. Core promoters are sequences within the promoter that are essential for transcription initiation. RNA polymerase is able to bind to core promoters in the presence of various specific [[w:transcription factor|transcription factors]].

The most common type of core promoter in eukaryotes is a short DNA sequence known as a [[w:TATA box|TATA box]], found 25-30 base pairs upstream from the start site of transcription. The TATA box, as a core promoter, is the binding site for a transcription factor known as [[w:TATA-binding protein|TATA-binding protein]] (TBP), which is itself a subunit of another transcription factor, called [[w:Transcription Factor II D|Transcription Factor II D]] (TFIID). After TFIID binds to the TATA box via the TBP, five more transcription factors and RNA polymerase combine around the TATA box in a series of stages to form a [[w:preinitiation complex|preinitiation complex]]. One transcription factor, DNA helicase, has [[w:helicase|helicase]] activity and so is involved in the separating of opposing strands of double-stranded DNA to provide access to a single-stranded DNA template. However, only a low, or basal, rate of transcription is driven by the preinitiation complex alone. Other proteins known as [[w:activator (genetics)|activators]] and [[w:repressor|repressors]], along with any associated [[w:coactivator|coactivators or corepressors]], are responsible for modulating transcription rate.

Thus, preinitiation complex contains:
*Core Promoter Sequence,
*Transcription Factors,
*DNA Helicase,
*RNA Polymerase,
*Activators and Repressors.

The transcription preinitiation in [[w:archaea|archaea]] is, in essence, homologous to that of eukaryotes, but is much less complex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Littlefield, O., Korkhin, Y., and Sigler, P.B. |year=1999 |title=The structural basis for the oriented assembly of a TBP/TFB/promoter complex |journal=PNAS |volume=96 |pages=13668–13673 |doi=10.1073/pnas.96.24.13668| pmid=10570130| issue=24| pmc=24122}}&lt;/ref&gt; The archaeal preinitiation complex assembles at a TATA-box binding site; however, in archaea, this complex is composed of only RNA polymerase II, TBP, and TFB (the archaeal homologue of eukaryotic [[w:transcription factor II B|transcription factor II B]] (TFIIB)).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Hausner, W., Michael Thomm, M. |year=2001 |title=Events during Initiation of Archaeal Transcription: Open Complex Formation and DNA-Protein Interactions |journal=Journal of Bacteriology |volume=183 |pages=3025–3031 |doi=10.1128/JB.183.10.3025-3031.2001| pmid=11325929| last1=Hausner| first1=W| last2=Thomm| first2=M| issue=10| pmc=95201}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Qureshi S.A., Bell S.D., Jackson S.P. |year=1997 |title=Factor requirements for transcription in the archaeon Sulfolobus shibatae |journal=EMBO Journal |volume=16 |pages=2927–2936 |doi=10.1093/emboj/16.10.2927| pmid=9184236| last1=Qureshi| first1=SA| last2=Bell| first2=SD| last3=Jackson| first3=SP| issue=10| pmc=1169900}}&lt;/ref&gt;Typically the PIC is made up of six general transcription factors: TFIIA (GTF2A1, GTF2A2), TFIIB (GTF2B), B-TFIID (BTAF1, TBP), TFIID (BTAF1, BTF3, BTF3L4, EDF1, TAF1-15, 16 total), TFIIE, TFIIF, and TFIIH. Also, at some point during its assembly it is joined with RNA polymerase II and the remaining components of the holoenzyme.

#The TATA binding protein (TBP, a subunit of TFIID), TBPL1, or TBPL2 can bind the promoter or TATA box. Most genes lack a TATA box and use an initiator element (INR) or downstream core promoter instead. Nevertheless, TBP is always involved and is forced to bind without sequence specificity. TAFs from TFIID can also be involved when the TATA box is absent. A TFIID TAF will bind sequence specifically, and force the TBP to bind non-sequence specifically, bringing the remaining portions of TFIID to the promoter.
#TFIIA interacts with the TBP subunit of TFIID and aids in the binding of TBP to TATA-box containing promoter DNA. Although TFIIA does not recognize DNA itself, its interactions with TBP allow it to stabilize and facilitate formation of the PIC.
#The N-terminal domain of TFIIB brings the DNA into proper position for entry into the active site of RNA polymerase II. TFIIB binds partially sequence specifically, with some preference for BRE. The TFIID-TFIIA-TFIIB (DAB)-promoter complex subsequently recruits RNA polymerase II and TFIIF.
#TFIIF (two subunits, RAP30 and RAP74, showing some similarity to bacterial sigma factors) and Pol II enter the complex together. TFIIF helps to speed up the polymerization process.
#TFIIE joins the growing complex and recruits TFIIH. TFIIE may be involved in DNA melting at the promoter: it contains a zinc ribbon motif that can bind single stranded DNA. TFIIE helps to open and close the Pol II’s ‘Jaw’ like structure, which enables movement down the DNA strand.
#DNA may be wrapped one complete turn around the preinitiation complex and it is TFIIF that helps keep this tight wrapping. In the process, the torsional strain on the DNA may aid in DNA melting at the promoter, forming the transcription bubble.
#TFIIH and TFIIJ enter the complex together. TFIIH is a large protein complex that contains among others the CDK7/cyclin H kinase complex and a DNA helicase. TFIIH has three functions: it binds specifically to the template strand to ensure that the correct strand of DNA is transcribed and melts or unwinds the DNA (ATP dependently) to separate the two strands using its helicase activity. It has a kinase activity that phosphorylates the C-terminal domain (CTD) of Pol II at the amino acid serine. This switches the RNA polymerase to start producing RNA. Finally it is essential for Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER) of damaged DNA. TFIIH and TFIIE strongly interact with one another. TFIIE affects TFIIH’s catalytic activity. Without TFIIE, TFIIH will not unwind the promoter.
#TFIIH helps create the transcription bubble and may be required for transcription if the DNA template is not already denatured or if it is supercoiled.
#Mediator then encases all the transcription factors and Pol II. It interacts with enhancers, areas very far away (upstream or downstream) that help regulate transcription.
The formation of the transcription preinitiation complex (PIC) is analogous to the mechanism seen in bacterial initiation. In bacteria, the sigma factor recognizes and binds to the promoter sequence. In eukaryotes, the transcription factors perform this role.
===TATA-binding protein and Transcription factor II D===


TBP is a subunit of the eukaryotic transcription factor '''TFIID'''. TFIID is the first protein to bind to DNA during the formation of the pre-initiation transcription complex of RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II). Binding of TFIID to the TATA box in the promoter region of the gene initiates the recruitment of other factors required for RNA Pol II to begin transcription. Some of the other recruited transcription factors include TFIIA, TFIIB, and TFIIF. Each of these transcription factors is formed from the interaction of many protein subunits, indicating that transcription is a heavily regulated process.TBP is also a necessary component of RNA polymerase I and RNA polymerase III, and is, it is thought, the only common subunit required by all three of the RNA polymerases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TATA-binding_protein TATA-binding protein]&lt;/ref&gt;

The TATA-binding protein (TBP) is a transcription factor that binds specifically to a DNA sequence called the TATA box. This DNA sequence is found about 35 base pairs upstream of the transcription start site in some eukaryotic gene promoters. TBP, along with a variety of TBP-associated factors, make up the TFIID, a general transcription factor that in turn makes up part of the RNA polymerase II preinitiation complex. As one of the few proteins in the preinitiation complex that binds DNA in a sequence-specific manner, it helps position RNA polymerase II over the transcription start site of the gene. However, it is estimated that only 10-20% of human promoters have TATA boxes. Therefore, TBP is probably not the only protein involved in positioning RNA polymerase II.

Transcription factor II D (TFIID) is one of several general transcription factors that make up the RNA polymerase II preinitiation complex. Before the start of transcription, the transcription Factor II D (TFIID) complex, consisting of TFIID, TBP, and at least nine other polypeptides, binds to the TATA box in the core promoter of the gene.
TFIID is itself composed of several subunits called TBP-associated factors (TAFs, of which there are 16) and the TATA Binding Protein (TBP). In a test tube, only TBP is necessary for transcription at promoters that contain a TATA box. TAFs, however, add promoter selectivity, especially if there is no TATA box sequence for TBP to bind to. TAFs are included in two distinct complexes, TFIID and B-TFIID. The TFIID complex is composed of TBP and more than eight TAFs. But, the majority of TBP is present in the B-TFIID complex, which is composed of TBP and TAFII170 (BTAF1) in a 1:1 ratio.

==RNA polymerase==
RNAP was discovered independently by Sam Weiss, Audrey Stevens, and Jerard Hurwitz in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Jerard Hurwitz|year=2005|month=December|title=The Discovery of RNA Polymerase|journal=Journal of Biological Chemistry |volume=280|issue=52|pages=42477–85|pmid=16230341|doi=10.1074/jbc.X500006200}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

RNA polymerase (RNAP)  is an enzyme that produces RNA. In cells, RNAP is needed for constructing RNA chains from DNA genes as templates, a process called transcription. RNA polymerase enzymes are essential to life and are found in all organisms and many viruses. In chemical terms, RNAP is a nucleotidyl transferase that polymerizes ribonucleotides at the 3' end of an RNA transcript.

==RNA polymerase in eukaryotes==
[[Image:Alpha-Amanitin–RNA polymerase II complex 1K83.png|thumb|Structure of eukaryotic RNA polymerase II (light blue) in complex with α-amanitin (red), a strong poison found in death cap mushrooms that targets this vital enzyme]]
Eukaryotes have several types of RNAP, characterized by the type of RNA they synthesize: The following RNA polymerases are very common in eukaryotic cells.

1 RNA polymerase I

2 RNA polymerase II

3 RNA polymerase III

4 RNA polymerase IV

5 RNA polymerase V

===RNA polymerase I===
[[RNA polymerase I]] synthesizes a pre-[[rRNA]] 45S, which matures into 28S, 18S and 5.8S rRNAs which will form the major RNA sections of the [[ribosome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Grummt I.|title=Regulation of mammalian ribosomal gene transcription by RNA polymerase I.|journal=Prog Nucleic Acid Res Mol Biol.|year=1999|volume=62|pages=109–54|pmid=9932453|doi=10.1016/S0079-6603(08)60506-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;Pol I consists of 8-14 protein subunits (polypeptides). All 12 subunits have identical or related counterparts in PolII and Pol III. rDNA transcription is confined to the nucleolus where several hundreds of copies of rRNA genes are present, arranged as tandem head-to-tail repeats. 

Pol I transcribes one large transcript, encoding an rDNA gene over and over again. This gene encodes the 18S, the 5.8S, and the 28S RNA molecules of the ribosome in eukaryotes. The transcripts are cleaved by snoRNA. The 5S ribosomal RNA is transcribed by Pol III. Because of the simplicity of Pol I transcription, it is the fastest-acting polymerase.
When rRNA synthesis is stimulated, SL1 (selectivity factor 1) will bind to the promoters of rDNA genes that were previously silent, and recruit a pre-initiation complex to which Pol I will bind and start transcription of rRNA.
Changes in rRNA transcription can also occur via changes in the rate of transcription. While the exact mechanism through which Pol I increases its rate of transcription is yet unknown, evidence has shown that rRNA synthesis can increase or decrease without changes in the number of actively transcribed rDNA.

RNAPII can exist in two forms: RNAPII0, with a highly phosphorylated CTD, and RNAPIIA, with a nonphosphorylated CTD.The carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II is that portion of the polymerase that is involved in the initiation of transcription, the [[5' cap|cap]]ping of the [[Messenger RNA|RNA transcript]], and attachment to the [[spliceosome]] for [[RNA splicing]].&lt;ref name=Brickley&gt;{{cite journal |author=Brickey WJ, Greenleaf AL |title=Functional studies of the carboxy-terminal repeat domain of Drosophila RNA polymerase II in vivo |journal=Genetics. |volume=140 |issue=2 |pages=599–613 |year=1995 |month=June |pmid=7498740 |pmc=1206638 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The CTD typically consists of up to 52 repeats of the sequence Tyr-Ser-Pro-Thr-Ser-Pro-Ser.&lt;ref name=Meinhart&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Nature. |issue=6996 |volume=430 |pages=223–6 |month=Jul |year=2004 |title=Recognition of RNA polymerase II carboxy-terminal domain by 3'-RNA-processing factors |pmid=15241417 |author=Meinhart A, Cramer P |format=abstract |doi=10.1038/nature02679

The CTD is an extension appended to the C terminus of RPB1, the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II. It serves as a flexible binding [[Scaffold protein|scaffold]] for numerous nuclear factors, determined by the [[phosphorylation]] patterns on the CTD repeats. Each repeat contains an evolutionary conserved and repeated heptapeptide, Tyr1-Ser2-Pro3-Thr4-Ser5-Pro6-Ser7, which is subjected to reversible phosphorylations during each transcription cycle.&lt;ref name=Phatnani&gt;{{ cite journal |author=Phatnani HP, Greenleaf AL |title=Phosphorylation and functions of the RNA polymerase II CTD |journal=Genes Dev. |month=Nov |year=2006 |volume=20 |issue=1 |pages=2922–36 |pmid= 17079683 |url=http://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/20/21/2922.long |doi=10.1101/gad.1477006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This domain is inherently unstructured yet evolutionarily conserved, and in [[eukaryote]]s it comprises from 25 to 52 tandem copies of the consensus repeat heptad.&lt;ref name=Corden&gt;{{ cite journal |author=Corden JL |title=Tails of RNA polymerase II |journal=Trends Biol Sci. |month= |year=1990 |volume=15 |issue= |pages=383–7 |url= |pmid= |doi=10.1016/0968-0004(90)90236-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As the CTD is frequently not required for [[general transcription factor]] (GTF)-mediated initiation and RNA synthesis, it does not form a part of the catalytic essence of RNAPII, but performs other functions.&lt;ref name=Phatnani/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_polymerase_II_holoenzyme&lt;/ref&gt;

Phosphorylation occurs principally on Ser2 and Ser5 of the repeats of CTD, although these positions are not equivalent. The phosphorylation state changes as RNAPII progresses through the transcription cycle: The initiating RNAPII is form IIA, and the elongating enzyme is form II0. While RNAPII0 does consist of RNAPs with hyperphosphorylated CTDs, the pattern of phosphorylation on individual CTDs can vary due to differential phosphorylation of Ser2 versus Ser5 residues and/or to differential phosphorylation of repeats along the length of the CTD. The PCTD (phosphoCTD of an RNAPII0) physically links pre-mRNA processing to transcription by tethering processing factors to elongating RNAPII, e.g., 5′-end capping, 3′-end cleavage, and polyadenylation.
Ser5 phosphorylation (Ser5PO4) near the 5′ ends of genes depends principally on the kinase activity of TFIIH (Kin28 in yeast; CDK7 in metazoans). The transcription factor TFIIH is a kinase and will hyperphosphorylate the CTD of RNAP, and in doing so, causes the RNAP complex to move away from the initiation site. Subsequent to the action of TFIIH kinase, Ser2 residues are phosphorylated by CTDK-I in yeast (CDK9 kinase in metazoans). Ctk1 (CDK9) acts in compliment to phosphorylation of serine 5 and is, thus, seen in middle to late elongation.
CDK8 and cyclin C (CCNC) are components of the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme that phosphorylate the carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD). CDK8 regulates transcription by targeting the CDK7/cyclin H subunits of the general transcription initiation factor IIH (TFIIH), thereby providing a link between the mediator and the basal transcription machinery.
The gene CTDP1 encodes a phosphatase that interacts with the carboxy-terminus of transcription initiation factor TFIIF, a transcription factor that regulates elongation as well as initiation by RNA polymerase II&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_polymerase_II_holoenzyme&lt;/ref&gt;.

===RNA polymerase III===
[[RNA polymerase III]] synthesizes tRNAs, rRNA 5S and other small RNAs found in the [[cell nucleus|nucleus]] and [[cytosol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite  journal |author=Willis IM.|title=RNA polymerase III. Genes, factors and transcriptional specificity|journal=Eur J Biochem.|year=1993|month=February|volume=212|issue=1|pages=1–11|pmid=8444147 | doi = 10.1111/j.1432-1033.1993.tb17626.x  }}&lt;/ref&gt;RNA polymerase III (also called Pol III) transcribes DNA to synthesize ribosomal 5S rRNA, tRNA and other small RNAs. The genes transcribed by RNA Pol III fall in the category of &quot;housekeeping&quot; genes whose expression is required in all cell types and most environmental conditions. Therefore the regulation of Pol III transcription is primarily tied to the regulation of cell growth and the cell cycle, thus requiring fewer regulatory proteins than RNA polymerase II.
In the process of transcription (by any polymerase) there are three main stages:Initiation; requiring construction of the RNA polymerase complex on the gene's promoter.
Elongation; the writing of the RNA transcript.Termination; the finishing of RNA writing and disassembly of the RNA polymerase complex.

RNA polymerase silences the transposons and repetitive DNA in the siRNA pathway. The siRNA plays a major role in defending the genome against the invading viruses and transposable elements by RNA directed DNA methylation. 
Polymerase IV and ROS1 demethylase unlocks and recondenses the 5S rDNA chromatin, which is present in seed and used for the development of adult features in plants.Polymerase IV is involved in setting the methylation patterns in the 5S genes during plant maturation.
In arabidopsis polymerase IV works with binding protein DCL3 and a RNA polymerase II RDR2 in a silencing pathway which Polymerase IV would produce RNA, which is changed to dsRNA by RDR2 then converted to siRNA by DCL3.

==Initiation of transcription==
[[File:simple transcription initiation1.svg|thumb|left|500px|Simple diagram of transcription initiation. RNA polymerase (RNAP)]]
  
Transcription initiation is more complex in eukaryotes.  Eukaryotic RNA polymerase does not directly recognize the core promoter sequences.  Instead, a collection of proteins called transcription factors mediate the binding of RNA polymerase and the initiation of transcription. Only after certain transcription factors are attached to the promoter does the RNA polymerase bind to it. The completed assembly of transcription factors and RNA polymerase bind to the promoter, forming a transcription initiation complex. Transcription in the archaea domain is similar to transcription in eukaryotes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Mohamed Ouhammouch, Robert E. Dewhurst, Winfried Hausner, Michael Thomm, and E. Peter Geiduschek | title=Activation of archaeal transcription by recruitment of the TATA-binding protein| journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | year=2003| volume=100| issue=9| pages=5097–5102 | pmc=154304 | doi=10.1073/pnas.0837150100 | pmid=12692306}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In bacteria, transcription begins with the binding of RNA polymerase to the promoter in DNA. RNA polymerase is a core enzyme consisting of five subunits: 2 α subunits, 1 β subunit, 1 β' subunit, and 1 ω subunit. At the start of initiation, the core enzyme is associated with a sigma factor that aids in finding the appropriate -35 and -10 base pairs downstream of promoter sequences.

'''What is sigma factor?'''

A sigma factor (σ factor) is a prokaryotic transcription initiation factor that enables specific binding of RNA polymerase to gene promoters. Different sigma factors are activated in response to different environmental conditions. Every molecule of RNA polymerase contains exactly one sigma factor subunit, which in the model bacterium Escherichia coli is one of those listed below. E. coli has seven sigma factors; the number of sigma factors varies between bacterial species. Sigma factors are distinguished by their characteristic molecular weights. For example, σ70 refers to the sigma factor with a molecular weight of 70 kDa.

===Transcription Factors===
Transcription factors are essential for the regulation of gene expression and are, as a consequence, found in all living organisms. The number of transcription factors found within an organism increases with genome size, and larger genomes tend to have more transcription factors per gene.
There are approximately 2600 proteins in the human genome that contain DNA-binding domains, and most of these are presumed to function as transcription factors. Therefore, approximately 10% of genes in the genome code for transcription factors, which makes this family the single largest family of human proteins. Furthermore, genes are often flanked by several binding sites for distinct transcription factors, and efficient expression of each of these genes requires the cooperative action of several different transcription factors (see, for example, hepatocyte nuclear factors). Hence, the combinatorial use of a subset of the approximately 2000 human transcription factors easily accounts for the unique regulation of each gene in the human genome during development.

In molecular biology, a transcription factor (sometimes called a sequence-specific DNA-binding factor) is a protein that binds to specific DNA sequences, thereby controlling the movement (or transcription) of genetic information from DNA to mRNA. Transcription factors perform this function alone or with other proteins in a complex, by promoting (as an activator), or blocking (as a repressor) the recruitment of RNA polymerase (the enzyme that performs the transcription of genetic information from DNA to RNA) to specific genes.

General transcription factors  or GTFs are intimately involved in the process of gene regulation, and most are required for life. TATA binding protein, (TBP) is a GTF that binds to the TATAA box (T=Thymine, A=Adenine) the motif of nucleic acids that is directly upstream from the coding region in all genes. TBP is responsible for the recruitment of the RNA Pol II holoenzyme, the final event in transcription initiation. These proteins are ubiquitous and interact with the core promoter region of DNA, which contains the transcription start site(s) of all class II genes.
Not all GTFs play a role in transcriptional initiation; some are required for the second general step in transcription, elongation. For example, members of the FACT complex (Spt16/Pob3 in S. cerevisiae, SUPT16H/SSRP1 in humans) facilitate the rapid movement of RNA Pol II over the encoding region of genes. This is accomplished by moving the histone octamer out of the way of an active polymerase and thereby decondensing the chromatin.

Transcription factors are modular in  structure and contain the following [[protein domains|domains]]:

'''[[DNA-binding domain]]''' ('''DBD'''), which attach to specific sequences of DNA enhancer  or Promoter: Necessary component for all vectors: used to drive transcription of the vector's transgene [[promoter (biology)|promoter]] sequences) adjacent to regulated genes.  DNA sequences that bind transcription factors are often referred to as [[hormone response element|'''response elements''']].

'''Trans-activating domain''' ('''TAD'''), which contain binding sites for other proteins such as [transcription coregulators.  These binding sites are frequently referred to as '''activation functions''' ('''AFs''').&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12893880&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Wärnmark A, Treuter E, Wright AP, Gustafsson J-Å | title = Activation functions 1 and 2 of nuclear receptors: molecular strategies for transcriptional activation | journal = Mol. Endocrinol. | volume = 17 | issue = 10 | pages = 1901–9 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12893880 | doi = 10.1210/me.2002-0384 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An optional '''signal sensing domain''' ('''SSD''') (''e.g.'', a ligand binding domain), which senses external signals and, in response, transmit these signals to the rest of the transcription complex, resulting in up- or down-regulation of gene expression.  Also, the DBD and signal-sensing domains may reside on separate proteins that associate within the transcription complex to regulate gene expression.

== Elongation of RNA==

[[File:simple transcription elongation1.svg|left|thumb|400px|Simple diagram of transcription elongation (RNA in blue color)]]

After the first bond is synthesized, the RNA polymerase must clear the promoter. During this time there is a tendency to release the RNA transcript and produce truncated transcripts. This is called abortive initiation and is common for both eukaryotes and prokaryotes. Abortive initiation continues to occur until the σ factor rearranges, resulting in the transcription elongation complex (which gives a 35 bp moving footprint). The σ factor is released before 80 nucleotides of mRNA are synthesized.Once the transcript reaches approximately 23 nucleotides, it no longer slips and elongation can occur. This, like most of the remainder of transcription, is an energy-dependent process, consuming adenosine triphosphate (ATP).
One strand of the DNA, the template strand (or noncoding strand), is used as a template for RNA synthesis. As transcription proceeds, RNA polymerase traverses the template strand and uses base pairing complementarity with the DNA template to create an RNA copy. Although RNA polymerase traverses the template strand from 3' → 5', the coding (non-template) strand and newly-formed RNA can also be used as reference points, so transcription can be described as occurring 5' → 3'. This produces an RNA molecule from 5' → 3', an exact copy of the coding strand (except that thymines are replaced with uracils, and the nucleotides are composed of a ribose (5-carbon) sugar where DNA has deoxyribose (one less oxygen atom) in its sugar-phosphate backbone).
Unlike DNA replication, mRNA transcription can involve multiple RNA polymerases on a single DNA template and multiple rounds of transcription (amplification of particular mRNA), so many mRNA molecules can be rapidly produced from a single copy of a gene.
Elongation also involves a proofreading mechanism that can replace incorrectly incorporated bases. In eukaryotes, this may correspond with short pauses during transcription that allow appropriate RNA editing factors to bind. These pauses may be intrinsic to the RNA polymerase or due to chromatin structure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics) Transcription (genetics)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transcription termination==
[[File:simple transcription termination1.svg|left|thumb|400px|Simple diagram of transcription termination. RNA is shown in blue color.]]

Bacteria use two different strategies for transcription termination. In Rho-independent transcription termination, RNA transcription stops when the newly synthesized RNA molecule forms a G-C-rich hairpin loop followed by a run of Us. When the hairpin forms, the mechanical stress breaks the weak rU-dA bonds, now filling the DNA-RNA hybrid. This pulls the poly-U transcript out of the active site of the RNA polymerase, in effect, terminating transcription. In the &quot;Rho-dependent&quot; type of termination, a protein factor called &quot;Rho&quot; destabilizes the interaction between the template and the mRNA, thus releasing the newly synthesized mRNA from the elongation complex.
Transcription termination in eukaryotes is less understood but involves cleavage of the new transcript followed by template-independent addition of As at its new 3' end, in a process called polyadenylation.

===Rho-dependent termination===

A Rho factor acts on an RNA substrate. Rho's key function is its helicase activity, for which energy is provided by an RNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis. The initial binding site for Rho is an extended (~70 nucleotides, sometimes 80-100 nucleotides) single-stranded region, rich in cytosine and poor in guanine, called the rho utilization site or rut, in the RNA being synthesised, upstream of the actual terminator sequence. Several rho binding sequences have been discovered. No consensus is found among these, but the different sequences each seem specific, as small mutations in the sequence disrupts its function. Rho binds to RNA and then uses its ATPase activity to provide the energy to translocate along the RNA until it reaches the RNA-DNA helical region, where it unwinds the hybrid duplex structure. RNA polymerase pauses at the termination sequence, which is due to the fact that there is a specific site around 100nt away from the Rho binding site called the Rho-sensitive pause site. So, even though the RNA polymerase is about 40nt per second faster than Rho, it does not pose a problem for the Rho termination mechanism as the RNA polymerase allows Rho factor to catch up.




===Rho-independent termination===

Rho-independent termination  (also known as Intrinsic termination) is a mechanism in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes that causes mRNA transcription to be stopped. In this mechanism, the mRNA contains a sequence that can base pair with itself to form a stem-loop structure 7-20 base pairs in length that is also rich in cytosine-guanine base pairs. These bases form three hydrogen bonds between each other and are therefore particularly strong. Following the stem-loop structure is a chain of uracil residues. The bonds between uracil and adenine are very weak. A protein bound to RNA polymerase (nusA) binds to the stem-loop structure tightly enough to cause the polymerase to temporarily stall. This pausing of the polymerase coincides with transcription of the poly-uracil sequence. The weak Adenine-Uracil bonds destabilize the RNA-DNA duplex, causing it to unwind and dissociate from the RNA polymerase.
Stem-loop structures that are not followed by a poly-Uracil sequence cause the RNA polymerase to pause, but it will typically continue transcription after a brief time because the duplex is too stable to unwind far enough to cause termination.
Rho-independent transcription termination is a frequent mechanism underlying the activity of cis-acting RNA regulatory elements, such as riboswitches&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Intrinsic_termination&amp;oldid=428278551&lt;/ref&gt;.

==mRNA and its modification==
The pre-mRNA molecule undergoes three main modifications. These modifications are 5' capping, 3' polyadenylation, and RNA splicing, which occur in the cell nucleus before the RNA is translated.
===Capping of mRNA===

[[Image:5'_cap_structure.png|400px|thumb|5' cap structure]]
The 5' cap looks like the 3' end of an RNA molecule (the 5' carbon of the cap ribose is bonded, and the 3' unbonded). This provides significant resistance to 5' exonucleases.
Capping of the pre-mRNA involves the addition of 7-methylguanosine (m7G) to the 5' end. To achieve this, the terminal 5' phosphate requires removal, which is done with the aid of a phosphatase enzyme. The enzyme guanosyl transferase then catalyses the reaction, which produces the diphosphate 5' end. The diphosphate 5' prime end then attacks the α phosphorus atom of a GTP molecule in order to add the guanine residue in a 5'5' triphosphate link. The enzyme (guanine-N7-)-methyltransferase (&quot;cap MTase&quot;) transfers a methyl group from S-adenosyl methionine to the guanine ring.This type of cap, with just the (m7G) in position is called a cap 0 structure. The ribose of the adjacent nucleotide may also be methylated to give a cap 1. Methylation of nucleotides downstream of the RNA molecule produce cap 2, cap 3 structures and so on. In these cases the methyl groups are added to the 2' OH groups of the ribose sugar. The cap protects the 5' end of the primary RNA transcript from attack by ribonucleases that have specificity to the 3'5' phosphodiester bonds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5'_cap 5'cap]&lt;/ref&gt;

The starting point is the unaltered 5' end of an RNA molecule. This features a final nucleotide followed by three phosphate groups attached to the 5' carbon.

One of the terminal phosphate groups is removed (by RNA terminal phosphatase), leaving two terminal phosphates.

GTP is added to the terminal phosphates (by a guanylyl transferase), losing two phosphate groups (from the GTP) in the process. This results in the 5' to 5' triphosphate linkage.

The 7-nitrogen of guanine is methylated (by a methyl transferase).

Other methyltransferases are optionally used to carry out methylation of 5' proximal nucleotides.

The 5' cap has 4 main functions:

Regulation of nuclear export.

Prevention of degradation by exonucleases.

Promotion of translation (see ribosome and translation).

Promotion of 5' proximal intron excision.

Nuclear export of RNA is regulated by the Cap binding complex (CBC), which binds exclusively to capped RNA. The CBC is then recognized by the nuclear pore complex and exported. Once in the cytoplasm after the pioneer round of translation, the CBC is replaced by the translation factors eIF-4E and eIF-4G. This complex is then recognized by other translation initiation machinery including the ribosome.
Cap prevents 5' degradation in two ways. First, degradation of the mRNA by 5' exonucleases is prevented (as mentioned above) by functionally looking like a 3' end. Second, the CBC complex and the eIF-4E/eIF-4G block the access of decapping enzymes to the cap. This increases the half-life of the mRNA, essential in eukaryotes as the export process takes significant time.
Decapping of an mRNA is catalyzed by the decapping complex made up of at least Dcp1 and Dcp2, which must compete with eIF-4E to bind the cap. Thus the 5' cap is a marker of an actively translating mRNA and is used by cells to regulate mRNA half-lives in response to new stimuli. Undesirable mRNAs are sent to P-bodies for temporary storage or decapping, the details of which are still being resolved. The mechanism of 5' proximal intron excision promotion is not well understood, but the 5' cap appears to loop around and interact with the spliceosome in the splicing process, promoting intron excision.
===Polyadenylation of mRNA===
[[Image:Alternative polyadenylation.svg|thumb|350px|Results of using different polyadenylation sites on the same gene]]
The pre-mRNA processing at the 3' end of the RNA molecule involves cleavage of its 3' end and then the addition of about 200 adenine residues to form a [[poly(A) tail]]. The cleavage and adenylation reactions occur if a [[polyadenylation|polyadenylation signal sequence]] (5'- AAUAAA-3') is located near the 3' end of the pre-mRNA molecule, which is followed by another sequence, which is usually '''(5'-CA-3')'''. The second signal is the site of cleavage. A '''GU-rich sequence''' is also usually present further downstream on the pre-mRNA molecule. After the synthesis of the sequence elements, two multisubunit [[protein]]s called [[cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor]] (CPSF) and [[cleavage stimulation factor]] (CStF) are transferred from [[RNA Polymerase II]] to the RNA molecule. The two factors bind to the sequence elements. A protein complex forms that contains additional cleavage factors and the enzyme [[Polyadenylate Polymerase]] (PAP). This complex cleaves the RNA between the polyadenylation sequence and the GU-rich sequence at the cleavage site marked by the (5'-CA-3') sequences. Poly(A) polymerase then adds about 200 adenine units to the new 3' end of the RNA molecule using [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] as a precursor. As the poly(A) tails is synthesised, it binds multiple copies of poly(A) binding protein, which protects the 3'end from ribonuclease digestion.&lt;ref name=&quot;CITEREFBiochemistry1&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Hames|Hooper|2006|Ref=CITEREFHamesHopper2008|p=225}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Poly(A)-binding protein or &quot;PABP&quot;'''

Poly(A)-binding protein (or &quot;PABP&quot;) is a RNA-binding protein which binds to the poly(A) tail of mRNA. The poly(A) tail is located on the 3' end of mRNA. The nuclear isoforms selectively binds to around 50 nucleotides and stimulates the activity of Polyadenylate polymerase.The expression of mammalian Poly(A)-binding protein is regulated at the translational level by a feed-back mechanism: the mRNA encoding PABP contains in its 5' UTR an A-rich sequence which binds Poly(A)-binding protein. This leads to repression of translation
The cytosolic isoform of eukaryotes Poly(A) binding protein binds to the initiation factor eIF-4G via its C-terminal domain. EIF-4G is bound to eIF-4E, another initiation factor bound to the 5' cap on the 5' end of mRNA. This binding forms the characteristic loop structure of eukaryotic protein synthesis. Poly(A)-binding protein interacting proteins in the cytosol compete for the eIF-4G binding sites. Poly(A)-binding protein has also been shown to interact with a termination factor (eRF3)

'''Alternative polyadenylation'''

Many protein-coding genes have more than one polyadenylation site, so a gene can code for several mRNAs that differ in their 3' end. Since alternative polyadenylation changes the length of the 3' untranslated region, it can change which binding sites for microRNAs the 3' untranslated region contains. MicroRNAs tend to repress translation and promote degradation of the mRNAs they bind to, although there are examples of microRNAs that stabilise transcripts. Alternative polyadenylation can also shorten the coding region, thus making the mRNA code for a different protein, but this is much less common than just shortening the 3' untranslated region.
The choice of poly(A) site depends on the expression of the proteins that take part in polyadenylation. For example, the expression of CstF-64, a subunit of cleavage stimulatory factor (CstF), increases in macrophages in response to lipopolysaccharides (a group of bacterial compounds that trigger an immune response). This results in the selection of weak poly(A) sites and thus shorter transcripts. This removes regulatory elements in the 3' untranslated regions of mRNAs for defense-related products like lysozyme and TNF-α. These mRNAs then have longer half-lives and produce more of these proteins.RNA-binding proteins other than those in the polyadenylation machinery can also affect whether a polyadenyation site is used, as can DNA methylation near the polyadenylation signal&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Polyadenylation&amp;oldid=422375377&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Splicing of RNA==
[[Image:Pre-mRNA to mRNA.svg|right|thumbnail|420px|Simple illustration of a pre-mRNA, with introns (top). After the introns have been removed via splicing, the mature mRNA sequence is ready for translation (bottom).]]



Splicing is the process by which pre-mRNA is modified to remove certain stretches of non-coding sequences called introns; the stretches that remain include protein-coding sequences and are called exons. Sometimes pre-mRNA messages may be spliced in several different ways, allowing a single gene to encode multiple proteins. This process is called alternative splicing. Splicing is usually performed by an RNA-protein complex called the spliceosome, but some RNA molecules are also capable of catalyzing their own splicing&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA Messenger_RNA]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:A complex.jpg|thumb|Spliceosome A complex defines the 5' and 3' ends of the intron before removal]]
'''Introns'''
One plausible hypothesis for the observed distribution of introns is that ancient predecessors of modern-day eukaryotes contained large numbers of introns, and that selective pressure to control genome size in fast-growing species may have led to the elimination of many ancient introns. Complicating this issue is that finding that many introns are themselves mobile genetic elements, and can be inserted into and deleted from genes.
Shortly after the discovery of introns, investigators offered competing theories that offer alternative scenarios for the origin and early evolution of spliceosomal introns. Other classes of introns such as self-splicing and tRNA introns are not subject to much debate, but see for the former. These are popularly referred to as the Introns-Early (IE) and the Introns-Late (IL) views.
The IE model, championed by Walter Gilbert, proposes that introns are extremely old and numerously present in the earliest theoretical ancestors of prokaryotes and eukaryotes, the progenotes. In this model, introns were subsequently lost from prokaryotic organisms, allowing them to attain growth efficiency. A central prediction of this theory is that the early introns were mediators that facilitated the recombination of exons that represented the protein domains. This model cannot account for some observed positional variation of introns shared among related genes.

The IL model proposes that introns were recently inserted into originally intron-less contiguous genes after the divergence of eukaryotes and prokaryotes. In this model, introns probably originated from transposable elements. This model is based on the observation that the spliceosomal introns are restricted to eukaryotes alone. However, there is considerable debate over the presence of introns in the early prokaryote-eukaryote ancestors and the subsequent intron loss-gain during eukaryotic evolution. The evolution of introns and of the intron-exon structure may be largely independent of the evolution of coding-sequences.

Introns were first discovered in protein-coding genes of adenovirus , but are now known to occur within a wide variety of genes throughout all of the biological kingdoms.
The frequency of introns within different genomes can vary widely across the spectrum of biological organisms. For example, introns are extremely common within the nuclear genome of higher vertebrates (e.g. humans and mice), where protein-coding genes almost always contain multiple introns, while introns are rare within the nuclear genes of some eukaryotic microorganisms, for example baker's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). In contrast, the mitochondrial genomes of vertebrates are entirely devoid of introns, while those of eukaryotic microorganisms may contain many introns.
===Spliceosome and its assembly===

[[Image:Minor spliceosome.jpg||thumb|280px|right|A comparison between major and minor splicing mechanisms&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_spliceosome Minor spliceosome]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Each spliceosome is composed of five small nuclear RNA proteins, called snRNPs, (pronounced &quot;snurps&quot;) and a range of non-snRNP associated protein factors.
The snRNPs that make up the nuclear spliceosome are named U1, U2, U4, U5, and U6, and participate in several RNA-RNA and RNA-protein interactions. The RNA component of the snRNP is rich in uridine (the nucleoside analog of the uracil nucleotide).
The canonical assembly of the spliceosome occurs anew on each hnRNA. The hnRNA contains specific sequence elements that are recognized and utilized during spliceosome assembly. These include the 5' end splice, the branch point sequence, the polypyrimidine tract, and the 3' end splice site. The spliceosome catalyzes the removal of introns, and the ligation of the flanking exons.
Introns typically have a GU nucleotide sequence at the 5' end splice site, and an AG at the 3' end splice site. The 3' splice site can be further defined by a variable length of polypyrimidines, called the polypyrimidine tract (PPT), which serves the dual function of recruiting factors to the 3' splice site and possibly recruiting factors to the branch point sequence (BPS). The BPS contains the conserved Adenosine required for the first step of splicing.
A group of less abundant snRNPs, U11, U12, U4atac, and U6atac, together with U5, are subunits of the so-called minor spliceosome that splices a rare class of pre-mRNA introns, denoted U12-type. These snRNPs form the U12 spliceosome are located in the cytosol.
New evidence derived from the first crystal structure of a group II intron suggests that the spliceosome is actually a ribozyme, and that it uses a two–metal ion mechanism for catalysis.

The model for formation of the spliceosome active site involves an ordered, stepwise assembly of discrete snRNP particles on the hnRNA substrate.  The first recognition of hnRNAs involves U1 snRNP binding to the 5' end splice site of the hnRNA and other non-snRNP associated factors to form the commitment complex, or early (E) complex in mammals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal=Molecular and Cell Biology | volume=12 | author = Jamison SF, Crow A, and Garcia-Blanco MA | date= October 1, 1992 | title=The Spliceosome Assembly Pathway in Mammilian Extracts | pages=4279–87 | pmid=1383687 |pmc=360351 | issue=10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| journal= Cell | volume=59 | pages=349–58 | title=Identification of functional U1 snRNA pre-messenger RNA complexes committed to spliceosome assembly and splicing| author=Seraphin B. and Rosbash M. | year=1989 | pmid=2529976 | doi=10.1016/0092-8674(89)90296-1| issue= 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The commitment complex is an ATP-independent complex that commits the hnRNA to the splicing pathway.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid3065622&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Legrain P, Seraphin B, Rosbash M |title=Early commitment of yeast pre-mRNA to the spliceosome pathway |journal=Mol.

The presence of a pseudouridine residue in U2 snRNA, nearly opposite of the branch site, results in an altered conformation of the RNA-RNA duplex upon the U2 snRNP binding.  Specifically, the altered structure of the duplex induced by the pseudouridine places the 2' OH of the bulged adenosine in a favorable position for the first step of splicing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Upon recruitment of the triple snRNP, several RNA-RNA rearrangements precede the first catalytic step and further rearrangements occur in the catalytically active spliceosome.  Several of the RNA-RNA interactions are mutually exclusive; however, it is not known what triggers these interactions, nor the order of these rearrangements.  The first rearrangement is probably the displacement of U1 snRNP from the 5' splice site and formation of a U6 snRNA interaction.  It is known that U1 snRNP is only weakly associated with fully formed spliceosomes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Upon recruitment of U2 snRNP, the branch binding protein SF1 in the commitment complex is displaced since the binding site of U2 snRNA and SF1 are mutually exclusive events.

Within the U2 snRNA, there are other mutually exclusive rearrangements that occur between competing conformations.  For example, in the active form, stem loop IIa is favored; in the inactive form a mutually exclusive interaction between the loop and a downstream sequence predominates.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid9476892&quot; /&gt; It is unclear how U4 is displaced from U6 snRNAm, although RNA has been implicated in spliceosome assembly, and may function to unwind U4/U6 and promote the formation of a U2/U6 snRNA interaction.  The interactions of U4/U6 stem loops I and II dissociate and the freed stem loop II region of U6 folds on itself to form an intramolecular stem loop and U4 is no longer required in further spliceosome assembly.  The freed stem loop I region of U6 base pairs with U2 snRNA forming the U2/U6 helix I.  However, the helix I structure is mutually exclusive with the 3' half of an internal 5' stem loop region of U2 snRNA.

The RNA components of snRNPs interact with the intron and may be involved in catalysis. Two types of spliceosomes have been identified (the major and minor) which contain different snRNPs.
Major
The major spliceosome splices introns containing GU at the 5' splice site and AG at the 3' splice site. It is composed of the U1, U2, U4, U5, and U6 snRNPs and is active in the nucleus. In addition, a number of proteins including U2AF and SF1 are required for the assembly of the spliceosome.

E Complex-U1 binds to the GU sequence at the 5' splice site, along with accessory proteins/enzymes ASF/SF2, U2AF (binds at the Py-AG site), SF1/BBP (BBP=Branch Binding Protein);

A Complex-U2 binds to the branch site and ATP is hydrolyzed;

B1 Complex-U5/U4/U6 trimer binds, and the U5 binds exons at the 5' site, with U6 binding to U2;

B2 Complex-U1 is released, U5 shifts from exon to intron and the U6 binds at the 5' splice site;

C1 Complex-U4 is released, U6/U2 catalyzes transesterification, that make 5'end of introns ligate to the A on intron and from a lariat ,U5 binds exon at 3' splice site, and the 5' site is cleaved, resulting in the formation of the lariat;

C2 Complex-U2/U5/U6 remain bound to the lariat, and the 3' site is cleaved and exons are ligated using ATP hydrolysis. The spliced RNA is released and the lariat debranches.


This type of splicing is termed canonical splicing or termed the lariat pathway, which accounts for more than 99% of splicing. By contrast, when the intronic flanking sequences do not follow the GU-AG rule, noncanonical splicing is said to occur (see &quot;minor spliceosome&quot; below).
'''Minor spliceosome'''

The minor spliceosome is a ribonucleoprotein complex that catalyses the removal (splicing) of an atypical class of spliceosomal introns (U12-type) from eukaryotic messenger RNAs in plant, insects, vertebrates and some fungi (Rhizopus oryzae). This process is called noncanonical splicing, as opposed to U2-dependent canonical splicing. U12-type introns represent less than 1% of all introns in human cells. However they are found in genes performing essential cellular functions.
The minor spliceosome is very similar to the major spliceosome, however it splices out rare introns with different splice site sequences. While the minor and major spliceosomes contain the same U5 snRNP, the minor spliceosome has different, but functionally analogous snRNPs for U1, U2, U4, and U6, which are respectively called U11, U12, U4atac, and U6atac. Like the major spliceosome, it is only found in the nucleus&lt;ref&gt;Will CL, Lührmann R (August 2005). &quot;Splicing of a rare class of introns by the U12-dependent spliceosome&quot;. Biol. Chem. 386 (8): 713–24&lt;/ref&gt;.
Trans-splicing
Trans-splicing is a form of splicing that joins two exons that are not within the same RNA transcript

==Self splicing==



Self splicing occurs for rare introns that form a ribozyme, performing the functions of the spliceosome by RNA alone. There are three kinds of self-splicing introns, Group I, Group II and Group III. Group I and II introns perform splicing similar to the spliceosome without requiring any protein. This similarity suggests that Group I and II introns may be evolutionarily related to the spliceosome. Self-splicing may also be very ancient, and may have existed in an RNA world present before protein. 
Two transesterifications characterize the mechanism in which group I introns are spliced:
3'OH of a free guanine nucleoside (or one located in the intron) or a nucleotide cofactor (GMP, GDP, GTP) attacks phosphate at the 5' splice site.
3'OH of the 5'exon becomes a nucleophile and the second transesterification results in the joining of the two exons.
The mechanism in which group II introns are spliced (two transesterification reaction like group I introns) is as follows:
The 2'OH of a specific adenosine in the intron attacks the 5' splice site, thereby forming the lariat
The 3'OH of the 5' exon triggers the second transesterification at the 3' splice site thereby joining the exons together.

'''Group I'''
Group I introns are distributed in bacteria, lower eukaryotes and higher plants. However, their occurrence in bacteria seems to be more sporadic than in lower eukaryotes, and they have become prevalent in higher plants. The genes that group I introns interrupt differ significantly: They interrupt rRNA, mRNA and tRNA genes in bacterial genomes, as well as in mitochondrial and chloroplast genomes of lower eukaryotes, but only invade rRNA genes in the nuclear genome of lower eukaryotes. In higher plants, these introns seem to be restricted to a few tRNA and mRNA genes of the chloroplasts and mitochondria. Both intron-early and intron-late theories have found evidences in explaining the origin of group I introns. Some group I introns encode homing endonuclease (HEG), which catalyzes intron mobility. It is proposed that HEGs move the intron from one location to another, from one organism to another and thus account for the wide spreading of the selfish group I introns. No biological role has been identified for group I introns thus far except for splicing of themselves from the precursor to prevent the death of the host that they live by. A small number of group I introns are also found to encode a class of proteins called maturases that facilitate the intron splicing.

Splicing of group I introns is processed by two sequential ester-transfer reactions. The exogenous guanosine or guanosine nucleotide (exoG) first docks onto the active G-binding site located in P7, and its 3'-OH is aligned to attack the phosphodiester bond at the 5' splice site located in P1, resulting in a free 3'-OH group at the upstream exon and the exoG being attached to the 5' end of the intron. Then the terminal G (omega G) of the intron swaps the exoG and occupies the G-binding site to organize the second ester-transfer reaction, the 3'-OH group of the upstream exon in P1 is aligned to attacks the 3' splice site in P10, leading to the ligation of the adjacent upstream and downstream exons and free of the catalytic intron.
Two-metal-ion mechanism seen in protein polymerases and phosphatases was proposed to be used by group I and group II introns to process the phosphoryl transfer reactions, which was unambiguously proven by a recently resolved high-resolution structure of the Azoarcus group I 
intron.

'''Group II catalytic intron'''

Group II catalytic introns are found in rRNA, tRNA and mRNA of organelles in fungi, plants and protists, and also in mRNA in bacteria. They are large self-splicing ribozymes and have 6 structural domains (usually designated dI to dVI). This model and alignment represents only domains V and VI. A subset of group II introns also encode essential splicing proteins in intronic ORFs. The length of these introns can therefore be up to 3kb. Splicing occurs in almost identical fashion to nuclear pre-mRNA splicing with two transesterification steps. The 2' hydroxyl of a bulged adenosine in domain VI attacks the 5' splice site, followed by nucleophilic attack on the 3' splice site by the 3' OH of the upstream exon. Protein machinery is required for splicing in vivo, and long range intron-intron and intron-exon interactions are important for splice site positioning. Group II introns are further sub-classified into groups IIA and IIB, which differ in splice site consensus, and the distance of the bulged adenosine in domain VI (the prospective branch point forming the lariat) from the 3' splice site.

'''Group III introns'''

Montandon,P. and Stutz,E. (1984) and Hallick,R.B. et al. (1988 and 1989) reported examples of a novel type of introns in Euglena chloroplast. In 1989, David A.Christopher and Richard B.Hallick proposed the title, Group III introns to identify this new class with the following characteristics:
Group III introns are much shorter than other self-splicing intron classes, ranging from 95 to 110 nucleotides amongst those known to Christopher and Hallick, and identified in chloroplasts. On the other hand, Christopher and Hallick stated: &quot;By contrast, the smallest Euglena chloroplast group II intron ... is 277 nucleotides.&quot;
Their conserved sequences proximal to the splicing sites have similarities to those of group II introns, but have fewer conserved positions.
They do not map into the conserved secondary structure of group II introns. (Indeed Christopher and Hallick were unable to identify any conserved secondary structure elements among group III introns.)
They are usually associated with genes involved in translation and transcription.
They are very A+T rich.
In 1994, discovery of a group III intron with a length of one order of magnitude longer indicated that length alone is not the determinant of splicing in Group III introns (Copertino DW., Hall ET.)
Splicing of group III introns occurs through lariat and circular RNA formation. Similarities between group III and nuclear introns include conserved 5' boundary sequences, lariat formation, lack of internal structure, and ability to use alternate splice boundaries.

==RNA-editing==
[[Image:Editing.PNG|600px|thumb|Summary of the Various Functions of RNA Editing]]

The RNA-editing system seen in the animal may have evolved from mononucleotide deaminases, which have led to larger gene families that include the apobec-1 and adar genes. These genes share close identity with the bacterial deaminases involved in nucleotide metabolism. The adenosine deaminase of E. coli cannot deaminate a nucleoside in the RNA; the enzyme’s reaction pocket is too small to for the RNA strand to bind to. However, this active site is widened by amino acid changes in the corresponding human analog genes, APOBEC-1 and ADAR, allowing deamination.
The insertional editing seen in the trypanosome mitochondria has no relation with the nucleoside conversion process. The enzymes involved have been shown in other studies to be recruited and adapted from different sources. But, the specificity of nucleotide insertion via the interaction between the gRNA and mRNA are similar to the tRNA editing processes in the animal and Acanthamoeba mithochondria. Furthermore, the eukaryotic ribose methylation of rRNAs by guide RNA molecules may provide another link between RNA editing and modification.
As a consequence, the numerous studies suggest that RNA editing may have evolved in specific lineages of speciation, due to the subtle differences in their mechanism. The data does not support the existence of RNA editing in the RNA world, since its mechanism is not linked to any hypothesized process that may have existed at that time. Therefore, RNA editing appears to have evolved at a later time to compensate for the changes in gene sequences and to increase variation.

===Editing by insertion or deletion===

RNA editing through the addition and deletion of uracil has been found in kinetoplasts from the mitochondria of ''Trypanosoma brucei''. Editing of the RNA starts with the base-pairing of the unedited primary transcript with a guide RNA (gRNA), which contains complementary sequences to the regions around the insertion/deletion points. The newly formed double-stranded region is then enveloped by an editosome, a large multi-protein complex that catalyzes the editing. The editosome opens the transcript at the first mismatched nucleotide and starts inserting uridines. The inserted uridines will base-pair with the guide RNA, and insertion will continue as long as A or G is present in the guide RNA and will stop when a C or U is encountered. The inserted nucleotides cause a frameshift and result in a translated protein that differs from its gene.


'''The Editosome Complex'''
The mechanism of the editosome involves an endonucleolytic cut at the mismatch point between the guide RNA and the unedited transcript. The next step is catalyzed by one of the enzymes in the complex, a terminal U-transferase, which adds Us from UTP at the 3’ end of the mRNA. The opened ends are held in place by other proteins in the complex. Another enzyme, a U-specific exoribonuclease, removes the unpaired Us. After editing has made mRNA complementary to gRNA, an RNA ligase rejoins the ends of the edited mRNA transcript.
As a consequence, the editosome can edit only in a 3’ to 5’ direction along the primary RNA transcript. The complex can act on only a single guide RNA at a time. Therefore, a RNA transcript requiring extensive editing will need more than one guide RNA and editosome complex.




'''Editing by deamination'''

'''C-U editing'''
The editing involves cytidine deaminase that deaminates a cytidine base into a uridine base. An example of C-to-U editing is with the apolipoprotein B gene in humans. Apo B100 is expressed in the liver and apo B48 is expressed in the intestines. The B100 form has a CAA sequence that is edited to UAA, a stop codon, in the intestines. It is unedited in the liver.


'''A-I editing'''
A-to-I editing occurs in regions of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). Adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs) are the RNA-editing enzymes involved in the hydrolytic deamination of Adenosine to Inosine (A-to-I editing). A-to-I editing can be specific (a single adenosine is edited within the stretch of dsRNA) or promiscuous (up to 50% of the adenosines are edited). Specific editing occurs within short duplexes (e.g., those formed in an mRNA where intronic sequence base pairs with a complementary exonic sequence), while promiscuous editing occurs within longer regions of duplex (e.g., pre- or pri-miRNAs, duplexes arising from transgene or viral expression, duplexes arising from paired repetitive elements). There are many effects of A-to-I editing, arising from the fact that I behaves as if it is G both in translation and when forming secondary structures. These effects include alteration of coding capacity, altered miRNA or siRNA target populations, heterochromatin formation, nuclear sequestration, cytoplasmic sequestration, endonucleolytic cleavage by Tudor-SN, inhibition of miRNA and siRNA processing ,and altered splicing&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=RNA_editing&amp;oldid=424324287&lt;/ref&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Using the form below will rename a page, moving all of its history to the new name. The old title will become a redirect page to the new title. Be sure to check for [[Special:DoubleRedirects|double]] or [[Special:BrokenRedirects|broken redirects]]. You are responsible for making sure that links continue to point where they are supposed to go.

Note that the page will '''not''' be moved if there is already a page at the new title, unless it is empty or a redirect and has no past edit history. This means that you can rename a page back to where it was renamed from if you make a mistake, and you cannot overwrite an existing page.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">A conic section is defined as the locus of all points where the distance from the point to the focus and the point to a straight line known as the directrix is a constant ratio. This ratio is known as the eccentricity of the section.
* If the ratio is 1, the section is known as a parabola.
* If the ratio is less than one, the section is an ellipse. A circle is a special case of an ellipse.
* If the ratio is greater than one, the section is hyperbola.

All conic sections can be formed by taking the intersection of a cone and a plane, hence the name.

== Using the collection creator ==
After the ''collection creator'' has been enabled, the box as seen below is shown above each wiki page.
{|
|-
| [[File:Collection Extension - Create a collection box.png|frame|The collection creator interface]]
|-
|}

;''Add this page to your collection''
:Adds the currently viewed page to your collection.
;''Show collection''
:Opens a new page which will show a list of all pages that you added to your collection. On that page, you can '''change the order''' of the pages in your collection and '''structure''' them using chapters. Further, you can '''download''' the books as a [[w:PDF|PDF]] or [[w:OpenDocument|ODF]], or order a '''printed book'''.
;''Suggest pages''
:This tool analyzes the current set of pages in your book and '''suggests''' pages that might be also relevant to the overall topic of your collection. This tool allows to create collections '''quickly'''.
;''Disable''
:This will '''disable''' the ''Collection creator'' and '''delete''' your collection (unless you saved it first).

=== Adding pages without visiting them ===
A quick way to add pages is to simply hover on a linked page. If you wait about one second, a small box will pop up with the message &quot;Add linked wiki page to your collection&quot;. Click on this link, and the linked page will be added to your collection.

=== Adding whole categories ===
If you are viewing a [[Wikibooks:Categories|category page]], you can add all the pages in that category at once. The ''Add this page to your collection'' link will have changed into ''Add this category to your collection''. Click on this new link, and all the pages in that category will be added to your collection. Relevant categories may be found at the very bottom of Wikibooks pages. Categories can also be added by hovering category links.</text>

==Question: Quiz ==

Is there a way to use the [[v:Help:Quiz|quiz]] together with [[mw:Extension:Collection|collections]]? For example: it would be nice if the software could show the answers that are in the quiz code in a section after the exercises... But until now, even the questions are not displayed correctly...

:As far as I know the [http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Quiz quiz extension] is not supported by wikibooks. If it was, you should be able to use the standard tricks to have a different on-screen and print version, i.e. &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;includeonly&gt; and &lt;noinclude&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; if you use the traditional print version approach and [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Help:Collections#Substituting_templates substitution templates] if you use collections. --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 13:31, 1 April 2009 (UTC)

== Question: image and code ==

Hi,
I have made pdf from page :
[[Fractals/Iterations_in_the_complex_plane/Julia_set Julia set]].
It looks good. The only problem is that the code is on the image . See for example section &quot;External distance estimation&quot; in pdf file.
Here psedocode : &quot;if (LastIteration==IterationMax)
then { /* interior of Julia set: color = black */ }....&quot;
Is on the image : Julia set : image with C source code.
How can I change it ? Regards. --[[User:Adam majewski|Adam majewski]] ([[User talk:Adam majewski|talk]]) 07:47, 30 May 2009 (UTC)

But PDF generates sucessfully!

Can somebody fix this ODF book creation error?

== Images can be improperly positionned in generated PDF ==

Hi,

I've generated a PDF form the [[Blender_3D:_Noob_to_Pro]] wikibook. Resulting PDF is : [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&amp;bookcmd=download&amp;collection_id=0cd82511e39ba944&amp;writer=rl&amp;return_to=Wikibooks%3ACollections%2FBlender+3D%3A+Noob+to+Pro here] (A4 format).

Result is good, except for some pages where images (which appeared centered on the online version) are moved partially outside the right margin in the generated PDF. Example of such page incorreclty generated is [[Blender_3D:_Noob_to_Pro/Coordinate_Transformations|Blender_3D:_Noob_to_Pro/Coordinate_Transformations]] (the 3rd image of the LEM is centered online, but incorrect in the generated PDF).

Please help.

== Cannot save collection,using Collections tool ==

I use IE9, and I have been a user here for over a month.
I cannot fill in a collection file name for either my namespace or the wiki space -- the input field is disabled.
And so is the &quot;submit&quot; button for the field.

If I modify the HTML on-the-fly from my browser to fill in the collection name and enable the submit button, then hit the submit button, the save never happens. Yesterday, when I tried this, I got a bunch of wiki errors.--[[User:AngelinaBelle|AngelinaBelle]] ([[User talk:AngelinaBelle|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/AngelinaBelle|contribs]]) 11:25, 19 October 2011 (UTC)
:I have filed a [[bugzilla:31821|bug report]] for this, as I see it's also been reported at Wikipedia and I was able to reproduce the error when saving.  I had to try to save to the Wikibooks namespace, as I was able to fill in the text field for the Wikibooks namespace, but not the user namespace. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|discuss]]&lt;/small&gt; 14:20, 19 October 2011 (UTC)

== A few issues with PDF render ==
I like collections, but the output just isn't up to it at the moment and it looks like I'll have to go back to print versions. You can find the issues here in a collection I've been trying to build:[[User:Pluke/Collections/Unit2]]

* &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;syntaxhighlight&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; tag not working
* passing &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;syntaxhighlight&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; to a template causes the template parameter to not be passed correctly, defaulting back to &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{1}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
* You can't have an exercise box that spreads over more than one page
** See Boolean gate combination
* internal wikipedia links are not highlighted, but present ie. using: &lt;nowiki&gt;[[w:apple|apple]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
* inconsistent rendering of CSS / styles
** box widths not 100% when they are in wiki view
** background colours missing from most css
** style formatting of text in tables doesn't seem to work
* wikitable display is inconsistent
** table caption is displayed incorrectly &lt;nowiki&gt;|+ '''Examples of Boolean Algebra shown in a truth table'''&lt;/nowiki&gt; (this may be a result of nested tables not being handled correctly)
* transparency on SVGs appears as plain black
* &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; tag not working
* &lt;nowiki&gt;{{cquote}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; rendering is a little clumsy, the speech marks over lap the text

== Section Numbers ==

I'm in the process of adding chapter and section numbers for a collection, specifically [[Wikibooks:Collections/GLSL_Programming_in_Unity]]. The idea is to hard code chapter and section numbers in that page and to have a template ({{tlx|GLSL Programming Unity SectionRef}}) with hard coded chapter and section numbers to produce numbered references in the output for print. Whenever the numbering changes (e.g. when sections are added, removed, or moved around), these two pages but no other pages have to be changed. Is there an easier way to achieve a similar result? --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Martin Kraus|contribs]]) 22:01, 19 May 2012 (UTC)

== Positive Feedback ==

I am not sure whether this is the proper venue for submitting such feedback, but it's the only one I've found so far.  I am very impressed with the quality of the output of the PDF generation.  I mean, I'm no document expert or anything, but it exceeds anything I expected.  Quite excellent.  If anyone could pass on my congratulations and my thanks to the people who made the PDF generation system possible, I would be grateful.  A job well done. -- 00:39 28 January 2013 (UTC)

== A request for HTML output ==

Some time ago I downloaded the wikibook [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro]]. Originally it was in three large HTML files, &quot;Beginner Tutorials&quot;, &quot;Advanced Tutorials&quot;, and &quot;Miscellaneous Tutorials&quot;. This was very convenient and made it very easy to use offline while teaching myself how to use Blender. Unfortunately, in the intervening period some misguided person has spent a lot of effort cutting up the three large pages into what are now 254 small pages, some consisting of only a single paragraph. I'm sure this person meant well and undoubtedly had in mind the oft-repeated saying that webpages should consist of little more than a screenful of data. (I have tried to find the origin of this suggestion that smaller pages are somehow &quot;better&quot;. It always seemed to me a rather patronising belief, as if we &quot;ordinary folk&quot; are not capable of maintaing our attention for more than a few minutes at a time. It seems very out of place on the Wikibooks site, where people have deliberately come to look for long-form content.) Sadly, this decimation has made what was a wonderful resource into something completely unusable for offline reading.

So I tried today to collect all 254 pages into a downloadable book, with disastrous results.

It took about 4 hours going through all the pages to click on the &quot;Add this page to your collection&quot; link at the head of each page. (The hover &quot;Add this page to your collection&quot; links on the main index page don't display.) I finally had the collection ready to be rendered and downloaded. Away it went rendering for what may have been half an hour, then presented me with the link to download the epub. (I intended to unzip the epub later and pull out the HTML files that comprise it.) I clicked the link and I'm not sure how long it took then displaying a blank page (20 minutes?) before finally saying that an error had occurred. I went back to the earlier page and tried downloading again. Another error and a note saying that my collection seems to have been deleted (though I don't think it was). I tried a few more times, including attempting to download as OpenDocument format (I could convert that to HTML later).

Interestingly I looked around in the /tmp directory on my machine and found three 13MB files that are incomplete PDF documents with times corresponding to my attempts to download the epub and OpenDocument files... but I never requested PDF. (I've since tried a test on a single page, and the collection process '''only''' delivers PDF.)

May I request adding HTML format to the book collection formats? It would be much easier to do than the other three formats. PDF is terribly bloated and suited only to printing on paper. OpenDocument format is similar, but at least possible to convert to other formats. The epub format is a conveniently compact reader format, but none of the three formats allow animated gifs or sounds and videos to play. HTML alone is capable of printing, displaying animated gifs and playing sound and video.

Can I also request that the policy of slicing pages into ever smaller and smaller pieces be reversed? It is a terribly retrograde step that makes books virtually unusable unless you are lucky enough to have cheap, fast, always-on internet. Most of the planet still has expensive, slow, occasional internet. Remember, this isn't Wikipages or Wikiparagraphs, it is Wiki'''books'''. People come here looking for large chunks of information: books. To serve it up to them in tiny chunks is to sorely underestimate them, and as it did for me today, makes life far more difficult than it need be. It has sadly made [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro]] completely unusable for offline work. It's like tearing the pages out of a paper book and handing them to a reader one at a time as they request them, instead of letting the reader have the whole book to read as they wish. It makes no sense.

&lt;-- Second page (renamed)
&lt;-- Third page

&lt;-- Second chapter's name
&lt;-- Fourth page
&lt;-- Fifth page (renamed)
&lt;-- Sixth page 

*   These parameters are not currently supported by the printed book creation system
    but will be at some point in the future. In the meantime, these can be used to
    give a preview of what the printed book cover could be like.
&lt;/pre&gt;
|-
|}

You can also manually create a collection from scratch by using the same format. To create a collection from scratch, start a new page such as &lt;nowiki&gt;[[User:Myusername/Collections/Mybookname]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;. Only [[Wikibooks:Autoconfirmed users|autoconfirmed users]] can save collections.

;Allowed syntax
Only the following syntax is allowed:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
| '''Title'''
| The title is contained in double equals signs.&lt;br /&gt;
{{green|&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;== Title ==&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;}}
|-
| '''Subtitle'''
| The subtitles is contained in three equals signs.&lt;br /&gt;
{{green|&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;=== Subtitle ===&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;}}
|-
| '''Chapter headings'''
| Chapter headings are preceded with a semicolon.&lt;br /&gt;
{{green|&lt;code&gt;;Chapter name&lt;/code&gt;}}
|-
| '''Adding a page'''
| A page is inserted as a wikilink after a colon.&lt;br /&gt;
{{green|&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;:[[Book Name/Page]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;}}
|-
|'''Renaming a page'''
|You can use a pipe ('&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;') to rename the page in the collection.&lt;br /&gt;
{{green|&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;:[[Python Programming/Classes|Classes]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;}}
|}

;Location of collections
Books can either be saved in the user's namespace &lt;nowiki&gt;[[User:Name/Collections/Book Name]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; or as a community book at &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Wikibooks:Collections/Book Name]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;. To be recognized as a collection, it must belong to the category [[:Category:Collections]] (automatically added by {{tl|saved book}}).

==Loading collections==

To load a collection, simply click on the 'load collection' link in the banner at the top of each collection. If the banner isn't present, then add {{tl|saved book}} at the top of the page.

==Improving the book layout==

Some wiki-markup can lead to problems in the generation of PDF documents as part of the book feature.  This mainly applies to templates, which will be displayed differently in the electronic or print version compared to how they look in the online version of a page.  This can be fixed by either substituting the current template or removing the template from the content that cause problems in the PDF.  As a rule of thumb, all content (especially templates) that is not useful for an offline version of the document, should be excluded from the print version.

===Identifying problems===

The most efficient way to identify problems is to go on the individual pages of your book and view the page as a PDF (click &quot;Download as PDF&quot; in the &quot;print/export&quot; box on the left hand side of your screen, towards the bottom). Preview the page, and if something doesn't look right, chances are there's a problem. While the printed books and OpenDocument version will differ from the PDF version, they share a lot of similarities. If something looks weird in the PDF version, chances are it will also look weird in the printed book or OpenDocument version.

Usually there are three kinds of problems:

* A template that is not content-related (such as [[Template:Navbox|a navigational box]]) is displayed. See below on how to fix this.
* Something looks weird, such as &lt;span style=&quot;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;234&lt;span style=&quot;white-space:nowrap;margin-left:0.3em;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;display:inline-block; margin-bottom:-0.3em; vertical-align:-0.4em; line-height:1.2em; font-family:monospace,'Courier New'; font-size:85%; text-align:right;&quot;&gt;+23&lt;br /&gt;&amp;minus;21&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; looking like 234+23-21 in the PDF, or having superfluous whitespace. This is usually due to a template being coded in a non-standard way, or to a problem with the rendering software. You can try to fix this yourself if you know your way around templates. If you don't know how to fix it or are simply intimidated by templates, leave a message on the discussion page of the template, and place a notice at [[Help:Collections/Feedback]] and someone will look into it.
* Content and style problems, such as spelling, grammar, different varieties of English, poorly worded sentences, ...

===Fixing problems===

There are four ways to resolve issues caused by templates:

*'''Exclude templates:''' A template can be excluded from content by adding it to [[:Category:Exclude in print]].
:''Note:'' Many templates use other templates to function.  Therefore groups/types of templates can be excluded by adding the commonly used template to this category.
*'''Exclude certain specific content:''' By using [[Template:Hide in print]], certain specific content, such as a few words or an image, can be excluded from printing.&lt;blockquote&gt;{{green|This content will be printed. &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Hide in print|This content will *not* be printed.}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; This content will be printed.}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
*'''Include certain specific content only in print versions:''' The [[Template:Only in print]] can be used to insert content that shall only be visible in offline versions.&lt;blockquote&gt;{{green|This content will be printed. &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Only in print|This content will only appear in PDFs or printed books, *not* with the browser.}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; This content will be printed.}}

Content problems such as poorly worded sentences, or style problems such as variations in the citation style used, can be fixed only by editing the page.

==Multi-wiki Collections==
Using the extension it is [http://code.pediapress.com/wiki/ticket/408 currently impossible] to create a collection of content from multiple different wikis.  However, you can easily create books containing articles from multiple wikis using the [[w:bookmarklet|bookmarklet]] offered on [http://pediapress.com/collection/ this page].

[[File:Pedia-hill-2.jpg|right|250px|Printed books by PediaPress]]

Wikibooks offers users a service to order '''individually printed books''' based on collections created with the [[Help:Collections|Collection Tool]]. The service is offered in cooperation with [[w:PediaPress|PediaPress]] which is the official [[w:print on demand|print on demand]] partner of the Wikimedia Foundation.&lt;sup class=&quot;plainlinks&quot;&gt;[[wmf:Wikis_Go_Printable|[1]]]&lt;/sup&gt;

=== How to order a printed version ===
&lt;table style=&quot;background: rgb(220,220,220); float:right; margin:0px;&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr style=&quot;background: rgb(128,128,128)&quot;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;[[File:Pediapress_book_ordering_step_1.png|200px]]&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;[[File:Pediapress_book_ordering_step_2.png|200px]]&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;[[File:Pediapress_book_ordering_step_3v2.png|200px]]&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr style=&quot;background: white&quot;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;small&gt;&amp;nbsp;1) Click on [[Special:Collection|&quot;Preview with PediaPress&quot;]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;small&gt;&amp;nbsp;2) Collection gets loaded by PediaPress&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;small&gt;&amp;nbsp;3) Set up cover, choose country, get price&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr style=&quot;background: rgb(128,128,128)&quot;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;[[File:PediaPress_book_ordering_step_4.png|200px]]&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;[[File:Pediapress_book_ordering_step_5.png|200px]]&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;[[File:Pediapress_book_ordering_step_6.png|200px]]&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr style=&quot;background: white&quot;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;small&gt;&amp;nbsp;4) View preview&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;small&gt;&amp;nbsp;5) Add to cart&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;small&gt;&amp;nbsp;6) Enter shipping and billing information&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

First create your personal collections of pages as described on the [[Help:Collections|Collection Tool help page]].

Then simply click on &quot;Preview with PediaPress&quot; on the [[Special:Collection|'Show collection']] page. This uploads your collection to the PediaPress website. 
After choosing the destination country, an approximate number of pages and the price are shown. Title, subtitle, and editor can be set or changed here. Further, users can customize the cover by selecting an image from within the collection to appear on the front of the book, as well as setting a background color.

There is a preview which shows what your selected pages (only the first N pages) will look like in a printed book.  (''Note'': The typesetting and layout of printed books differs from downloadable PDFs, since the page size is half letter, not letter and it includes additional features like an index, references as footnotes, etc.)

At this point, your book can be ordered by adding it to the cart and checking out.  Available payment methods are MasterCard, Visa, and PayPal.  Softcover books are printed within 2–3 business days, hardcover or color books are printed within 15 business days, and shipping takes another 2–20 days.

=== How are books manufactured? ===
[[File:Pedia-still-5.jpg|thumb|250px|Printed Wikibooks books]]
PediaPress uses the [[TeX]] typesetting system to generate a digital pre-press reproduction. Books produced by this technique look just like conventional books. 

Book specification:
* Content
** Table of contents
** The selected pages
** Endnotes
** Licensing information 
** Index 
* Paper size: 8.5 inch × 5.5 inch (216 mm x 140 mm)
* Images are printed using the highest available resolution
* Books can contain 50 to 800 pages; larger collections are automatically evenly split up into multiple volumes

There is an [http://pediapress.com/resources/images/samplebook/samplebook.pdf example book] (PDF), which shows how printed books are typeset.

=== How much do printed books cost? ===
{| style=&quot;float:right; border:solid 1px; margin:1em;&quot;
|- 
!number of pages !! price
|-
|100 || US$&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;8.90
|-
|200 || US$ 12.90
|-
|300 || US$ 16.90
|-
|400 || US$ 20.90
|-
|500 || US$ 24.90
|-
|600 || US$ 28.90
|-
|700 || US$ 32.90
|}

Pricing for printed books depends on the number of included pages (see table). Shipping costs depend on the shipping destination. To get a detailed quote, simply upload your book to PediaPress and select your country and currency.

The [[w:Wikimedia Foundation|Wikimedia Foundation]] receives 10% of the gross total for each book sold.

=== Which shipping options are available? ===
For the US and most European destinations express shipping options are available. For most other countries in the world a standard shipping option is the default. Delivery time varies from 2 to 20 business days depending on the destination.

=== What is PediaPress? === 
PediaPress is an online service which offers customized printed books from wiki content.  The web-to-print service works on any MediaWiki which has deployed the open source [[mw:Extension:Collection|Collection Extension]]. The company actively supports the MediaWiki community and established a long-term partnership with the Wikimedia Foundation ([[wmf:Wikis Go Printable|Wikis Go Printable]]). The company was founded in 2007 and is located in Mainz, Germany. For more information see [http://pediapress.com/about/].

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Nav collection tool}}
== Printed books ==

:See [[Help:Collections/Printed books|About collections printed as books]]

== PDF export ==

=== Why are pages displayed differently than in the browser? ===
Books have no scroll bars, while a browser does, so printed content needs to be split up on several pages. To get an acceptable typesetting result, some page elements need to be displayed differently. This may result in some unexpected layouts, especially for tables and parts of wiki pages that use HTML instead of MediaWiki markup.

=== How can I improve the appearance? ===
You can edit the wiki pages themselves to make them print better. See [[Help:Collections/Advanced|Help for Experts]] for some ideas. 

== OpenDocument Text export ==

=== What is OpenDocument Text? ===
The [[w:OpenDocument|OpenDocument]] format (ODF) is an [[XML]]-based file format originally created and implemented by the [[w:OpenOffice.org|OpenOffice.org]] office suite. It is a free and open [[w:OASIS (organization)|OASIS]] standard aimed to replace the proprietary [[w:Microsoft Word|Microsoft Word]] file format.

Storing books in this format is useful if one wants to modify the books. This option allows editors to generate arbitrarily styled books with additional content. Teachers may find this useful.

=== Which software is required to open this file? === 

[[w:OpenOffice.org|OpenOffice]], [[w:KOffice|KOffice]] or others. There also is an [http://odf-converter.sourceforge.net/ ODF-AddIn] for [[w:Microsoft Word|Microsoft Word]]. Moreover, [[w:Microsoft Office 2007|Microsoft Office 2007]] with the latest service pack now supports the OpenDocument format.

== Collection tool ==

=== Where can I find stored collections? ===
All stored collections are placed in [[:Category:Collections]] and can be browsed at [[Wikibooks:Collections]].

=== How do the exports comply with license requirements? ===

==== PDF export ====
* link to each page and its version
* all contributors are mentioned
* images are linked to their image page on the wiki
* inclusion of the CC-BY-SA (English)

==== Printed books ====
* URL of each page and its version
* all contributors are mentioned
* URL of each image
* all contributors of an image are mentioned
* license name of the image is mentioned
* inclusion of the CC-BY-SA (English)

=== Can I use the collection tool with my MediaWiki installation? ===
Yes, the book tool is based on the [http://code.pediapress.com open source project mwlib]. The MediaWiki component [[mw:Extension:Collection|Collection extension]] works out of the box with most MediaWikis and the PediaPress service.

=== How do I delete my collection? ===
*If you saved your collection in your userspace (e.g. [[User:USERNAME/Collections/My book]]), you can simply request deletion by placing {{tlx|speedy|user request}} on top of the page.
*If you saved your book in the Wikibooks namespace (e.g. [[Wikibooks:Collections]]), several options are possible.
**If you created the book by mistake or as a test, place {{tlx|speedy|test page}} at the top of the page
**If you created a book, and ''no one else'' edited the book, place {{tlx|speedy|author request}} at the top of the page
**If someone else (other than [[Wikibooks:Bots|bots]]) edited the page, then you need to follow the steps listed at ''[[WB:RFD|Requests for Deletion]]'' (RFD).

== Known limitations ==

=== Skin support ===
The tool currently only works with the Monobook, Modern, and Vector skins.

=== Limitation of the book size ===
Printed books can not contain more than 500 pages, will contain 800 pages per volume (books more than 800 pages long will be split over two or more volumes). The A5 books have approximately double the number of pages than the equivalent A4 PDF.

Please keep in mind that generation of large PDFs can take a long time and results in high server load. Dividing collections into multiple books might be a solution.

=== Infoboxes and large tables ===
[[Template:Infobox|Infoboxes]] and other large tables are printed at full page size, not &quot;floated&quot; to the side as on the Web. This is a result of the limited size of A5 paper: if the infobox was shrunk to fit, the text within would be illegible. 

=== CSS &amp; HTML ===
CSS and HTML used in the wiki markup are only partially evaluated when generating PDFs. Templates can be adjusted for print to avoid some of the problems, see [[Help:Collections/Advanced|Help for Experts]] for details. 

=== TeX formulas ===

In PDF exports, math-tags are rendered as raster images and not in print-quality due to technical limitations.

== Bugs and general feedback ==
Bugs, feature requests and questions are best reported at the [[Help:Collections/Feedback|Feedback page]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Napoleon's theorem''' (so called because some people have attributed it to Napoleon Bonaparte) states that if any triangle is taken, and an equilateral triangle constructed on each side, pointing outwards, the centroids of these three triangles are the vertices of an equilateral triangle.

The theorem is easily proved by calculating the separations of the centroids and showing that they are equal.

&lt;/noinclude&gt;
PediaPress offers high-quality printed books based on wiki content and is an official partner of the [[wmf:|Wikimedia Foundation]].

Clicking the ''Order book from PediaPress'' button, will take you to the [http://pediapress.com/ website of PediaPress]. Once there you'll get a quote for your individual printed book and see a preview how it would look like.

The price depends on the number of pages. 10% of the gross sales price goes to the Wikimedia Foundation.

Books are perfectly bound with printed dimensions of 8.5 inch x 5.5 inch (216 mm x 140 mm) and contain a table of contents, your chapters and pages, licensing information, and an index.

More information on printed books can be found in the [[Help:Collections/Frequently Asked Questions|FAQ]].</text>

== How many people follow {{SUBPAGENAME}}? ==
About 800 thousand.

== Where is {{SUBPAGENAME}} practiced? ==
Wicca is practiced mainly in the United States and the United Kingdom.

== What are the main beliefs of {{SUBPAGENAME}}? ==
Wicca is a very interesting religion. It is very eclectic, meaning that there are many different versions of it. 
Most people who practice Wicca believe in spirits, mystical creatures, elements, and multiple gods and goddesses. Many women find comfort in Wicca, and one of the main reasons for this is because feminine energy and spirit is largely represented. There is even a version of Wicca that only represents female energy and spirit. As previously stated, there are many versions of Wicca. To every person who practices it, it is unique. It's like going to a candy shop with a box to hold all the candy you want in it, and you pick out only the pieces you like. Wicca is so vast, and many people only choose parts of it to practice. In Wicca, you can incorporate other religions into it. It is a very flexible religion.

== What texts does {{SUBPAGENAME}} hold sacred? ==

== What are some main holidays and practices of {{SUBPAGENAME}}? ==
Wiccans celebrate festivals which happen throughout the year. These holidays are called ''Sabbats''. One festival, called ''''Imbolc'''', is on January 31st or February 1st and is to celebrate the first day of Spring. ''''Beltane'''' is held on May 1st or April 31st.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==
A conic is a second degree polynomial. When it is expanded, you get an equation of the form:
&lt;math&gt;Ax^2 + Bxy +Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0&lt;/math&gt;. If the value of &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is zero then the conic is not rotated and sits on the x- and y- axes. If &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is non-zero, then the conic is rotated about the axes, with the rotation centred on the origin.

== Graphing ==
=== Graphing a Rotated Conic ===
If you are asked to graph a rotated conic in the form &lt;math&gt;Ax^2 + Bxy +Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0&lt;/math&gt;, it is first necessary to transform it to an equation for an identical, non-rotated conic. This is then plotted onto new axes which are drawn onto the graph. The equation for the nonrotated conic can be found by: &lt;math&gt;AX^2 + BXY +CY^2 + DX + EY + F = 0&lt;/math&gt;. Note how capital letters are used for the pronumerals. This signifies that they reperesent different values to the original equaiton.

To determine the values of X and Y, you use the formulae:
* &lt;math&gt;tan 2\theta = \frac{B}{A-C}&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;x = X cos \theta - Y sin \theta&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;y = X sin \theta + Y cos \theta&lt;/math&gt;

By substituting the new values of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; into the original equation, a new one can be obtained which represents a non-rotated conic which can be plotted on a set of axes rotated at &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; (anti-clockwise) to the original x- and y- axes. When you do this, however, it will still be necessary to determine the new rotated location of points such as the vertex, foci and directrixes. This can be done using the following formulae:
* &lt;math&gt;X = x cos \theta + y sin \theta&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;Y = -x sin \theta + y cos \theta&lt;/math&gt;
Where (X,Y) are the new rotated coordinates of the orginal point (x,y). 

The formula: &lt;math&gt;B^2 -4AC&lt;/math&gt; can be used to determine the type of conic from the original equation before you start graphing:
* &lt;math&gt;B^2 -4AC = 0&lt;/math&gt;: Parabola
* &lt;math&gt;B^2 -4AC &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt;: Ellipse
* &lt;math&gt;B^2 -4AC &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;: Hyperbola

=== Rotating a Conic ===
If you wish to rotate a conic by a certain angle, &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;, it is relatively simple. All you do is make the following substitution from the previous section:
* &lt;math&gt;x = X cos \theta - Y sin \theta&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;y = X sin \theta + Y cos \theta&lt;/math&gt;
Replacing the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; values from the function with these new ones. Then simplify the answer, and it will be a function for the same conic rotated by &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; counter-clockwise about the origin.

      <comment>/* Iterative geometric scaling */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Scaling is the process of applying linear transformations to the problem constraint matrix in order to improve its numerical properties.

The type of scaling to be deployed can be controlled using command-line options in the case of GLPSOL or via the GLPK API when calling GLPK directly from a program.

__FORCETOC__

== Overview ==

Scaling within GLPK is managed by the function &lt;tt&gt;glp_scale_prob&lt;/tt&gt;.
The original information on this page was derived from the source code comments for this function and its subsidiary functions
&lt;tt&gt;scale_prob&lt;/tt&gt;,
&lt;tt&gt;gm_scaling&lt;/tt&gt;,
&lt;tt&gt;gm_iterate&lt;/tt&gt;, and
&lt;tt&gt;eq_scaling&lt;/tt&gt;.
On that note, the GLPK codebase is well commented and a good place to look for detailed information.

Scaling in GLPK may consist of the following steps &amp;mdash;
with the respective [[w:Bitwise_OR#OR|bitwise or-able]] scaling options also shown:

* skip if the problem is well scaled : &lt;tt&gt;GLP_SF_SKIP&lt;/tt&gt;
* perform iterative geometric scaling : &lt;tt&gt;GLP_SF_GM&lt;/tt&gt;
* perform equilibration scaling : &lt;tt&gt;GLP_SF_EQ&lt;/tt&gt;
* round scale factors to nearest power of two : &lt;tt&gt;GLP_SF_2N&lt;/tt&gt;

The default scaling setting &lt;tt&gt;GLP_SF_AUTO&lt;/tt&gt; undertakes the first three steps in the order:
&lt;tt&gt;GLP_SF_SKIP&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;GLP_SF_GM&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;GLP_SF_EQ&lt;/tt&gt;.  
Use of the MIP presolver may also add &lt;tt&gt;GLP_SF_2N&lt;/tt&gt;.

Scaling normally also provides [[GLPK/Terminal_output#Scaling_output|terminal output]].
More details can be found in the 
[[GLPK/Literature#Official_GLPK_documentation|official documentation]]
or directly from the source code.

== Check whether problem is well scaled ==

The problem is considered well scaled if,

&lt;math&gt;
0.1 \leq \left|a_{i,j}\right| \leq 10, \forall a_{i,j} \neq 0
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;a_{i,j}&lt;/math&gt; is the constraint matrix coefficient for row ''i'' and column ''j''.

== Iterative geometric scaling ==

Geometric scaling can be applied equally to rows and columns.  Geometric scaling scales each row or column such that the product of the smallest and the biggest absolute value is unity.

&lt;math&gt;
a'_{i,j} = \frac{a_{i,j}}{ \sqrt{ \min(\left|a_{i,j}\right|) \times \max(\left|a_{i,j}\right|) } }
&lt;/math&gt;

Iterative geometric scalings applies geometric scaling alternatively to rows and columns until either a maximum number of iterations is reached or the  scaling does not improve significantly. The scaling quality ''r'' is defined by:

&lt;math&gt;
r = \frac{\max(\left|a_{i,j}\right|)}{\min(\left|a_{i,j}\right|)}
&lt;/math&gt;

GLPK defaults to a round-to-round improvement for ''r'' of at least 10% and a maximum of 15 rounds before termination.

== Equilibration scaling ==

Equilibration scaling can be both applied to both rows and columns.  Equilibration scaling divides each row or column by the biggest absolute value present in that row or column.

&lt;math&gt;
a'_{i,j} = \frac{a_{i,j}}{\max(\left|a_{i,j}\right|)}
&lt;/math&gt;

Equilibration scaling makes the [[w:Norm_%28mathematics%29#Maximum_norm_.28special_case_of:_infinity_norm.2C_uniform_norm.2C_or_supremum_norm.29|infinity norm]] of each row and column equal to one.

== Nearest power of two scaling ==
Scaling may produce rounding errors. These can be avoided if all scaling factors are powers of two as this will only influence the exponent and not the mantissa of the [[w:IEEE_754-2008|IEEE 754]] representation of double precision numbers.

The algorithm first iterates over all rows and then over all columns. The scaling factor each row/column is rounded to the closest power of two:

&lt;math&gt;
f \leftarrow 2 ^ { \lfloor log_2( \frac{4}{3} f ) \rfloor }
&lt;/math&gt;

== Recomputation ==

If you add or remove a row or column or modify an existing row/column, then you will need to call &lt;tt&gt;glp_scale_prob&lt;/tt&gt; again.  In the case of modification, this call may also change some row and/or column scale factors and thereby the basis matrix.  This then invalidates the current basis factorization stored in your &lt;tt&gt;glp_prob&lt;/tt&gt; object by the simplex solver, because the factorization is computed for the scaled matrix and not the original matrix.  This, however, is only a matter of efficiency (and not accuracy or stability) because, if the basis factorization becomes invalid, the simplex solver will simply compute a new basis matrix.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''A Unique Early History'''

California was originally settled by a First Nation which in its various tribes is called the Chumash. When the Spanish conquistadors entered the continent, the land became part of the Spanish empire. Father Juniper Serra pioneered a string of missions up the coast and the Catholic church was a major player inculcating the Chumash with Christianity. 

Subsequently, war broke out in Texas and swiftly engulfed the continent. A group of rebel white American settlers declared the Bear Flag Republic and seceded from Mexico, barely two weeks before the US Navy arrived at Monterey and declared US martial law. US troops marched into Mexico City and installed Santa Anna from whom the US exacted the Treaty of Guadalupe. Cash was paid for acquisition of California.

The U.S. Congress subsequently took California into the USA as a state. As a result, California has two US Senators and a House of Representatives delegation of 53, including House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. 
'''
The Gold Rush and Immigrant Scares'''

The California Gold Rush was a major influence, drawing Americans from the East and many Asians from the West. This led to a series of anti-Chinese scare which by all estimates are not a legacy of which to be proud.

'''Modernization''' 

This section is under construction. Please feel free to contribute.

'''Jumping to Modern Times'''

In the 2002 gubernatorial campaign, Democratic incumbent Gray Davis defeated Republican challenger Bill Simon.

On October 7, 2003, Davis was successfully recalled, with 55.4% of the voters supporting the recall (see results of the 2003 California recall). With a plurality of 48.6% of the vote, Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger was chosen as the new governor. Lieutenant Governor Cruz Bustamante received 31.5% of the vote, and Republican State Senator Tom McClintock received 13.5% of the vote.

Schwarzenegger began his shortened term with a soaring approval rating and soon after began implementing a conservative agenda. This initially resulted in sparring with the heavily Democratic Assembly and Senate over the state budget, battles which provided his infamous &quot;girly men&quot; comment but also began taking their toll on his approval rating. Schwarzenegger then embarked on a campaign to enact several ballot propositions in a 2005 Special Election touted as reforming California's budget system, redistricting powers, and union political fundraising. The union-led campaign spearheaded by the California Nurses Association contributed heavily to the defeat of every proposition in the Special Election. Since this conspicuous failure, Schwarzenegger has made a turn back to the left, criticizing the Bush Administration at many junctures, reviving his environmental agenda, and compromising with the legislature on the traditionally Democratic issue of education spending. His approval rating has also been revived, and he was re-elected in 2006. However continued paralysis in state government and the inability of the Legislature and Governor to work out the fundamental funding questions has resulted in voter disapproval of both the legislators and the Governor whose approval rating is among the lowest ever recorded pending the election of a successor in November, 2010.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''California Public Records Act''' (California Government Code
[http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=gov&amp;group=06001-07000&amp;file=6250-6270 §§ 6250] through 6276.48) was a law passed by the California State Legislature and signed by the Governor in 1968 mandating disclosure of governmental records to the public upon request, unless there is a specific reason not to do so. The law is similar to the Freedom of Information Act, except for the fact that &quot;the people have the right of access to information concerning the conduct of the people's business&quot; is enshrined in Article 1 of the California Constitution due to California Proposition 59 (the Sunshine Amendment).

==Purpose==
When the legislature enacted CPRA, it expressly declared that &quot;access to information concerning the conduct of the people's business is a fundamental and necessary right of every person in this state.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Cal. Gov't Code § 6250.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, in California &quot;access to government records has been deemed a fundamental interest of citizenship&quot;&lt;ref&gt;CBS v. Block, 42 Cal. 3d 646, 652 n.5, 230 Cal. Rptr. 362, 725 P. 2d 370 (1986).&lt;/ref&gt; and has emphasized that &quot;maximum disclosure of the conduct of governmental operations [is] to be promoted by the act.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Id. at 651-52 (emphasis added).&lt;/ref&gt; By promoting prompt public access to government records, the CPRA is &quot;intended to safeguard the accountability of government to the public.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Register Div. of Freedom Newspapers Inc. v. County of Orange, 158 Cal. App. 3d 893, 901, 205 Cal. Rptr. 92 (1984).&lt;/ref&gt; As the California Supreme Court recognized in CBS v. Block:

{{quote|Implicit in a democratic process is the notion that government should be accountable for its actions. In order to verify accountability, individuals must have access to government files. Such access permits checks against the arbitrary exercise of official power and secrecy in the political process.&lt;ref&gt;Id. at 651.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Public records and exemptions==
In accordance with this policy, public records are broadly defined to include &quot;any writing containing information relating to the conduct of a public's business prepared, owned, used or retained by any state or local agency regardless of physical form or characteristic[.]&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Cal. Gov't. Code § 6252(e).&lt;/ref&gt; Citing with approval an even broader definition of public records adopted by the California Attorney General, another court has stated:

{{quote|This definition is intended to cover every conceivable kind of record that is involved in the governmental process and will pertain to any new form of record-keeping instrument as it is developed. Only purely personal information unrelated to 'the conduct of the public's business' could be considered exempt from this definition, i.e., the shopping list phoned from home, the letter to a public officer from a friend which is totally void of reference to governmental activities.&lt;ref&gt;San Gabriel Tribune v. Superior Court, 143 Cal. App. 3d 762, 774; 192 Cal. Rptr. 415, 422 (1983)(internal citations omitted); see also Versaci v. Superior Court, 127 Cal. App. 4th 805, 813, 26 Cal. Rptr. 3d 92 (2005)(quoting Coronado Police Officers Ass'n v. Carroll, 106 Cal. App. 4th 1001, 1006, 131 Cal. Rptr. 2d 553 (2003)(citing with approval same definition)).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Moreover, unless the public records of a local agency are exempt from the provisions of the CPRA, they must be made available for public inspection.&lt;ref&gt;Williams v. Superior Court, 5 Cal. 4th 337, 346, 19 Cal. Rptr. 2d 882, 852 P.2d 377 (1993).&lt;/ref&gt;  Exemptions must be narrowly construed and the public agency bears the burden of proving that an exemption applies.&lt;ref&gt;Bakersfield City School Dist. v. Superior Court, 118 Cal. App. 4th 1041, 1045, 13 Cal. Rptr. 3d 517 (2004); CSU Fresno Association v. Superior Court, 90 Cal.App.4th 810, 831, 108 Cal. Rptr. 2d 870 (2001); see also Lorig v. Medical Bd., 78 Cal. App. 4th 462, 467, 92 Cal. Rptr. 2d 862 (2000); County of Los Angeles v. Superior Court, 82 Cal. App. 4th 819, 825, 98 Cal. Rptr. 2d 564 (2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the exemptions under the CPRA are set forth under Section 6254 and are specific as to certain records or types of records, but under Section 6255 a general exemption exists where, on the facts of the particular case, &quot;the public interest served by not making the record public clearly outweighs the public interest served by disclosure of the record.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Cal. Gov't Code § 6255 (commonly called the &quot;catch all&quot; exemption).&lt;/ref&gt; In reviewing the propriety of an agency decision to withhold records, a court is charged with ascertaining whether nondisclosure was justified under either of these statutes.&lt;ref&gt;Cal. Gov't Code § 6259(b).&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the CPRA was modeled after the federal Freedom of Information Act (&quot;FOIA&quot;), 5 U.S.C. Section 552 et seq, courts may look to case law under FOIA in construing the CPRA.&lt;ref&gt;See Times Mirror Co. v. Superior Court, 53 Cal. 3d 1325, 1338, 283 Cal. Rptr. 893, 813 P.2d 240 (1991); ACLU v. Deukmejian, 32 Cal. 3d 440, 447, 186 Cal. Rptr. 235, 651 P.2d 822 (1982); but see Williams, 5 Cal. 4th at 348-54 (holding that CPRA's exemption for law enforcement investigatory records did not incorporate FOIA criteria and thus courts cannot look to FOIA cases to interpret Section 6254(f) of the CPRA, but must look to the statutory language of the CPRA provision to construe the statute).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Orders and appeals==
To facilitate prompt public access to public records, court orders either directing disclosure of public records or supporting an agency's decision of nondisclosure are immediately reviewable by an appellate court by way of an emergency petition seeking issuance of an extraordinary writ.&lt;ref&gt;Cal. Gov't Code § 6259(c).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, the California Supreme Court made clear that under this writ procedure, trial court orders are reviewable on their merits.&lt;ref&gt;Times Mirror Co., 53 Cal. 3d at 1336; see also State Bd. of Equalization v. Superior Court, 10 Cal. App. 4th 1177, 1185, 13 Cal. Rptr. 2d 342 (1992) (echoing the decision in Times Mirror and stating that the scope of review by a writ of review is equivalent with the scope of review on appeal).&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, when a trial court order under the CPRA is reviewed by an appellate court, the independent review standard is employed for legal issues and factual findings made by the trial court will be upheld if they are based on substantial evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Times Mirror Co., 53 Cal. 3d at 1336 (citing Block, 42 Cal. 3d at 650-51).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <comment>/* Mandatory referendum */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">
In California, a ballot is a proposed law that is submitted to the electorate for approval in a direct vote (or plebiscite). It may take the form of a constitutional amendment or an ordinary statute. A ballot proposition may be proposed by the California State Legislature or by a petition signed by members of the public under the initiative system. In California a vote on a measure referred to voters by the legislature is a mandatory referendum; a vote to veto a law that has already been adopted by the legislature is an optional referendum or &quot;people's veto&quot;; the process of proposing laws by petition is the initiative.

==Overview==

Referenda have been a part of the Constitution of California since 1849. The initiative and optional (or facultative) referendum were introduced in 1911, by a constitutional amendment called California Proposition 7 (1911). There are three forms of direct democracy in California.

===Mandatory referendum===

The State Legislature may pass an act which is signed by the Governor of California, proposing a state constitutional amendment, which is then submitted to the voters as a referendum at the next statewide election. If more than 50% of the voters approve the referendum then the constitutional amendment is approved and goes into effect.

===Optional referendum===

Laws already adopted by the state legislature may be vetoed by means of a referendum. To qualify a referendum for inclusion on the ballot, a referendum petition must have been signed by at least five per cent of the number of voters in the previous gubernatorial election. This is also known as a &quot;petition referendum&quot; or &quot;people's veto&quot;.

===Initiative===

A ballot proposition enacted by the initiative process may alter the State constitution, or amend the ordinary laws of the state, or do both. An initiative is brought about by writing a proposed law as a petition, and submitting the petition to the [[California Attorney General along with a submission fee (in 2004 this was $200), and obtaining signatures on petitions from registered voters amounting to 8% (for a constitutional amendment) or 5% (for a statute) of the number of people who voted in the most recent election for governor.  The signed petitions are then sent to the Secretary of State of California for validation of signatures.

Due to duplicate signing or invalid signatures, usually at least 50% more than the legal minimum number of signatures are collected to compensate for possible invalidated signatures.  If the number of validated signatures is more than the minimum number required, the proposed initiative measure is submitted to the voters, similar to a referendum as noted above.  If the proposition is approved by more than 50% of all voters who vote, it becomes a part of the state constitution (if it is a proposed amendment) or the state's statutes (if it is a proposed statute) in the same manner and having the same legal effect as if it had been passed by the state legislature and signed by the governor.

In order to pass, the &quot;yes&quot; votes on a proposition must exceed the &quot;no&quot; votes. Ballots which record neither a &quot;yes&quot; nor a &quot;no&quot; on the proposition are ignored in determining the outcome. In other words, the majority of voters required for passage refers to a majority of those voting on that proposition, rather than a majority of those voting in the election held at the same time or a majority of those who are registered to vote.

Originally, initiative and referendum petitions were given a number starting at one each year.  This tended to be confusing as often famous initiatives such as California Proposition 13(of 1978) might be confused with another initiative in a later year if there were more than twelve proposals on the ballot in any given year.  Starting in 1982, the proposition numbers were not re-used but would continue to increment until at least a decade had passed from when a particular one had appeared on the ballot, eventually resulting in proposition numbers exceeding 200.  Starting with the 1998 ballot, the count has been reset back to one; it will now be reset every ten years.&lt;ref name=&quot;California Attorney General's Office&quot;&gt;[http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/ballot-measures/initiative-guide.htm California Attorney General's Office] Initiative Guide&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{nutshell|Government agencies have formal provision for public comment in response to proposed rules and finalization of official reports as well as opportunities to address agencies as part of public meetings. Various customs and rules apply at Federal, state, county, regional,inter-agency and local levels of executive, legislative and judicial branches, but they are all integral parts of  free speech provisions of constitutional democracy.}}

==Introduction==
'''Public comment''' is a specific term of art used by various government agencies in the United States, a constitutional democracy, in several circumstances. It is sometimes called &quot;''vox populi''&quot;. Generally these circumstances are open public meetings of government bodies which set aside time for oral public comments, or comments, usually upon documents. Such documents may either be reports such as Draft Environmental Impact Reports (DEIR's) or new regulations. There is typically a notice which is posted on the web and mailed to more or less ad hoc lists of interested parties known to the government agencies. If there is to be a change of regulations, there will be a formal notice of proposed rulemaking. &lt;P&gt;The basis for public comment is found in general political theory of constitutional democracy as originated during and after the French Enlightenment, particularly by Rousseau &lt;ref&gt;Jean-Jaques Rousseau, The Social Contract, late 1700's, Public Domain&lt;/ref&gt;. This basis was elaborated in the American Revolution, and various thinkers such as Franklin, Jefferson &lt;ref&gt;Declaration of Independence, Jefferson et al, 1776&lt;/ref&gt;and Thomas Paine &lt;Ref&gt; Common Sense, Thomas Paine, late 1700's, public domain.&lt;/ref&gt;are associated with the rejection of tyrannical, closed government decision making in favor of open government. The tradition of the New England Town Hall is believed to be rooted in this early American movement, and the distillation of formal public comment in official proceedings is a direct application of this format in the workings of public administration itself. 

==Overview: The Two Types of Public Comment==

Public comment embedded in actual meetings is typical of meetings convened by legislative or executive bodies; judicial units do not have public comment, but rather testimony from witnesses and procedural statements from attorneys. Public units such as city councils or county legislative bodies are typical examples of legislative public comment hearing bodies. Note that comment may be written, oral, or electronic. 

There are two types of comment period. One is when comment goes to a specific agenda item. Secondly there is a class of public comment which pertains to items which are not on the agenda for that day. However, it is necessary that comments be restricted to matters within the jurisdiction of the government body.

This latter requirement is seldom enforced except in those unusual cases in which commentators have set themselves at odds with policy makers and have been designated as a nuisance. In such cases, there are usually more explicit reasons given for restricting the rights of such speakers, however most undesirable comments tend to be outside the scope of legislative jurisdiction. The above distinction between agenda-item public comment and what is called &quot;General Public Comment&quot; pertains both to legislative type bodies as well as executive agencies. These are typically commissions, committees or boards. There are typically public comment periods during meetings of agencies such as city councils, county boards, and agencies which are concerned with matters such as water quality, fish and game, sewer runoff management and transportation. Time limits frequently range from one to five minutes for unscheduled presentations. It is not typical to require that the person commenting be a resident, a registered voter, a qualified elector, or even a citizen, simply that they be present and able to speak.

A whole different class of public comment is requested by agencies which are seeking input on draft policy documents such as Environmental Impact Reports which provide information which may be used in policy determinations by their own agency and other agencies at various levels of government.Typically there is a notice of completion of the draft which is posted in the newspaper, on the web, and is mailed to known interested parties who may be designated as &quot;stakeholders&quot; or simply &quot;interested parties&quot;. A public comment period is established and comments which are received by the cutoff date become part of the official public record. In some cases, there is a statutory mandate that those comments be replied to or incorporated in some fashion into the Final document.

==Oral public comment at public meetings ==

Comments provided at public meetings may be oral or written and not infrequently utilize audio visual aids such as thumb drives, CDs or overhead projectors (transparencies or opaque material). They may include video clips. A laser pointer, such as used by professional presenters, is useful but seldom utilized except by scheduled presenters on preset agendas, who are often credentialed professionals hired by the government agency to produce reports or provide consultation.

Public comment in some cases includes remarks from experts or public officials with some role in the issue at stake, but at a different time or level of process. Typically these kinds of comments may be ad hoc, not solicited by the governing agency which is conducting the hearing. There may be informal expectation that such a party may comment, but if it is an interested agency then there will be prior notification and a larger chunk of time may be allowed to such presenters. Surprisingly, however, these knowledgeable high level speakers, including office holders, often are limited to the same time constriction and queuing requirements as all other public commentors. They simply wait in line, their name is called when their speaker slip happens to come to the top of the pile, and they are subject to being cut off after their two minutes or three minutes are up.This equalization between expert and lay commentator is an example of social leveling which occurs in democratic process and which is often harshly criticized by elitist theorists such as Machiavellians, fascists, communist technocrats and other conservative social thinkers.

Persons preparing public comment often think about and express the value of the constitutional protection and a certain level of gratitude for the opportunity to speak. Such expressions are considered good etiquette the first few times a speaker presents to a board, and it is also common to state one's background, credentials, or interest. Persons who speak frequently to a particular agency become better known and typically refrain from repeating such formalities to excess, and may go directly into their substantive testimony.

==Variation of official attitude toward public meeting comment ==

In constitutional democracies which permit public comment, meeting facilitators can be relaxed, friendly and informal, allowing for errors on the part of public speakers such as exceeding allowable time. In some cases they are strict in enforcement of rules and may make somewhat hostile remarks to speakers. This attitude may be a result of prior episodes in which public commenters may have expressed accusations or hostility to seated officials. Frequently, such remarks result in warnings and may escalate to the point that the meeting chair may not recognize the public speaker and refuse to allow access to the microphone. Less frequently, speakers who are out of order are ordered to leave, escorted out of the building, or, rarely, placed under arrest for trespass or other charges. However, most government agencies in the United States are reluctant to resort to such measures, which may be viewed as restricting free speech protection of the US and various state constitutions. They may also result in litigation and in some cases do. For instance, Robert Norse filed suit against the City of Santa Cruz when he made a Nazi style straight arm salute to the Santa Cruz City Council as a protest for council not permitting one additional public speaker who had not put in a speaker's slip and would have exceeded the amount of time allowed for public comment. The suit, typical of a possible consequence of not permitting public comment, is based upon Title 42 Section 1983 of the US Code, and alleges that city council violated his First Amendment right to free speech by having him arrested for refusing to leave as ordered in response to his gesture. &lt;ref&gt;Norse vs. City of Santa Cruz, US District Court, North Central District, Public Record&lt;/ref&gt;

Some states and regions may differ widely in their policies and procedures with regard to public comment, ranging from the extremes of anarchist collectives in twentieth century Spain, in which many routine decisions were made by workers councils, to dictatorships in which making a comment on the performance of government officials can be proscribed by law as tantamount to slander or provoking insurrection. In such systems, even the very idea of exposure to risk of prosecution deters the flow of information needed for the system's self rationalization process, resulting in stifled innovation, accumulated inefficiencies, decline of group morale and trust levels, with  eventual system collapse.

Liberalized systems also typically proscribe slander, fabrications and personal attacks, however defined, and public commenters are discouraged from engaging in back and forth discussion with board or committee members. Comments which are directed from the floor towards persons who have the floor are generally classified as heckling.

==Public comment in authoritarian systems==
Authoritarian systems generally tend to take a dim view of public comment. In the writings of Benito Mussolini, he expressed the view that fascism offers &quot;free&quot; speech, but only to persons who were &quot;qualified&quot; to have an opinion.&lt;ref&gt; Readings on Fascism and National Socialism Selected by members of the department of philosophy, University of Colorado Contents The Doctrine of Fascism by Benito Mussolini&lt;/ref&gt;Similarly, in the historical development of Nazism, public commentators at official NSDAP rallies were not infrequently beaten by the mob, or, if there were large numbers supporting the adverse commentator, brawls broke out. &lt;ref&gt;&quot;Goebbels&quot; by Ralf Georg Reuth&lt;/ref&gt;today's People's Republic of China, public comment on government policy is considered inappropriate, and may result in long prison terms for persons such as Wei Jin Sheng.

==Public comment as an aid to editing of government publications==

As indicated above, there is a separate and distinct form of public comment, in the US, does not occur at meetings but is solicited in written or electronic form prior to a set deadline. This type of comment may pertain to an intended action, such as permit issuance, or the classification of a particular species of plant or animal as endangered. Other instances occur with regard to publication of draft environmental impact reports, which comments are then answered and may be reflected in subsequent revisions to the document. These public comments are often posted on the web in advance of the deadline, which provides commentators with an opportunity to view the remarks of others before committing themselves in writing. 

This type of comment process may be mandated in legislation or in regulations enforcing statutes such as the National Environmental Protection Act (NEPA) or California's Cxxxx Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). Triggering events may include development proposals, mandated master plan updates or discovery of an endangered species. The NIH requested and received massive public comment pertaining to its own openness to its generally sophisticated public, and they did a thorough job of analyzing the voluminous submissions which is posted on their website. &lt;ref&gt;http://publicaccess.nih.gov/analysis_of_comments_nih_public_access_policy.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

A government portal which may be useful allows review of comments and opportunity for making comment and can be searched by keyword&lt;ref&gt;http://www.regulations.gov/#!home&lt;/ref&gt;.
The keyword search crosses different government agencies and has drop-downs permitting a boolean exclusion algorithm narrowing the focus between alternative choices such as documents, rules, notice of proposed rule changes, etcetera.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Marine Life Protection Act''' (MLPA) was passed in 1999 and is part of the California Fish and Game Code. The MLPA requires California to reevaluate all existing marine protected areas (MPAs) and potentially design new MPAs that together function as a statewide network. The MLPA has clear guidance associated with the development of this MPA network. MPAs are developed on a regional basis with MLPA and MPA specific goals in mind, and are evaluated over time to assess their effectiveness for meeting these goals.

==Overview==
Unlike terrestrial conservation, marine conservation often lacks a systematic approach to conserving biodiversity&lt;ref name=&quot;Gleason&quot;&gt;Gleason, Mary G. et al. 2006. Assessing gaps in marine conservation in California. ''Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment''. 4: 249-258.&lt;/ref&gt;. Little gap analysis has been performed on the marine environment, and there is a lack of knowledge into what is protected, what needs to be protected, and where the protection needs to occur&lt;ref name=&quot;Gleason&quot;/&gt;.  Over the last century there has been a rapid increase in the loss of marine biodiversity and habitat degradation. About 70% of California's population lives within one hour of the coast and the ocean provides resources to local, state, and national interests. As a result, species and habitat loss has become a major issue. Over 90% of California's coastal wetlands have been lost, coastal waters have become contaminated with a variety of urban and agricultural toxins, and a large number of targeted species have declined in the last 10–20 years&lt;ref name=&quot;Gleason&quot;/&gt;. Over the last two decades, California fish catches have decreased by over 50%&lt;ref name=&quot;Avasthi&quot;&gt;Avasthi, Amitabh. 2005. California tries to connect its scattered marine reserves. ''Science''. 305: 487-489.&lt;/ref&gt;. These impacts have decreased the health and value of the California's coastal ocean and imply a need for a more systematic approach to marine conservation&lt;ref name=&quot;Gleason&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Avasthi&quot;&gt;Avasthi, Amitabh. 2005. California tries to connect its scattered marine reserves. ''Science''. 305: 487-489.&lt;/ref&gt;. Although there is no single solution to conserving the marine environment, MPAs are a potentially valuable tool for marine conservation when designed and managed effectively. A well designed and managed network of MPAs helps to prevent degradation, fosters marine biodiversity, and may maintain a more sustainable fishing industry&lt;ref name=&quot;Avasthi&quot;/&gt;. The MLPA helps to promote a shift from single-species management to an ecosystem based management and is a more systematic approach to marine conservation.

==A Brief History of California MPAs==
California’s first six MPAs were created between 1909 and 1913; by 1950 all had been removed. After 1950 more than 50 other MPAs were created along the California coast. But these MPAs were established in a random manner and without regard to regional conservation goals&lt;ref name=&quot;CDFG&quot;&gt;CDFG. 2004. Marine Life Protection Act: sections 2850-2863. Sacramento, CA: California Department of Fish and Game, Marine Region.&lt;/ref&gt;. Most have been thought to be too small and ineffective in protecting against habitat and species loss&lt;ref name=&quot;Gleason&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Avasthi&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CDFG&quot;&gt;CDFG. 2004. Marine Life Protection Act: sections 2850-2863. Sacramento, CA: California Department of Fish and Game, Marine Region.&lt;/ref&gt;. With these existing MPAs less than 1% of coastal waters were protected, and none extended to deeper waters&lt;ref name=&quot;Gleason&quot;/&gt;. In 1999 the MLPA was created in order to re-evaluate the current MPA system and to establish a better network of MPAs that would be more effective in protecting against habitat and species loss.

==The Marine Life Protection Act==
[http://www.dfg.ca.gov/MRD/mlpa/mlpa_language.pdf The Marine Life Protection Act language as amended to July 2004] 
===MLPA Findings===
The MLPA found that existing MPAs were not created under a coherent plan or scientific guidelines, and that there is a need to redesign the MPA system. Coastal development, water pollution, and other human activities are a threat to California’s diverse coastal waters. These coastal waters, along with the ecosystems and species which thrive within them are vital assets to the state and nation. An improved MPA system would help protect against habitat and ecosystem loss, conserve biological diversity, provide safe breeding grounds for fish and other marine species, improve research opportunities, create a reference point from which the rest of the ocean can be compared against, and may help to re-grow depleted fisheries&lt;ref name=&quot;CDFG&quot;/&gt;.

===MPA Network===
The MLPA appointed the California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG) with the task of developing and managing a network of MPAs. The CDFG determines the final location and size of each MPA. The goal is to establish a network of MPAs that work together. This network takes into account the movement of adult and larval fish and also focuses on deepwater habitats for the first time&lt;ref name=&quot;Avasthi&quot;/&gt;. A proportion of the MPA network is to be designated as no-take zones. No-take zones allow for a large area of safe breeding grounds and a sanctuary for large, female fish. Large female fish produce more viable offspring and are vital in a population&lt;ref name=&quot;Palumi&quot;&gt;Palumbi, S.R. 2004. Why Mothers Matter. ''Nature'' 430: 621-622.&lt;/ref&gt;. With this idea, the MPA network has the potential to boost fish populations in areas out side of MPAs. Fishery growth has been successful along the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary after reserves were established in these areas&lt;ref name=&quot;Avasthi&quot;/&gt;. The final decision of the size and location of the MPAs depends on the species and habitats effected, stakeholder and conservation goals, and how each individual MPA will function on its own and as part of the network.

===MLPA Implementation===
After its passage in 1999, the CDFG began to implement the MLPA. The first attempt involved a Master Plan Team which included primarily scientific experts and governmental agencies, with little input from local [[Stakeholder analysis|stakeholders]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Weible&quot;&gt;Weible, Christopher. et al. 2004. A comparison of a collaborative and top-down approach to the use of science in policy: establishing marine protected areas in California. ''The Policies Study Journal''. 32: 187-207.
&lt;/ref&gt;. This plan failed once it was brought to the public for approval, mostly because stakeholders and other members of the public were excluded from the process. Commercial and recreational fishers showed the most resistance, stating that MPAs produce no benefits for fisheries and objecting to the size and location of the proposed MPAs&lt;ref name=&quot;Avasthi&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Weible&quot;&gt;Weible, Christopher. et al. 2004. A comparison of a collaborative and top-down approach to the use of science in policy: establishing marine protected areas in California. ''The Policies Study Journal''. 32: 187-207.
&lt;/ref&gt;. In 2002, the CDFG implemented the MLPA for a second time. This plan involved members from the Master Plan Team, as well as seven Working Stakeholder Groups, which included governmental agency officials, recreational and commercial fishing interests, recreational divers, ocean vessel representatives, environmental interests, charter boat operators, harbormasters, and scientists/educators&lt;ref name=&quot;Weible&quot;&gt;Weible, Christopher. et al. 2004. A comparison of a collaborative and top-down approach to the use of science in policy: establishing marine protected areas in California. ''The Policies Study Journal''. 32: 187-207.
&lt;/ref&gt;. This attempt was more successful and gained public support, but the project lost funding in 2003 due to a poor fiscal year. 

In 2004 the CDFG gained new funding from several organizations to initiate the Marine Life Protection Act Initiative. The Initiative divided the coast into sequential regions and assembled a Blue Ribbon Task Force on Marine Protected Areas, Science Advisory Team, and Regional Stakeholder Group to develop and evaluate the first set of MPAs in the Central Coast region&lt;ref name=&quot;Avasthi&quot;/&gt;. On April 13, 2007, after nearly three years of public meetings and proposal reviews, the Fish and Game Commission evaluated and voted on a final MPA proposal for the Central California coast. The commission voted on a plan to establish 29 MPAs covering approximately 204 square miles (18%) of state waters with 85 square miles (8%) designated as no-take state marine reserves&lt;ref name=&quot;CDFG 2007&quot;&gt;CDFG. 2007. Marine Life Protection Act initiative: commission gives final approval for Central Coast marine protected areas. [http://www.dfg.ca.gov/MRD/mlpa/ccmpas.html]. Viewed 22 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;. The network ranges from Pigeon Point in San Mateo County south to Point Conception in Santa Barbara County, and contains several types of MPAs with varying degrees of protection. Central coast MPA regulations will be effective starting summer 2007&lt;ref name=&quot;CDFG 2007&quot;&gt;CDFG. 2007. Marine Life Protection Act initiative: commission gives final approval for Central Coast marine protected areas. [http://www.dfg.ca.gov/MRD/mlpa/ccmpas.html]. Viewed 22 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;. 

The Central Coast plan has received high marks for scientific effectiveness.  Local stakeholders developed a balanced network that protects the region’s best habitat, including parts of the Big Sur Coast and Monterey Bay, while allowing continued access to most recreational and commercial fishing grounds.  California’s new Central Coast MPAs went into effect in September 2007 and scientific baseline data has been collected over the last two years.

The North Central Coast plan, adopted by the Fish and Game Commission on August 5, 2009, also represented a compromise between different interest groups, and protected iconic sites like the Farallon Islands, Point Reyes Headlands, and Bodega Head while leaving nearly 90 percent of coastal waters open for fishing.  Regulations for the North Central Coast MPAs, which extend from Alder Creek, near Pt. Arena in Mendocino County, to Pigeon Point in San Mateo County, went into effect on May 1, 2010. The regulations established 21 marine protected areas (MPAs), three State Marine Recreational Management Areas, and six special closures, in total covering approximately 153 square miles (20.1%) of state waters in the north central coast study region. Approximately 86 square miles (11%) of the 153 square miles are designated as &quot;no take&quot; state marine reserves, while different take allowances providing varying levels of protection are designated for the rest.

In 2008, South Coast Regional Stakeholders began a public planning process to design the part of the statewide MPA network that spans from Pt. Conception in Santa Barbara county to the U.S. border with Mexico. On Dec. 15, 2010 the CA Fish and Game Commission adopted regulations to create 36 new MPAs encompassing approximately 187 square miles (8 percent) of state waters in the study region. Approximately 116 square miles (4.9 percent) have been designated as no-take state marine reserves (82.5 square miles/3.5 percent) and no-take state marine conservation areas (33.5 square miles/1.4 percent), with the remainder designated as state marine conservation areas with different take allowances and varying levels of protection. Implementation of the new South Coast MPAs will take place in mid 2011.

The North Coast region, which stretches from Point Arena to the Oregon border, concluded the stakeholder planning process in August 2010.  Stakeholders developed a unified proposal for their regional MPA network supported by fishermen, conservationists, and tribal representatives.  The unified plan will be considered by the Fish and Game Commission beginning in 2011.

===The Science===
An extensive body of peer-reviewed studies on marine protected areas have concluded that well-designed networks of protected waters are effective in improving ocean health and making ocean waters more resilient&lt;ref name=&quot;Halpern&quot;&gt;Halpern, Benjamin S. et al. 2010.  Placing marine protected areas onto the ecosystem-based management seascape. ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States''.&lt;/ref&gt;.  Most recently, the February 2010 issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) included several new studies that showed that scientifically-based MPA networks have a net positive impact on both ecosystem productivity and associated fisheries. One of the studies found that such well-designed networks can simultaneously improve the quality of ocean habitat, increase the size and abundance of sea life, and increase fishing yields and profits. &lt;ref name=&quot;Gaines&quot;&gt;Gaines, Steven. et al. 2010.  Designing marine reserve networks for both conservation and fisheries management. ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States''.&lt;/ref&gt; Several studies have stressed the importance of location: The location of protected areas is important. In order to be effective, marine reserves must be placed in the areas where fish and shellfish feed and breed&lt;ref name=&quot;Halpern&quot;&gt;Halpern, Benjamin S. et al. 2010.  Placing marine protected areas onto the ecosystem-based management seascape. ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States''.&lt;/ref&gt;.


===MLPA Controversy / Conflict of Interest Investigation===
The MLPA Initiative recently began to receive negative press from fishing rights groups and individual fishermen due to the apparent conflict of interest of some MPA officials and unfair practices in the MLPA process&lt;ref name=&quot;Holland&quot;&gt;Richard Holland. 2009. Rules Disregarded, Changed. [http://www.wonews.com/Blog.aspx?id=608&amp;AuthorID=59062&amp;t=BLATANT%20FRAUD]. Viewed 29 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;. On May 14, 2009, Fish and Game Commission Member Jim Kellogg called for the Commission to put the MLPA process on hold due to the state budget crisis. Senate Majority Leader Dean Florez and North Coast Assemblyman Wes Chesbro requested investigation into conflicts of interest among Blue Ribbon Task Force members as well as sources of funding for the MLPA.&lt;ref name=&quot;Indy Bay&quot;&gt;Indy Bay. 2009. Jim Kellogg Asks Commission to Put MLPA Process on Hold. [http://www.indybay.org/newsitems/2009/05/15/18595079.php]. Viewed 29 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 19, 2009, the California Fair Political Practices Commission (CFPPC) disclosed that the Enforcement Division of the Fair Political Practices Commission has started a formal investigation into Fish and Game Commissioner George Michael Sutton, under charge of having violated the Political Reform Act (PRA) of 1974 due his conflicts of interest on votes on the MLPA while serving on the Fish and Game Commission.&lt;ref name=&quot;Earthtimes.org&quot;&gt;Earth Times. 2009.

On June 24, after investigating the matter, the Fair Political Practices Commission (FPPC) declared that Commissioner Sutton can participate in any and all public processes and deliberations surrounding the Marine Life Protection Act (MLPA) without conflict.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

=== MPLA process winds up ===

Despite staunch opposition from fishermen whose livelihood might be impacted, the final brushstrokes were put on the MPLA process at the Santa Barbara meeting in late 2010. Despite signifigant input from the industry, many of the provisions would apparently impact economically viable fisheries. Representatives indicated that they intend to file litigation with respect to one or more possible improprieties in the process. On the other hand, many contended that there was an unprecedented level of public involvement which provides a solid foundation of legitimation of the process.

Much of the criticism centered on putative irregularities with respect to the Blue Ribbon committee of experts. Specifically, it is alleged by many that the commission did not conform to the Brown Act and conducted some of its activities via informal meetings which nevertheless did cover public policy matters which the Act would require to have been public. The other side contends that there were never substantive disposition of issues at any such contacts and that they never met in quorum. 

It remains to be seen to what extent the industry will shrug off lingering resentment of the imperfections in the process and the outcome and to what extent there may be continuing litigation, non-compliance, or attempts to repeal or modify the MPLA as enacted. There are some who argue that the management of fisheries will benefit the industry long term, and possibly that viewpoint will gain traction going forward. Nevertheless, it is clear that there is significant disatisfaction within the fishing towns and it is unclear whether those views will taper or increase as the 2011 election season approaches. 

Much was said of the putative involvement of &quot;Hewlett Packard money&quot; and there is a perception that environmental interests are well funded by endowments of various kinds which are insensitive to the needs or working people. Sentiment against environmentalism runs high even in communities which pride themselves on maintaining high standards with respect to environmental stewardship. A similar dynamic occurs with respect to Coastal Commission regulation, in which agricultural interest bitterly contest permitting requirements which constrain crop rotation. 

If environmental successes provoke significant backlash, they may find many of their gains being reversed if the State Legislature switches to Republican, or if Democratic party leaders mitigate their environmental policies. It will be interesting to note to what extent political campaigns in 2011 bring out dissatisfaction with environmental controls such as the MLPA. Some business interests, such as residential realtors and tourism, are solidly in support of environmentalism. When the campaign dollars flow, perhaps those kinds of businesses will support candidates with strong Sierra Club endorsements, offsetting loss of votes and financial support such candidates may receive from fishing, agriculture and developers.

The '''Independent Media Center''' (a.k.a. '''Indymedia''' or '''IMC''') is a global Open publishing|participatory network of journalists that report on political and social issues. It originated during the Seattle WTO Ministerial Conference of 1999 protest activity|anti-WTO protests worldwide in 1999 and remains closely associated with the global justice movement, which criticizes neo-liberalism and its associated institutions. Indymedia uses an open publishing and democratic media process that allows anybody to contribute.

According to its homepage, &quot;Indymedia is a collective of independent media organizations and hundreds of journalists offering grassroots, non-corporate coverage. Indymedia is a democratic media outlet for the creation of radical, accurate, and passionate tellings of truth.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indymedia.org/en/index.shtml Indymedia global home page]&lt;/ref&gt; Indymedia was founded as an alternative to government and corporate media, and seeks to facilitate people being able to publish their media as directly as possible.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hanni&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Haas|first=Tanni|date=1 July 2007|title=Do citizen-based media of communication advance public journalism's ideals?

==Overview==
The first Indymedia project was started in late November 1999 to report on protests against the WTO Ministerial Conference of 1999 protest activity|WTO meeting that took place in Seattle, Washington|Seattle, Washington (U.S. state)|Washington, and to act as an alternative media source.&lt;ref&gt;[http://seattle.indymedia.org/en/1999/11/2.shtml First ever Indymedia post, made November 24, 1999]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dead link|date=February 2010}} This followed a successful experiment in June that year, reporting the events of the Carnival Against Capitalism in London, UK. The Media team there used software and unmediated reports from protest participants.&lt;ref&gt;Anonymous, &quot;June 18th 1999 Carnival Against Capital&quot;, in Days of Dissent!, 2004, accessed online at http://web.archive.org/web/20050508150407/daysofdissent.org.uk/j18.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The open publishing script was first developed by video activists in Sydney, Australia.

After Seattle the idea and network spread rapidly. By 2002, there were 89 Indymedia websites covering 31 countries (and the Palestinian territories),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://indymedia.org/ |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20020901125639/http://indymedia.org/ |archivedate=2002-09-01 |title= Wayback Machine - indymedia.org circa September 1, 2002 |accessdate=2008-04-05 |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt; growing to over 150 by January 2006, not all of them currently active. Indymedia websites publish in a number of languages, including English, Spanish, German, Italian, Portuguese, French, Russian, Arabic and Hebrew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://docs.indymedia.org/Global/FrequentlyAskedQuestionEn#languages |date=25 July 2007|title=Indymedia's Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)  |publisher=Indymedia Documentation Project |accessdate=2009-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IMC collectives distribute Printing|print, sound reproduction|audio, photo, and video media, but are most well known for their open publishing newswires, sites where anyone with internet access can publish news from their own perspective. The content of an IMC is determined by its participants, both the users who post content, and members of the local Indymedia collective who administer the site. While Indymedias worldwide are run autonomously and differ according to the concerns of their users, they share a commitment to provide copyleft content. The general rule is that content on Indymedia sites can be freely reproduced for non-commercial purposes.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://docs.indymedia.org/view/Global/PrinciplesOfUnity IMC &quot;Principles of Unity&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Indymedia sites run on a number of free software platforms, many developed especially for the purpose; these include DadaIMC, Mir, Oscait, Active, SF-Active, Activismo, Drupal and Plone (software)|Plone.

==Content and focus==
Image:Belgian Indymedia media centre.jpg|300px|thumb| Belgian Indymedia's headquarters in Brussels
The origins of IMCs themselves came out of protests against the concentrated ownership and perceived biases in corporate media reporting. The first IMC node, attached as it was to the Seattle anti-corporate globalization protests, was seen by activists as an alternative news source to that of the corporate media, which they accused of only showing violence and confrontation, and portraying all protesters negatively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19991223&amp;slug=A19991224010135&quot;Independent+Media+Center&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19991218&amp;slug=3002212&quot;Independent+Media+Center&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seattlepi.com/local/22220_gag09.shtml?searchpagefrom=1&amp;searchdiff=1732 Media center fighting FBI over Web data&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seattlepi.com/local/19980_security24.shtml FBI raids media center&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seattlepi.com/local/wto091.shtml An overflow crowd vents its anger at city, police&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ratical.org///////////////co-globalize/NLG-REPORT.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, between 1999 and 2001, IMC newswires tended to be focused on up-to-the-minute coverage of protests, from local Demonstration (people)|demonstrations to Summit (meeting)|summits where anti-globalization movement protests were occurring. In 2007, this was still the case,&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; but some IMCs are attempting to broaden their coverage to include more of what &quot;traditional&quot; journalism ignores.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

===Print projects===
There have been a number of print-based projects under the Indymedia banner, including short-run papers and longer-running newspapers. New York City IMC has produced The Indypendent, a bi-weekly &quot;free paper for free people&quot; for over five years. Winner of numerous awards from the Independent Press Association for original writing, photography, design and art, the Indypendent is currently the most widely circulated underground paper in North America.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} During the 2004 Republican National Convention in New York City, the Indypendent printed hundreds of thousands of copies and briefly attained a mass circulation. Contentious issues have included consistent editorial practices, commercial advertising and a diversity of perspectives rare among radical publications. Short-run papers for protests have included the Unconvention during the Philadelphia &quot;R2K&quot; protests during the 2000 Republican National Convention|Republican National Convention in 2000. Other newspapers include the Bay Area's Fault Lines (newsmagazine)|Fault Lines, and papers in Connecticut, Maine, Baltimore and St. Louis in the United States, as well as in Wellington, New Zealand.

===Radio projects===
They have a global radio project, which aggregates audio RSS feeds from around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://radio.indymedia.org/|title= Radio Indymedia|publisher=radio.indymedia.org|accessdate=2009-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Video project===
They produce a regular DVD magazine, called newsreal, in the US, Europe and Australia.

Some of their footage has been used in evidence in several court cases, e.g. 27th G8 summit|Genoa.

==Organizational structure==
===Local===
Image:Indymedia Cuiabá.jpg|300px|thumb|Indymedia collective at Mato Grosso Federal University in Cuiabá, Brazil hosting a free radio broadcast in 2004.
Local IMC collectives are expected to be open and inclusive of individuals from a variety of different local anti-capitalist point of view (literature)|points of view, whether or not these have any definite political philosophy, so that even those without internet access can participate in both content creation and in content consumption. Editorial policies, locally chosen by any Indymedia collective, generally involve removing articles which the Indymedia editors believe promote racism, sexism, hate speech, and homophobia.&lt;ref name=principles&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; All Indymedia collectives are expected to have a locally chosen, thoroughly discussed and clearly stated editorial policy for posts to their website.&lt;ref name=principles/&gt;

===Global===
The overall Indymedia network is decentralized to the extent that the local IMCs operate independently once they are authenticated into the IMC network. The process of admission into the IMC network is somewhat centralized but is relatively relaxed and transparent compared to the occasionally contentious disputes within local IMCs and has not generated a great deal of criticism. Local IMC collectives vary widely in their openness, editorial policies and tolerance of different viewpoints. Along with the locally-organised collectives are IMC websites dealing with particular topics (such as biotechnology) or for different media (such as video). Along with contributing their own media, core organizers maintain IMC's open publishing infrastructure, enabling different people throughout the internet to publish their news. IMC editing is done by a system of layered admin which contributors apply to join for each site, by participating on open email lists and attending open meetings.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

As an example of different models for collective internal organizing, the DC IMC (one of the older IMCs in the network) became a Coop with dues with a workshop/office, now closed.  In contrast, other IMC local collectives are without any formally-defined membership and have minimal organizational structure.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} Some IMC memberships require its members to sign a mission statement – not every IMC has a formalized policy. Some collectives do ban members for repeated rules violations. Some feel that membership includes only those actively doing organizing or other IMC work, while some feel that it actually extends to every IMC contributor.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

===Funding===
IMCs tend to be funded solely by donations of money and equipment from individuals. In maintaining its independence and anti-corporate stance, Indymedia has had struggles with funding issues. For example, in September 2002, the Ford Foundation proposed funding for an Indymedia regional meeting{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}. This was ultimately refused because many volunteers, especially some from IMC Argentina, were uncomfortable with accepting money from the Foundation, which some believe to be linked to the CIA.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

==Reputation==
Image:Indymed2.jpg|300px|thumb|Indymedia workshop
Indymedia has a variable reputation, both among its users and outside critics.
Indymedia has been criticized for adopting a position hostile to the interests of capital, others believe that this is the purpose of the media. Its editorial policy on feature selection and hiding or deletion of articles has been criticized of being biased in certain topic areas, such as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Some critics argue that since anyone can publish with little to no editorial process, unsubstantiated allegations and conspiracy theories are often published as fact, along with inaccurate articles and content that can offend.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

In its favor, Indymedia is an alternative to corporate media. Its operations are conducted by activists around the world, who, though they may be lacking in journalistic training and corporate funding, tend to make up for this with enthusiasm for reporting issues of social justice and unique related events, which in their view, the corporate media under-reports or Project Censored|censors. For example, the Bolivian Gas War in 2003 was virtually unheard of in the US media, while it received extensive worldwide and multilingual reporting through Indymedia. Another example is the February 15, 2003 anti-war protest in many US and European cities, which received detailed coverage written by its participants.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

While Indymedia has global aspirations, the vast majority of IMCs are in North America, Latin America and Europe. Although the Middle East is an area of considerable interest to Indymedia, there are only three IMCs in the region, located in Beirut, Lebanon; Cyprus and Israel, although there was a Palestine IMC in Jerusalem between 2001 and 2003. The Lebanon center is one of three IMCs in Muslim nations; the other two are in Jakarta, Indonesia and Istanbul, Turkey.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

===Temporary removal from Google News searches===
In early May 2003, after receiving numerous complaints about newswire stories that referred to the Israeli military (Israel Defence Forces|IDF) as &quot;Zionazi forces&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://chicago.indymedia.org/newswire/display/11403/index.php example of Newswire posting using the term &quot;Zionazi forces&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; or to Israelis as &quot;Zionazis&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indymedia.org.uk/en/2003/02/52318.html example of Newsire posting using the term &quot;Zionazi&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; Google temporarily stopped including some IMCs in Google News searches (many non-English IMCs remained in the search){{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}. Google News described the term &quot;Zionazi&quot; as a &quot;degrading, hateful slur&quot; and refused to index the San Francisco Bay Area Independent Media Center|Bay Area IMC because it had appeared there; SF Bay Area Indymedia agreed that it &quot;could be considered hate speech&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indybay.org/newsitems/2003/09/03/16398621.php Google News Bans SF Bay Area Indymedia Over Israel/Palestine Controversy]&lt;/ref&gt; This spawned a petition which sought to promise that content the Indymedia community finds offensive will be moderated from the front page as a matter of editorial policy.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} IMCs were still included in normal Google web searches. As of October 2004, IMC articles were restored to Google News searches.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

==Controversy and criticism==
===Hate speech===
Naomi Klein has written, &quot;Every time I log onto activist news sites like Indymedia.org, which practice 'open publishing,' I'm confronted with a string of Jewish conspiracy theories about 9-11 and excerpts from the Protocol of the Elders of Zion.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;klein&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naomiklein.org/articles/2002/04/sharon-le-pen-and-anti-semitism|title='Sharon, Le Pen, and Anti-Semitism'|author=Naomi Klein|accessdate=October 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Open publishing has left some IMCs in Europe vulnerable to legal action or threats of Lawsuit|legal action related to questions of Defamation|libel or hate speech.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} In some such cases, local IMC collectives took autonomous decisions to temporarily suspend the site while the different activist groups reorganized to find a consensual, constructive method of dealing with these problems and to increase openness and non-authoritarian organizing methods.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

===FBI investigation===
In March 2006, the Los Angeles Times alleged that Indymedia had appeared with Food Not Bombs and the Communist Party of Texas on an Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI terrorist watchlist, revealed at a presentation at the University of Texas|University of Texas School of Law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.infoshop.org/article.php?story=2006fnb_fbii_spying Food Not Bombs, Indymedia investigated by FBI] [http://nyc.indymedia.org/en/2006/03/66278.html Austin FBI Officer Says Indymedia, FNB, CP of Texas on Terrorist Watch List]&lt;/ref&gt; A reference to the 2005 IndyConference was made at the same presentation.

===Editorial policy===
Although attempts have been made to formalize global editorial standards, the autonomous and independent nature of Indymedia has meant that many IMCs prefer their own local policies. As a result, many deal with similar issues and complaints, particularly around matters of distinguishing between criticism and hateful comments (&quot;hate speech&quot;); and the criteria for selecting issues and authors for the websites' &quot;featured articles&quot;. While freedom of speech is valued by Indymedia collectives, it is rarely the overriding principle guiding editorial policy.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

Many IMCs now routinely remove from the front page &quot;newswire&quot; articles copied from corporate-run or state-run press sources. This policy (where implemented) is intended by those IMCs to keep Indymedia as an independent news source, rather than a blog of articles from existing news sources.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

There is generally an editorial electronic mailing list, to which questions and complaints may be directed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lists.indymedia.org/mailman/listinfo/imc-manila-editorial Imc-manila-editorial Info Page&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Servers seizures==
Indymedia has had interactions with authorities in USA and UK.

===Seizure of servers by the FBI===
On October 7, 2004, the FBI took possession of several Server (computing)|server hard drives used by a number of IMCs and hosted by US-based Rackspace Managed Hosting. The servers in question were located in the United Kingdom and managed by the British arm of Rackspace, but some 20 mainly European IMC websites were affected, and several unrelated websites were affected (including the website of a Linux distribution).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/10/08/1097089554894.html?oneclick=true FBI seizes Indymedia servers], ''Sydney Morning Herald, 2004-10-08&lt;/ref&gt; No reasons were given at first by the FBI and Rackspace for the seizure, in particular IMC was not informed. Rackspace claimed that it was banned from giving further information about the incident.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indymedia.org/en/2004/10/111999.shtml Indymedia report]&lt;/ref&gt; Some (but not all) of the legal documents relating to the confiscation of the servers were unsealed by a Texas district court in August 2005, following legal action by the Electronic Frontier Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eff.org/press/releases/2005/08 EFF Statement]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Lettice, [http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/08/03/indymedia_texas_docs_unsealed/ ''US court files reveal Italian link to Indymedia server grab''], The Register, 3rd August 2005, accessed 25th August 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The documents revealed that the government never officially demanded the computer servers—the subpoena to Rackspace only requested server log files. This contradicted previous statements by the web host that it took the servers offline because the government had demanded the hardware. Thus, it is unclear whether it is correct to say the servers were seized by the FBI. The documents also contradicted Rackspace's claim that it had been ordered by the court not to discuss publicly the government's demand. The seized servers were returned on October 13, 2004.

A statement by Rackspace&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in [http://www.indymedia.org/en/2004/10/111999.shtml ''FBI Seizes IMC Servers in the UK''], accessed 25th August 2007&lt;/ref&gt; stated that the company had been forced to comply with a court order under the procedures laid out by the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty, which governs international police co-operation on &quot;international terrorism, kidnapping and money laundering&quot;. The investigation that led to the court order was said to have arisen outside of the U.S. Rackspace stated that they were prohibited on giving further detail. Agence France-Presse reported FBI spokesman Joe Parris,&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_kmafp/is_200410/ai_n6865024 News website Indymedia says FBI seized server]&lt;/ref&gt; who said the incident was not an FBI operation, but that the subpoena had been issued at the request of the Italy|Italian and the Swiss governments. Again, no further details on specific allegations were given. UK involvement was denied in an answer given to a parliamentary question posed by Richard Allan, Liberal Democrat MP.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.richardallan.org.uk/?m=200410 MP Richard Allan's website]&lt;/ref&gt;

Indymedia pointed out that they were not contacted by the FBI and that no specific information was released on the reasons of seizing the servers. Indymedia also sees the incident in the context of &quot;numerous attacks on independent media by the US Federal Government&quot;, including a subpoena to obtain IP logs from Indymedia at the occasion of the Republican National Conference,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aclu.org/freespeech/protest/11476prs20040830.html American Civil Liberties Union : Statement of Brian Szymanski Regarding Secret Service Investigation of Indymedia&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; the shut-down of several community radio stations in the US by the Federal Communications Commission|FCC, and a request by the FBI to remove a post on Nantes IMC containing a photograph of alleged undercover Swiss police.&lt;ref&gt;[http://indymedia.org/en/static/fbi Indymedia's page on the FBI seizure]&lt;/ref&gt;

The move was condemned by the International Federation of Journalists, who stated that &quot;The way this has been done smacks more of intimidation of legitimate journalistic inquiry than crime-busting&quot; and called for an investigation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifj.org/en/articles/more-intimidation-than-crime-busting-says-ifj-as-police-target-independent-media-network ''&quot;More Intimidation Than Crime-Busting&quot; Says IFJ As Police Target Independent Media Network''], IFJ press release, 8th October 2004, accessed 28th August 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Criticism was also voiced by European civil liberties organisation Statewatch&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statewatch.org/news/2004/oct/04uk-usa-indymedia.htm ''Was the seizure of Indymedia's servers in London unlawful or did the UK government collude? ''], Statewatch Press release, October 2004, accessed 25th August 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and the World Association of Community Radio Broadcasters (AMARC).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifex.org/united_kingdom/2004/10/08/fbi_seizes_indymedia_servers_in/ ''FBI seizes Indymedia servers in the United Kingdom''], bulletin, 8th October 2004, accessed 28th August 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In Italy, the federal prosecutor of Bologna Marina Plazzi confirmed that an investigation against Indymedia had been opened because of suspected &quot;support of terrorism&quot;, in the context of Italian troops in the Iraqi city of Nasiriyah. The Italian minister of justice, Roberto Castelli, has refused further details. In November 2003, 17 members of parliament belonging to the right-wing Alleanza Nazionale, including Alessandra Mussolini demanded that Indymedia be shut down. A senior AN member and government official had announced the co-operation with US authorities (AN was a member of the Italian coalition government), and AN spokesman Mario Landolfi welcomed the FBI's seizure of the Indymedia servers. Left-wing Italian politicians denounced the move and called for an investigation.&lt;ref&gt;Damiano Valgolio, ''The Censorers Trace leads to Rome and Zurich'', Junge Welt, 11th October 2004, cited at [http://www.indymedia.org/en/2004/10/112083.shtml ''Indymedia to U.S., U.K., Swiss and Italian Authorities: &quot;Hands Off Our Websites&quot;''], accessed 25th August 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bristol server seizure===
Image:Bristol indymedia.jpg|300px|thumb|Graffito (drawing technique)|Graffito in Bristol, United Kingdom advertising the local chapter of Indymedia with the slogan &quot;read it write it your site your news&quot;.
Not long after the Rackspace affair another server in the UK was seized by police in June 2005. An anonymous post on the Bristol Indymedia server, came to police attention for suggesting an &quot;action&quot; against a freight train carrying new cars as part of a protest against cars and climate change in the run up to that year's Gleneagles G8 summit.&lt;ref&gt;John Leyden, ''[http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/06/28/indymedia_server_seizure_bristol/ Legal row after police seize Bristol Indymedia server]'', The Register, 28th June 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The police claimed that the poster broke the law by &quot;incitement to criminal damage&quot;, and sought access logs from the server operators. Despite being warned by lawyers that the servers were &quot;journalistic equipment&quot; and subject to special laws,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indymedia.org.uk/en/2005/06/314798.html ''PRESS RELEASE : Bristol Indymedia Server Threatened''], Bristol IMC press release, 24th June 2005, accessed 25th August 2007&lt;/ref&gt; the police proceeded with the seizure and a member of the Bristol Indymedia group was arrested.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/bristol/somerset/4629399.stm ''Indymedia server seized in raid''], BBC News, 28 June 2005, accessed 25th August 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Indymedia was supported in this matter by the National Union of Journalists, Liberty (pressure group)|Liberty&lt;ref&gt;

===Other legal actions - IMC UK===
In 2005, Indymedia UK was threatened with a libel action by the US arms company EDO Corporation, for publishing articles accusing their UK branch EDO (UK) of EDO MBM Technology Ltd (who supply the US, UK, and Israel armed forces) of being 'warmongers'. Their lawyers ultimately withdrew the writ.

EDO Corporation|EDO MBM then launched a further High Court lawsuit against the protest group Smash EDO in April 2005, under anti-stalker laws, presenting as evidence articles that had been posted anonymously on Indymedia UK. Although a controversial interim injunction was imposed on this evidence, the suit collapsed without reaching a trial in early 2006.

===Other legal actions - IMC US===
On January 30, 2009, one of the system administrators of the server that hosts indymedia.us received a grand jury subpoena from the United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana|Southern District of Indiana federal court. The subpoena asked the administrator to provide all &quot;IP addresses, times, and any other identifying information&quot; for every visitor to the site on June 25, 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;subpoena&quot;&gt;Electronic Frontier Foundation [http://www.eff.org/wp/anatomy-bogus-subpoena-indymedia &quot;Anatomy of a Bogus Subpoena&quot;], Retrieved on 2009-11-11.&lt;/ref&gt; The subpoena also included a gag order that stated that the recipient is &quot;not to disclose the existence of this request unless authorized by the Assistant U.S. Attorney.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;subpoena&quot; /&gt; The administrator of indymedia.us could not have provided the information because Indymedia sites generally do not keep IP address logs. The Electronic Frontier Foundation determined that there was no legal basis for the gag order, and that the subpoena request &quot;violated the Stored Communications Act|SCA's restrictions on what types of data the government could obtain using a subpoena.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;subpoena&quot; /&gt; Under Reporters' privilege#Department of Justice guidelines|Justice Department guidelines, subpoenas to news media must have the authorization of the attorney general.

==Assaults on journalists==
On August 15, 2000, the Los Angeles Police Department temporarily shut down&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.lists.indymedia.org/imc-nyc/2000-August/000130.html [Imc-Nyc&amp;#93; Lapd Blocks Satellite Feed Of Indymedia Coverage Of Dnc In Los Angeles&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; the satellite uplink and production studio of the Los Angeles Independent Media Center on its first night of Democratic National Convention coverage, claiming explosives were in a van in the adjacent parking lot. No explosives were ever found.

On October 27, 2006, New York–based journalist Bradley Roland Will was killed along with two Mexican protesters in the city of Oaxaca, Oaxaca|Oaxaca. People had been demonstrating in the city since May as part of an 2006 Oaxaca protests|uprising prompted by a teachers strike. Lizbeth Cana, attorney general of Oaxaca, claimed the conflict was caused by the protesters and that the gunmen who engaged them were upset residents from the area{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}.

==Social software==

The various php software that makes Indymedia, is available for download. It is released under the GPL licence. In 2006, a number of long-time Indymedia developers met at the Techmeet Summit in São Paulo, Brazil to begin work on a next-generation CMS for Indymedia, combining the efforts of the two main IMC content management systems. A prototype for the new CMS was released in 2008 and work continues on the project, coordinated at ''cms.indymedia.org''.

'''Concentration of media ownership''' (also known as '''media consolidation''' or '''media convergence''') refers to a process whereby progressively fewer individuals or organizations control increasing share of the mass media.&lt;ref&gt;Steven, 2009: p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary research demonstrates increasing levels of consolidation, with many media industries already highly concentrated and oligopoly,dominated by a very small number of firms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Downing, John|title=The SAGE Handbook of Media Studies|publisher=SAGE|year=2004|isbn=9780761921691|page=296|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=isFAwqhITCUC&amp;pg=PA296}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Lorimer, Rowland &amp; Scannell, Paddy|title=Mass communications: a comparative introduction|publisher=Manchester University Press|year=1994|isbn=9780719039461|pages=86–87|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=5z7oAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA86}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the major media outlets are owned by a proportionately small number of conglomerates and corporations.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Media concentration closely related to issues of editorial independence, media bias, and freedom of the press. In that sense, the term &quot;media consolidation&quot; is used especially by those who view such consolidation as sociologically detrimental, dangerous, or problematic.

==Debates==
Concentration of media ownership is very frequently seen as a problem of contemporary media and society.&lt;ref name=&quot;New Internationalist&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author= New Internationalist|title= Global Media |url= http://www.newint.org/issues/2001/04/01/|work= |publisher=New Internationalist |date= April 2001|accessdate=2009-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;newint.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author= New Internationalist|title= Ultra Concentrated Media - Facts|url= http://www.newint.org/features/2001/04/01/facts/|work= |publisher=New Internationalist |date= April 2001|accessdate=2009-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Katharine Ainger&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author= Katharine Ainger|title= Empires of the Senseless|url= http://www.newint.org/features/2001/04/01/keynote/|work= |publisher=New Internationalist |date= April 2001|accessdate=2009-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; When media ownership is concentrated in one or more of the ways mentioned above, a number of undesirable consequences follow, including the following:

*Commercially driven, ultra-powerful mass market media is primarily loyal to sponsors, i.e. advertisers and government rather than to the public interest.
*If only a few companies representing the interests of a minority elite control the public airwaves of 300 million US citizens, then calling them &quot;public airwaves&quot; is only lip service.
*Healthy, market-based competition is absent, leading to slower innovation and increased prices.

It is important to elaborate upon the issue of media consolidation and its effect upon the diversity of information reaching a particular market.  Critics of consolidation raise the issue of whether monopolistic or oligopolistic control of a local media market can be fully accountable and dependable in serving the public interest.  If, for example, only one or two media conglomerates dominate in a single market, the question is not only that of whether they will present a diversity of opinions, but also of whether they are willing to present information that may be damaging to either their advertisers or to themselves.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

This despite the fact that before deregulation there were only the Big Three television networks.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

On the local end, reporters have often seen their stories refused or edited beyond recognition, in instances where they have unearthed potentially damaging information concerning either the media outlet's advertisers or its parent company.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

An example would be the repeated refusal of networks to air &quot;ads&quot; from anti-war advocates to liberal groups like MoveOn.org, or religious groups like the United Church of Christ, regardless of factual basis.  Journalists and their reports may be directly sponsored by parties who are the subject of their journalism leading to reports which actually favor the sponsor, have that appearance, or are simply a repetition of the sponsors opinion.  [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Lwr2SA5Pec]{{Verify credibility|date=January 2011}}

Consequently, if the companies dominating a media market choose to suppress stories that do not serve their interests, the public suffers, since they are not adequately informed of some crucial issues that may affect them.  If the only media outlets in town refuse to air a story, then the question becomes, who will?

Concern among academia rests in the notion that the purpose of the first amendment to the US constitution was to encourage a free press as political agitator evidenced by the famous quote from US President Thomas Jefferson, &quot;The only security of all is in a free press. The force of public opinion cannot be resisted when permitted freely to be expressed. The agitation it produces must be submitted to. It is necessary, to keep the waters pure.&quot;{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Critics of media deregulation and the resulting concentration of ownership fear that such trends will only continue to reduce the diversity of information provided, as well as to reduce the accountability of information providers to the public.  The ultimate consequence of consolidation, critics argue, is a poorly-informed public, restricted to a reduced array of media options that offer only information that does not harm the media oligopoly's growing range of interests

For those critics, media deregulation is a dangerous trend, facilitating an increase in concentration of media ownership, and subsequently reducing the overall quality and diversity of information communicated through major media channels.  Increased concentration of media ownership can lead to the censorship of a wide range of critical thought

AAnother concern is that consolidated media is not flexible enough to serve local communities in case of emergency.  This happened in Minot, North Dakota, in 2002, after a train filled with anhydrous ammonia derailed.  None of the leading radio stations in Minot carried information on the derailment or evacuation procedures, largely because they were all owned by Clear Channel Communications and received automated feeds from the corporate headquarters in San Antonio, Texas.  1600 people were injured and one died &lt;ref&gt;http://www.in-forum.com/specials/minot/part5.cfm?id=106028{{Verify credibility|date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify credibility|date=January 2011}}

== Determinants of media pluralism ==
Pluralism is a very complex issue that cannot be secured by creating one panacea solution. According to Gillian Doyle, the following have to be investigated in order to decide what sort of acts or policies are the best for any given country that want to support media pluralism: size and wealth of the market; diversity of suppliers; consolidation of resources; and diversity of output.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

===Size and wealth of the market===
“Within any free market economy, the level of resources available for the provision of media will be constrained principally by the size and wealth of that economy, and the propensity of its inhabitants to consume media.” [Gillian Doyle; 2002:15] Those countries that have relatively large market, like the United Kingdom, France or Spain have more financial background to support diversity of output and have the ability to keep more media companies in the market (as they are there to make profit). More diverse output and fragmented ownership will, obviously, support pluralism. In contrast, small ones like Ireland or Hungary suffer from the absence of all those that are given in bigger countries. It means that “support for the media through direct payment” and “levels of consumers expenditure”, furthermore “the availability of advertising support” [Gillian Doyle; 2002:15] are less in these countries, due to the low number of audience. Overall, the size and wealth of the market determine the diversity of both media output and media ownership.

===Diversity of suppliers/owners===
From the previous paragraph can be assumed that size/wealth of the market have a very strong relation to the diversity of supplier. If the first is not given (wealthy market) then it is difficult to achieve fragmented supplier system. Diversity of suppliers refers to those heterogeneous independent organizations that are involved in media production and to the common ownership as well. The more various suppliers there are, the better for pluralism is. However, “the more powerful individual suppliers become, the greater the potential threat to pluralism.” &lt;ref&gt;Doyle, 2002: p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consolidation of resources===
The consolidation of cost functions and cost-sharing. Cost-sharing is a common practice in monomedia and cross media. For example, “for multi-product television or radio broadcasters, the more homogeneity possible between different services held in common ownership (or the more elements within a programme schedule which can be shared between ’different’ stations), the greater the opportunity to reap economies.” &lt;ref&gt;Doyle, 2002: p. 22-23&lt;/ref&gt; Though the main concern of pluralism is that different organization under different ownership may buy the same e.g. news stories from the same news-supplier agency. In the UK, the biggest news-supplier is The Press Association (PA). Here is a quoted text from PA web site: “The Press Association supplies services to every national and regional daily newspaper, major broadcasters, online publishers and a wide range of commercial organisations.” Overall, in a system where all different media organizations gather their stories from the same source, then we can’t really call that system pluralist. That is where diversity of output comes in

==Concentration of media ownership globally==
Globally, large media conglomerates which may operate in California at any time include, National Amusements, Viacom, CBS Corporation, Time Warner, News Corp, Bertelsmann AG, Sony, General Electric, Vivendi SA, The Walt Disney Company, Hearst Corporation, Organizações Globo and Lagardère Group.&lt;ref name=&quot;New Internationalist&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;newint.org&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Katharine Ainger&quot;/&gt;

As of 2010, The Walt Disney Company is the world's largest media conglomerate, with News Corporation, Time Warner and Viacom ranking second, third and fourth respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune500/2010/industries/145/index.html - Fortune 500]&lt;/ref&gt;

====United Kingdom====
Many Californians may utilize UK media due to its good reputation and the common language.  United Kingdom|Britain and Ireland, Rupert Murdoch owns best-selling tabloids ''News of the World'', ''The Sun (newspaper)|The Sun'' as well as the broadsheet ''The Times'' and ''Sunday Times'', and 39% of satellite broadcasting network BSkyB. BSkyB in turn owns a significant part of ITV plc.
Daily Mail and General Trust (DMGT) own The ''Daily Mail'' and'' The Mail on Sunday'', ''Ireland on Sunday'', and free London daily ''Metro (Associated Metro Limited)|Metro'', and control a large proportion of regional media, including through subsidiary Northcliffe Media, in addition to large shares in ITN and GCap Media.

Richard Desmond owns ''OK! magazine'', Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5, the ''Daily Express'' and the ''Daily Star (United Kingdom)|Daily Star''.

The ''Evening Standard'' and ''The Independent'' are both owned by Russian businessman and ex KGB agent Alexander Lebedev.

===Israel===
Many Californians may access Israeli media especially for opinions on international events. In Israel, Arnon Mozes owns the most widespread Hebrew newspaper, Yediot Aharonot, the most widespread Russian newspaper Vesti (newspaper)|Vesty, the most popular Hebrew news website Ynet, and 17% of the cable TV firm Hot (Israel)|HOT. Moreover, Mozes owns the Reshet TV firm, which is one of the two operator of the most popular channel in Israel, channel 2.

=== Mexico ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2010}}
Many Californians read Mexican media. In Mexico there are only two national broadcast television networks, Televisa and TV Azteca. The former has a 70% market share. Though concern about the existence of a duopoly had been around for some time, a press uproar sparked in 2006, when Ley Televisa|a controversial reform to the Federal Radio and Television Law, seriously hampered the entry of new competitors, like Cadena Tres.

Televisa also owns subscription TV entreprises Cablevisión (Mexico)|Cablevisión and SKY Latin America|SKY, publishing company Editorial Televisa, and the Televisa Radio broadcast radio network, creating a de facto media monopoly in many regions of the country.

===United States===
In the United States, movie production is known to be dominated by major studios since the early 20th Century; before that, there was a period in which Motion Picture Patents Company|Edison's Trust monopolized the industry. The music and television industries recently witnessed cases of media consolidation, with Sony Music Entertainment's parent company merging their music division with Bertelsmann AG's BMG to form Sony BMG and TimeWarner's The WB and CBS Corp.'s UPN merging to form The CW. In the case of Sony BMG, there existed a &quot;Big Five&quot; (now &quot;Big Four record labels|Big Four&quot;) of major record company|record companies, while The CW's creation was an attempt to consolidate ratings and stand up to the &quot;Big Four&quot; of United States|American network television|network (terrestrial) television.

There may also be some large-scale owners in an industry that are not the causes of monopoly or oligopoly. Clear Channel Communications, especially since the Telecommunications Act of 1996, acquired many radio stations across the United States, and came to own more than 1,200 stations. However, the radio broadcasting industry in the United States and elsewhere can be regarded as oligopolistic regardless of the existence of such a player. Because radio stations are local in reach, each licensed a specific part of airwave by the Federal Communications Commission|FCC in a specific local area, any local market is served by a limited number of stations. In most countries, this system of licensing makes many markets local oligopolies. The similar market structure exists for television broadcasting, cable systems and newspaper industries, all of which are characterized by the existence of large-scale owners. Concentration of ownership is often found in these industries.

In the United States, data on ownership and market share of media companies is not held in the public domain. Academics, for example at MIT Media Lab and NYU, have struggled to find data that show reliably the concentration of media ownership. 

====History====
Prior to 1927, public airwaves in the United States were regulated by the United States Department of Commerce and largely litigated in the courts as the growing number of stations fought for space in the burgeoning industry. The Federal Radio Act of 1927 (signed into law February 23, 1927) nationalized the airwaves and formed the Federal Communications Commission|Federal Radio Commission (later named the Federal Communications Commission, or FCC) to assume control of the airwaves.

The Communications Act of 1934 refined and expanded on the authority of the FCC to regulate public airwaves in the United States, combining and reorganizing provisions from the Federal Radio Act of 1927 and the Mann-Elkins Act of 1910.  It empowered the FCC, among other things, to administer broadcasting licenses, impose penalties and regulate standards and equipment used on the airwaves.  The Act also mandated that the FCC would act in the interest of the &quot;public convenience, interest, or necessity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.fcc.gov/Reports/1934new.pdf The Communications Act of 1934 ].&quot;  United States Public Law.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Act established a system whereby the FCC grants licenses to the spectrum to broadcasters for commercial use, so long as the broadcasters act in the public interest by providing news programming.

Lobbyists from the largest radio broadcasters, ABC and NBC, wanted to establish high fees for broadcasting licenses, but Congress saw this as a limitation upon free speech. Consequently, “the franchise to operate a broadcasting station, often worth millions, is awarded free of charge to enterprises selected under the standard of ‘public interest, convenience, or necessity.’”&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[Thomas I. Emerson, &lt;u&gt;The System of Freedom of Expression&lt;/u&gt; (New York: Vintage Books, 1970), p. 654-655 ].&quot; Thomas I. Emerson&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, radio and television was dominated by the Big Three television networks until the mid-1990s.

The Telecommunications Act of 1996 set the modern tone of deregulation, a relaxing of percentage constrictions that solidified the previous history of privatizing the utility and commodifying the spectrum. The legislation, touted as a step that would foster competition, actually resulted in the subsequent mergers of several large companies, a trend which still continues.&lt;ref name=&quot;Klinenberg0607&quot; &gt;{{cite web |url=http://adbusters.org/the_magazine/72/Fighting_For_Air_An_interview_with_Eric_Klinenberg.html |title=Adbusters : The Magazine - #72 The Fake Issue / Fighting For Air: An interview with Eric Klinenberg |accessdate=2007-06-29 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 4,000 radio stations were bought out, and minority ownership of TV stations dropped to its lowest point since the federal government began tracking such data in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Fairness &amp; Accuracy in Reporting |title= Speak Out for Media Democracy: Why isn’t the FCC doing its job?|url=http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=1823 |work= |publisher=Fairness &amp; Accuracy in Reporting |date= 3/9/2003|accessdate=10 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Federal Communications Commission|FCC held one official forum, February 27, 2003, in Richmond, Virginia in response to public pressures to allow for more input on the issue of elimination of media ownership limits. Some complain that more than one forum was needed.&lt;ref&gt;Casuga, Jay-Anne. [http://www.richmond.com/business/10399 Not Enough: FCC public hearing allows only one hour for citizen input] (Richmond.com)&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 2, 2003, Federal Communications Commission|FCC, in a 3-2 vote under Chairman Michael Powell (politician)|Michael Powell, approved new media ownership laws that removed many of the restrictions previously imposed to limit ownership of media within a local area. The changes were not, as is customarily done, made available to the public for a comment period.

* Single-company ownership of media in a given market is now permitted up to 45% (formerly 35%, up from 25% in 1985) of that market.
* Restrictions on newspaper and TV station ownership in the same market were removed.
* All TV channels, magazines, newspapers, cable, and Internet services are now counted, weighted based on people's average tendency to find news on that medium.  At the same time, whether a channel ''actually contains'' news is no longer considered in counting the percentage of a medium owned by one owner.
* Previous requirements for periodic review of license have been changed.  Licenses are no longer reviewed for &quot;public-interest&quot; considerations.

The decision by the FCC was overturned by the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in ''Prometheus Radio Project v. FCC'' in June, 2004.  The Majority ruled 2-1 against the FCC and ordered the Commission to reconfigure how it justified raising ownership limits.  The Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court later turned down an appeal, so the ruling stands.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes.com&quot;&gt;Labaton, Stephen.  &quot;[http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/18/business/media/18broadcast.html?pagewanted=all Plan Would Ease Limits on Media Owners].&quot; ''The New York Times,'' 18 Oct 2007.  Retrieved on 10 Dec 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cross-ownership proceedings====
The FCC voted December 18, 2007 to eliminate some media ownership rules, including a statute that forbids a single company to own both a newspaper and a television or radio station in the same city. FCC Chairman Kevin Martin (FCC)|Kevin Martin circulated the plan in October 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes.com&quot;/&gt;  Martin's justification for the rule change is to ensure the viability of America's newspapers and to address issues raised in the 2003 FCC decision that was later struck down by the courts.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DOC-278113A1.pdf Chairman Kevin J. Martin Proposes Revision to the Newspaper/Broadcast Cross-Ownership Rule].&quot; FCC. Press Release, 13 Nov 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  The FCC held six hearings around the country to receive public input from individuals, broadcasters and corporations.  Because of the lack of discussion during the 2003 proceedings, increased attention has been paid to ensuring that the FCC engages in proper dialogue with the public regarding its current rules change.

FCC Commissioners Deborah Taylor-Tate and Robert McDowell joined Chairman Martin in voting in favor of the rule change.  Commissioners Michael Copps and Jonathan Adelstein, both Democrats, opposed the change.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://money.cnn.com/news/newsfeeds/articles/djf500/200712181340DOWJONESDJONLINE000561_FORTUNE5.htm FCC Votes to Relax Cross-Media Ownership Rule]&quot;  ''Associated Press,'' 18 Dec 2007.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Brown Act''', officially known as the '''Ralph M. Brown Act''', was an act of the California State Legislature, authored by Assemblymember Ralph M. Brown and passed in 1953, that guaranteed the public’s right to attend and participate in meetings of local legislative bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title= The Brown Act: Open Meetings for Local Legislative Bodies | publisher= California Attorney General | volume= Foreword, Introduction, and Table of Contents | last= Lockyer | first= Bill | year= 2003 | url= http://ag.ca.gov/publications/2003_Intro_BrownAct.pdf | accessdate= 2009-06-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Brown Act, originally a 686 word statute that has grown substantially over the years, was enacted in response to mounting public concerns over informal, undisclosed meetings held by local elected officials.  City councils, county boards, and other local government bodies were avoiding public scrutiny by holding secret &quot;workshops&quot; and &quot;study sessions.&quot;  The Brown Act solely applies to California city and county government agencies, boards, and councils.  The comparable Bagley-Keane Act mandates open meetings for State government agencies.

The introduction to the Brown Act describes its purpose and intent:&lt;ref&gt;California Government Code §54960&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In enacting this chapter, the Legislature finds and declares that the public commissions, boards and councils and the other public agencies in this State exist to aid in the conduct of the people's business.  It is the intent of the law that their actions be taken openly and that their deliberations be conducted openly.  The people of this State do not yield their sovereignty to the agencies which serve them.  The people, in delegating authority, do not give their public servants the right to decide what is good for the people to know and what is not good for them to know.  The people insist on remaining informed so that they may retain control over the instruments they have created.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A local newspaper opined of the act:

{{cquote|A law to prohibit secret meetings of official bodies, save under the most exceptional circumstances, should not be necessary.  Public officers above all other persons should be imbued with the truth that their business is the public’s business and they should be the last to tolerate any attempt to keep the people from being fully informed as to what is going on in official agencies.  Unfortunately, however, that is not always the case. Instances are many in which officials have contrived, deliberately and shamefully, to operate in a vacuum of secrecy. | 4= ''Sacramento Bee'' | 5= October 1952 }}

==Criticisms==
Supporters of the Brown Act say it still lacks enforcement, contending the law has been eroded by court decisions and government officials' efforts to block access to records.  &quot;The unfulfilled promise, I'm afraid, that 50 years has revealed, is enforcement,&quot; commented Terry Francke, of the California First Amendment Coalition, on the 50th anniversary of the bill's passage in 2003.

==Key provisionss==

* Open meetings are required of all county, city and special districts such as water boards. The Brown Act does not apply to the state legislature itself, to the consternation of some commentators.
* Closed sessions are only allowed for things like labor and real estate negotiations. The body must report back on the progress of closed session at the following open public session.
* Documents at meetings are public, all of them.
* Electronic communications auch as emails must not be allowed to be used to conduct a de facto closed private meeting. Back and forth emails constitute an illegal deliberation.
* Emergency situations allow some exceptions to rules such as the prohibition of back and forth emails between members of a board.
* Public is not required to provide their name or any information when viewing documents.
* Notice of meetings
* No action or discussion shall be undertaken on any item not on the agenda so that the public will have notice, via the agenda, in advance, that the particular action is being taken or discussed. 


* Criminal penalties are written into the act if there is proven intent to deprive the public of information, although this is rarely even threatened or discussed.
* Public comment is permitted at all open public meetings but the chair has discretion as to the scope and length of such public comment.
* Public criticism of governemtnt action is allowed but most agencies specifically prohibit personal attacks. 
* Recording the proceedings is, by law, permitted, when it is done in a non-disruptive manner.
* Special meetings are subject to all of the same requirements as any other meeting.

== Exceptions ==
The Brown Act applies to &quot;legislative&quot; agencies such as school districts, which &quot;legislate&quot; policy, boards of supervisors, city councils etc.
&lt;ref&gt; Government Code Section 54952&lt;/ref&gt;
According to the [[California_Public_Policy_and_Citizen_Participation/glossary|Primordial Wikipedia Article]] on the Brown Act,as of the date it was transwiki'd, subcommittees that are less than a ''quorom'' do not count. According to that wikipedia article this section was based on, &quot;''Advisory'' committees that do not legislate do not count.&quot; However, this writer is on an advisory committee which does not legislate, and Brown Act compliance is enforced very rigorously at all times and, according to city staff, the city could be fined for violating the Brown Act in the conduct of its advisory committee activities. Be sure to consult with the city or county attorney if you are on such a committee or if you are a citizen seeking to enhance the performance of any such committee. 

According to the wikipedia article, state agencies are covered by the Bagley Keene Act. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ag.ca.gov/publications/bagleykeene2004_ada.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gary Webb''' (August 31, 1955 &amp;ndash; December 10, 2004) was a Pulitzer prize-winning United States|American Investigative journalism|investigative journalist.

Webb was best known for his 1996 &quot;Dark Alliance&quot; series of articles written for the ''San Jose Mercury News'' and later published as a book. In the three-part series, Webb investigated Nicaraguans linked to the Central Intelligence Agency|CIA-backed Contra (guerrillas)|Contras who had allegedly smuggled cocaine into the U.S.  Their smuggled cocaine was  distributed as crack cocaine in Los Angeles, with the profits funneled back to the Contras. Webb also alleged that this influx of Nicaraguan-supplied cocaine sparked, and significantly fueled, the widespread Crack Epidemic|crack cocaine epidemic that swept through many U.S. cities during the 1980s. According to Webb, the CIA was aware of the cocaine transactions and the large CIA and Contras cocaine trafficking in the US|shipments of drugs into the U.S. by Contra personnel.  Webb charged that the Reagan administration shielded inner-city drug dealers from prosecution in order to raise money for the Contras, especially after Congress passed the Boland Amendment, which prohibited direct Contra funding.

Webb's reporting generated fierce controversy, and the ''San Jose Mercury News'' backed away from the story, effectively ending Webb's career as a mainstream media journalist. In 2004, Webb was found dead from Multiple gunshot suicide|two gunshot wounds to the head, which the coroner's office judged a suicide. Though he was criticized and outcast from the mainstream journalism community, his reportage was eventually vindicated as many of his findings have since been validated: since Webb's death, both the ''Los Angeles Times'' and the ''Chicago Tribune'' have defended his &quot;Dark Alliance&quot; series. Renowned journalist and former Webb colleague Al Giordano states that &quot;the CIA’s internal investigation by Inspector General Frederick Hitz vindicated much of Gary’s reporting&quot; and observes that despite the campaign against Webb, &quot;the government eventually admitted to more than Gary had initially reported&quot; over the years.

== Biography ==
=== Early life ===
Webb was born to a military family in Corona, California.  At 15, Webb began writing editorials for his suburban Indianapolis high school newspaper.  At the height of the protests against the Vietnam War, he created his first controversy when he criticized the use of a female drill team to rally students for the war.  Webb attended journalism school at Northern Kentucky University, where he was on staff at the student newspaper ''The Northerner'', but dropped out.  He started his professional career at the ''Kentucky Post'', then worked as a statehouse correspondent for the ''Cleveland Plain Dealer''.  Webb found a lifelong passion in investigating political corruption|government and corporate crime|private sector corruption.  In 1988, Webb joined the ''San Jose Mercury News'' as a staff writer.  He helped expose freeway retrofitting problems in the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake and wrote stories about computer software problems at the California Department of Motor Vehicles|DMV.

=== Dark Alliance ===
==== Series ====
In August 1996 the ''San Jose Mercury News'' published Webb's &quot;Dark Alliance,&quot; a 20,000 word, three-part investigative series which alleged that Nicaraguan drug traffickers had sold and distributed cocaine|crack cocaine in Los Angeles during the 1980s, and that drug profits were used to fund the CIA-supported Nicaraguan Contra (guerrillas)|Contras. Webb never asserted that the CIA directly aided drug dealers to raise money for the Contras, but he did document that the CIA was aware of the cocaine transactions and the large shipments of cocaine into the U.S. by the Contra personnel.&lt;ref&gt;Webb's 1999 book, ''Dark Alliance'', substantiated these allegations with copious references.&lt;/ref&gt;  &quot;Dark Alliance&quot; received national attention. At the height of the interest, the web version of it on ''San Jose Mercury News'' website received 1.3 million hits a day. According to the ''Columbia Journalism Review'', the series became &quot;the most talked-about piece of journalism in 1996 and arguably the most famous&amp;mdash;some would say infamous&amp;mdash;set of articles of the decade.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;CJR&quot;&gt;{{cite news

Webb supported his story with documents obtained through the Freedom of Information Act, subsequently including a 450-page declassified version of an October 1988 report by CIA Inspector General Frederick Hitz.  According to Webb and his supporters, the evidence demonstrates that White House officials, including Oliver North, knew about and supported using money from drug trafficking to fund the contras, and these officials neglected to pass any information along to the Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA. The 1988 report from the Senate Subcommittee on Narcotics, Terrorism and International Operations of the Committee on Foreign Relations led by Sen. John Kerry commented that there were &quot;serious questions as to whether or not US officials involved in Central America failed to address the drug issue for fear of jeopardizing the war effort against Nicaragua.&quot;&lt;ref name=DLEFP&gt;U.S. Senate.

{{Rquote|right|If we had met five years ago, you wouldn't have found a more staunch defender of the newspaper industry than me ... I was winning awards, getting raises, lecturing college classes, appearing on TV shows, and judging journalism contests. So how could I possibly agree with people like Noam Chomsky and Ben Bagdikian, who were claiming the system didn't work, that it was steered by powerful special interests and corporations, and existed to protect the power elite? And then I wrote some stories that made me realize how sadly misplaced my bliss had been.

Immediately, denials began to emerge refuting the assertions Webb made in &quot;Dark Alliance.&quot; Reports in the ''The Washington Post|Washington Post'' (Oct 4, 1996), ''Los Angeles Times'', and ''The New York Times|New York Times'' (Oct 21, 1996), tried to debunk the link between the Contras and the crack epidemic.  ''Post'' ombudsman Geneva Overholser agreed with critics that her paper's response to Webb's series showed &quot;misdirected zeal&quot; and &quot;more passion for sniffing out the flaws in San Jose's answer than for sniffing out a better answer themselves.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Would that we had welcomed the surge of public interest as an occasion to return to a subject the Post and the public had given short shrift. Alas, dismissing someone else's story as old news comes more naturally.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Norman Solomon|Solomon, Norman. (Jan./Feb. 1997). &quot;[http://web.archive.org/web/20050211194420/http://www.datafilter.com/mc/c_fairContraCrackCiaDamageControl.html Snow Job]&quot;. ''Extra!''.

Robert Parry, who in 1985 became the first reporter to accuse the Contras of involvement in drug trafficking,[http://www.motherjones.com/news/special_reports/total_coverage/coke.html] wrote that the ''Post'''s denunciation of Webb was ironic, because the paper &quot;had long pooh-poohed earlier allegations that the Contras were implicated in drug shipments&quot; but now &quot;the newspaper was finally accepting the reality of Contra Illegal drug trade|cocaine trafficking, albeit in a backhanded way.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Parry|Parry, Robert. (1996). &quot;[http://www.consortiumnews.com/archive/crack2.html Contra-Crack Story Assailed]&quot;. ''ConsortiumNews.com''. Retrieved Jul. 21, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to these attacks, Webb created a web site that contained primary documents, transcripts, and audio interviews.   By January 1997, Webb's editors no longer contacted him about his stories.  In March, Webb was informed that the paper was going to address the readers about his series.  On May 11, 1997, ''Mercury News'' executive editor Jerry Ceppos published an editorial describing the series as an &quot;important work&quot; and &quot;solidly documented,&quot; but criticized the series for: a reliance on one interpretation of complicated, sometimes-conflicting pieces of evidence; failing to estimate the amount of money involved; for oversimplifying the crack epidemic; and for creating impressions that were open to misinterpretation through imprecise language and graphics.&lt;ref name=Osborn&gt;Osborn, Barbara Bliss.

Retrieved Jul. 21, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  Webb was reassigned to a suburban bureau 150 miles from his home.  Because of the long commute, Webb quit the paper in December 1997. 

Webb alleged that the 1997 backlash was a form of media manipulation.  &quot;The government side of the story is coming through the ''Los Angeles Times'', the ''New York Times'', the ''Washington Post'',&quot; Webb stated.  &quot;They use the giant corporate press rather than saying anything directly. If you work through friendly reporters on major newspapers, it comes off as the ''New York Times'' saying it and not a mouthpiece of the CIA.&quot;&lt;ref name=Osborn/&gt;  James Aucoin, a communications professor who specializes in the history of investigative reporting, wrote: &quot;In the case of Gary Webb's charges against the CIA and the Contras, the major dailies came after him.  Media institutions are now part of the establishment and they have a lot invested in that establishment.&quot;&lt;ref name=Osborn/&gt;

====Book====
In 1999, Seven Stories Press published Webb's ''Dark Alliance: The CIA, the Contras, and the Crack Cocaine Explosion'', complete with extensive source citations.  The book received mixed reviews.

The book includes an account of a meeting between a pilot (who was making drug/arms runs between San Francisco and Costa Rica) with two Contra leaders who were also partners with the San Francisco-based Contra/drug smuggler Norwin Meneses.  According to eyewitnesses, Ivan Gomez, identified by one of the Contras as a CIA agent, was allegedly present at the drug transactions.  The pilot told Hitz that Gomez said he was there to &quot;ensure that the profits from the cocaine went to the Contras and not into someone's pocket.&quot;

According to Webb, Judd Iverson, a San Francisco defense attorney who represented former Contra Julio Zavala, discovered compelling evidence demonstrating that &quot;agents of the U.S. government were intricately involved in sanctioning cocaine trafficking to raise funds for Contra revolutionary activity.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;DarkAlliance&quot;&gt;Webb 1999, pp. 92-95.&lt;/ref&gt;  Soon after, members of the Justice Department persuaded U.S. District Court Judge Robert Peckham to seal the documents in the case.

=== Critics ===
Webb’s reporting on the CIA’s dealings with cocaine dealers was not without its critics. ''The Nation'' magazine contributor David Corn, while crediting him that &quot;it is only because of Webb that US citizens have ''confirmation from the CIA'' that it partnered up with suspected drug traffickers in the just-say-no years and that the Reagan Administration, consumed with a desire to overthrow the Sandinistas in Nicaragua, allied itself with drug thugs,&quot;  also criticized Webb for overstating the case and for not proving &quot;his more cinematic allegations.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenation.com/blogs/capitalgames?bid=3&amp;pid=2066 Gary Webb Is Dead&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Reason (magazine)|Reason'' magazine’s Glenn Garvin was critical of Webb’s sources and of the evidence he presented. Garvin wrote that Webb’s evidence that the Contra leadership was selling cocaine is almost entirely drawn from the claims of a few Nicaraguan traffickers facing long jail terms, and argued that they were using the CIA as a convenient scapegoat. Garvin also wrote that every guerilla group, including the Mujahideen, FARC and Shining Path, has used the narcotics trade as a way of bolstering its funding efforts, and that far from the Contra-related drug trade being widespread it came down to a small handful of Contra pilots and their associates who were involved in narcotics. He also argued that while these covert narcotic relationships were alleged to be most rampant, the Contras had the least need for funds, as the United States was supplying them with millions of dollars a year in support.&lt;ref&gt;[http://reason.com/9901/bk.gg.hookedon.shtml Reason Magazine - Hooked on Fantasies&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Supporters and Corroboration ===
According to historian Mark Fenster,&lt;ref&gt;Fenster, Mark. (2008) Conspiracy Theories: Secrecy and Power in American Culture (revised edition). University of Minnesota Press. 0816654948, pp. 2-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

:[T]he common view among journalists and researchers who have reviewed Webb's stories and have expertise on the Contras and the CIA's role in Nicaragua is that the stories sometimes overstate and overplay the largely testimonial evidence Webb had gathered but were nevertheless neither false nor fantastic. This is true whether the commentators are sympathetic to or critical of Webb. The historical consensus -- to the extent that such a thing is possible concerning controversial covert operations -- indicate that the basic outlines of the ''Mercury News'' stories were largely correct.

In 2006 the LA Times published ''The Truth in `Dark Alliance,’'' in which L.A. Times Managing Editor Leo Wolinsky is quoted saying &quot;in some ways, Gary got too much blame...He did exactly what you expect from a great investigative reporter.&quot; The article surveys mainstream reporting at the time of Webb's pieces and states that while Webb had committed &quot;hyperbole&quot; and included some unproven allegations, articles by the New York Times &quot;didn’t include the success he achieved or the wrongs he righted – and they were considerable&quot; according to  Walt Bogdanich, now a New York Times editor, who had known Webb earlier.

The LA Times piece criticizes its own unfair portrayal of Webb -- &quot;we dropped the ball&quot; -- and notes that &quot;spurred on by Webb’s story, the CIA conducted an internal investigation that acknowledged in March 1998 that the agency had ''covered up Contra drug trafficking for more than a decade''&quot; and concludes that &quot;History will tell if Webb receives the credit he’s due for prodding the CIA to acknowledge its shameful collaboration with drug dealers. Meanwhile, the journalistic establishment is only beginning to recognize that the controversy over “Dark Alliance” had more to do with poor editing than bad reporting [on Webb's part]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2006/aug/18/opinion/oe-schou18 L.A. Times - The truth in `Dark Alliance’]&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in 2005 in the Chicago Tribune, about &quot;the Dangers of Questioning Government Actions,&quot; Don Wycliff, the Tribune's public editor, wrote, &quot;I still think Gary Webb had it mostly right. I think he got the treatment that always comes to those who dare question aloud the bona fides of the establishment: First he got misrepresented -- his suggestion that the CIA tolerated the Contras' cocaine trading became an allegation that the agency itself was involved in the drug trade. Then he was ridiculed as a conspiracy-monger.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.commondreams.org/views05/0106-34.htm Chicago Tribune - Dangers of Questioning Government Actions]&lt;/ref&gt;

Media Critic Norman Solomon's analysis, &quot;The Establishment's Papers Do Damage Control for the CIA,&quot; includes various corroborating evidence that a witch-hunt to discredit Webb was pursued more vigorously than the truth of some of Webb's allegations, including corroboration internal to one such paper, the Washington Post. Notes Solomon&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=1374 FAIR - Snow Job The Establishment's Papers Do Damage Control for the CIA]&lt;/ref&gt;:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Post's ombudsman, Geneva Overholser, was on target (11/10/96) when she re-raised the question of the U.S. government's relationship to drug smuggling and noted that the three newspapers &quot;showed more passion for sniffing out the flaws in San Jose's answer than for sniffing out a better answer themselves.&quot;

Citing &quot;strong previous evidence that the CIA at least chose to overlook contra involvement in the drug trade,&quot; Overholser found &quot;misdirected zeal&quot; in the Post's response to the Mercury News series: &quot;Would that we had welcomed the surge of public interest as an occasion to return to a subject the Post and the public had given short shrift.&quot;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Investigation timeline ===
Facing increasing public scrutiny from the fallout after Webb's &quot;Dark Alliance&quot; series, the CIA conducted its own internal investigations. Investigative journalist Robert Parry credits Webb for being responsible for the following government investigations into the Reagan-Bush administration's conduct of the Contra war:

* On December 10, 1996, Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block announced the conclusion of his investigation into the issue, publishing a summary of the investigation at a press conference.  He announced at the press conference that &quot;We have found no evidence that the government was involved in drug trafficking in South-Central.&quot;  Nevertheless, the report included information that supported some of the charges. Charles Rappleye reported in the ''L.A. Weekly'' that Block's &quot;unequivocal statement is not backed up by the report itself, which raises many questions.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Rappleye, Charles. (Dec. 13, 1996). &quot;[http://www.csun.edu/CommunicationStudies/ben/news/cia/961213.law.html Sherman's Contra-Diction]&quot;. ''LA Weekly''. Retrieved copy of original article Jul. 21, 2006 from California State University Northridge.&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the LAPD investigation centered on allegations made in a postscript article to the newspaper's &quot;Dark Alliance&quot; series.
* On January 29, 1998, Hitz published Volume One of his internal investigation.  This was the first of two CIA reports that eventually substantiated many of Webb's claims about cocaine smugglers, the Nicaraguan contra movement, and their ability to freely operate without the threat of law enforcement.&lt;ref&gt;s:CIA Inspector General Frederick P. Hitz&lt;/ref&gt;
* On March 16, 1998,  Hitz admitted that the CIA had maintained relationships with companies and individuals the CIA knew were involved in the drug business.  Hitz told the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence that &quot;there are instances where CIA did not, in an expeditious or consistent fashion, cut off relationships with individuals supporting the Contra program who were alleged to have engaged in drug-trafficking activity or take action to resolve the allegations.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Pincus, ''Washington Post'', Mar. 17, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Senator John Kerry reached similar conclusions a decade earlier in 1987. (See:&lt;ref name=DLEFP/&gt;)
* On May 7, 1998,  Rep. Maxine Waters, revealed a [http://www.csun.edu/coms/ben/news/cia/7May98/waters2.html memorandum of understanding] between the CIA and the Justice Department from 1982, which was entered into the Congressional Record.  This letter had freed the CIA from legally reporting drug smuggling by CIA assets, a provision that covered the Nicaraguan Contras and the Afghan rebels.[http://www.vcsun.org/%7Ebattias/cia/980507.cr.txt]
* On July 23, 1998, the United States Department of Justice|Justice Department released a report by its Inspector General, Michael R. Bromwich.  The Bromwich report claimed that the Reagan-Bush administration was aware of cocaine traffickers in the Contra movement and did nothing to stop the criminal activity. The report also alleged a pattern of discarded leads and witnesses, sabotaged investigations, instances of the CIA working with drug traffickers, and the discouragement of Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA investigations into Contra-cocaine shipments. The CIA's refusal to share information about Contra drug trafficking with law-enforcement agencies was also documented.  The Bromwich report corroborated Webb's investigation into Norwin Meneses, a Nicaraguan drug smuggler. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}
* On October 8, 1998, CIA I.G. Hitz published Volume Two of his internal investigation.  The report described how the Reagan-Bush administration had protected more than 50 Contras and other drug traffickers, and by so doing thwarted federal investigations into drug crimes. Hitz published evidence that drug trafficking and money laundering had made its way into Reagan's United States National Security Council|National Security Council where Oliver North oversaw the operations of the Contras.[http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB2/nsaebb2.htm]  According to the report, the Contra war took precedence over law enforcement.  To that end, the internal investigation revealed that the CIA routinely withheld evidence of Contra crimes from the Justice Department, Congress and even the analytical division of the CIA itself.  Further, the report confirmed Webb's claims regarding the origins and the relationship of Contra fundraising and drug trafficking.  The report also included information about CIA ties to other drug traffickers not discussed in the Webb series, including [http://www.fas.org/irp/cia/product/cocaine2/south.html#20 Moises Nunez] and [http://www.fas.org/irp/cia/product/cocaine2/other.html#2 Ivan Gomez].  More importantly, the internal CIA report documented a cover-up of evidence which had led to false intelligence assessments.

=== Aftermath and death ===
After leaving ''San Jose Mercury News'' Webb went to work for the California Assembly Speaker's Office of Member Services and served as a consultant to the California State legislature Task Force on Government Oversight.

[[Image:Cannabis 01 bgiu.jpg|thumb|right|Marijuana (''Cannabis sativa'')]]

The recent history of '''Cannabis in California''' comprises a number of legislative, legal, and cultural events surrounding use of marijuana, hashish, and cannabis. California was the first state to establish a Medical cannabis program, enacted by '''Proposition 215''' in 1996 and '''California Senate Bill 420'''. Prop. 215, also known as the ''&quot;Compassionate Use Act&quot;'', was approved by initiative with a 55% majority, allowing people with cancer, AIDS and other chronic illnesses the right to grow or obtain marijuana for medical purposes when recommended by a doctor. SB 420, or the '''Medical Marijuana Protection Act''', was signed into law by Governor Gray Davis and established an identification card system for medical marijuana patients.

In 2009, Tom Ammiano introduced the Marijuana Control, Regulation, and Education Act, which would remove penalties under state law for the cultivation, drug possession, and use of marijuana for persons over the age of 21. When the Assembly Public Safety Committee approved the bill on a 4 to 3 vote in January 2010, this marked the first time in United States history that a bill legalizing marijuana passed a legislative committee. While the legislation failed to reach the Assembly floor, Ammiano stated his plans to reintroduce the bill later in the year, depending on the success of '''California Proposition 19''', the ''Regulate, Control and Tax Cannabis Act'', which appeared on the November 2010 ballot.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/mar/29/local/la-me-banks30-2010mar30|title=Pot breaks the age barrier|last=Banks|first=Sandy|date=March 29, 2010|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=March 31, 2010|publisher=Tribune Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the proposition lost 46% to 54%. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.taxcannabis.org/index.php/pages/initiative/&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 30th, 2010, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger signed into law CA State Senate Bill 1449, effectively reducing the charge of possession of up to one ounce of cannabis from a misdemeanor to a violation, similar to a traffic violation, with a $100 fine and no mandatory court appearance or criminal record.&lt;ref&gt; http://dl5.activatedirect.com/fs/distribution:letterFile/yvcee9xanplikz_files/z65ij4mzqc9pon?&amp;_c=d%7Cyvcee9xanplikz%7Cz65p1zm6c0d0km&amp;_ce=1285923483.e22c10cbdfb613cdd335475c0f46b779&lt;/ref&gt; The law became effective January 1, 2011.

==Legality==
===Decriminalization===
In 1973, California's neighboring state of Oregon became the first state to decriminalize cannabis.&lt;ref name=Slate&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/id/1007088/|title=Which States Have Decriminalized Marijuana Possession?|date=February 14, 2001|accessdate=January 15, 2010|first=Chris|last=Suellentrop|work=Slate (magazine)|Slate|publisher=The Washington Post Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; While laws vary from state to state, decriminalization of marijuana (which treats the drug possession of small amounts of the drug as a civil, rather than a criminal, offense) was established in July 1976 when the California State Legislature passed Senate Bill 95.&lt;ref name=Slate/&gt;&lt;ref name=Crime&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=3ahzoZhXyQwC&amp;pg=PA249&amp;lpg=PA249&amp;dq=California+%22SB+95%22+marijuana&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=cZMHxYRdoq&amp;sig=VW-Zjl7Vo6k1Af9Mwq0Z9fHmvTI&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=pCRRS8TkE4_itgOe6vTkBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CBwQ6AEwBDgU#v=onepage&amp;q=California%20%22SB%2095%22%20marijuana&amp;f=false|title=Crime: Critical Concepts in Sociology|accessdate=January 15, 2010|pages=249–250|year=2003|editor=Philip Bean|publisher=Routledge | isbn=9780415252676}}&lt;/ref&gt; California Proposition 19 (1972)|Proposition 19, a California ballot proposition|ballot proposition previously attempting to decriminalize marijuana, was defeated in November 1972 state election by a 66.5% majority.&lt;ref name=CA1972&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=1pwMAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=5l8DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2700,1007395&amp;dq=california+marijuana+decriminalization&amp;hl=en|title=Marijuana: Political future in California?|date=June 2, 1973|accessdate=January 15, 2010|first=Kevin|last=Phillips|work=St. Petersburg Times|publisher=Times Publishing Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; SB 95 made possession one ounce (28.5&amp;nbsp;grams) of marijuana a misdemeanor punishable by a $100 fine, with higher punishments for amounts greater than one ounce, for possession on school grounds, or for cultivation.&lt;ref name=NORML&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.norml.com/index.cfm?wtm_view=&amp;Group_ID=4525|title=California - NORML|accessdate=January 15, 2010|publisher=National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''California Proposition 36''' (also known as the ''Substance Abuse and Crime Prevention Act of 2000'') was approved by 61% of voters, requiring that &quot;first and second-offense drug violators be sent to drug treatment programs instead of facing trial and possible incarceration.&quot;&lt;ref name=Prop36&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2000/11/15/MN108231.DTL|title=Money, Opinion Propelled Prop. 36|first=Bill|last=Wallace|date=November 15, 2000|accessdate=January 15, 2010|work=San Francisco Chronicle}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marijuana remains decriminalized in California today.&lt;ref name=NORML/&gt;

===Medical marijuana===
[[Image:Medical-marijuana-sign.jpg|thumb|right|Medical marijuana sign at a dispensary on Ventura Boulevard in Los Angeles, California]]

California's Medical medical marijuana program was established when state voters approved California Proposition 215 (also known as the Compassionate Use Act of 1996)&lt;ref name=CACodes&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=hsc&amp;group=11001-12000&amp;file=11357-11362.9|title=Health and Safety Code Section 11357-11362.9|publisher=California State Legislature|accessdate=January 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the November 5, 1996 ballot with a 55% majority.&lt;ref name=MedicalMarijuana&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nctimes.com/news/local/article_46eee9d6-f440-539f-8ec7-c1052fc0b917.html|title=County, medical marijuana users head to showdown|first=Gig|last=Conaughton|date=November 12, 2006|accessdate=January 12, 2010|work=North County Times|publisher=Lee Enterprises}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposition added Section 11362.5 to the California Health and Safety Code, modifying state law to allow people with cancer, anorexia, AIDS, spasticity, glaucoma, arthritis, migraines or other chronic illnesses the &quot;legal right to obtain or grow, and use marijuana for medical purposes when recommended by a doctor&quot;. The law also mandated that doctors not be punished for recommending the drug, and required that Federal government of the United States|federal and State governments of the United States|state governments work together &quot;to implement a plan to provide for the safe and affordable distribution of marijuana to all patients in medical need.&quot;&lt;ref name=CACodes/&gt;&lt;ref name=MedicalMarijuana/&gt; Proposition 215 does not affect federal law, which still prohibits the cultivation and possession of marijuana.

Vague wording became a major criticism of Prop. 215, though the law has since been clarified through the Supreme Court of California's rulings and the passage of subsequent laws. In January, 2010, the California Supreme Court ruled that the amendments to Prop 215 were illegally done, and all limits on medical marijuana in California were lifted. Presently, within the state of California, Medical Marijuana users with a valid Doctors recommendation may grow and possess as much marijuana as they require, provided that it is strictly for personal use (as was clarified and published in the LA Times){{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}. Currently there is a bill waiting for California voters this November (Proposition 19) that would effectively make possession and cultivation of marijuana legal for everyone over the age of 21, and would regulate it similarly to alcohol. If passed, Proposition 19 would not only provide much needed revenue for the Californian budget, but would virtually eliminate marijuana grown illegally on public lands, removing the threat of hikers, hunters, fishermen and others walking into illegal grow operations and quite possibly boobytraps setup by illegal growers. California's Proposition 19 has the support of many law enforcement agencies as it would free up much needed resources and allow them to direct them into areas of law enforcement that they are really needed, such as the eradication of illegal drug labs where methamphetamine is manufactured.&lt;ref name=History&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/sunletters/la-oew-gutwillig-imler6-2009mar06,1,7457273,full.story|title=Medical marijuana in California: a history|first1=Scott|last1=Imler|first2=Stephen|last2=Gutwillig|date=March 6, 2009|accessdate=January 12, 2010|work=Los Angeles Times|publisher=Tribune Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; To differentiate patients from non-patients, Governor Gray Davis signed California Senate Bill 420 (also known as the Medical Marijuana Protection Act) in 2003, establishing an identification card system for medical marijuana patients. SB 420 also allows for the formation of patient collectives, or non-profit organizations, to provide the drug to patients.&lt;ref name=Support&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sacramentopress.com/headline/16900/Support_for_the_legalization_of_cannabis_grows|title=Support for the legalization of cannabis grows|date=October 31, 2009|accessdate=January 12, 2010|first=David Watts|last=Barton|work=Sacramento Press|publisher=Castle Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Medical marijuana ID cards are issued through the California Department of Public Health's Medical Marijuana Program (MMP).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cdph.ca.gov/programs/MMP/Pages/Medical%20Marijuana%20Program.aspx|title=Medical Marijuana Program|publisher=California Department of Public Health|accessdate=January 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program began in three counties in May 2005, and expanded statewide in August of the same year. 37, 236 cards have been issued throughout 55 counties as of December 2009.&lt;ref name=MMPStatistics&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cdph.ca.gov/programs/MMP/Documents/Web%20Fact%20Sheet%2012-14-09.pdf|title=California Department of Public Health Medical Marijuana Program (MMP) Facts and Figures|format=Portable Document Format|PDF|accessdate=January 12, 2010|date=December 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of California's program argue that marijuana has become quasi-legal, as &quot;anyone can obtain a recommendation for medical marijuana at any time for practically any ailment&quot;.&lt;ref name=History/&gt; Acknowledging that there are instances in which the system is abused and that laws could be improved, Stephen Gutwillig of the Drug Policy Alliance Network&lt;ref name=Committee&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/breaking-news/ci_14173190?nclick_check=1|title=Committee passes marijuana legalization bill|date=January 12, 2010|accessdate=January 12, 2010|first=Steven|last=Harmon|work=San Jose Mercury News|publisher=MediaNews Group}}&lt;/ref&gt; insists that the passages of Proposition 215 is &quot;nothing short of incredible&quot;. Gutwillig argues that because of the law, 200,000 patients in the state now have safe and affordable access to medical marijuana to relieve pain and treat medical conditions, without having to risk arrest or buy the drug off the black market.&lt;ref name=History/&gt; Twelve other U.S. states have followed California's lead to enact medical marijuana laws of their own: Alaska, Colorado, Hawaii, Maine, Michigan Compassionate Care Initiative|Michigan, Montana, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon Medical Marijuana Act|Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington.&lt;ref name=MMStates&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.modbee.com/local/story/122848.html|title=Medical pot users seek help in theft|date=November 16, 2007|accessdate=January 12, 2010|first=Milie|last=Raguso|work=The Modesto Bee|publisher=The McClatchy Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legalization of non-medical cannabis===
On February 23, 2009,&lt;ref name=AB390&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/09-10/bill/asm/ab_0351-0400/ab_390_bill_20090223_introduced.html|title=AB 390 - Assembly Bill|publisher=California State Legislature|accessdate=January 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; California State Assemblyman Tom Ammiano (Democrat) introduced the '''Marijuana Control, Regulation, and Education Act''', a proposed bill that would &quot;remove all penalties under California law for the cultivation, transportation, sale, purchase, possession, and use of marijuana, natural THC and paraphernalia by persons over the age of 21&quot; and &quot;prohibit local and state law enforcement officials from enforcing federal marijuana laws&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/comments_blog/2009/02/marijuana-legal.html|title=Could Measure AB 390 put a 360 on California's budget woes?|date=February 24, 2009|accessdate=January 12, 2010|work=Los Angeles Times|publisher=Tribune Company|first=Tony|last=Pierce}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill would help with battling the 2008–2010 California budget crisis by allowing the state to regulate and tax its sale at $50 per ounce.&lt;ref name=Time&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1884956,00.html|title=Can Marijuana Help Rescue California's Economy?|date=March 13, 2009|accessdate=January 12, 2010|first=Alison|last=Stateman|work=Time (magazine)|Time|publisher=Time Inc.|Time Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''Time'' magazine, California tax collectors estimate the bill would raise about $1.3 billion a year in revenue.

Critics such as John Lovell, lobbyist for the California Peace Officers' Association, argue that too many people already struggle with alcohol and drug abuse, and legalizing another Psychoactive drug|mind-altering substance would lead to a &quot;surge&quot; of use, making problems worse.&lt;ref name=Time/&gt; Apart from helping the state's budget by enforcing a tax on the sale of cannabis, proponents of the bill argue that legalization will reduce the amount of criminal activity associated with the drug. Orange County Superior Court Judge James Gray estimates that eliminating arrests, prosecutions, and imprisonment for nonviolent offenders due to legalization could save the state $1 billion a year.&lt;ref name=Time/&gt;

The bill was delayed until January 2010, when the Assembly Public Safety Committee approved the bill on a 4 to 3 vote—this marked the first time in United States history that a bill legalizing marijuana passed a legislative committee.&lt;ref name=Committee/&gt; However, the bill was unable to move forward to the Health Committee, where it was required to be heard before reaching the Assembly floor, before the January 15 deadline for proposed 2009 legislation. Ammiano plans to re-introduce the bill later this month or wait to see how a ballot measure for legalization fares in November 2010.&lt;ref name=Committee/&gt;

There were three separate marijuana related initiatives put forth to qualify for the California state elections, November 2010|November 2010 elections. Two of these failed to gather the required number of signatures.

On March 24, 2010 California Proposition 19, titled the '''&quot;Regulate, Control and Tax Cannabis Act&quot;''', qualified for the November ballot for the State of California.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/mar/29/local/la-me-banks30-2010mar30|title=Pot breaks the age barrier|last=Banks|first=Sandy|date=March 29, 2010|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=March 31, 2010|publisher=Tribune Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; If it had passed, this initiative would have legalized marijuana in California and allowed local governments to tax and regulate the sale of marijuana and its related activities.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.taxcannabis.org/index.php/pages/initiative/&lt;/ref&gt; However, the proposal was defeated during the November 2 election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vote.sos.ca.gov/maps/ballot-measures/19/|title=CA Secretary of State: Results for Proposition 19|date=November 7, 2010|publisher=Secretary of State|Secretary of State's office|accessdate=November 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But I see no reason why you couldn't add metric units ''in addition'' to the existing ones. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|discuss]]&lt;/small&gt; 04:47, 25 February 2011 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Identifying Conics ==
Conics are reasonably easy to graph if they are given in their standard form. Unfortunately, this is often not the case. Conics can be represented by polynomials of the form: &lt;math&gt;Ax^2 + Bxy +Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0&lt;/math&gt;, and to graph these it is necessary to convert them back to their standard form. Before you do this, though, the formula: &lt;math&gt;B^2 -4AC&lt;/math&gt; can be used to determine the type of conic from the original equation before you start graphing:
* &lt;math&gt;B^2 -4AC = 0&lt;/math&gt;: Parabola
* &lt;math&gt;B^2 -4AC &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt;: Ellipse
* &lt;math&gt;B^2 -4AC &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;: Hyperbola

Firstly, if B is not zero then the graph represents a rotated conic. Follow the instructions given on [[Conic_Sections/Rotation_of_Axes|Rotation of Axes]] to determine how to convert this to a non-rotated form. Then convert this to the standard form of a conic as detailed later in this section, and graph it on a set of axes at the appropriate angle to the x- and y- axes.

If B is equal to zero, then use completing the square and algebraic manipulation to obtain standard forms of the conics.

=== Examples ===
==== Example 1: (Ellipse) &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{9}x^2+\frac{1}{25}y^2-\frac{2}{3}x-\frac{8}{25}y+\frac{16}{25}=0&lt;/math&gt; ====
It is first necessary to complete the square for the x and y terms. First we will start with x. While it appears that in this case b is &lt;math&gt;-\frac{2}{3}&lt;/math&gt;, you must remember that the coefficient of &lt;math&gt;x^2&lt;/math&gt; must be equal to 1. Therefore:
&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{9}x^2-\frac{2}{3}x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;=\frac{1}{9}[x^2-6x]&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Now, b = -6. &lt;math&gt;(\frac{b}{2})^2=(\frac{-6}{2})^2=9&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;=\frac{1}{9}[x^2-6x+9-9]&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;=\frac{1}{9}[(x-3)^2-9]&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;=\frac{1}{9}(x-3)^2-1&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Doing the same for the y:
&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{25}y^2-\frac{8}{25}y&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;=\frac{1}{25}[y^2-8y]&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Now, b = -8. &lt;math&gt;(\frac{b}{2})^2=(\frac{-8}{2})^2=16&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;=\frac{1}{25}[y^2-8y+16-16]&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;=\frac{1}{25}[(y-4)^2-16]&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;=\frac{1}{25}(y-4)^2-\frac{16}{25}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
These can then be placed back into the original equation:
&lt;math&gt;(\frac{1}{9}(x-3)^2-1)+(\frac{1}{25}(y-4)^2-\frac{16}{25})+\frac{16}{25}=0&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Which simplifies to &lt;math&gt;\frac{(x-3)^2}{9}+\frac{(y-4)^2}{25}=1&lt;/math&gt; Which is the standard form for an ellipse. To check our answer, we can use the formula &lt;math&gt;B^2 -4AC&lt;/math&gt; getting the values from the original equation. Substituting these in gives: &lt;math&gt;(0)^2 -4(\frac{1}{9})(\frac{1}{25})=-\frac{4}{225}&lt;/math&gt; which is less than zero. Therefore the conic is an ellipse, confirming our previous answer.

==== Example 2: &lt;math&gt;Circle&lt;/math&gt; ====
==== Example 3: &lt;math&gt;Parabola&lt;/math&gt; ====
==== Example 4: &lt;math&gt;Hyperbola&lt;/math&gt; ====
==== Example 5: (Rotated Ellipse) &lt;math&gt;6x^2 + \sqrt{3}xy+7y^2-36=0&lt;/math&gt; ====
The fact that it has an xy term means that this is a rotated conic. The angle that it has been rotated is given by: &lt;math&gt;tan 2\theta = \frac{B}{A-C}=\frac{(\sqrt{3})}{(6)-(7)}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Therefore &lt;math&gt;2\theta=atan \frac{(\sqrt{3})}{(6)-(7)}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;2\theta=atan -\sqrt{3}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;2\theta=\frac{-\pi}{3}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\theta=\frac{-\pi}{6}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This tells you that the conic has been rotated &lt;math&gt;-\frac{\pi}{6}&lt;/math&gt; radians, or -30°, anticlockwise, which is the same as &lt;math&gt;\frac{\pi}{6}&lt;/math&gt; radians or 30° clockwise about the origin.&lt;br /&gt;
You can then make the following substitutions to obtain the polynomial for an identical, non-rotated conic:
* &lt;math&gt;x = X cos \theta - Y sin \theta&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;y = X sin \theta + Y cos \theta&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In this case, &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;-\frac{\pi}{6}&lt;/math&gt;. Make sure you do not confuse the sign as this will make further calculations invalid. the value for the angle used is always the amount anti-clockwise. Therefore, substituting &lt;math&gt;\theta = -\frac{\pi}{6}&lt;/math&gt; into the previous will give you:
* &lt;math&gt;x = X cos \frac{-\pi}{6} - Y sin \frac{-\pi}{6}&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;y = X sin \frac{-\pi}{6} + Y cos \frac{-\pi}{6}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Which simplifies to 
* &lt;math&gt;x = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}X - \frac{1}{2}Y &lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;y = -\frac{1}{2}X + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}Y&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
When these are substituted into the rotated equation, you get:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;6(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}X - \frac{1}{2}Y)^2 + \sqrt{3}(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}X - \frac{1}{2}Y)(-\frac{1}{2}X + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}Y)+7(-\frac{1}{2}X + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}Y)^2-36=0&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Expanding the brackets gives:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;6(\frac{3}{4}X^2+\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}XY+\frac{1}{4}Y^2)+\sqrt{3}(-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}X^2+\frac{1}{2}XY+\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}Y)+7(\frac{1}{4}X^2-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}XY+\frac{3}{4}Y^2)-36=0&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
When you expand the brackets and collect like terms, you end up with:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;(6\times\frac{3}{4}+\sqrt{3}\times\frac{-\sqrt{3}}{4}+7\times\frac{1}{4})X^2+(6\times\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}+\sqrt{3}\times\frac{1}{2}+7\times\frac{-\sqrt{3}}{2})XY+(6\times\frac{1}{4}+\sqrt{3}\times\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}+7\times\frac{3}{4})Y^2-36=0&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Which simplifies to:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\frac{11}{2}X^2+0XY+\frac{15}{2}Y^2-36=0&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The fact that there is now no XY term means that this is an equation for a non-rotated conic. Now all that remains is a little algebraic manipulation to get it into its standard form:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\frac{11}{2}X^2+\frac{15}{2}Y^2=36&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\frac{X^2}{\frac{2}{11}}+\frac{Y^2}{\frac{2}{15}}=36&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\frac{X^2}{\frac{2}{11}\times36}+\frac{Y^2}{\frac{2}{15}\times36}=1&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\frac{X^2}{\frac{72}{11}}+\frac{Y^2}{\frac{24}{5}}=1&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Which is the standard form of an ellipse which you can use to find the axis lengths, eccentricity, foci and anything else. Remember though that this must be graphed at the angle found earlier of &lt;math&gt;\frac{-\pi}{6}&lt;/math&gt; to the x-axis. You can use the same formulae from above to find the rotated location of points from the non-rotated ellipse:&lt;br /&gt;
The point (x,y) when rotated by an angle of &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; about the origin becomes (X,Y) where:
* &lt;math&gt;X = x cos \theta + y sin \theta&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;Y = -x sin \theta + y cos \theta&lt;/math&gt;

      <comment>/* Short Term Memory */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Memory ==
One of the most common depiction of hypnosis in todays media is its use to recall past events, but there is more to it than that. This section will attempt to provide a framework to understand how [[w:Memory|memory]] is stored and how to make use of that faculty of the brain under hypnosis.

Memories can be said to be stored in seven dimensions, the normal three dimensions plus time, smell, taste and emotions. Not all persons are capable of the same capacity in regards to the observation and storage of the memories. For instance age, sex, duration and number of repetitions (even of similar experiences) will have a distinct influence on the accuracy of the recollection of these variables. Emotional memory seems to be the stronger variable, emotions attached to memories are what makes them have a meaning, a value.

One need also to comprehend that memories are stored in a biological medium, that depends not on chemical reactions to induce physical restructure in the brain. Our brains have regions dedicated to tasks (processing of information) but also to memory that ultimately can be defined as the processes by which information is utilized.

{{TODO|Cover [[w:Protein kinase M zeta/Protein kinase C zeta|PKCζ]] (in memory model) [http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/notrocketscience/2011/03/03/exposing-the-memory-engine-the-story-of-pkmzeta/ advances Exposing the memory engine: the story of PKMzeta], [http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/70519/title/Enzyme_revives_long-term_memories Enzyme revives long-term memories Boosting levels in the brain helps rats remember old times], [http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/06/health/research/06brain.html Brain Researchers Open Door to Editing Memory].}} 

=== Memory vs Imagination ===
Memory is also close related to imagination and visualization. As we will discuss later on, people diverge in how they visualize events, some can see images as in watching a movie or a photo others can only get a sensation about the form, they can &quot;imagine&quot; but they cannot &quot;see&quot;, this is valid also to the other variables, some people will be more aware of emotions, smells or tastes than others. The brain also has the tendency to fill any blanks and inconsistencies of a memory by making use of the imagination using similitudes with any other memories or even adding details only due to the expectation of their presence even more if any external reinforcement is given, even if in an subconscious way.

;'''Creativity'''
Memory and mental visualization are the core of the creativity, it is using free association, extrapolation and deduction that new concepts are developed. Imagination only on it broader sense can be said to be an act of creating something new, more often than not it is a simply the recollection of a stored memory within a new idealized context.

=== Type of memory ===
The prevailing model ([[w:cognitive architecture|cognitive architecture]]), named [[w:ACT-R|ACT-R]] (pronounced ''act-ARE'': Adaptive Control of Thought—Rational) was mainly developed by [[w:John Robert Anderson (psychologist)|John Robert Anderson]] at [[w:Carnegie Mellon University|Carnegie Mellon University]] and divides long-term memory into [[w:declarative memory|declarative (explicit)]] and [[w:procedural memory|procedural (implicit)]] memories.

[[w:Declarative memory|Declarative memory]] requires conscious recall effort, in that some conscious process must call back the information. It is sometimes called ''[[w:explicit memory|explicit memory]]'', since it consists of information that is explicitly stored and retrieved.

Declarative memory can be further sub-divided into [[w:semantic memory|semantic memory]], which concerns facts taken independent of context; and [[w:episodic memory|episodic memory]], which concerns information specific to a particular context, such as a time and place. Semantic memory allows the encoding of abstract knowledge about the world, such as &quot;Paris is the capital of France&quot;. Episodic memory, on the other hand, is used for more personal memories, such as the sensations, emotions, and personal associations of a particular place or time. [[w:Autobiographical memory|Autobiographical memory]] (memory for particular events within one's own life) is generally viewed as either equivalent to, or a subset of, episodic memory. [[w:Visual memory|Visual memory]] is part of memory preserving some characteristics of our senses pertaining to visual experience. One is able to place in memory information that resembles objects, places, animals or people in sort of a mental image. Since visual memory can also enable indirect priming (activating related memories) it is assumed some kind of perceptual representational system underlies this phenomenon. The pathways of importance seems to be the medial [[w:temporal lobe|temporal lobe]].

In contrast, [[w:procedural memory|procedural memory]] (or ''[[w:implicit memory|implicit memory]]''), often referred muscle memory, is not based on the conscious recall of information, but on implicit learning. Procedural memory is primarily employed in learning motor skills and should be considered a subset of implicit memory. It is revealed when one does better in a given task due only to repetition - no new explicit memories have been formed, but one is unconsciously accessing aspects of those previous experiences. Procedural memory involved in [[w:motor learning|motor learning]] depends on the [[w:cerebellum|cerebellum]] and [[w:basal ganglia|basal ganglia]].

{{NOTE|Procedural memory has a specific importance for instance in the context of [[Hypnosis/Chapters/Uses#Sports|hypnosis applied to sports]].}}

'''Topographic memory''' (a subset of [[w:Spatial memory|spatial memory]]) is the ability to orient oneself in space, to recognize and follow an itinerary, or to recognize familiar places. Getting lost when traveling alone is an example of the failure of topographic memory. This is often reported among elderly patients who are evaluated for dementia. The disorder could be caused by multiple impairments, including difficulties with perception, orientation, and memory.

'''Flashbulb memories''' are clear [[w:episodic memories|episodic memories]] of unique and highly emotional events, often traumatic. For instance remembering where you were or what you were doing when you first heard the news of 9/11.

=== New memories ===
Hypnosis can create new memories but the subject has to be able to accept them as valid (interiorize) to incorporate them into his reality, in most cases this can only be archived if there is a strong predisposition to do so. In any case, memory alteration of any kind, it is generally accepted as dangerous and can have unforeseen consequences. Memories more than any other aspect is what defines us.

{{NOTE|New memories in this context do not refer to the shaping of perception of an event, but the full synthesizing of a false memorized experience.}}

Memories are created and accessed by generic but different internal phases:
*Cognitive apprehension.
*Storage (Encoding done via associative, referencing and correlation processes).
*Recall.

In the next section we will look on how memories stored.Cognitive apprehension was already covered in the previous chapter, in the [[Hypnosis/Chapters/Mind#Self_and_reality|section about self and reality]].

=== Storage ===
[[w:Storage (memory)|Memory storage]], the retention of information, is achieved through the encoding process. There seems to be two distinct types of memory storage, '''short term memory''' and '''long term memory''' and there are several varieties proposed memory models.

It is hard to define each memory operation as insulated tasks, like for instance in computers, biological memory are fuzzy in nature they seems to have specific qualities like strength and priority, something that digital memory does not replicate. One interesting parallelism that does seems exist is locational optimization, that is depending the type of memory they have specific locations on the brain, this occurs in a way that it is very similar to digital systems, as a way to optimize communication between subsystems.

{{NOTE|Hypnosis can shape perception, by exponentiating, creating or removing sensory and emotional information.}} 

Memory is associative by nature, commonalities will not only reinforce old memories and serve to ease establishing new ones. A study from Northwestern University verified that sound can help the creation of stronger memory. That if a sound is present when committing something to memory, playing that same sound later will also reinforce the memory, even while sleeping in a modest way (not to be confused with Sleep-learning that we covered before). This is an example of anchoring (creation of the connection between to simultaneous events) and priming (activating the association). 

==== Short Term Memory ====
[[w:Short-term memory|Short-term memory]] refers to the memory of the immediate past, a short duration of time, that seems to be continuously deteriorating. In the process of memory encoding, all input events, after several layers of filtering, will first enter the brain's short-term memory.

{{NOTE|It is important to distinguish that consciously and subconsciously, memorized events are related but the particulars that have been not consciously perceived will less importance to the conscious mind. Some of the information processing is done subconsciously for example correlation and similitudes occur without a conscious effort.}} 

Short-term memory will degrade in a short time, if not refreshed by any subsequent memory operation. Studies suggest that the conscious capacity of the short-term memory for storage is approximately seven &quot;focal&quot; items, plus or minus two. It may depend on the type (modality) and complexity of the event and so this limit may be subject to a larger variability.

There are chemical way to prevent the formation of new memories ('''[[w:Anterograde amnesia|Anterograde amnesia]]'''). For instance the drug [[w:Midazolam|Midazolam]] (marketed in English-speaking countries under the trade names Dormicum, Hypnovel or Versed) is used in surgery to inhibit unpleasant memories formation.

{{NOTE|This control over memory formation we start to have can be extremely illusory considering that we still have a limited understanding on memory operations, just because one is not conscientious of the what transpired, subconsciously there may be implications that are not as easily to detect. Just because one can not remember an event, one has never the less experienced it.}}

The most powerful methodology is to guide the subconscious to perform the memory refreshing of the information, this is best done using incomplete patterns. Like the jingle that from time to time will return to our mind out of nowhere by using an interrupted pattern of attractive bit of information, especially if the expected outcome/conclusion is thwarted, the operator can introduce other ideas and piggy back on the effort that the subconscious will make to make sense of the data, this works even outside of trance and is often used in commercials that will convey an incomplete event or build up for an event that never happens on screen or goes completely against what was expected.

One could even speculate that this capability, cognitive response is an evolutionary trait that is linked to the development of human culture. As we have seen in the history chapter, storytelling can create trance states, this boost to memorization may have been been important to early humans as to preserve oral lore and promote survivability. Under trance the effect is potentiated. Using hypnosis there is a limited control over short-term memory or natural memory creation outside of previous conditioning, for instance hypnosis can be used to alter immediate perceptions of events, even their suppression or making them stronger, especially by linking them to emotions.

==== Long Term Memory ====
[[w:Long-term memory|Long-term memory]], is all information that is held for a prolonged period of time. Short-term memory that the subconscious agrees to define as important is moved to this type of long duration storage, that is more vast but more costly for direct consciously access. Some models assume long-term memory is capable of unlimited memory, but there may be some limits it all seems to hinge on subsequent processes that optimizes not only storage but access, in a way that is similar to a lose digital compression (details may be dropped) and correlations and similitudes are used to reduce duplication. Because there is no specific way to consciously assess all that is memorized some models defend that memory may not be permanent at all and that unless memory is occasionally recalled, it degrades to a point that it is no longer remembered.

;'''Sleep'''
Today it is commonly accepted that one of the functions of sleep, and dreams is to process and optimize memory storage, even to preemptively create responses to hypothetical scenarios extrapolated from our experiences. 
While we sleep, the brain categorizes, discards and analyses recent memories, not only of past events or experiences but every recent thought it decides as important.

{{NOTE|A 2011 study at University of Tübingen in Germany by [http://www.kfg.uni-luebeck.de/html/gb/born.htm Prof. Dr. J. Born], demonstrated that sleep and an expectation of a test will increase the memory recall of relevant data. Source: [http://www.jneurosci.org/ Journal of Neuroscience, DOI 10.1523/jneurosci.3575-10.2011]}}

=== Recall ===
Memory recall capabilities also varies hugely from individual to individual, and also depends ultimately on how strongly memories have been stored and accessed, emotional states do have a high importance on the moment of memory created as it is believed that strong emotional experiences will help to create long lasting memories. Emotional or physical pain, more so than emotional pleasure or physical pleasure these are often linked to cravings and often dependency.  Recollecting (reactivating) a memory will make it stronger.

Physical pain and pleasure can also build resistance on how the brain processes the inputs. Emotional pleasure driven memories when linked to physical pain or physical discomfort can also bypass the expectation that an individual would avoid the repetition of a painful or uncomfortable experience.   

As we have already discussed memory comes in two major distinct forms, short term and long term, this types of memory are not only distinct in how they are managed by the brain they have also have different qualities. There is of course sub-levels, for instance we may recall an address for some hours or a day, or for instance a movie plot memory will become to decay in a few weeks, after a while only very specific sequences can be easily recalled, on the other hand most highly emotional memories will tend to remain with us for the rest of our lives.

It is also interesting to mention the reports of total life experience recall that some people report after being in a near death situation. Britain's Royal Navy Rear Admiral Sir [[w:Francis Beaufort|Francis Beaufort]] (1774 – 1857), inventor of the [[w:Beaufort scale|Beaufort scale]], reports while writing about his near death experience in an almost fatal drowning accident after a fall off a boat in Portsmouth harbor on June 10, 1791 ([http://books.google.pt/books?id=9x_VAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA499 full text]).

{{Quotation| &quot;Though the senses were thus deadened, not so the mind; its activity seemed to be invigorated in a ratio which defies all description—for thought rose after thought with a rapidity of succession that is not only indescribable, but probably inconceivable, by any one who has not himself been in a similar situation. The course of those thoughts I can even now in a great measure retrace—the event which had just taken place, the awkwardness that had produced it—the bustle it must have occasioned (for J had observed two persons jump from the chains)—the effect it would have on a most affectionate father—the manner in which he would disclose it to the rest of the family—and a thousand other circumstances minutely associated with home, were the first series of reflections that occurred. They took then a wider range—our last cruise—a former voyage, and shipwreck—my school—the progress I had made there, and the time I misspent —and even all my boyish pursuits and adventures. Thus travelling backwards, every past incident of my life seemed to glance across my recollection in retrograde succession; not, however, in mere outline, as here stated, but the picture filled up with every minute and collateral feature; in short, the whole period of my existence seemed to be placed before me in a kind of panoramic review, and each act of it seemed to he accompanied by some reflection on its cause, or its consequences ; indeed, many trifling events which had been long forgotten then crowded into my imagination, and with the character of recent familiarity.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&quot;May not all this be some indication of the almost infinite power of memory with which we may awaken in another world, and thus be compelled to contemplate our past lives? Or might it not in some degree warrant the inference that death is only a change or modification of our existence, in which there is no real pause or interruption * But, however that may be, one circumstance was highly remarkable; that the innumerable ideas which flashed into my mind were all retrospective—yet I had been religiously brought up—my hopes and fears of the next world had lost nothing of their early strength, and at any other period intense interest and awful anxiety would have been excited by the mere probability that I was floating on the threshold of eternity: yet at that inexplicable moment when I had a full conviction that I had already crossed the threshold, not a single thought wandered into the future—I was wrapped entirely in the past.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&quot;The length of time that was occupied by this deluge of ideas, or rather the shortness of time into which they were condensed, I cannot now state with precision, yet certainly two minutes could not have elapsed from the moment of suffocation to that of my being hauled up.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;}}

It then becomes hard to state concisely what the limits of our memory is, it seems however that the limit is vastly superior to what we in our everyday can access.

{{NOTE|This near death memory recall events have been tentatively explained by an ''in extremis'' subconscious attempt of the mind to find a match in a past experiences to the situation ones is now living.}}

A study by Benton H. Pierce and David A. Gallo also indicate that visual memory is stronger than auditory memory and the degree of recollection is also increased using visualization activation. (See 2011 paper {{PDFlink|[http://memorylab.uchicago.edu/pdf/Pierce_2011.pdf Encoding Modality Can Affect Memory Accuracy via Retrieval Orientation]}})

==== Priming ====
[[w:Priming (psychology)|Priming]] is an implicit memory effect of reactivation of a memory/concept on exposure to a stimulus that has a mental correlation. It can occur following perceptual, semantic, or conceptual stimulus repetition. For example, if a person reads a list of words including the word table, and is later asked to complete a word starting with tab, the probability that he or she will answer table is greater than if not so primed. Another example is if people see an incomplete sketch that they are unable to identify and they are shown more of the sketch until they recognize the picture, later they will identify the sketch at an earlier stage than was possible for them the first time.

The effects of priming can be very salient and long lasting, even more so than simple recognition memory. Unconscious priming effects can affect word choice on a word-stem completion test long after the words have been consciously forgotten.

Priming works best when the two stimuli are in the same modality. For example visual priming works best with visual cues and verbal priming works best with verbal cues. But priming also occurs between modalities, or between semantically related words such as &quot;doctor&quot; and &quot;nurse&quot;.

Priming is extremely important in hypnosis from the choice of words to the creation of reactive stimuli, anchors and triggers.

{{TODO|Possible transclusion of the Wikipedia article.}}

==== Memories as emotional triggers ====
In general, the more emotionally charged an event or experience is, the better it is remembered; this phenomenon is known as the '''memory enhancement effect''', most often a person is has no conscious awareness of the process. Most of us consciously remember sensory inputs (smell and vision) better than the memories emotional connotations.

{{NOTE|A Psychological Science study in 2009, by Psychologist Sarah Master of the University California, Los Angeles. Showed that women holding their partner's hand or viewing his photo decreased the women's pain significantly more than touching or viewing a stranger-and the photo was just as effective as the physical contact.}}

Special consideration should be given to avoid unwanted [[w:Abreaction|abreactions]] from a subject during hypnosis. Be aware of the subject phobias and bad experiences before hand. Use the [[Hypnosis/Chapters/Hypno#Pre-hypnosis|pre-hypnosis stage]] to find the relevant information and during hypnosis be aware on how the subject reacts to the induced perceptual changes.

=== Repression ===
Memory repression is mostly done subconsciously, as we've seen sleep time seems to be linked to memory storage and prioritization, repression of memory seems to be the other side of the process. Some will even argue that we never forget anything that whatever loss there is, is restricted to the fidelity of the stored memories and the ease of access to them. But this bring up a realization, that degradation is a form of memory alteration.

There is also a issue of fragmentation, that is events that are not consciously remember but are so strong that can dictate subconsciously our reactions. [[w:Amnesia|Amnesia]] is a very vast phenomena but it is interesting to note that it can originate both from a pure physical neurological damage ('''organic amnesia''') and also by very long list of purely psychological reasons, of particular note to our subject is '''post-hypnotic amnesia''', where events during hypnosis are forgotten, or where past memories are unable to be recalled. The failure to remember those events can be induced by suggestions made during the hypnosis or occur without a explicit suggestion. This is classified as a subtype of [[w:Psychogenic amnesia|Psychogenic amnesia]] ('''dissociative amnesia''').

A person can also be taught to forget emotional details, like personal feelings, associated with a memory without erasing the memory of the actual event, helping to deal with depression or as a therapy for post-traumatic stress disorder. This is supported by a study conducted by a research team from the University of St. Andrews in 2012.

Notes: The 1977 S.G. Elizabethan Catalogue states that &quot;Examples of the 1sh. and 10sh. have been seen with the obliterating bars over &quot;NIGERIA&quot; strengthened with additional bars in ballpoint pen.&quot; 

It also states that &quot;The 1 1/2D. is known, unused, with an overprint, similar to that used on the 2D., inverted and with &quot;SOVEREIGN BIAFRA&quot; omitted.

A polynomial is a variable that has the general form
:;&lt;math&gt;P(x) = a_n x^n + a^n-1 x^n-1 + a_1 x + a_o&lt;/math&gt;
Here, the &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; literals represent any constant numbers.

==Monomial==
Polynomials with highest degree as 1 are called Monomials.
Monomial has the general form

&lt;math&gt;P(x) = a x &lt;/math&gt;

Consider &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; as a monomial function of x.
: &lt;math&gt;y = 2 x &lt;/math&gt;
:  x | y
: -2 | -4
: -1 | -1
:  0 | 0
:  1 | 1
:  2 | 2


General equation of a straight line with slope m = a through y intercept (0,b)

* &lt;math&gt;P(x) = a x + b&lt;/math&gt;

Equation of a straight line with slope m = 1 and passing through (0,0).
: &lt;math&gt;y = x&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Protect Your Move==

No matter where you are moving to, insurance can help protect the things that you have worked so hard for over the years. Just like any other insurance policy, moving insurance takes a fee and then provides you cash payment if something is damaged while it is being moved.

==Where to Buy Moving Insurance==

There are a couple of different places that consumers can purchase moving insurance from. First is the moving company itself, which offers an insurance-like product called valuation. When you choose valuation instead of traditional insurance, you will be getting a set per pound amount for each pound of goods that is being shipped. Most companies offer a basic level of valuation coverage for free with the purchase of their services, but this is usually not enough to cover the value of the items being shipped. Consumers can, however, purchase additional coverage if they choose to.

Another place to get moving insurance is a traditional insurance company. Movers are not insurance companies, so their version of moving insurance is not actual insurance. When you choose a traditional policy, however, you will be dealing with actual insurance. These policies can be purchased separately or they can be added on to your homeowners policy. They cover the cost of each item individually rather than a per pound rate.

==Things to Consider==

Purchasing moving insurance is a very important part of every move. It is important that consumers think about the worth of their goods and find out how much of each type of insurance would be needed to replace everything. By doing this, consumers can guarantee that they have enough coverage.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Polynominal Equation==
An equation is an expression of one variable such that
:; &lt;math&gt;f(x) = Ax^n + Bx^(n-1) + x^1 + x^0 = 0 .&lt;/math&gt;

==Solving Polynominal Equation==
Solving polynominal equations involves finding all the values of variable x that satisfy f(x) = 0.

===First Order Equation===
A first order polynominal equation of one variable x has the general form
: Ax + B = 0

Rewrite the equation above
: &lt;math&gt;x + \frac{B}{A} = 0&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;x = -\frac{B}{A}&lt;/math&gt;

==Second Order Equation==
A second order polynominal equation of one variable x has the general form
# &lt;math&gt;Ax^2 + Bx + C = 0&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;Ax^2 + C = 0&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;Ax^2 - C = 0&lt;/math&gt;

===Solving Equation===
====Method 1====

&lt;math&gt;Ax^2 + Bx + C = 0&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;x^2 + \frac{B}{A}x + \frac{C}{A} = 0&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;x = -\alpha \pm \lambda&lt;/math&gt;

Where
: &lt;math&gt;\alpha = - \frac{B}{2A}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\beta = - \frac{C}{A}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\lambda = \sqrt{\alpha^2 - \beta^2}&lt;/math&gt;


Depending on the value of &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; the equation will have the following root

One Real Root
: &lt;math&gt;-\alpha = - \frac{B}{2A}&lt;/math&gt;

Two Real Roots
: &lt;math&gt;-\alpha \pm \lambda &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;-\frac{B}{2A} \pm \sqrt {\frac{B^2 - 4 AC}{2A}} &lt;/math&gt;

Two Complex Roots
: &lt;math&gt;-\alpha \pm j\lambda &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;-\frac{B}{2A} \pm j\sqrt {\frac{B^2 - 4 AC}{2A}} &lt;/math&gt;

====Method 2====

&lt;math&gt;ax^2 + b = 0&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;x^2 + \frac{b}{a} = 0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x = \pm \sqrt{-\frac{b}{a}}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x = \pm j \sqrt{\frac{b}{a}}&lt;/math&gt;

====Method 3====
&lt;math&gt;ax^2 - b = 0&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;x^2 - \frac{b}{a} = 0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x = \pm \sqrt{\frac{b}{a}}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x = \pm \sqrt{\frac{b}{a}}&lt;/math&gt;

The general form of First Order Equation
: &lt;math&gt;A \frac{d f(x)}{dx} + B f(x) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

Which can be writte as
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{d f(x)}{dx} = - \frac{B}{A} f(x)  &lt;/math&gt;

has one root of the exponential function form
: &lt;math&gt;f(x) = A e^(-\frac{B}{A}) t &lt;/math&gt;

==Proof==
Equation is an expression of one variable such that
: &lt;math&gt;A \frac{d f(x)}{dx} + B f(x) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{d f(x)}{dx} + \frac{B}{A} f(x) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{d f(x)}{f(x)} = -\frac{B}{A} dx&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\int \frac{d f(x)}{f(x)} = -\frac{B}{A} \int dx&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;Ln f(x) = -\frac{B}{A} t + C&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;f(x) = e^[-\frac{B}{A} t + C]&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;f(x) = e^C e^(-\frac{B}{A}) t &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;f(x) = A e^(-\frac{B}{A}) t &lt;/math&gt;

Second Ordered Differetial Equation has the general form
: &lt;math&gt;A \frac{d^2 f(x)}{dx^2} + B \frac{d f(x)}{dx} + C = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

Which can be expressed as

      <text xml:space="preserve">====NAME====
MNI-register  -  interactive volume display and point tagging program


====SYNOPSIS====
&lt;nowiki&gt;
register  [-version]] [-help]
 [-rgb]] [-cmap]] [-single] [-double]
 [-global variable value]]
 [volume1''filename]  [volume2''filename] [tags.tag]
&lt;/nowiki&gt;

====DESCRIPTION====
Register  is  an interactive graphics application.  It can
display one or two volumes (typically MR or PET), and  the
merged image of the two.  Some, but not all, versions will
allow switching between single and double buffer mode  and
between  RGB  and  colour  map  mode, so the options -rgb,
-cmap, -single, -double are useful for setting the initial
state  of the program.  There are three viewports for each
volume, showing tranverse, sagittal, coronal slices.   The
user  can  move  throughout  the  volumes,  and create tag
points within the volumes.  If enough tag points  for  two
volumes  are picked, then a transformation is computed for
registering the two volumes.  This transform  is  used  in
displaying  the  merged  image and in allowing the user to
start a process which resamples one of  the  volumes  into
the same space as the other.
A  vector volume will normally be converted to an RGB volume, on input. 
I don't know what that means in  terms  of
register's display.  Alternatively, the vector can be converted to a
scalar whose value is the mean of  the  vector
components,  by  setting  the global variable
Convert''vectors''to_rgb to FALSE.

====USER INTERFACE====
The user interface is a mouse-based interface composed  of
buttons,  sliders, and text entry.  Buttons can be pressed
with the left mouse button.  Text entries can  be  changed
by  pressing  the  left  mouse button on them, then typing
text.  Typing return signals the text entry is done.  Typing  escape
ends text editting without modifying the text.
The delete, cursor left, and  cursor  right  keys  may  be
used.   Ctrl-a and ctrl-e move the cursor to the beginning
and end of text, respectively.  Ctrl-u deletes all text in
the text entry.

====MAIN MENU====
Quit: Quits the program, after confirmation.

Resample and Load: Resamples the second volume to place it
in the same space as the first, according to the transformation
defined by the tag points. 
Resample  Filename: Text entry to set the name of the file
to create for the resampling.

Synced / Not Synced: Toggle switch to control whether  the
cursor  position  in  all volumes is enforced to always be
the same.

Flat / Interpolated: Not implemented yet.  Eventually will
control the interpolation method for display.
Colour  Map / RGB: Toggles between colour map mode (faster
updates) and RGB mode (truer colours).

Double / Single: Toggles between double and single buffer.

Load Tags: Loads a set of tag points into the program.

Tags  Filename:  Text  entry to set name of filename to be
used by load and save tags.  A default extension \&quot;.tag\&quot; is
provided automatically.

Save  Tags: Saves all active tag points to a file.  If one
volume is loaded, then a set of single tags is saved.   If
two  volumes  are  loaded, then a set of pairs of tags are
saved.

Save Transform: Saves the transform  defined  by  the  tag
points, if it exists.

Transform  Filename: Text entry to set name of filename to
be used by save transform.  A default extension \&quot;.xfm\&quot;  is
provided automatically.

Record  Tag:  Overwrites  the  current tag point positions
with the current positions within  the  volumes.   If  the
current  tag point is the end of the tags, then it creates
a new tag point.

Delete Tag: Deletes the current tag point.

Delete All Tags: Pops up a confirmation box  allowing  you
to delete all the tags.

Transform  Type: Pops up a dialog to select 6 parameter, 7
parameter, 12 parameter, or thin-plate  spline  non-linear
fitting.

Tags  In/Visible:  Toggles  the display of tag point positions on the slices.

Cursor In/Visible: Toggles the display of cursor crosshair
on the slices.

Interp: Flat/Smooth: Toggles the display of slices between
flat and smooth shading.  Smooth shading takes much longer
to  update  (a  few  seconds), but produces higher quality
images, especially noticeable when the images  are  zoomed
up.

RMS:  Displays the average RMS error of the tag points, if
a transform exists.

====VOLUME MENUS====
Voxel and World Position Readouts Displays the position of
the  volume  cursor  in  voxel and world coordinates.  The
positions can be changed numerically by  clicking  on  the
number and typing in the desired position.

Load Volume: Loads the specified volume.

Volume Filename: Specifies the volume filename.

Reset View: Resets the scale and translation of the slices
to fit in the viewports.

Filter Pops up a dialog window  that  selects  the  filter
type for each of the 3 views of the volume.  The filtering
applies across slices, but not within slice.   The  filter
types  are:  nearest  neighbour, linear interpolation, box
filter, triangle filter, and gaussian filter.

Under Colour: Sets the colour displayed for  voxels  whose
values are less than the range.

Over  Colour:  Sets  the colour displayed for voxels whose
values are greater than the range.

Colour Bar Slider: Sets the colour range.  The left  mouse
can  be used to drag the upper or lower limit.  The middle
mouse is used to move both at the same time.

Colour Coding Type: Sets the colour coding method  to  one
of gray scale, hot metal, spectral, red, green, or blue.

====MERGED MENU====
Voxel  and  World Position Readouts: Displays the position
of the volume cursor in voxel and world coordinates.   The
positions  can  be  changed numerically by clicking on the
number and typing in the desired position.

Reset View: Resets the scale and translation of the slices
to fit in the viewports.

Merge  Method  Buttons:  Sets  the  merge method to one of
blend, weighted, one on two, or two on one.  Blend  allows
blending  between  the two volumes.  Weighted allows arbitrary
weights for the two volumes.  One on two places volume  one  on  top
of  volume two, with volume two showing
through if volume one is out of range.  Two on one is  the
opposite.

Opacity Sliders Sets the weights of the two volumes.  Only
used if the merge method is blend or weighted.

====TAGS MENU====
Position: Displays and allows setting of tag positions.

Name: Sets the name of a tag.

On / Ignore: Sets the activity of a tag, whether  it  contributes to the transformation or not.

Dst:  Displays  the distance of the tag point in the first
volume from the position of the  transformed

====MOUSE AND KEYBOARD====
In the slice viewports, the following actions are valid:

Left Mouse: Sets the volume cursor position.

Middle Mouse: Moves slice  perpendicular  according  to  y
position of mouse.

Right  Mouse:  Adds  a new tag point at the current volume
cursor positions.

Shift/Ctrl/Alt Left Mouse: Translates the slice display

Shift/Ctrl/Alt  Middle  Mouse:  Zooms  the  slice  display
according to the y position of the mouse.

====VOLUME CACHING====
Register  has  the  ability  to handle volumes larger than
virtual memory by caching parts of the volume  in  memory.
The  current  default for deciding when to cache is volume
is 80 Megabytes.  See  the  documentation  of  the  source
libraries for MNI-register for more information.

Note that volume caching can have a radical effect on performance.
In some cases you may get much better results by disabling caching,
especially when working with volumes on NFS-mounted filesystems.

To disable caching, set VOLUME_CACHE_THRESHOLD environment variable to -1. I.E
&lt;code&gt;export VOLUME_CACHE_THRESHOLD=-1&lt;/code&gt; in bash

====FILES====
/usr/local/lib/register.globals

/usr/local/lib/register_UI.globals

== I'd like to wikiobookify &quot;Optimizing Code for Speed&quot; ==

Hi all, [[Optimizing Code for Speed]] should be wikibookified per the request of a moderator (which prevents making it a 100% completion status.). I don't mind it being split into pages, but I'd like to know how to do it exactly. Is there a script somewhere or a page explaining the process? [[User:Shlomif|Shlomif]] ([[User talk:Shlomif|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Shlomif|contribs]])
:It's really simple. Just copy the contents of each of the sections into a subpage. for example, the introduction goes to [[Optimizing Code for Speed/Introduction]]. After you've done that, turn the book into a table of contents. You can see how this is done by looking at a random book. [[::User:Kayau|Kayau]] {{toolbar|separator=dot

== Quizzes and Exams ==

Hey guys, do we have a multiple choice quiz function on the English wikibooks? On the Icelandic wikibooks, we have &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;quiz display=simple&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; and we can produce a nice self assessment on Wikibooks. See [http://is.wikibooks.org/wiki/Enska/L%C3%A6r%C3%B0u_ensku_1/Spurningakeppni_A here]. If we do, what's the code?

== &quot;Future of Wikimedia&quot; ==

Came across this recently-created essay.  It's an interesting examination and helps foster thoughts on long-term planning.  See [[m:User:Yair rand/Future of Wikimedia]].  &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|discuss]]&lt;/small&gt; 05:08, 6 February 2011 (UTC)
: That's a refreshing contrast to the usual &quot;we should put all our resources into Wikipedia, and the unimportant side projects are welcome to try to survive&quot;.  (It's also interesting to me as a Wikinewsie that, while I agree ''that'' it has massive potential, I disagree with or doubt other things said about it, and feel Wikinews's current key challenge is missing from the account... but I digress.&amp;nbsp;:-)

: Regarding Wikibooks, I'm interested that the author draws xyr correspondence between Wikibooks and Wikipedia by analogizing our books to Wikipedia's ''pages''.  I disagree with that.  An independent project has the psychologically significant property that its mainspace text wikilinks are internal to the project.
:* Wikinews suffers, psychologically, because its mainspace text wikilinks are often, in some articles almost entirely, to Wikipedia.  (I mean to do something about that... again I digress.)
:* Wikipedia mainspace text mostly wikilinks to Wikipedia pages.
:* Wiktionary mainspace text mostly wikilinks to Wiktionary pages.
:* But Wikibooks mainspace text, once it matures, mostly wikilinks ''within the same book''.  So each book feels like an independent project, analogous not to a single Wikipedia page but to the whole of Wikipedia &amp;mdash; only with such a small scope that it's almost impossible to build and maintain a significant contributing community.  This also explains the difficulty with a single person writing a book by xyrself.
: Moving forward, we may view ourselves as shepherds of a very large flock of tiny projects (though it may be less like herding sheep, and more like [[wikt:herding cats|herding cats]]).  Obvious subgoals include
:* helping users find a book they might be interested in contributing to.  (Goes back to my thoughts on keyword searching.&amp;nbsp;:-)
:* helping a book to establish and maintain a coherent style despite long dry spells between significant contributions:  it should be possible to pick up an &quot;abandoned&quot; book without having to reinvent the wheel (unless, of course, one wants to).  If I chose a random book, even a random book whose subject I'm competent in, and tried to contribute to it, I might have to either ignore the intended organization, and thus potentially degrade it, or spend a pile of up-front time figuring out how the book was meant to be organized and how, if at all, I feel it ought to be reorganized.  Even with that effort, subtle aspects of the previously envisioned organization might never become evident to me.  My point is, we want to make it easier for the past contributors to a book to successfully liaise with later contributors across time.
:* helping books to coordinate with each other, for synergy.  An obvious goal, that falls trippingly off the tongue and is very hard to know how to go about.

::Someone recently made the point that we're like a collection of wikis within one.  That matches up with your comments and recent discussions at [[Wikibooks talk:Incubator]].  I do find the essay's overall theme, &quot;a Wikipedia surrounded by successful projects will have a far better future than without&quot; to be insightful.  The cross-wiki watchlists and bug fixes/feature requests would help to encourage greater participation.  The software is deficient in supporting the idea of wikis within a wiki, from watching a book at once to per-book CSS/JavaScript.  As Wikipedia is quite mature, the opportunity for growth is at the other projects. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|discuss]]&lt;/small&gt; 16:48, 6 February 2011 (UTC)
== Page counts are incorrect ==

It appears that a definition I read somewhere about pages having to be in a content namespace and '''having a link to another page''' for them to be counted as content pages in [[Special:Statistics]] is correct.  I checked the value of &lt;nowiki&gt;{{NUMBEROFARTICLES}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; before and after adding a link to a page with none ([[.NET Development Foundation/Iterators]]), for example, and it caused the value to increment.  It's too bad [[Special:DeadendPages]] is disabled.  The implications of this are that the values shown on the main page, in the local statistics, at stats.wikimedia.org, and especially in [[m:List of Wikimedia projects by size]] all severely under-report our progress.  [[A-level Chemistry/AQA/Module 5/Periodicity]] with all its content wouldn't be counted, for instance.  I've found that [[w:Wikipedia:Dead-end pages]] has instructions that will produce a list of pages that can then have navigation templates applied, rectifying the count. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|discuss]]&lt;/small&gt; 21:57, 24 January 2011 (UTC)
:It can be changed to count commas instead of links - [[mw:Manual:$wgUseCommaCount]]. [[User:Bawolff|Bawolff]] ([[User talk:Bawolff|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Bawolff|contribs]]) 22:34, 24 January 2011 (UTC)
::A good find!  Too bad it doesn't apply retroactively.  Maybe the developers would run the update script.

Presumably there was some logic in choosing &quot;wikilink or comma&quot; as the options but I can't think of one. Perhaps a &lt;nowiki&gt;{&lt;/nowiki&gt; would be a good choice for us as most / all pages will include a transcluded template? &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 16:43, 4 February 2011 (UTC)
:::::::: I think the problem with wikilinks could be fixed for Wikibooks if the criteria for it were the use of wikilinks on a page OR a page is linked to from another page. Generally books have a table of contents with wikilinks to their pages, so if the criteria were updated to that than just having a table of contents should be enough to ensure all its pages were counted. Another option I can think of would be to count all pages which are categorized. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 19:46, 4 February 2011 (UTC)
::::::::: Wondering, could we hotwire {{tl|BookCat}} so that every page (or every content-space page) it's on would have a link, without causing that link to be obnoxiously visible?

:::::::::: If links through template inclusion were enough to have a page counted, I think most pages would already be counted due to the use of navigational aids. I wonder if page statistics even matter. Other than to perhaps determine average book length, I think how many books Wikibooks has is the statistics that is most relevant to us. I think counting pages based on template inclusion is a good idea, but I think multiple ways for a page to be counted would help to ensure more pages are counted without people having to go out of their way to make sure a page is counted. Another option could be the presents of any one of &quot;!&quot;, &quot;?&quot;, or &quot;.&quot; since at least one is guaranteed to be present in properly formed sentence. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 21:30, 4 February 2011 (UTC)

If charts at stats.wikimedia.org make it appear that we are stagnating, the foundation will not see it as a priority to have the developers handle the big feature requests outstanding for Wikibooks (such as watching a whole book at once), people primarily contributing to Wikipedia will not want to invest time in a &quot;second-class&quot; project, and changes to extensions such as Flagged Revisions will continue to not be discussed with us ahead of time. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|discuss]]&lt;/small&gt; 00:08, 5 February 2011 (UTC)

== 1.17 Update ==

Some issues I've seen, and I don't know whether or not they are temporary: [[Template:Navbox]] is not styled; the protection icons via [[Template:pp-meta]] are not in the correct location anymore, the default style of wikitables has changed (good thing, we don't need purple clashing with everything), the [[Template:Mbox|Mbox]] suite is not styled.  Very odd because the big thing was a change to JavaScript implementation, not CSS. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|discuss]]&lt;/small&gt; 13:49, 11 February 2011 (UTC)

: I hope the issues are temporary as well. You could say there are two big changes actually. MediaWiki 1.17 is intended to speed up load time and decrease hits to their servers, if I understand correctly, by combining, compressing, and anticipating what JavaScript and CSS is or is not needed. I believe this second big change is intended to not to have any visibly noticeable affect though, besides people possibly noticing pages load faster. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 14:01, 11 February 2011 (UTC)

::I think I know what the problem is, though I only know of one solution to fix it.  The linked CSS pages at [[MediaWiki:Common.css]] are not loading.  Only solution would be to combine them again.  Most Wikimedia sites don't try to do what we are doing here.  I will maybe file a bug report.

::: I think in theory at least this should be fixable locally without a need to combine them again. Would be a pity if all that effort to make our CSS more manageable and the discussion of specific CSS problems easier went to waste. I think it should be reported as a bug though, as it may be an unintended side effect.

{{outdent|::::::::}}

I managed to attend the office hour IRC meeting this time. The good news, right now this bug is considered a blocker that will need to be fixed before 1.17 is released. Other than that, I think as a community, we probably need to discuss what if anything to do about scripts in user space. People sometimes copy scripts from other wikimedia projects, and don't keep up with changes made to fix bugs and updates to mediawiki. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 19:28, 14 February 2011 (UTC)

:We don't have any gadgets that reference scripts in user space, but my concern would be whether our gadgets are getting dated, with too many that won't work with Vector (and thus appear to be broken to new users using the default theme and not knowing about Monobook) and whether they will work after the update (or even whether they have been unmaintained and could break any day now&amp;mdash;Whiteknight's Visual Book Designer).  Short of using a bot to replace functions that are clear replacements, I feel scripts in user space should be maintained by the user.  If they were created across multiple wikis, [[User:Pathoschild|Pathoschild]] has a bot that will update CSS/JS globally for a user seeking to update. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|discuss]]&lt;/small&gt; 20:50, 14 February 2011 (UTC)

:: People asked would things break at the meeting. 1.17 is intended to maintain backwards compatibility according to the mediawiki developers. I think the mediawiki developers don't expect things to break, but will fix them if they do and are reported to bugzilla. The old methods will still be around in 1.17.
:: When Wikibooks was updated to 1.16 I began to update scripts in MediaWiki space to keep on top of things. While I trust the mediawiki developers to keep things working right now, I have doubts the Wikibooks community will be informed should a decision be made to remove the old methods in a future release. I think the best way to avoid surprises is to update sooner rather than later as we know about it.
:: I think scripts in user space should be updated to avoid surprises too, I just don't know whose responsibility we should consider it to be to do so. People may want to know why things aren't working as they use to at some point.

== Books for examination ==

An IP editor has, over time, created several books that are often poorly translated.  Several pages of them were blatant copyright violations of Wikipedia content and I have deleted those pages but others are probably taken only partly from Wikipedia.  The content appears to be copied/translated from vi.wikibooks.org given that some of the images used here are used there in books that appear to cover the same topics.  This is likely the same editor who created ''Arithmatics'' which was moved to ''Arithmetics'' and [[Wikibooks:Requests for deletion/Arithmetics|deleted]], ''Mathematics Fundamental'' which was moved to ''Mathematics Fundamentals'' and [[Wikibooks:Requests for deletion/Mathematics Fundamentals|deleted]], and ''Physics Handbook'' which was [[Wikibooks:Requests for deletion/Physics Handbook|deleted]].  I deleted the recently-created ''Electronics Course'' entirely as it was complete copy-pastes of ''Electronics Handbook''.  If this person created an account they could track their contribution history instead of forgetting and creating the same thing four months later under a new IP…  [[Arithmetic Course]], [[Calculus Course]], [[Trigonometry Course]], [[Geometry Course]], [[Electronics Handbook]], [[Physics Course]], [[Digital Electronics]], [[Communication Course]] are ones I can think of off the top of my head in case anyone sees any other problems that I've missed. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|discuss]]&lt;/small&gt; 02:58, 18 February 2011 (UTC)

== Statistics ==

It's been asked of me before and I recently got a request through OTRS for whether or not there's a tool for seeing page views at Wikibooks (we don't have [[Wikibooks:Statistics]]).  Previously I didn't know of any but I recently heard that a tool normally used just for Wikipedia can be &quot;hacked&quot; to output results for Wikibooks.
*Visit http://stats.grok.se/en.b/top for the top 1000 pages and ignore the &quot;Wikipedia article traffic statistics&quot; title.
*Add the page you want to know about in particular to the end of &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://stats.grok.se/en.b/201102/&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; for February statistics.  The end is YYYYMM, so you can change the value in the address bar for older months.
The interface and forms of the site cannot be used; doing so reverts it back to Wikipedia.  Would you believe that 18 of the top 30 spots are held by pages in [[LaTeX]]? &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|discuss]]&lt;/small&gt; 00:01, 21 February 2011 (UTC)

: Wikibooks use to keep track of pretty good statistics useful for book projects, until the format of the data dumps changed from SQL to XML. Would just require motivated individuals to do so again. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 01:45, 21 February 2011 (UTC)

: Here's a rough example of the type of statistics Wikibooks use to have:
:# [[File:Increase.svg|12px|link=]] Cookbook (&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;+120&lt;/span&gt;)
:# [[File:Increase.svg|12px|link=]] LaTeX (&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;+50&lt;/span&gt;)
:# [[File:Decrease.svg|12px|link=]] Rubik Puzzles (&lt;span style=&quot;color:red;&quot;&gt;-20&lt;/span&gt;)

: Where the arrow indicated whether contributions went up or down since last time for the given book, and the number in parenthesis represented the contribution difference since last time. I'd like to see such a system in use again. I think it acts as a good motivator and can encourage people. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 10:28, 21 February 2011 (UTC)

== Disappearance of Private WikiBook ==

I had created a Wikibook that was 56 pages in length. I attempted to create a Chapter and the book suddenly had no content. When I was in a Wikipedia article, the book creator showed that I had 56 pages, however, when I went to add page, the book was empty of content. Are there length restrictions on Wikibooks, and if so, can advance notification be given by the system administrator so that the book can be saved before elimination? &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:98.94.81.35|98.94.81.35]] ([[User talk:98.94.81.35|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/98.94.81.35|contribs]]) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;

== Wikibook in Latex ==

In the math community, most people write things using Latex. Does anyone have an idea on how one could start a wikibook project with people prefering to write Latex documents ?

== editing and viewing problem ==

Hi,

I have problem with viewing discussion pages and editing some pages.
It is only in english wikibooks and only on some pages.
Like here : [[Fractals/Iterations_in_the_complex_plane/Julia_set]].

I see:
* inactive Talk tab , not active Discussion tab
* inactive Edit tab
* active edit link which opens &quot;Editing Null&quot; page

What is a reason of this and how I can resolve it ?

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Physical Significance of Poles and Zeros ==

With respect to this article on poles and zeros of the transfer function, I find that the notion of poles and zeros in case of a simple transfer function is explained in detail and I specifically liked the part which details the &quot;meaning of a pole&quot;, where the exponential and the sinusoidal nature of the response are decoupled and explained clearly.

However, I feel that it is also relevant to highlight the physical significance of the poles and zeros of a transfer function in this article. Personally, I have understood the physical significance of a pole as I have mentioned below. However, I still haven't understood the physical significance of a zero.

Physical Significance of a Pole:
We can relate the statement &quot;An (open loop)system has a pole at ω(rad/s)&quot;, to an object which has a natural frequency of oscillation of ω(rad/s). Furthermore, from the fundamental concept of resonance in physics, this object with a natural frequency &quot;ω&quot;, will attain resonance when excited by an input of frequency &quot;ω&quot;. And we know that resonance corresponds to maximum energy transfer. From the perspective of an (open loop)system, a pole at &quot;ω&quot;, mathematically means that the denominator of the transfer function will become zero and hence, the transfer function reaches infinity. For practical reasoning, we can consider that, infinity in mathematical terms corresponds to some large energy physically. Accordingly, when the (open loop)system is excited by an input which has a frequency &quot;ω&quot;, then there will be a large amount of energy transfer from input to output, which we also call resonance, and hence, the transfer function takes a value of infinity mathematically.

Kindly let me know with your feedbacks about my above view of the physical significance of a pole. I am equally keen to learn and know about other physical interpretations of pole and specifically a zero.

Thank You.Rajeev singh

: Singh, I totally agree with you. All these books are just copy-paste of mantras. As [Talk:Control Systems/Transfer Functions#Eigenvector treatment | I complained elsewhere]], they do not explain the essence of things. I see that you can convert a recursion &lt;math&gt;y_{n+2} = a y_{n+1} + b y_n + x_n&lt;/math&gt; into generating function 
::&lt;math&gt;z^{-2}(Y(z) - y_1 z^{-1} - y_0) = a z^{-1}(Y(z) - y_0) + b Y(z) + X(z)&lt;/math&gt; 
:and derive output 
::&lt;math&gt;Y(z) = {X(z)z^{-2} + (y_1 - a y_0) z^{-1} + y_0 \over 1 - az^{-1} - bz^{-2}} = {X(z) + (y_1 - a y_0) z + y_0 z^2 \over (z - p_1)(z-p_2)}.&lt;/math&gt; 
The poles of characteristic polynomial clearly characterize the system -- they are eigenvalues of the system and, thus, allow to compute n-th state quickly, by diagonalization. It would also be interesting to know how are they related to z. The generating functions approach, which I have taken, tells that the series variable z is not important for analysis. Yet, something suggest that poles, when &lt;math&gt;z=p_i&lt;/math&gt;, the response Y(z) will be infinite. What does that mean? What is z if my input signal is X(z) and output is Y(z), how can I make my input to equal z and p_n to obtain infinite response? What does it mean that signal is equal to eigenvalue? Why z is frequency? Why you cannot have more zeroes than poles, is it causality or stability issue? --[[User:Javalenok|Javalenok]] ([[User talk:Javalenok|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Javalenok|contribs]]) 17:20, 23 September 2014 (UTC)</text>

﻿{{Haskell minitoc|chapter=Advanced Haskell}}

== Introduction ==

Arrows are a generalization of monads: every monad gives rise to an arrow, but not all arrows give rise to monads. They serve much the same purpose as monads -- providing a common structure for libraries -- but are more general. In particular they allow notions of computation that may be partially static (independent of the input) or may take multiple inputs. If your application works fine with monads, you might as well stick with them. But if you're using a structure that's very like a monad, but isn't one, maybe it's an arrow.


== 介绍 ==
箭头（arrow)是单子（monad）的抽象：所有的单子都是箭头，但不是所有的箭头都是单子他们都为一个目的设计 -- 提供一个通用的结构来构建库 --但箭头抽象度更高。  特别的，箭头允许为那写非全静态的（取决于输入）或者是多输入的计算做上记号。 如果能用单子写出不错的程序，你会喜欢上它的。但如果你只是写出了一些像单子的东西，那它可能是箭头

== &lt;code&gt;proc&lt;/code&gt; and the arrow tail ==

Let's begin by getting to grips with the arrows notation.  We'll work with the simplest possible arrow there is (the function) and build some toy programs strictly in the aims of getting acquainted with the syntax.

Fire up your text editor and create a Haskell file, say toyArrows.hs:

&lt;source lang = &quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
{-# LANGUAGE Arrows #-}

import Control.Arrow (returnA)

idA :: a -&gt; a
idA = proc a -&gt; returnA -&lt; a

plusOne :: Int -&gt; Int
plusOne = proc a -&gt; returnA -&lt; (a+1)
&lt;/source&gt;

These are our first two arrows.  The first is the identity function in arrow form, and second, slightly more exciting, is an arrow that adds one to its input.  Load this up in GHCi, using the -XArrows extension and see what happens.

&lt;pre&gt;
% ghci -XArrows toyArrows.hs   
   ___         ___ _
  / _ \ /\  /\/ __(_)
 / /_\// /_/ / /  | |      GHC Interactive, version 6.4.1, for Haskell 98.
/ /_\\/ __  / /___| |      http://www.haskell.org/ghc/
\____/\/ /_/\____/|_|      Type :? for help.

Loading package base-1.0 ... linking ... done.
Compiling Main             ( toyArrows.hs, interpreted )
Ok, modules loaded: Main.
*Main&gt; idA 3
3
*Main&gt; idA &quot;foo&quot;
&quot;foo&quot;
*Main&gt; plusOne 3
4
*Main&gt; plusOne 100
101
&lt;/pre&gt;

Thrilling indeed.  Up to now, we have seen three new constructs in the arrow notation:
* the keyword &lt;code&gt;proc&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;-&lt;&lt;/code&gt;
* the imported function &lt;code&gt;returnA&lt;/code&gt;

Now that we know how to add one to a value, let's try something twice as difficult: adding TWO:

&lt;source lang = &quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
 plusOne = proc a -&gt; returnA -&lt; (a+1)
 plusTwo = proc a -&gt; plusOne -&lt; (a+1)
&lt;/source&gt;

One simple approach is to feed (a+1) as input into the &lt;code&gt;plusOne&lt;/code&gt; arrow.  Note the similarity between &lt;code&gt;plusOne&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;plusTwo&lt;/code&gt;.  You should notice that there is a basic pattern here which goes a little something like this: proc FOO -&gt; SOME_ARROW -&lt; (SOMETHING_WITH_FOO)

{{Exercises|1=
# &lt;code&gt;plusOne&lt;/code&gt; is an arrow, so by the pattern above &lt;code&gt;returnA&lt;/code&gt; must be an arrow too.  What do you think &lt;code&gt;returnA&lt;/code&gt; does?
}}

== &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt; notation ==

Our current implementation of &lt;code&gt;plusTwo&lt;/code&gt; is rather disappointing actually... shouldn't it just be &lt;code&gt;plusOne&lt;/code&gt; twice?  We can do better, but to do so, we need to introduce the do notation:

&lt;source lang = &quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
 plusTwoBis = 
  proc a -&gt; do b &lt;- plusOne -&lt; a
               plusOne -&lt; b
&lt;/source&gt;

Now try this out in GHCi:

&lt;pre&gt;
Prelude&gt; :r
Compiling Main             ( toyArrows.hs, interpreted )
Ok, modules loaded: Main.
*Main&gt; plusTwoBis 5
7
&lt;/pre&gt;

You can use this do notation to build up sequences as long as you would like:

&lt;source lang = &quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
plusFive =
 proc a -&gt; do b &lt;- plusOne -&lt; a
              c &lt;- plusOne -&lt; b
              d &lt;- plusOne -&lt; c
              e &lt;- plusOne -&lt; d
              plusOne -&lt; e
&lt;/source&gt;

== Monads and arrows ==

:''FIXME: I'm no longer sure, but I believe the intention here was to show what the difference is having this proc notation instead to just a regular chain of dos''

==Merge with Lua Programming / Embedding Lua / Lua components written in C&amp;C++==

I support the merge of Lua programming and Lua Programming, with Lua programming's content largely superseding Lua Programming's.  Lua Programming does have a section called 'solutions' which suggests there should be pages about writing Lua components in C and C++ and embedding and embedding Lua in C and C++.  [[User:Hackbinary|Hackbinary]] ([[User talk:Hackbinary|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Hackbinary|contribs]]) 13:05, 12 October 2013 (UTC)

==Programming Solutions==

I notice that you have removed the &quot;programming solutions&quot; section. This has left a hidden section &quot;solution&quot;s, which is no longer accessible via the book indexes. I'll put this back for now, until the indexes are fixed.

This solution uses magic numbers (the number of attempts) buried in the code, which isn't good practice. It would be better to define the number of attempts at the top of the program. --[[User:Fishpi|Fishpi]] ([[User talk:Fishpi|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Fishpi|contribs]]) 21:34, 25 February 2011 (UTC)</text>

Thank you for improving the [[Embedded Systems/PIC Microcontroller]] Wikibook.
I hope you find that and other Wikibooks useful.
I hope you periodically stop by and help us, a little step at a time, improve these rough drafts until we have amazingly useful, insightful, and easy-to-understand books.

==Chapter 1==

&lt;nowiki&gt;
 I remember two childhoods. I had two. Whether this is a fortunate thing or not I really can't say. Fortune is only apparent in life's result. Certainly, we cannot know our fortunes until they have become history. Looking backward it is difficult to imagine my past as belonging to me at all. Since my life is hardly over it would be hasty to state with any certainty of fortune or misfortune.
   There are fleeting fragments of life, here, where I call home. Life with my mother and father. Long summers with my brothers and sisters under the blue skies of the great northwestern prairies. This makes it very difficult really to relate this story. Difficult to relate much of my life prior to age 5 or so. Not difficult for lack of remembering, but difficult because I can't tell if those memories belong to me or are part of some mental delusion that I have allowed myself to fall victim to.
   My first memory of my life, here, is being dropped off on a corner in a small, rural, Canadian town. I had been thoroughly instructed where to walk, the house number, where I would live, the people I would come in contact with there. As the small van drove away, I followed my instructions. I walked down the street. I walked to a house. I climbed the stairs. I opened the front door. I entered the house.
   From the front door I passed through a small boot room, at the top of the front step. It was summer, the weather was dry and my shoes were not soiled. I saw no reason to remove them. I decided that it was best not to remove them, in case I needed to beat a hasty retreat.
   Beyond the boot room was what appeared to be a kitchen. There was a woman working there, preparing the evening meal. I waited pensively in the doorway assessing how she would respond to my initial presence. She glanced my direction after noticing, perhaps sensing, me standing there. She looked at me briefly. There was a subtle question that crossed her face momentarily and then it was gone again. Something subconscious perhaps.
   I felt some relief when she looked away to her work once again.
   &quot;Go wash your hands for dinner.&quot;, she said. These were the first words I remember my mother speaking.
   I thought to comply quickly and do as she wished. Not being intimately familiar with the layout of the house was the next problem I would need to resolve. I moved past her, through the room to one of two other doors on the opposite wall. Both were closed. I chose the door to the right. It opened to a basement stairway. 
   &quot;Did you hear me?&quot;, the woman said, &quot;Do I need to repeat myself?&quot;. She turned and pointed to the other door. &quot;Hands!&quot;, she said. There was a threatening maternal undertone to her voice.
   I quickly closed the stairway door and moved to open the other. As I passed from the kitchen she returned to her work. &quot;Use soap this time&quot;, she said.
   Beyond the second door was a short hallway. A brief search found me in a simple washroom with basic bathtub, toilet and sink. The fixtures were utilitarian and clean. There was a bar of soap on the sink which I used to wash my hands, and a single towel hanging on a peg. As I dried my hands on the towel I could hear some commotion coming from the kitchen. I replaced the towel to the peg and returned to the kitchen.
   At the door was another woman who seemed very upset. &quot;I saw them&quot;, she was saying, &quot;They snatched him and drove away.&quot;
   My mother was trying to calm her. &quot;No&quot;, she said,&quot;He's here. Look&quot;. Mother pointed at me.
   When the other woman saw me standing there she quieted and a quizzical look transformed her.
&lt;/nowiki&gt;
