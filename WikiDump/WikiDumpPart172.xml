      <text xml:space="preserve">The word VELLY is a Punjabi word and commonly used for Brave and Honest people. There is a myth in everyone's mind that meaning of VELLY &quot;a person who always stay Idle and do illegal activities. VELLY is a term used for Charismatic personalities having combination of following traits:

Volunteer - who actively takes on a task, responsibility, or project on his own without being assigned, ordered, or told to do so. Often not paid for the work that he do.

Ethical - in accordance with the accepted principles of right and wrong that govern the conduct of a profession or business.

Lucky - always blessed with good luck and successive fortune.

Loyal - in terms of everything with everyone ie; Parents, Friends, Work-place and Society.

Yankee - having In-built characteristic of trade, commerce, business and productivity OR a person more concerned with relevant practical experience than theory.

These people has the willingness to stand up when others want them to sit down. It is about diversity, faith, sexuality and ethics amongst leaders in the workplace, at school and in communities.

&quot;The ability to stand up for what is right in difficult situations&quot; - VELLY CULTURE

VELLY is highly regarded across cultures and has obvious benefits for those surrounded by these people.

• Physically acting in spite of possible harm to the body.

• Morally acting in a way that enhances what one believes to be good in spite of social disapproval and possible backlash.

• Psychologically such as overcoming one's own addictive habits, irrational anxieties, and harmful dependent relationships.

The positive view societies have of honesty can be seen from the fact that it is something people try to develop in young children and adolescents. There are certain individuals who seem to especially excel in this human strength. This trait is important in many areas of life.

&quot;Feeling alive and showing enthusiasm for all activities&quot; - PRINCIPLES OF VELLY</text>

===Probity in Governance===
Probity in governance is an essential and vital requirement for an efficient and effective system of governance and for socio-economic development.  An important requisite for ensuring probity in governance is absence of corruption. The other requirements are effective laws, rules and regulations governing every aspect of public life and, more important, an effective and fair implementation of those laws, etc. Indeed, a proper, fair and effective enforcement of law is a facet of discipline. Unfortunately for India, discipline is disappearing fast from public life and without discipline, as the Scandinavian economist- sociologist, Gunnyar Myrdal, has pointed out, no real progress is possible. 
Discipline implies inter alia public and private morality and a sense of honesty.  While in the West a man who rises to positions of higher authority develops greater respect for laws, the opposite is true in our country. Here, the mark of a person holding high position is the ease with which he can ignore the laws and regulations. We are being swamped by a culture of indiscipline and untruth; morality, both public and private, is at a premium.  
 Menace of corruption in public life : Corruption is an abuse of public resources or position in public life for private gain.  The scope for corruption increases when control on the public administrators is fragile and the division of power between political, executive and bureaucracy is ambiguous.  Political corruption which is sometimes inseparable from bureaucratic corruption tends to be more widespread in authoritarian regimes where the public opinion and the Press are unable to denounce corruption.  
The paradox of India, however, is that in spite of a vigilant press and public opinion, the level of corruption is exceptionally high.  This may be attributed to the utter insensitivity, lack of shame and the absence of any sense of public morality among the bribe-takers.  Indeed, they wear their badge of corruption and shamelessness with equal élan and brazenness.  The increase of opportunities in State intervention in economic and social life has vastly increased the opportunity for political and bureaucratic corruption, more particularly since politics has also become professionalized.  We have professional politicians who are politicians on a full time basis, even when out of office. 
There seems to be a nexus between terrorism, drugs, smuggling, and politicians, a fact which was emphasized in the Vohra Committee Report. 
 Corruption has flourished because one does not see adequately successful examples of effectively prosecuted cases of corruption.  Cases, poorly founded upon, half-hearted and incomplete investigation, followed by a tardy and delayed trial confluence a morally ill-deserved but a legally inevitable acquittal.  The acceptance of corruption as an inexorable reality has led to silent reconciliation and resignation to such wrongs.  There needs to be a vital stimulation in the social consciousness of our citizens – that is neither has a place in the personal nor social.
It is true that the present process of withdrawing the State from various sectors in which it should have never entered or in which it is not capable of performing efficiently may reduce the chances of corruption to some extent but even if we migrate to a free market economy, there has to be regulation of economy as distinct from restrictions upon the industrial activity. The requirements of governance would yet call for entering into contracts, purchases and so on.
 The Scandinavian economist-sociologist, Gunnyar Myrdal, had described the Indian society as a ‘soft society’. He also clarified what the expression ‘soft society’ means.  According to him, a soft society is: (a) one which does not have the political will to enact the laws necessary for its progress and development and/or does not possess the political will to implement the laws, even when made, and (b) where there is no discipline.   In fact, he has stressed the second aspect more than the first. According to him, if there is no discipline in the society, no real or meaningful development or progress is possible.  It is the lack of discipline in the society - which expression includes the administration and structures of governance at all levels - that is contributing to corruption.  Corruption and indiscipline feed upon each other.  One way of instilling the discipline among the society may be to reduce the chances of corruption and to deal with it sternly and mercilessly wherever it is found.   For this purpose, the inadequacies in the criminal judicial system have to be redressed. 
 Corruption is also anti-poor. Take, for example, the Public Distribution System (PDS) and the welfare schemes for the poor including Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs).  It is well-known that a substantial portion of grain, sugar and kerosene oil meant for PDS goes into black-market and that hardly 16% of the funds meant for STs and SCs reach them – all the rest is misappropriated by some of the members of the political and official class and unscrupulous dealers and businessmen.
The famous economist, Late Mehbub-Ul-Haq succinctly and poignantly set out the ill-effects of corruption in a South Asian country like ours.  He said:
 “Corruption happens everywhere.  It has been at the center of election campaigns in Italy and the United Kingdom, led to the fall of governments in Japan and Indonesia, and resulted in legislative action in Russia and the United States.  But, if corruption exists in rich, economically successful countries, why should South Asia be worried about it?  The answer is simple: South Asian corruption has four key characteristics that make it far more damaging than corruption in any other parts of the world.

First, corruption in South Asia occurs up-stream, not down-stream.  Corruption at the top distorts fundamental decisions about development priorities, policies, and projects. In industrial countries, these core decisions are taken through transparent competition and on merit, even though petty corruption may occur down-stream.

Second, corruption money in South Asia has wings, not wheels.  Most of the corrupt gains made in the region are immediately smuggled out to safe havens abroad.   
Third, corruption in South Asia often leads to promotion, not prison.  The big fish – unless they belong to the opposition – rarely fry. 
Fourth, corruption in South Asia occurs with 515 million people in poverty, not with per capita incomes above twenty thousand dollars.   
In the case of Vineet Narain vs. Union of India (AIR 1998) the Supreme Court referred with approval the recommendations of Lord Nolan Committee on Standards in Public Life in the United Kingdom.  The following principles of public life, of general application, were commended by the court:
“Principles of public life: The general principles of conduct which underpin public life need to be restated. We have done this. The seven principles of selflessness, integrity, objectivity, accountability, openness, honesty and leadership are set out (later on).
Codes of conduct: All public bodies should draw up codes of conduct incorporating these principles.

Independent scrutiny: Internal systems for maintaining standards should be supported by independent scrutiny.
               
Education: More needs to be done to promote and reinforce standards of conduct in public bodies, in particular through guidance and training, including induction training.”
The Seven Principles of Public Life are stated in the Report by  Nolan Committee, thus -
 “The Seven Principles of Public Life:

·         Selflessness
·         Integrity
·         Objectivity        
·         Accountability
·         Openness
·         Honesty
·         Leadership





Certain measures required to be taken for ensuring probity in governance:  
·         Need for enforcing section 5 of the Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Act, 1988
·         Misfeasance in Public Office – A Remedy
·         Necessity for a law providing for confiscation of illegally acquired assets of public servants
·         Enactment of a Public Interest Disclosure Act
·         Enactment of a Freedom of Information Act
·         Necessity for enacting a Lok Pal Bill in addition to the Central Vigilance Commission Act
·         Strengthening of the Criminal Judicial System

==Previous years' questions==
===2013===
1) A Public Information Officer has received an application under RTI Act. Having gathered the information, the PlO discovers that the information pertains to some of the decisions taken by him, which were found to be not altogether right. There were other employees also who party to these decisions were. Disclosure of the information is likely to lead to disciplinary action with possibility of punishment against him as well as some of his colleagues. Non-disclosure or part disclosure or camouflaged disclosure of information will result into lesser punishment or no punishment.

The PIO is otherwise an honest and conscientious person but this particular decision, on which the RTI application has been filed, turned out to be wrong. He comes to you for advice.

The following are some suggested options. Please evaluate the merits and demerits of each of the options

(i) The PIO could refer the matter to his superior officer and seek his advice and act strictly in accordance with the advice, even though he is not completely in agreement with the advice of the superior.

(ii) The PIO could proceed on leave and leave the matter to be dealt by his successor in office or request for transfer of the application to another PIO.

(iii) The PIO could weigh the consequences of disclosing the information truthfully, including the effect on his career, and reply in a manner that would not place him or his career in jeopardy, but at the same time a little compromise can be made on the contents of the information.

(iv) The PIO could consult his other colleagues who are party to the decision and take action as per their advice.
Also please indicate (without necessarily restricting to the above options) what you would like to advise, giving proper reasons. (250 words)


2) You are working as an Executive Engineer in the construction cell of a Municipal Corporation and are presently in-charge of the construction of a flyover. There are two Junior Engineers under you who have the responsibility of day-to-day inspection of the site and are reporting to you, while you are finally reporting to the Chief Engineer who heads the cell. While the construction is heading towards completion, the Junior Engineers have been regularly reporting that all construction is taking place as per design specifications. However, in one of your surprise inspections, you have noticed some serious deviations and lacunae which, in your opinion, are likely to affect the safety of the flyover. Rectification of these lacunae at this stage would require a substantial amount of demolition and rework which will cause a tangible loss to the contractor and will also delay completion. There is a lot of public pressure on the Corporation to get this construction completed because of heavy traffic congestion in the area. When you brought this matter to the notice of the Chief Engineer, he advised you that in his opinion it is not a very serious lapse and may be ignored. He advised for further expediting the project for completion in time. However, you are convinced that this was a serious matter which might affect public safety and should not be left unaddressed.

What will you do in such a situation? Some of the options are given below. Evaluate the merits and demerits of each of these options and finally suggest what course of action you would like to take, giving reasons. (250 words)

(i) Follow the advice of the Chief Engineer and go ahead.

3) Sivakasi in Tamil Nadu is known for its manufacturing clusters on firecrackers and matches. The local economy of the area is largely dependent on firecrackers industry. It has led to tangible economic development and improved standard of living in the area.

So far as child labour norms for hazardous industries like firecrackers industry are concerned, International Labour Organization (ILO) has set the minimum age as 18 years. In India, however, this age is 14 years.

The units in industrial clusters of firecrackers can be classified into registered and non-registered entities. One typical unit is household-based work. Though the law is clear on the use of child labour employment norms in registered/non-registered units, it does not include household-based works. Household-based work means children working under the supervision of their parents/relatives. To evade child labour norms, several units project themselves as household-based works but employ children from outside. Needless to say that employing children saves the costs for these units leading to higher profits to the owners.

On your visit to one of the units at Sivakasi, the owner takes you around the unit which has about 10—15 children below 14 years of age. The owner tells you that in his household-based unit, the children are all his relatives. You notice that several children smirk, when the owner tells you this. On deeper enquiry, you figure out that neither the owner nor the children are able to satisfactorily establish their relationship with each other.

(a) Bring out and discuss the ethical issues involved in the above case.

(b) What would be your reaction after your above visit? (300 words)


4) You are heading a leading technical institute of the country. The institute is planning to convene an interview panel shortly under your chairmanship for selection of the post of professors. A few days before the interview, you get a call from the Personal Secretary (PS) of a senior government functionary seeking your intervention in favour of the selection of a close relative of the functionary for this post. The PS also informs you that he is aware of the long pending and urgent proposals of your institute for grant of funds for modernization, which are awaiting the functionary’s approval. He assures you that he would get these proposals cleared.

(a) What are the options available to you?

(b) Evaluate each of these options and choose the option which you would adopt, giving reasons. (250 words)


5) As a senior officer in the Finance Ministry, you have access to some confidential and crucial information about policy decisions that the Government is about to announce. These decisions are likely to have far-reaching impact on the housing and construction industry. If the builders have access to this information beforehand, they can make huge profits. One of the builders has done a lot of quality work for the Government and is known to be close to your immediate superior, who asks you to disclose this information to the said builder.

(a) What are the options available to you?

(b) Evaluate each of these options and choose the option which you would adopt, giving reasons. (250 words) 


6) You are the Executive Director of an upcoming Infotech Company which is making a name for itself in the market.

Mr. A, who is a star performer, is heading the marketing team. In a short period of one year, he has helped in doubling the revenues as well as creating high brand equity for the Company so much so that you are thinking of promoting him. However, you have been receiving information from many corners about his attitude towards the female colleagues; particularly his habit of making loose comments on women. In addition, he regularly sends indecent SMS’s to all the team members including his female colleagues.

One day, late in the evening, Mrs. X, who is one of Mr. A’s team members, comes to you visibly disturbed. She complains against the continued misconduct of Mr. A, who has been making undesirable advances towards her and has even tried to touch her inappropriately in his cabin.

She tenders her resignation and leaves your office.

(a) What are the options available to you?

(b) Evaluate each of these options and choose the option you would adopt, giving reasons. (250 words)</text>

The partners meeting in Sofia emerged as a necessity during halfway project time to evaluate the first year’s activity, highlight the results and successful implementation and recognize the possible oversights or miscommunications. 

A certain workflow gap has been observed among the partners as a result of setting different expectations as to project coordination, cultural background and work ethic. 

The need to synchronize partners implementation and results throughout the project and set further steps gained shape into a training and workshop program, on the basis of intercultural awareness and management strategy. 

==== Practices  ====

Both good and bad examples of building transnational partnerships practices are notable for the current action. 

The managerial approach and reaction potential internal issues that led to significant achievements: 

*Creating the opportunity for the partners to meet and to better get to know each other, thus securing a more effective communication and partnership reinforcement. Maintaining a high level of interpersonal focus through direct meetings, discussions and one-to-one relating can significantly influence individuals' motivation and involvement. 
*Focus on intercultural issues and creation of an awareness program giving the participants a chance to exchange from local approach to planning, acceptance of diversity, curiosity and learning, communication patterns and cultural expectations – including specific gestures, traditions and attitude towards global society, social acceptance, work ethic and hierarchic management 
*Open and flexible managerial and cultural approach by extending the partnership with representative from Rroma community in Bulgaria with the effect of social inclusion opportunities and participation of this minority group into policy making and local governance 
*Creative and empowering approach in management. Resolving crises management through meeting and working together with partners, discussing specific issues related to project coordination and technical tasks &lt;br&gt;

Important aspects related to cultural expectations to keep in sight in building and managing international partners that can emerge from less successful practices. Facing multicultural projects requires an enhanced level of cultural sensitivity and competence. Particularly in different response of the partners to creative style vs executive style in project coordination approach on the basis of cultural expectations, society evolution and – to some extent – traditional governance (typically among Eastern European states)&lt;br&gt;Thus it is not always the case, as it proved in a transnational partnership involving Romania and Bulgaria, two newly member states and neighbor countries. While the Romanian partner positively reacted to a flexible management style in coordinating the project, its Bulgarian counterparts required closer coordination and precise guidelines. As it turns out, although both countries have been under totalitarian ruling for a significant time period, Romanians have emerged with renewed entrepreneurial energy and interest for tackling new ideas and projects initiatives, while among the neighbor partner, in absence of aligned perspectives regarding the work that is being done, tended to lose efficiency and interest in its work.&lt;br&gt;Therefore, lack of consistency in coordination in absence of a clear vision shared by this partner involved in the project results in an aspect that may lead to a slow working rhythm and low quality results as well as a lost of motivation due to generalized confusion regarding the objectives and activities.&lt;br&gt;In this context, lack of clear stated roles and positions the partners are expected to have in the project and consequent confusion at this level fosters delays in implementation the tasks and in clarifying emerging issues.&lt;br&gt;Communication style that is not sufficiently culturally aware can oftentimes lead to crisis inside the partnership. Simply communicating the monitoring report results, raising some aspects to keep in sight during project implementation could be an example of such approach, that practically blocked the execution flow and generated confusion among the partners

Highlights of the Internal team training program in Sofia, Bulgaria, April 2010 and [[Report on Intercultural Training Program in Sofia, Bulgaria. April, 2010|Intercultural Training Program]] organized by Mirela Ciucur, Liviana Mustafa and Stefano De Santis with the participation of Bulgarian partners: Children of Europe, NASMB, Erceq and Time Foundation &lt;br&gt; 

It is rather beneficial for partnership building and generating successful results during cooperation for development endeavor to recognize the impact of diversity and to give the partner states the opportunity to meet on a mutual ground and exchange from their various experience and cultural perspective. 

The contribution of newly member states to increasing the project’s horizons has been repeatedly emphasized as the key way of gaining a new perspective on how the MDGs are perceived, good and bad practices in implementing them by empowering the local actors. Incidentally, by encouraging representation of Rroma ethnic minority, significant ideas on improved education system by involving the local authorities as well as participation in the policy making have emerged. 

The element of diversity has been stressed several times as the key ingredient to progress and successful partnerships. It is at the essence of building the European Union itself to recognize the role of culturally and historically divers nations and to work on understanding, accepting, learning the differences and finding a mutual language and constructive ways to work together. 

Therefore, one of the most important aspects to highlight was the initiative of including the newly members from Eastern Europe, their significant contribution in reaching the local authorities, educators and media and learning from the partners in this region’s unbiased perspective on cooperation for development. While the necessity for a certain culture of giving education at the public level has been recognized, so many important aspects in implementing the MDGs in the region were brought to the table, particularly models to follow or to learn from. The experience of the partners to some extent but mostly their initiative and drive for learning more and successfully achieve the goals for development – are all part of the positive outcome of the meeting in Sofia. 

One of the program’s priorities – resolving the differences in managerial approach and vision has been successfully achieved by identifying a rather flexible and open style in coordination, in an attempt to encourage initiative and creativity of the partners in implementing the project, while their need for a closer communication and guidance was acknowledged on the basis of cultural background. 

It turns out to be more rewarding to work with our counterparts in an environment of mutual understanding and aligned objectives. And nowhere can this be more needed than in an European endeavor, where misunderstandings based on culture can make or break lucrative projects, transnational partnerships and any other type of cross-cultural working. &lt;br&gt;

Following Eugad workshop and training program. Sofia, Bulgaria April 2010 

=== &lt;br&gt;Executive Summary  ===

The partners meeting in Sofia emerged as a necessity during halfway project time to evaluate the first year’s activity, highlight the results and successful implementation and recognize the possible oversights or miscommunications. 

A certain workflow gap has been observed among the partners as a result of setting different expectations as to project coordination, cultural background and work ethic. 

The need to synchronize partners implementation and results throughout the project and set further steps gained shape into a training and workshop program, on the basis of intercultural awareness and management strategy. 

Several significant achievements resulted following the partners meeting in Sofia, notably: 

*the opportunity for the partners to meet and to better get to know each other, more effective communication and partnership reinforcement 
*intercultural awareness program giving the chance to exchange from local approach to planning, acceptance of diversity, curiosity and learning, communication patterns and cultural expectations – including specific gestures, traditions and attitude towards global society, social acceptance, work ethic and hierarchic management 
*extended partnership with representative from Rroma community in Bulgaria with the effect of social inclusion opportunities and participation of this minority group into policy making and local governance 
*resolving crises management through meeting and working together with partners, discussing specific issues related to project coordination and technical tasks

=== Workshop highlights  ===

*the great interest among the participants in learning about intercultural aspects in a transnational partnership 
*diversity related issues and its crucial role in working in cooperation projects and development oriented strategies 
*partners' networks and supporters, a venue that can help influence the policy making process both at the European and local level 
*cultural differences between the Eastern and Western countries - the level of limitation in daring to start new and innovative projects, most probably based on a history of lacking social acceptance and identity

=== Program objectives  ===

#Define milestones of first year of activities within the project, identify strengths and weaknesses in partnership management 
#Benchmarks from implementing activities in Romania, provide key methods and tools for effectively introduce them in Bulgaria 
#Cross cultural exchanges – address different cultural approach to planning the activities within the project, communication methods and language differences, intercultural task management 
#Reinforce the cooperation level among the partners through discussing potential issues and obstacles and responding to specific needs on a national and local bases 
#Increase the cultural awareness and capacity to expand the extent of local knowledge, in best preparing and introducing the project’s outcome.

=== Ideas summary  ===

It is rather beneficial for partnership building and generating successful results during cooperation for development endeavor to recognize the impact of diversity and to give the partner states the opportunity to meet on a mutual ground and exchange from their various experience and cultural perspective. 

The contribution of newly member states to increasing the project’s horizons has been repeatedly emphasized as the key way of gaining a new perspective on how the MDGs are perceived, good and bad practices in implementing them by empowering the local actors. Incidentally, by encouraging representation of Rroma ethnic minority, significant ideas on improved education system by involving the local authorities as well as participation in the policy making have emerged. 

The element of diversity has been stressed several times as the key ingredient to progress and successful partnerships. It is at the essence of building the European Union itself to recognize the role of culturally and historically divers nations and to work on understanding, accepting, learning the differences and finding a mutual language and constructive ways to work together. 

Therefore, one of the most important aspects to highlight was the initiative of including the newly members from Eastern Europe, their significant contribution in reaching the local authorities, educators and media and learning from the partners in this region’s unbiased perspective on cooperation for development. While the necessity for a certain culture of giving education at the public level has been recognized, so many important aspects in implementing the MDGs in the region were brought to the table, particularly models to follow or to learn from. The experience of the partners to some extent but mostly their initiative and drive for learning more and successfully achieve the goals for development – are all part of the positive outcome of the meeting in Sofia. 

One of the program’s priorities – resolving the differences in managerial approach and vision has been successfully achieved by identifying a rather flexible and open style in coordination, in an attempt to encourage initiative and creativity of the partners in implementing the project, while their need for a closer communication and guidance was acknowledged on the basis of cultural background. 

It turns out to be more rewarding to work with our counterparts in an environment of mutual understanding and aligned objectives. And nowhere can this be more needed than in an European endeavor, where misunderstandings based on culture can make or break lucrative projects, transnational partnerships and any other type of cross-cultural working. 

In our attempt to raise our cultural awareness and enable us to communicate effectively across national cultures, our partners workshop meeting was meant to stimulate our beyond-self-culture personal curiosity and enable us to work more effectively with our counterparts from neighbor cultures. 

The intercultural training program in Sofia, Bulgaria was therefore a success, resolving all of the objectives proposed and setting the ground for a reinforced transnational partnership, improved communication, a more culturally aware coordination and effective steps, both strategic and technical for successfully implementing the Action.

=== Brief description of the event  ===

Since cultural differences are so deep and intuitive, they can lead sometimes to substantial misunderstanding and miscommunication. Nowhere can this be more detrimental than in an European endeavor, where misunderstandings based on culture can make or break lucrative projects, transnational partnerships and any other type of cross-cultural working.&lt;br&gt;Our intercultural training workshop is, therefore, an ongoing attempt to raise our cultural awareness and enable us to communicate effectively across our cultures.&lt;br&gt;Created in close collaboration with the partner organizations, our intercultural program in Sofia is meant to stimulate our beyond-our-own-culture personal curiosity and enable us to work more effectively with our counterparts from other cultures. 

=== Proposed focus  ===

*How a team cooperates in addressing strengths and weaknesses in partnership management; 
*Evaluation of the results accomplished in the first year and how to achieve the expected project milestones, 
*Benchmarks from implementing activities in Romania, provide key methods and tools for effectively introduce them in Bulgaria (this needs to be better clarified) 
*Cross Cultural communication: – address different cultural approach to planning the activities within the project, communication methods and language differences, intercultural task management

&lt;br&gt; 

=== Minutes of the Internal Team Meeting  ===

The meetings took place in Sofia and was hosted by Children of Europe organization, in Sofia University. &lt;br&gt;The participants were invited among the Bulgarian partners and were welcomed by the Project Manager and the Romanian team, who opened '''the first day meeting''' with a short introduction about the event and its objectives. The President of Children of Europe organization, Ms. Karina Angelieva, introduced her new team of experts in the project and discussed about the good timing of the workshop considering the importance of aligning partners' ideas and activities at this stage. Mr. Stefano de Santis followed the discussion with some insights on the EUGAD vision and expected outcomes and introduced the partners to the documentary challenge, highlighting the importance of personal motivation and initiative for a successful partnership and management.&lt;br&gt;Mrs. Mirela Ciucur discussed the agenda and asked the participants to plan together the following meetings and discussions in order to touch base on every pending step concerning the Action. She continued with an interactive presentation, with the support of her Romanian colleague, Ms. Liviana Mustafa, on issues related to the challenges of a transnational partnership and the importance of gaining intercultural awareness in order to achieve the desired impact. She also argued the importance of accepting diversity as a personal and social development stimulant and highlighted a few habits that can secure the success within an intercultural working group. Ms Liviana Mustafa supported the presented ideas with some anecdotes meant to illustrate the messages conveyed and invited the participants to a cross-cultural discussion on specific habits and national stereotypes. &lt;br&gt;This introduction was followed by a series of direct meetings between the training team and the Bulgarian partners, starting with the National Association of Small and Medium Businesses represented by Mrs. Anna Lalkovska. The meeting took place the same day in the NASMB office in Sofia and offered the participants the opportunity of discussing the project status and potential challenges in implementing the tasks. Mrs. Anna Lalkovska discussed about the work done in Bulgaria by the organization and shared her ideas on the following steps in the Action as well as different opportunities in strengthening the partnership.&lt;br&gt;'''The second day''', the training team had several meetings with the other partners in the project continuing the direct discussions with Mrs. Malina Georgieva, the representative of Erceq Bulgaria. Expectations and perspectives regarding the EUGAD project were clarified and a framework was discussed in order to secure the desired outputs. Mrs. Malina Georgieva highlighted the important input that Erceq expertise and network can have for the Action and confirmed her interest and enthusiasm in participating in the project. A meeting with Mr. Kamen Chipev, the representative of Time Foundation, followed, offering the opportunity to understand his perception about EUGAD management style and his different approach and reasons for intending to leave the project. Once more, the necessity of meeting on a mutual ground to resolve certain aspects related to the managerial approach, the planning and decision making process within the project emerged as they may not always meet the organizations' expectations from the beginning. Mr. Stefano de Santis used this venue to re-establish connection with Time Foundation representative and explained his approach in managing the project as well as efforts he has done to secure the results and maintain a high level of motivation among the participants. Both sides agreed that Time Foundation has finalized its work within the EUGAD partnership and established the next necessary steps in securing the most impactfull implementation of the pending tasks. &lt;br&gt;The day ended with a question based interview between Mr. Stefano de Santis and the Romanian organizing team aiming at highlighting the most important aspects related to cultural diversity and how it reflects on the current partnership, ideas useful for the video documentary.&lt;br&gt;'''The third day''' of the meeting was mostly dedicated to planning and brainstorming among all the Bulgarian partners and the training team. Ideas and strategies regarding the creation of Manuals and the best format for presenting them to the identified stakeholders were discussed by Mrs. Karina Angelieva that affirmed again her interest in coordinating the Capacity Building workshop and the possibility of organizing it as a Bulgarian-Romanian joint event. Mr. Stefano de Santis had the chance to share his expectations regarding the documentaries and broadcasting possibilities and further clarified all pending administrative and management related questions. He also discussed the next outcomes of the project – Manuals and documentaries – and suggested some venues of getting the best results from the following step planned for EUGAD, the Capacity Building Workshop.&lt;br&gt;Technical aspects related to the wiki updating were also mentioned and some aspects were clarified the same day. Further pending steps and potential questions will be discussed and clarified through Skype conferences.

== Question 1  ==

*''Can you share with us the issues and questions you plan addressing and the information you expect to receive from this mission?&lt;br&gt;''

''It would help our partners to share thoughts with their team members and thus represent the voice of their organisation in the meetings with you.?''&lt;br&gt;&lt;u&gt;Answer&lt;/u&gt;:&amp;nbsp; Being more specific to the monitoring exercise, this is structured over five criteria. These are:&lt;br&gt; 

#Relevance and Quality of Project Design: The appropriateness of project’s objectives to the real problems, needs and priorities of its target groups/beneficiaries and the quality of the project design through which these objectives are to be achieved.&lt;br&gt; 
#Efficiency of implementation to date: How well were the means/inputs applied to the activities and converted into results (as in &quot;outputs&quot;).&lt;br&gt; 
#Effectiveness to date: The contribution made by the project’s results (as in &quot;outcomes&quot;) to the achievement of the project purpose.&lt;br&gt; 
#Impact prospects: As presently implemented, the project’s likely contribution to the project’s Overall Objective.&lt;br&gt; 
#Potential Sustainability: The likelihood of a continuation in the stream of benefits produced by the project after the period of external support has ended.&lt;br&gt;

== Question 2 &amp;amp; 3&lt;br&gt;  ==

*''Since we have implemented only 25% of the Action Gantt, it will be possible for us to measure the efficeincy of activities undertaken to produce the expected results. However, it is not yet possible for us to measure the outcomes, i.e. the expected changes occurring as a direct consequence of the project. This is because these changes are not directly achieved by the project team but are a consequence of the proactive participation of other project stakeholders who are expected to capitalize the project results and use them according to the Action plan. Do you agree with this? ''&lt;br&gt; 
*''If we cannot yet address the issue of measuring or evaluating the outcomes, we cannot yet evaluate the coherence of the project design, i.e. its capacity of individuating the adequate project outputs that will enable action beneficiaries to take corrective actions on the factors generating the identified problems, thereby contributing to the achievement of action objectives. Do you agree with that?''&lt;br&gt;

&lt;u&gt;'''Answer:&lt;br&gt;'''&lt;/u&gt; Without studying any of the documentation of your project, I understand that the project is at an early stage. So, by experience, I would say that the focus would be more on the design and the quality of the Logical Framework Matrix-logframe (a good logframe clearly defines the intervention logic, it has SMART OVIs that can be realistically measured and takes into consideration the risks and the assumptions) and the activities undertaken so far and less on the achievement of the results and the specific objectives (project purpose). Also, based on the design and the progress so far, the likelihood of impact and sustainability can be assessed (the real impact and sustainability come usually after the end of a project).&lt;u&gt;'''&lt;br&gt;'''&lt;/u&gt; 

&lt;br&gt; 

== Question 4  ==

*''In your letter, you stated that the Objective of Monitoring is to enable focused project management decisions. Since the applicant is not listed as a Recipient of the Monitoring results, we were wondering if you plan sharing the mission results and recommendations with us so that the project mangement team is better able to take focused decisions?''&lt;br&gt;

&lt;u&gt;'''Answer'''&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt; 

Our output is a two pages report, with concrete structure (it is based on the five monitoring criteria). We are contractually obliged to send it directly to the EC in Brussels. The Task Manager of the project should circulate it to the project stakeholders in order that they are aware of the monitoring recommendations. So, yes, the results of the mission will be noticed to you (through the official channel, this being the Task Manager in Brussels).&lt;br&gt; 

== Question 5  ==

*''Does your Organization have a web site where the organization is presented?&amp;nbsp; Does Europaid have a web site where the scope and the method of external monitoring missions are explained?''

&lt;u&gt;'''Answer'''&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt; 

Our organization, being an Institute inside the National Technical University of Athens has a web-site but it is more academic-oriented than business-oriented. 

You will not get any valuable information from there. Nevertheless, I am sending you two links from the web-site of Europeaid that refer to the monitoring and the assurance of projects quality.

'''Princess Cake''' or ''prinsesstårta'' (original name in Swedish).

==Ingredients==
* Cake layers
* A green marzipan layer for the top
* Whipped cream
* Vanilia cream
** 2 dl whipped cream
** 2 egg yellows
** 2 table spoons maize flour
** 1 table spoon sugar
** ½ tea spoon vanilla powder 
* Powder sugar
* Strawberry jam (optional)

==Procedure==

Sweet cake layers can be bought ready. If you use them, the cake will take much less time to make (if you want to bake cake layers, the time to make the cake will probably double). The same goes for marzipan, you should be able to buy a already flattened piece of marzipan.

For the vanilla cream, mix all ingredients except for the vanilla powder and heat it to just below cooking point. Whip it for a while as it is bubbling (but not boiling!). Let it cool off for some minutes and then add the vanilla powder.

Put the vanilla cream between the layers and the whipped cream on top of the cake layers. If you want to have jam in the cake, replace one of the layers of vanilla cream with jam. the top layer of whipped cream should be thick and domed.

Cover the whole cake with the marzipan like on the picture and spray some powder sugar on it. Store in the fridge until it shall be eaten.

===[[Introduction_to_Oceanography]]===
This book describes the materials which make the oceans, and the unique chemical and physical properties of sea water.
We shall describe their origin, behavior, and history, and when relevant the relationship to other Earth systems such as the atmosphere and the lithosphere.
After reading this book, you will have a better understanding of the Ocean role in our dynamic planet.
This book is intended for people who wish to better understand our world and we hope that the text is fluently readable.
We hope the text will encompass a university level oceanography course.
The reader is assumed to have a general knowledge of high school chemistry, physics, and mathematics.
When complex ideas from these disciplines are introduced we will include a breif primer and link to relevant materials to aid the reader who is unfamiliar with them.
Our primary purpose is to be as clear as possible.

== Infobox Troubles ==

I'm editing a book. Specifically, [[Guide to The Lord of the Rings]]. I wanted to create a page for a character. I looked around to see how to make an infobox. Since this character is from Lord of the Rings, a work of Tolkien. I found an infobox template for Tolkien's fictional characters on Wikipedia. Here's a link to it: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Infobox_Tolkien_character]. I discovered that this doesn't work on Wikibooks. I searched for another one that would work on Wikibooks but the closest I could find was [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Template:Infobox_person/doc]. Unfortunately, this isn't good because I need it to say the race. The closest thing is ethnicity which doesn't make much sense in that case. I would like to know how I can make custom infoboxes. I'm pretty sure it's possible since, for example: Harry Potter on Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter, has an infobox unique to it. If you go to [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Muggles%27_Guide_to_Harry_Potter/Characters/Harry_Potter], if you view its source, you'd see that the infobox name is &quot;{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Character|&quot; rather than &quot;{{Infobox person&quot;. 

In conclusion, is there a way to use Wikipedia's infobox templates on Wikibooks, or a way to make a unique infobox template?

Answers would be appreciated. Thanks. [[User:PhoenixTheTraveller|PhoenixTheTraveller]] ([[User talk:PhoenixTheTraveller|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/PhoenixTheTraveller|contribs]]) 07:25, 15 December 2013 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Introduction to the GRE ===

The Graduate Record Examinations (GRE) is a standardized test used for graduate admissions in the United States and Canada, as well as for English-language studies worldwide.  The test is created by Educational Testing Services (ETS), a company which also makes the Praxis and TOEFL exams.

=== Scoring ===

The GRE is scored on a scale of 130 to 170 for both its verbal and quantitative sections - each gets a separate score.

=== Other Important Facts About the GRE ===

''Paper or Computer Options''.  The GRE may be taken on paper or using a computer.  Test takers may register at www.ets.org.

''Computer adaptivity''.  The computer based version of the test becomes harder or easier based on the test taker's performance, but only between sections.  For example, doing well on the first verbal section will cause the second one to increase in difficulty, but not affect remaining questions on the first.

''Calculator''.  Test takers may use a non-scientific calculator for the math sections.  This is provided onscreen for the computer version of the test.

''No penalty for guessing''.  Unlike some tests, here is no penalty for marking an incorrect response on the GRE.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction to GRE Math ==

The GRE tests only basic math universal to high school curricula.  The exam generally does not test any math beyond high school geometry; there is no trigonometry or calculus on the test.  Its math can be broken into essentially four categories.

=== Math Operations ===

The GRE frequently tests knowledge of these mathematical concepts such as the rules of radicals, exponents, absolute value, positives, negatives, and inverses.

=== Algebra ===

Algebra refers to the use of variables and equations to solve problems, such as by substituting a letter-value for an unknown.  The GRE heavily tests algebra, particularly in problems involving rates or proportions.

=== Geometry ===

Geometry refers to the variety of rules used to calculate attributes of lines and shapes.  The GRE tests a great deal of geometry, especially triangles, squares and circles.

=== Data Interpretation ===

Every GRE math section has a section of questions based on a chart, designed to test data interpretation skills.  Many of the other questions test statistical concepts such as averages and standard deviation.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The Two Types of GRE Math Questions ==

There are two types of GRE math questions: quantity comparison, and ordinary problem solving.

=== Quantity Comparison ===

A quantity comparison question will give two quantities and ask the test taker to compare them.  For example:


:1.  Ashley's pet cockatoo eats &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{7}{4}&lt;/math&gt; as much bird food as her pet parakeet.  Ashley has no other pets.


:'''Quantity A:'''  the percentage of total bird food eaten by Ashley's cockatoo

:'''Quantity B:'''  65%


:(A) Quantity A is greater.
:(B) Quantity B is greater.
:(C) The two quantities are equal.
:(D) The relationship cannot be determined from the information given.


(The correct answer is (A)).

=== Problem Solving ===

A problem solving question asks a &quot;normal&quot; multiple choice or open-ended question which requires mathematical reasoning to solve.


:11.  Vivie's pet cockatoo eats as much bird food as her pet parakeet.  Vivie has no other pets.  What fraction of the total bird food is eaten by Vivie's cockatoo?


:(A)&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{7}{4}&lt;/math&gt;
:(B)&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{4}{7}&lt;/math&gt;
:(C)&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{11}{4}&lt;/math&gt;
:(D)&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{11}{7}&lt;/math&gt;
:(E)&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{7}{11}&lt;/math&gt;


(The correct answer is (E))

The question prompt may be multiple choice or may be open-ended, asking test takers to bubble in the value.  Additionally, some may have three or seven choices and more than one correct answer.  This will be clearly indicated.  Also, approximately four problem solving questions around questions 17-20 will be based on a chart.

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Integers =

Though not explicitly tested, the concepts of '''integers''' and '''whole numbers''' are important to solving GRE math problems.

=== Rules ===

'''An integer is a number without any fraction or decimal behind it.'''

1, 3, -5, and 268 are integers, while 1.77 and &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{-2}{7}&lt;/math&gt; are not.

'''A whole number is a positive integer.'''

1, 2, and 3 are whole numbers; .62, -8, and {{sqrt|56}} are not.

=== Practice ===

Determine whether each of the following is an integer, a whole number, or both.

1.  -2

2.  113.7

3. &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{5}{6}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Comments ===

The GRE isn't going to ask questions such as “which of the following is an integer?” but the concept is important for solving other questions.  For instance, if 1 &lt;  ''x'' &lt; 5, x could have an infinite number of values, from 1.00001 to 3.0065.  But if ''x'' is an integer, its values are now limited to 2, 3, and 4.

=== Answers to Practice Questions ===

1.  -2 is an integer – it does not end in a fraction or decimal.  However, it is not a whole number.  Whole numbers are positive.

2.  113.7 is not an integer because it ends in a decimal.  Because it is not an integer, it is not a whole number either.  Remember, whole numbers are positive integers.

3. &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{5}{6}&lt;/math&gt;  is not an integer – it is a fraction.  Integers, remember, are numbers which do not end in fractions or decimals.  Because it is not an integer, it is not a whole number either, since whole numbers are positive integers.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">= '''Absolute Value''' =

The concept of '''absolute value''' - meaning a number's distance from zero - is tested on nearly every GRE.

=== Rule ===

'''Absolute value makes a negative positive, but otherwise does nothing.'''

“|   |” designates absolute value.  For example, if | ''x'' + 3 | = 5, there are two possible values for ''x'':

* ''x'' + 3 = 5, meaning ''x'' is 2

* ''x'' + 3 = -5, meaning ''x'' is -8

On an absolute value questions, split the value into two equations as seen above.

=== Practice ===
 

1. If | 3''x'' - 4 | = 5, then what could be the value of ''x''?


2. If | ''a'' | &gt; ''a'', then what is the greatest integer that ''a'' could be?


3. If 3|4''k'' - 2| - 12 = -3, what is the value of ''k''?


=== Comments ===

Absolute value tends to be tested in the quantity comparison section of the test, often with a variable modified by a constant within the absolute value.  (e.g. | ''q'' + 7 | = 5)  Solve these by writing out both of the potential values for the variable, and ''remember that either one could be the value.'' For example, in the prior equation, ''q'' could equal either -2 or -12, so it is unclear whether it is greater or less than -5.

=== Answers to Practice Questions ===
 
 
1. 3, -&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{-1}{3}&lt;/math&gt;


If | 3''x'' - 4 | = 5 then

3''x'' - 4 = 5

::or

3''x'' - 4 = -5


3''x'' - 4 = 5
:::::Take the first equation and solve it.  First, add 4 to both sides.

3''x'' = 9
:::::Now divide both sides by 3.

''x'' = 3
:::::''x'' is equal to 3.  But remember, this is just ''one'' solution - you still need to solve the other equation.

3''x'' - 4 = -5
:::::Now take the second equation and solve it. Add 4 to both sides.

3''x'' = -1
:::::Now divide both sides by 3.

''x'' = &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{-1}{3}&lt;/math&gt;


:::::''x'' is equal to negative one third.


This means that ''x'' = 3 ''or'' &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{-1}{3}&lt;/math&gt;


2. -1


Absolute value makes a positive negative, but otherwise does nothing - if the absolute value of a number is greater than that number itself, the number must be negative.  The greatest negative number is -1.

3. ''k'' = &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{5}{4}&lt;/math&gt;5/4,&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{-1}{4}&lt;/math&gt;


If 3|4''k'' - 2| - 12 = -3, then

3|4''k'' - 2|  = 9
:::::Add 12 to both sides.

|4''k'' - 2| =  3
:::::Divide both sides by 3.

4''k'' - 2 = 3

Split both possibilities.

4''k'' - 2 = -3
:::::Add 2 to to both sides

4''k'' = 5			.	
:::::Divide both sides by 5.

''k'' = &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{-1}{4}&lt;/math&gt;</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Positives &amp; Negatives ==

'''Subtracting a negative is the same as adding a positive.'''

5 - -3 = 5 + 3 = 8

'''Adding a negative is the same as subtracting a positive.'''

2 + -5 = 2 – 5 = -3

'''Multiplying a negative and a positive equals a negative.'''

5(-3) = -15

'''Multiplying a negative and a negative equals a positive.'''

-7(-3) = 7(3) = 21

Thus, multiplying any odd number of negatives together equals a negative, while multiplying any even number of negatives together equals a positive.

===Practice===

1.  What is the value of 8(-4)?


2.  If -2 - ''y'' is positive, then is ''y'' negative or positive?


3.  ''x''^77 is positive.  Is ''x'' negative or positive?




=== Answers to Practice Questions ===

1.  -32


Multiplying a positive by a negative equals a negative.


2.  ''y'' must be negative (and must be less than -2)


Subtracting a negative is the same as adding a positive.  For example, ''y'' could equal -3.  -2 - -3 = -2 + 3 = 1.


3.  ''x'' must be positive.


A negative multiplied by a negative equals a positive (e.g., -1 ✕ -1 = 1), while a positive multiplied by a negative equals a negative (e.g., (-1 ✕ -1) ✕ -1 = 1 ✕ -1 = -1).  Therefore, -1(-1)(-1) is negative, while -1(-1)(-1)(-1) is positive.  Thus, any time an odd number of negatives are multiplied together, they equal a negative - meaning x must be positive, since 77 ''x''s multiplied together are positive.

=== Practice ===

1.  ''xy'' is even and ''xz'' is odd.  Is ''y'' odd or even?


2.  ''a'' + ''b'' + ''c'' is even.  If ''a'' is odd, then could ''b'' and ''c'' be


both odd?

both even?

odd and even?


3.  (''f'' + ''g'')''h'' is an odd number.  If ''f'' is even, is ''g'' + ''h'' odd or even?
							

=== Answers to Practice Questions ===

1.  ''y'' must be even.


The product of two numbers is only odd if both numbers are odd.  Since ''xz'' is odd, both ''x'' and ''z'' must be odd.  However, ''xy'' is even.  This means that between ''x'' and ''y'', one must be even.  Since ''x'' is odd, ''y'' must be even.


2.  ''b'' and ''c'' must be odd and even, not necessarily in that order.


An odd plus an odd equals an even, as does an even plus an even.  Only an odd plus an even equals an odd.  Since ''a'' + ''b'' + ''c'' is even and ''a'' is odd, ''b'' + ''c'' must be odd.  This means that, between ''b'' and ''c'', one must be odd, and one must be even.  If they were both odd or even, ''b'' + ''c'' would be even, meaning ''a'' + ''b'' + ''c'' would be even, but it isn't.


3.  ''g'' + ''h'' must be even.


Only an odd and another odd multiply to make an odd.  Therefore, since (''f'' + ''g'')''h'' is odd, ''f'' + ''g'' must be odd.  Since ''f'' is even, ''g'' must be odd, since only an even and an odd add up to an odd.  ''h'' also must be odd, since it multiplies to make an odd.  Therefore, since an odd plus an odd equals an even, ''g'' + ''h'' must be even.</text>

'''A prime number is a number only divisible by itself and 1.'''

Prime numbers between 1 and 100 are as follows:

	2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41,
	43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97

Some numbers like 51, 57 or 93 may look like prime numbers but are in fact divisible by an oddball prime number.  These three are divisible by 17, 19 and 31, respectively.

Non-prime numbers can be divided into their prime factors.

A “factor” is a number by which a larger number can be divided.  Non-prime numbers can be broken down into their prime factors using a factor tree.

	    24
          |     |
        2       12
               |     |
             2        6
                     |   |
                    2     3


  24 = 2(2)(2)(3) or 2&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;(3)


This expression is known as the “prime factorization” of 24.  When factoring numbers, it is typically easiest to divide by 2's and 3's when possible.

=== Practice ===

1.  What is the prime factorization of 100?


2.  How many prime numbers are greater than 50 but less than 60?


3.  Express 372 as a product of prime numbers.


=== Answers to Practice Questions ===

1.  2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(5&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) or (2)(2)(5)(5)

Prime factorization can be achieved by drawing a factor tree - picking any two numbers that a number divides into, and dividing downward.

	100
           /      \
         4        25
       /    \     /    \
     2      2  5     5

The bottoms of the branches are the prime factors.  It doesn't matter which two numbers are picked first.  All factor trees lead to the same numbers.

	100
           /      \
         5        20
       	      /    \
	     2     10
	           /    \
 	          2      5

2.  Two - 53 and 59.

51 is divisible by 17, while 57 is divisible by 19.

3.  2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(3)(31) or 2(2)(3)(31)

             372
          /       \
        2        186
                 /     \
               2       93
                       /    \
                     3     31

As you can see, it is usually easier when factoring to take out 2's or 3's at first.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Least Common Multiple ==

The least common multiple of two numbers is the number that contains all of each's prime factors in the appropriate quantities, but nothing more.

For instance, the least common multiple of 12 and 15 is 60.

	12				15
          /     \			           /    \
        2        6			         3      5
                /    \
              2       3

The prime factorizations of 12 and 15 are 2(2)(3) and (3)(5).  Their least common multiple is 2(2)(3)(5), or 60.  The numbers share a prime factor, 3.

If numbers do not share any prime factors, the least common multiple is the product of the two numbers.  For instance, the least common multiple of 7 and 12 is 84.

If numbers share all of the same factors, such as 16 and 32 (which are 2(2)(2)(2) and 2(2)(2)(2)(2), respectively), the least common multiple is the greater number.

=== Practice ===

1.  What is the least common multiple of 20 and 15?

2.  If the least common multiple of two numbers is 36, and one of the numbers is 9, what is the other number?

3.  The least common multiple of 14 and 16 is how much greater than the least common multiple of 5 and 12?

                /    \
              2      5

The prime factorization of 20 is 2(2)(5), while the prime factorization of 15 is (3)(5).  Their least common multiple will thus be 2(2)(3)(5) - the number which contains all of the prime factors of each in the appropriate quantities, but nothing more.  The numbers share a common factor - 5 - thus, the 5 need not be repeated.

The prime factorization of 36 is 2(2)(3)(3).  The prime factorization of 9 is 3(3).  Since 36 is the least common multiple of 9 and the other number, this other number must be 2(2), or 4, since the least common multiple of two numbers is the number which contains the prime factors of each in the appropriate quantities, but nothing more.

16=2(2)2(2).

LCM of 14 and 16 → 7(2)2(2)2 = 112.

5=5

12=3(2)2.

LCM of 5 and 12 → 2(2)3(5) = 60.

112-60=52.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Greatest Common Factor ==

The greatest common factor of two numbers is the product of the prime factors which they have in common in the same quantities.

For example, the greatest common factor of 60 and 48 is 12.

	60				48
          /     \			           /    \

60 is equal to 2(2)(3)(5), while 48 is equal to 2(2)(2)(2)(3).  Their shared prime factors are 2, 2 and 3, which equal 12.

=== Practice ===

1.  What is the greatest common factor of 180 and 216?

2.  If the greatest common factor of 84 and y is 6, and the greatest common factor of 125 and y is 5, what is the lowest possible value for y?

3.  Which is larger - the greatest common factor of 120 and 192, or the greatest common factor of 128 and 192?

The prime factorization of 180 is 2(2)(3)(3)(5), while the prime factorization of 216 is 2(2)(2)(3)(3)(3).  The greatest common factor is the product of the prime factors they have in common in the same quantities - 2(2)(3)(3), or 36.

2.  30

If the greatest common factor of 84 and y is 6, then y at a minimum must have prime factors of 2 and 3.  If the greatest common factor of 125 and y is 5, then y must have 5 as a factor too.  Thus, y must at least equal 2(3)(5), or 30.

3.  The greatest common factor of 128 and 192

This question requires determining the prime factorization of each number.

The prime factorization of 192 is 2(2)(2)(2)(2)(2)(3).  Its greatest common factor with 120 is thus 2(2)(2)(3), or 24, while its greatest common factor with 128 is 2(2)(2)(2)(2)(2), or 64.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Order of Operations ==

The order of mathematical operations is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division, and finally, addition and subtraction.

The acronym is “Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally.”

Within these categories, it doesn't matter which operation is performed first.  Init doesn't matter whether 6 is divided by the 7 first or multiplied by the 8 first; the result will be the same.  However, with parentheses, the interior parentheses must be worked out prior to working out any exterior parentheses.  2(3(4 + 5)) requires adding the 4 and 5 before multiplying the result by 3.

“Divide bars” operate as parentheses.

Inthe 6 and 7 are added first, unlike inor a similar expression.

1.  What is the value of?

2.  If= 45 then what does q equal?

3.  If 5(6&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)(3 + 2) = 5 + e, what is the value of e?
		

=== Answers to Practice Questions ===

1.  6

Subtract the 2 from the 3 first, then multiply the 5 by the 1, then add the 4 to the 5.  Multiply the 6 by the 9, then divide by 9 to arrive at 6.

2.  13

	Start with the initial equation.

	Work out the parentheses.

	Multiply both sides by 7.

		Expand the parentheses.

		Subtract 24 from both sides.

		Divide both sides by 3.  q is 13.

3.  895

5(6&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)(3 + 2) = 5 + e	Start with the initial equation.

5(36)(5) = 5 + e 	Work out the operations inside the parentheses.

900 = 5 + e		Multiply the parenthetical amounts together.

895 = e		Subtract 5 from both sides.  e is 895.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Percentages ==

Percentage is a fraction of 100.  11% = .11 = 

Percent simply means “per hundred.”  However, be careful not to mix up the two key ways in which percentages are used.

Do not mix up changing to a percentage with changing by a percentage.

If a group of 100 members decreases to 20% of its membership, its membership goes down to 20.  If the group decreases by 20%, it goes down to 80.  Increasing to 110% is the same as increasing by 10%.  This also applies to fractions and decimals but is an especially common error with percentages.

=== Practice ===

1.  What is 30% of 80?

2.  If a bank account worth $10,000 increased in value by 25%, how much did it increase, and how much is it worth now?

3.  If a bank account worth $10,000 decreased in value to 25% of its worth, how much did it decrease, and how much is it worth now?


=== Answers to Practice Questions ===

1.  24

30% of 80 = .30(80) = .3(80) == 24

2.  The bank account's value increased by $2,500.  It increased to $12,500.

25% of 10,000 = .25(10,000) = 

This value must be added to the original total.  The account increased by 25%, and increased to 125% of its previous value.

3.  The bank account's value decreased by $7,500.  It decreased to $2,500.

25% of 10,000 = .25(10,000) = 

Since the bank account decreased to this percentage, this amount is the new value.  It must be subtracted from the old value to determine how much the account decreased by.

A '''ratio''' express the proportion of two commodities ''in relation to each other'' (as opposed to in relation to the whole, as a fraction or percentage does).

=== Rules ===

'''Add both numbers in a ratio to get the total amount with respect to each.'''

A ratio expresses quantity in relation to the other.  This is not to be mixed up with parts of the whole.  If the ratio of Democrats to Republicans at a conference is 6 to 4, then Republicans make up 40% of the conference (4 divided by 6 + 4).  If guitar players make up 70% of the rock band seminar and drummers make up 30%, then the ratio of guitarists to drummers is 7 to 3.

=== Practice ===

1.  Of the 50 lawyers at the meeting, 22 are bankruptcy lawyers; the remainder are divorce lawyers.  What is the ratio of bankruptcy lawyers to divorce lawyers?

2.  The ratio of stocks to bonds in the portfolio is 4 to 9.  If there are 169 items in the portfolio, how many of them are bonds?

3.  The ratio of ratio questions to non-ratio questions on the math quiz is 4 to 5.  If there are a total of 36 questions, how many are ratio questions?

=== Comments ===

As alluded, the most common mistake area in ratios is forgetting that the ratio is an expression of one quantity in relation to each other and not the total amount.  Whenever presented with a ratio, a test taker must add the two numbers to get the whole amount.

=== Answers to Practice Questions ===

1.  11 to 14

The ratio is 22 to (number of divorce lawyers) = 22 to (50 - 22) = 22 to 28 = 11 to 14

2.  117

The ratio of stocks to bonds is 4 to 9.  Thus, the fraction of the portfolio which is bonds is =

Always remember to add both numbers in a ratio to get the total amount.

multiplied by 169 is 117.

3.  16

The ratio of ratio questions to non-ratio questions is 4 to 5.  Thus, the fraction of the quiz which is math questions is = 
multiplied by 36 is 16.

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Decimals =

'''Decimals''' are an extension of the base ten numeral system to fractions of ten (such as hundredths and thousandths).  In this way they are a variation of fractions and percentages.

=== Rules ===

'''Decimals are fractions of 10, 100, 1000, and so on.'''

You will have access to a calculator on the GRE but it is nonetheless important that you understand the concept of decimals.

.1 is equal to one tenth; .01 is equal to one hundredth; .001 is equal to one thousandth.  Decimals are added and subtracted in the same way ordinary numbers are.

When multiplying decimals, multiply the numbers without decimals; then, push the decimal place to the right once for each time each multiplier is pushed to the right of the decimal.

.05 multiplied by .05 equals .0025, not .25.  6 multiplied by .9 is 5.4, while .6 multiplied by .9 is .54.  When in doubt, check these on the calculator.

=== Practice ===

1.  What is .04 multiplied by .08?

2.  y is equal to .4(x).  If x equals 20, what does y equal?

3.  What is the value of .009(.008)(.007)?

=== Answers to Practice Questions ===

1.  .0032

4(8) is 32.  .04 and .08 are both pushed 2 points to the right of the decimal; thus, their product is pushed 4 points to the right.

2.  8

.4(20) = (20) = 8

3.   0.000000504.

The multipliers are each pushed to the right of the decimal 3 times.  Thus, we take their product without decimals, and push it to the right 9 times.

9(8)(7) is 504; which pushed to the right 9 times equals 0.000000504.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The &quot;Up &amp; Down&quot; Rule ==

Increasing by a fraction or percentage requires decreasing by a smaller fraction or percentage to get back to the same quantity.

If a dress that sells for $100 increases in price by 25%, its price goes up to $125.  To return the dress to its original price, its price would have to be reduced by 20%, not 25%.  This is because the base number has increased.  Increasing 60 by 20% yields a value of 72.  72, however, will have to be reduced by a lower percentage - about 16% - to get back to 60.  With fractions, going down takes less than going up, since fractions are based on parts of the whole.

=== Practice ===

1.  A grocery store sells one third of its shortening.  What percentage of its remaining shortening will it have to restock to restore the shortening supply to its present value?

2.  An accountant's fees increase by 15%, but the account promises a discount to loyal customers which will make prices equal to the rate before the increase.  What fraction of the new rate will the accountant have to charge customers receiving the discount?

3.  Office supply sales increase by 40% in April but fall back to their original value in May.  What fraction of April's office supply sales are May's office supply sales?
			
=== Answers to Practice Questions ===

1.  50%

After selling of the shortening,remain.  We are looking for the amount needed to return the shortening to the previous level.  Let r equal the fraction that will be restocked.

+ r= 1	Take our initial equation.

r= 		Subtract from both sides.

r = .5 = 50%		Divide both sides by r equals 50%.


2.  

Let f equal the fraction that the account will charge of the new rate.

115(f) = 100

f ==	Divide both sides by 115.  The fraction is

'''Distance, rate and time problems''' are commonly tested on the GRE.  These problems are a common type of algebra problem encountered on the test, which test setting up equations and working with variables.

=== Rule ===

'''Distance equals rate multiplied by time.'''

'''If there are different rates for different periods of time, distance equals each rate multiplied by each unit of time.'''

For example, if a ship is traveling at 20 nautical miles per hour for 1.1 hours, the ship will travel a total of 22 nautical miles.

=== Practice ===

1.  A train travels 360 miles over the course of 8 hours.  How fast does the train travel?

2.  A car travels at 45 miles per hour.  How long will it take for the car to travel 225 miles?

3.  If a truck travels 175 miles over the course of 3.5 hours, how fast is the truck traveling?


=== Comments ===

A common problem on the GRE is the so-called &quot;brain-lapse mistake&quot;, where the person knows how to solve the problem but merely &quot;spaces&quot; mentally and puts the wrong number in the wrong part of the equation.

Rate and time problems, along with problems involving ratios and percentages are a common source of brian-lapse mistakes and thus test-takers who struggle with this particular problem should make sure to double-check rate and time problems on their GRE.
							 
=== Answers to Practice Questions ===

1.  45 miles per hour

Distance equals rate multiplied by time, thus:

360 = ''r''(8)
:::::Take our initial equation.

45 = ''r''
:::::Divide both sides by 8.

2.  5 hours

Distance equals rate multiplied by time; thus

''t''(45) = 225
:::::Take the initial equation.

''t'' = 5
:::::Divide both sides by 45.

3.  50 miles per hour

Distance equals rate multiplied by time, thus:

''r''(3.5) = 175
:::::Take the initial equation.

''r'' = 50
:::::Divide both sides by 3.5.

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Exponents =

The GRE frequently tests '''exponents''', which are numbers indicating how many times a value has been multiplied into a given system.

=== Rule ===

'''When multiplying exponents, add the exponent numbers; when raising exponents to a power, multiply the exponent numbers.'''

An exponent is a statement of how many times a number has been multiplied into a given system.  25 is equal to 5&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; or 5(5).  Multiplying 5&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; by 5&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; equals 5(5)(5)(5) or 5&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;.  Raising an exponent to a power multiplies the exponent numbers, while multiplying exponents merely adds their numbers.

:''a''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;(''a''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;) = ''a''&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;

:(''b''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; = ''b''&lt;sup&gt;30&lt;/sup&gt;

A negative exponent equals one divided by the number raised to that exponent; a fractional exponent indicates a radical of the corresponding degree.

==== Exponent of &quot;0&quot; is equal to 1 ====

A number with an exponent of “0” equals 1.

	''x''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; = 1

=== Practice ===

1.	What does ''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(''y''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;) equal?

2.  	If (''m''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; = ''m''&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt; what does ''x'' equal?

3. 	If &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt; is equal to ''q''&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; then what does ''q'' equal?


=== Answers to Practice Questions ===

1.  ''y''&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;

When multiplying, add the exponent numbers.

2.  16

When raising exponents to a power, multiply the exponent numbers.

3.  &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt;

Negative exponents indicate 1 divided by the number raised to this exponent.

''q''&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{q^2}&lt;/math&gt; so since ''q''&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;, then ''q''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; must equal 2 and ''q'' must equal &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Scientific Notation ==

In scientific notation, move the number left of the units digit once for each power of 10, or right of the decimal point for each negative power of 10.

1.76642 x 10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; = 1,766,420,000,000,000,000

1.76642 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-18&lt;/sup&gt; = .0000000000000000176642

Scientific notation is a method of expressing very large or very small numbers.  It consists of a single number multiplied by a power of 10.

=== Practice ===

1.  What is 18,221 expressed in scientific notation?

2.  What is 6.5438 x 1011 expressed in conventional notation?

3.  Express .0000652 in scientific notation.
							 
=== Answers to Practice Questions ===

1.  1.8221 x 104

Move the decimal place to the left of the first number, then multiply by a power of 10 for each place you slid it to the right, or by a negative power of 10 for each place you slid it to the left.

2.  654,380,000,000

Slide the decimal place to the right once for each power of ten.  Add a zero if there is no number to slide.

3.  6.52 x 10-5

Move the decimal place to the left of the first number, then multiply by a power of 10 for each place you slid it to the right, or by a negative power of 10 for each place you slid it to the left.

Radicals can be multiplied and divided, and perfect squares can be extracted.


A radical is a number which equals another number if multiplied by itself a given number of times.  The most common type of radical is the square root.  Square roots can be multiplied and divided, as indicated above, but they cannot be added or subtracted.does not necessarily equal , but does equal

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Mean, Median &amp; Mode =

The GRE frequently tests the three different mathematical averages, known as the '''mean''', '''median''', and '''mode.'''

=== Rules ===

'''The “mean” is the sum of all elements divided by the number of elements in the set.'''

'''The “median” is the middle number in a series.  If there are two middle numbers, the median is halfway between them.'''

'''The “mode” is the number that appears the most frequently.'''

“Average” is a term used for various data measures to determine what is “normal” in a series of numbers.  For example, suppose in four quarters of a basketball game, the basketball team scores 14, 15, 14, and 13 points.  The median number of points scored is 14 - the middle number.  The mode is also 14.

As mentioned above, &quot;mean&quot; is calculated by adding all the numbers together and dividing by the number of elements in the set.  For example the numbers 6, 10, and 20, would have a mean value of 12.  (6 + 10 + 20 = 36, divided by 3 = 12)

“Mean” as used on the GRE refers to “arithmetic mean.”  There is also a concept called “geometric mean” which the appropriate root of the product of all the numbers.  It is not tested on the GRE.

=== Practice ===

1.  Four friends each spend money at a shoe store.  Andy spends $145, Becky spends $122, Carla spends $140, and Donald spends $182.  What is the median expenditure on shoes?

2.  H&amp;T Holdings' stock portfolio had a value of $1.1 million in February, $1.5 million in March, and $1.6 million in April.  What was the average (arithmetic mean) value of H&amp;T's stock portfolio over these months?

3.  Erin works 14 overtime hours during week 1, 16 overtime hours during week 2, and 17 overtime hours during weeks 3 and 4.  Which is greater - the median overtime hours Erin worked, or the arithmetic mean of overtime hours that Erin worked?

=== Comments ===

The GRE likes to ask questions which test the nuances of the rules, such as what the median is in an even-numbered set.  The test will also commonly scramble numbers and ask the test taker to pick out the median or mode - in which case sorting the numbers numerically can be useful.

A commonly asked question is what the &quot;mode&quot; is in a series where two numbers both show up an equal number of times.  The answer from a statistical perspective is that both of these numbers are modes (this is known as a multimodular dataset).  However, the answer from a GRE preparation perspective is that this is not tested on the GRE.
					 
=== Answers to Practice Questions ===

1.  $142.50

The median is the middle number, or halfway between two middle numbers.

The numbers are $122, $140, $145, and $182; thus, the median is $142.50 - halfway between $140 and $145.

2.  $1.4 million

Mean is the sum of all values divided by how many values there were.

= $1.4 million

3.  The median is greater.

The median is the middle number, or halfway between two middle numbers.  The three numbers in this case are 14, 16, and 17; thus, the median is 16.

Mean is the sum of all values divided by how many values there were.  The mean in this case is thus:

An equation can be altered in any manner so long both sides are equally affected.

An equation is a statement that two quantities are equal to each other.  Anything can be done to an equation so long as it is done to both sides.

x = 2y			It is true that x is equal to 2 times y.

100x = 200y		Multiplying both sides by 100 yields another true statement.

x + 50 = 2y + 50	Adding 50 to both sides also yields another true statement.

If there is a variable on both sides of an equation, consolidate it on one side.

3x - 12 = x + 2

  - 2	   -2 		Subtract 2 from both sides

3x - 14 = x

   -x	  -x		Subtract x from both sides

2x - 14 = 0

  + 14    + 14		Add 14 to both sides

2x = 14

 ÷ 2      ÷ 2		Divide both sides by 2

x = 7

In an inequality (such as x &lt; y), the same rules of equations apply, except that when multiplying both sides of an inequality by a negative number, the inequality sign must be flipped around.  For example, if a &gt; b, then -a  &lt; -b.

=== Practice ===

Solve for the variable in the following equations.

1. 6x - 4 = 1 + x

2.  2a =
3. 3h - 17 = h + 4	




=== Answers to Practice Questions ===

1.  x = 1

6x - 4 = 1 + x		Take the initial equation.

6x = 5 + x		Add 4 to both sides.

5x = 5			Subtract x from both sides.

x = 1			Divide both sides by 5.

2.  a =

2a = 		Take the initial equation.

2a2 = 16		Multiply both sides by a.

a2 = 8			Divide both sides by 2.

a ==	Take the square root of both sides.

3.  h = 10.5

3h - 17 = h + 4	Take the initial equation.

3h = h + 21		Add 17 to both sides.

2h = 21		Subtract h from both sides.

h = 10.5		Divide both sides by 2.

About a third of GRE math questions involve &quot;algebra&quot; - the process of substituting a letter for an unknown value and manipulating statements to solve a problem.  One of the most important components of using algebra is knowing how to &quot;set up&quot; the initial equation; that is, to express the statement in terms of variables and mathematical operations.

=== Rule ===

'''Solve for unknown elements by substituting a letter for an unknown variable and adjusting the equation accordingly.'''

For example, suppose a cheetah can run 4 miles per hour faster than twice a giraffe's top speed.  If the giraffe's top speed is 20 miles per hour, how fast can the cheetah run?

Let ''c'' equal the cheetah's top speed and ''g'' equal the giraffe's top speed.

''c'' = 2''g'' + 4
:::::Take the initial equation.
		
''c'' = 2(20) + 4
:::::Substitute the known value for g.

''c'' = 40 +4
:::::Multiply out the parentheses.

''c'' = 44
:::::Add the numbers.  ''c'' is 44.

=== Practice ===

Set up and solve the following word problems.

1.  One slice of cake has 150 more calories than two slices of pie.  If one slice of pie has 80 calories, how many calories does a slice of cake have?

2.  Gary has worked at the auto shop 5 years longer than Pat, who has worked there 3 years less than Lindsay.  If Lindsay has worked at the shop for 6 years, how many years has Gary worked there?

3.  Jennifer has twice as many dachshunds as she has yorkies, and she has three fewer yorkies than poodles.  If Jennifer has 8 dachshunds, how many poodles does she have?
			

=== Comments ===

Most (but not all) questions which involve a story or sentences will need to be set up as algebraic equations.  These so-called &quot;word problems&quot; are very common on the GRE.  Typically the mathematical operations themselves are not hard; rather, the test tends to trip up test takers on setting the problem up the right way.

=== Answers to Practice Questions ===

1.  310

Let ''c equal the calories in a slice of cake and p equal the number of calories in one slice of pie.


''c'' = 2''p'' + 150
:::::Take the initial equation.

''c'' = 2(80) + 150
:::::Substitute a known value for ''p''.

''c'' = 160 + 150
:::::Work out the parentheses.

''c'' = 310
:::::Add the values.  A slice of cake has 310 calories.

2.  8 years

Let ''g'' equal the number of years Gary has worked, ''p'' equal the number of years Pat has worked, and ''l'' equal the number of years Lindsay has worked.


''p'' = ''l'' - 3
:::::Take one of the initial equations.

''p'' = (6) - 3
:::::Substitute the known value for ''l''.

''p'' = 3
:::::Subtract the values.  Pat has worked for 3 years.

''g'' = ''p'' + 5
:::::Take the other initial equation.

''g'' = (3) + 5
:::::Substitute the known value for ''p''.

''g'' = 8
:::::Add the values.  Gary has worked for 8 years.


3.  7

Let ''d'' equal the number of Jennifer's dachshunds, ''y'' equal the number of Jennifer's yorkies, and ''p'' equal the number of Jennifer's poodles.


2''y'' = ''d''
:::::Take the initial equation.  ''d'' is twice ''y''.

2''y'' = 8
:::::Substitute the known value for ''d''.

''y'' = 4
:::::Divide both sides by 4.  Jennifer has 4 yorkies.

''p'' = ''y'' + 3
:::::Take the other initial equation.

''p'' = (4) + 3
:::::Substitute the known value for ''y''.

''p'' = 7
:::::Add the values.  Jennifer has 7 poodles.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Systems of Equations ==

Two equations with two variables can be solved by adjusting one equation so that one variable is expressed in terms of another, and substituting this value into the other equation.

In 3x + 3y = 15, x and y could conceivably have many values, from 1 and 4 to 7 and -2, and so on.  Both variables can not be determined using this equation.  However, if a second equation is added, it is possible.

3x + 3y = 15	These two are known as a “system of equations.”

x - y = 1	To solve, begin with the second equation.

x = y + 1	Phrase the second equation in terms of one variable.
	In this case, this is done by adding y to both sides.

3(y +1) + 3y = 15	Substitute this value into the other equation.

3y + 3 + 3y = 15	Expand the parentheses.

6y + 3 = 15	Combine the variables.

6y = 12	Subtract 3 from both sides.

y = 2	Divide both sides by 6.  y is 2 (making x 3).

=== Practice ===

1.  5a - 3b = 21

:2a + b = 15

If a and b satisfy the system of equations above, what is the value of a + b?

2.  2f - g = 2

     2g + 2f  = 20

If f and g satisfy the system of equations above, what is the value of f?

3.  q + 4r = 21

     2r - q = 9

If q and r satisfy the system of equations above, what are the values of both q and r?


=== Answers to Practice Questions ===

1.  9

5a - 3b = 21

2a + b = 15	Take the second equation.

b = 15 - 2a	Convert this equation to express one variable in terms 	of 	the other.  In this case, subtract 2a from both sides.

5a - 3(15 - 2a) = 21	Substitute this value into the first equation.

5a - 45 + 6a = 21	Expand the parentheses.

11a - 45 = 21	Consolidate the variables.

11a = 66	Add 45 to both sides.

a = 6	Divide both sides by 11.  a is 6, b is 3, and a + b = 9


2.  4

2g + 2f  = 20	Take the second equation.

2g = 20 - 2f	Convert this equation to express one variable in terms 	of 	the other.  In this case, subtract 2f from both sides.

g = 10 - f	Divide both sides by 2.

2f - (10 - f)	Substitute this value into the first equation.

2f - 10 + f= 2	Expand the parentheses.

3f - 10 = 2	Consolidate the variables.

3f = 12	Add 10 to both sides.

f = 4	Divide both sides by 3.  f is 4.


3.  5, 1

2r - q = 9	Take the second equation.

-q = 9 - 2r	Convert this equation to express one variable in terms 	of 	the other.  In this case, subtract 2r from both sides.

q = 2r - 9	Multiply both sides by -2

(2r - 9) + 4r = 21	Substitute this value into the first equation.

2r - 9 + 4r = 21	Expand the parentheses.

6r - 9 = 21	Combine the variables.

6r = 30	Add 9 to both sides.  r is 5; q 1.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Averaging with Variables ==

If an average consists of a word problem, place the known values and variables into the average formula accordingly.

In some cases, the proportions can be calculated even if the exact amounts are not known.  Suppose the average trips to the grocery store per month is 5 in Scranton but 7 in Dunmore.  If the combined average of the two places is 5.5, what is the proportion of their populations?  If the populations were equal, the average would be 6 - Scranton must have a greater population.

	

			Let s and d equal the populations of Scranton and 					Dunmore, respectively.

 5s + 7d  = 5.5	(s + d)		Multiply both sides by (s + d).

 5s + 7d  = 5.5	s + 5.5d	Expand the parentheses.

5s + 1.5d = 5.5s		Subtract 5.5d from both sides.

1.5d = .5s			Subtract 5.5s from both sides.

3d = s				Divide both sides by .5.

Thus, 3d = s; in other words, Scranton has 3 times the population of Dunmore.

Practice

1.  Debbie sold an average of 44 fur coats per month at her fur coat store in 2011.  If Debbie's fur coat sales in November and December were three times as high as in the rest of the months, how many fur coats did she sell, on average, in November and December?

2. The average lifespan of the flamingos on Island A is 15 years while the average lifespan of flamingos on Island B 17 years.  The combined average lifespan on the islands is 15.8 years.  If 1,000 flamingos live on Island B, how many flamingos live on Island A?

3. The average height of the 12 office buildings in New Hartford is 32 feet.  If the Union Bank building is excluded, the average height of the office buildings is 29 feet.  How tall is the Union Bank building?
			


 Answers to Practice Questions 

1.  33

Let s equal Debbie's average fur coat sales in November and December and r equal her average fur coat sales for the other 10 months.

= 44		Take the initial equation.

= 44		Substitute the known value for s in terms of r.

= 44		Expand the parentheses.

= 44			Consolidate the variables.

= 528			Multiply both sides by 12.

  r = 33				Divide both sides by 16. The average sales per month 				in the 10 months outside of November and December 				is 33.

Since the regular rate is 33, the average rate for November and December is 99 - three times this amount.

		

  Answers to Practice Questions

2.  1500

Let a equal the flamingo population on island a.

= 15.8			Take the initial equation.

1,000(17) + a(15) = 15.8(1,000 + a)		Multiply both sides by (1,000 + a).

17,000 + 15a = 15,800 + 15.8a		Expand the parentheses.

1200 + 15a = 15.8a				Subtract 15,800 from both sides.

1200 = .8a					Subtract 15a from both sides.

1500 = a					Divide both sides by .8.  The flamingo 						population is 1500 on Island A.

 Answers to Practice Questions 

3. 65 feet

Let u equal the height of the union bank building.

= 32		Take the initial equation.

11(29) + u = 384		Multiply both sides by 12.

319 + u = 384			Work out the parentheses.

u = 65				Subtract 319 from both sides.  The building is 65 feet 				tall.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Quadratic Equations =

A '''quadratic equation''' is an equation such as ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; - 3''x'' = 2, where ''x'' is multiplied by both itself and a constant.

=== Rule ===

'''To solve an equation such as “''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 2''x''  = -1”, adjust the equation so that a zero is on one side, then break the equation into factors such as (x + 1)(x + 1) = 0.  The correct answer is the opposite of the numbers in the parentheses.'''

''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; - 3''x'' = -3
:::::Start with the initial equation.

''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; -3''x'' + 3 = 0
:::::Add 3 to both sides to set the equation equal to zero.

(''x'' + ?)(''x'' + ?) = 0
:::::Break the equation into two “roots” or “factors.”

(''x'' - 3)(''x'' - 1) = 0
:::::Find the two numbers which add up to the second number (the -3) and  multiply to the third number (the 3).  These 	 		will be the numbers in the parentheses, that multiply to ''x'' in the original equation.

''x'' = 3, 1

Most quadratic equations have two answers because they have different numbers in each factor.  Some, however, like (x + 1)(x + 1), only have one answer.

==== Difference of Two Squares ====

''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; - ''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; factors out to (x - y)(x + y).  This is known as the rule of “difference of two squares.”

Thus, ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; - 9 would thus factor out to (''x'' - 3)(''x'' + 3).  This is a special rule that is often tested on the GRE.

==== Factoring ====

“Factoring” is one of the most difficult parts of solving a quadratic equation.  x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 6x + 9 = 0 will factor into (x + 3)(x + 3), because if multiplied out, (x + 3)(x + 3) equals the prior equation.  The numbers in the parentheses will add up to second number in the equation  x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 6x + 9 = 0 and multiply up to the third number.  Observe more examples:	

Original equation	Set it equal to zero	  Factor		Solution

x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 4 = -4x		x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 4x + 4 = 0		(x + 2)(x + 2)		x = -2

x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; -4x = -3		x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; - 4x + 3 = 0		(x - 3)(x - 1)		x = 3, 1

x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; - 1 = x		x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; - x - 2 = 0		(x - 2)(x + 1)		x = 2, -1
						
						(find two numbers
						that add to the middle
						number and multiply to
						the third number)

=== Practice ===

1.  If ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 5 = -6''x'', then what is the value of x?

2.  ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; - 2''x'' = 8.  Solve for ''x''.

3.  If ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 4''x'' + 2 = -1, then what does ''x'' equal?

=== Answers to Practice Questions ===

1.  -5, -1

x2 + 5 = -6x		Take the initial equation.

x2 + 6x + 5 = 0		Add 6x to both sides to set the equation equal to zero.
			Make sure that the equation is in the form x2 + bx + c = 0.

(x + ?)(x + ?)		Break the equation into factors.  What two numbers add up to 			the middle number (6) and multiply to the last number (5)?

(x + 5)(x + 1) = 0	Plug the correct numbers into the equation.

x = -5, -1		x is the opposite of these numbers.



2.  4, -2

x2 - 2x = 8		Take the initial equation.

x -2x - 8 = 0		Subtract 8 from both sides to set the equation equal to zero.
			Make sure that the equation is in the form x2 + bx + c = 0.

(x + ?)(x + ?)		Break the equation into factors.  What two numbers add 				up to the middle number (-2) and multiply to the last 				number (-8)?

(x - 4)(x + 2) = 0	Plug the correct numbers into the equation.

x = 4, -2		x is the opposite of these numbers.



3.  -3, -1

x2 + 4x + 2 = -1	Take the initial equation.

x2 + 4x + 3 = 0	Add 1 to both sides to set the equation equal to zero.
			Make sure that the equation is in the form x2 + bx + c = 0.

(x + ?)(x + ?)		Break the equation into factors.  What two numbers add up to 			the middle number (4) and multiply to the last number (3)?

(x + 3)(x + 1) = 0	Plug the correct numbers into the equation.

x = -3, -1		x is the opposite of these numbers.

Some quadratic equations cannot be factored and must be solved using a special formula, the “quadratic formula.”  This formula is not tested on the GRE.

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Probabilities =

The GRE frequently tests '''probability''', which is the odds of a particular condition occurring.

=== Rules ===

'''The probability of an event happening MORE THAN ONCE is equal to:'''

:'''(odds the 1st time)(odds the second 2nd)(etc.)'''

'''The probability of an event happening AT LEAST ONCE over many tries is:'''

'''1 - (odds of failure the first time)(odds of failure the second time)(etc.)'''

Probability is the likelihood of an event occurring.  It is generally calculated as the number of desired outcomes desired by the total number of outcomes.  Probability is sometimes expressed as a fraction, or as a decimal.  When expressed as a decimal, a probability of “1” equals 100% chance, while a probability of .5 equals a 1 in 2 chance.

For example, when rolling a 6-sided die with faces numbered 1 to 6, the probability of rolling a 6 is 1 in 6, or 1.6666 repeating.  (Assuming that the die is not imbalanced).

For the odds of rolling two 6s in a row on a 6-sided die, the formula is (odds the first time)(odds the second time).

The odds of rolling a six at least once over 2 tries on a 6-sided die.  The formula is 1 - (combined odds of failure).

=== Practice ===

1.  Brian is sending out job applications to law firms.  His odds of being hired at Firm A are 1 in 3; his odds at Firm B are 1 in 5, and his odds at Firm C are 1 in 7.  What are the odds that Brian is hired by at least one of the law firms?

2.  Melanie is shooting baskets at the gym.  She has a 1 in 3 chance of making a three-point shot.  What are the odds of Melanie making 2 shots in a row?

3.  Darren has a 90% chance of being late for class each day.  What are the odds that he shows up on time three times in a row?

=== Comments ===

The distinction between the odds of something happening &quot;every time&quot; versus &quot;at least once&quot; is sometimes known as &quot;straight&quot; versus &quot;cumulative&quot; probability.

Probability can be one of the most complex areas of mathematics; however, GRE probability is usually relatively simple.  The questions the GRE asks with regard to probability can almost always be solved with the above equations.

=== Answers to Practice Questions ===

1.  57 out of 105

Since this is the odds of something happening at least once over multiple tries, the formula is 1 - (odds of failure the first time)(odds of failure the second time)(etc.).

The odds of success for Brian's applications are &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{3}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{5}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{7}&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus, the odds of failure for Brian's applications are &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{2}{3}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{4}{5}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{6}{7}&lt;/math&gt;. 

Brian's odds of being hired by at lest one of the firms are thus (1 - odds of failure), which works out to (1 - &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{2}{3}&lt;/math&gt;(&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{4}{5}&lt;/math&gt;)(&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{6}{7}&lt;/math&gt;) or &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{57}{105}&lt;/math&gt;


2.  1 out of 9

Since this is the odds of something happening more than once in a row, the formula is (odds the first time)(odds the second time)(etc.).  The odds are: &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{3}&lt;/math&gt;(&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{3}&lt;/math&gt;)

= &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{9}&lt;/math&gt;

3.  1 in 1000

Since this is the odds of something happening more than once in a row, the formula is (odds the first time)(odds the second time)(etc.).  The odds are: &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{10}&lt;/math&gt;(&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{10}&lt;/math&gt;)(&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{10}&lt;/math&gt;)

= &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{1000}&lt;/math&gt;

== Arrangements ==
A '''permutation''' is an arrangement where the order is important. In this case, the number of possible arrangements of elements is 
(possibilities for spot 1)(possibilities for spot 2)... This can be represented by a formula as follows:

&lt;math&gt;P(n,k)={\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}}&lt;/math&gt;.

* &lt;math&gt;P(n,k)&lt;/math&gt; is notation expressing a number of permutations of ''n'' items, taking ''k'' items at a time.
* &lt;math&gt;x!&lt;/math&gt;, read as 'x factorial', signifies the product of all the natural numbers from 1 to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. For example, 10! = 1(2)(3)(4)(5)(6)(7)(8)(9)(10).

A '''combination''' is an arrangement where the order does ''not'' matter. The combination formula is the same as the permutation formula, except everything is divided by &lt;math&gt;k!&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. the number of spots factorial:

&lt;math&gt;C(n,k)={\frac{n!}{(n-k)!k!}}&lt;/math&gt;.

Suppose Kathryn is packing tie-dye shirts to take on vacation, and will pick 3 out of her 27 tie-dye shirts to take with her.  How many assortments of shirts can she bring?  Order is not important in this question - selecting shirt 3, shirt 5, and shirt 7 is the same as picking shirt 7, shirt 3, and shirt 5.  Thus the number is:

&lt;math&gt;C(n,k)=C(27,3)={\frac{27!}{24!3!}}={\frac{27!}{6(24!)}}={\frac{27 \cdot 26 \cdot 25}{6}}=2,925&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, there are 2,925 possible shirt arrangements.

If order was important above - suppose Kathryn was picking a specific shirt for the first, second, and third days - the formula would not be divided by 3!.  It would simply be (spot 1)(spot 2)(spot 3), or (27)(26)(25), and would yield 17,550 possibilities.

Note that the number of possibilities descends (27, 26, 25) because the shirts can't be reused.  If Kathryn was picking tie-dye shirts to wear on the next three Mondays, and had an opportunity to wash and reuse the same one, the formula would be 
(27)(27)(27). 

=== Practice ===

1.  A pizza parlor has 8 different toppings available.  How many different pizzas with 3 toppings can be made?

2.  Lee has 4 different colors of paint to use on his model airplane.  He will paint the body one color, the tail rudder a different color, and the nose a different color yet.  How many different ways could Lee paint his airplane?

3.  A soup recipe calls for any 3 of a list of 6 herbs.  How many different groups of 3 herbs can be put in the soup?


=== Answers to Practice Questions ===

1.  56

On any arrangement question, ask two questions - is order important, and, can the elements be reused?

Order is not important - pepperoni, sausage and olives is the same as olives, sausage and pepperoni.  The elements can not be reused - a pizza can't have sausage, sausage, and sausage as its toppings.  It either has sausage or it doesn't.  Thus, the formula is:

== 56

2.  64

Order is important - a red nose and a blue rudder is different than a blue nose and a red rudder.  The colors can be reused - each of four is available.  The formula is thus:

4(4)(4) = 64

3.  A soup recipe calls for any 3 of a list of 6 herbs.  How many different groups of 3 herbs can be put in the soup?

Order is not important - thyme, parsley, and oregano is the same as oregano, parsley, and thyme in the soup.  The elements cannot be reused - the soup must have 3 of the 6 herbs.  The formula is thus:

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Digits of Numbers ==

If a question gives you the relationship between the various digits of a number, substitute variables for these digits and put the appropriate power of 10 in front of each one.

For example, the test might ask, “in a number, the hundreds digit is 2 greater than the tens digit, which is 2 greater than the units digit.  If the number is equal to 195 multiplied by the units digit, what is the number?'

* Let ''u'' equal the units digit, ''t'' the tens, ''h'' the hundreds, and ''x'' the number.
* Restate the givens in terms of ''u, t, h,'' and ''x.''
** ''t'' = ''u'' + 2
** ''h'' = ''t'' + 2 = ''u'' + 4
** ''x'' = 195''u''
** ''x'' = 100''h'' + 10''t'' + ''u''
* Find the value of ''u''.
** 195''u'' = ''x'' = 100''h'' + 10''t'' + ''u''
** 194''u'' = 100''h'' + 10''t''
** 194''u'' = 100(''u'' + 4) + 10(''u'' + 2)
** 194''u'' = 100''u'' + 10''u'' + 420 = 110''u'' + 420
** 84''u'' = 420
** ''u'' = 420/84 = 5
* Now you can find the values of the other numbers:
** ''t'' = 5 + 2 = 7
** ''h'' = 5 + 4 = 9
* Check your work:
** 975 = 195 * 5


	
=== Practice ===

1.  The tens digit of a 3-digit number is twice the units digit and one less than the hundreds digit.  If the number is equal to two less than 136 times the tens digit, what is the number?

2.  If the digits of a 2-digit number are reversed, the resulting number is 45 greater than the original number.  If the initial 2-digit number is less than 20, then what is its value?
					 


=== Answers to Practice Questions ===

1.  542

Let t equal the tens digit.

100(t + 1) + 10t + t/2 = 136t - 2
:Take the original equation.

100t + 100 + 10t + t/2 = 136t - 2
:Expand the parentheses.

110.5t + 100 = 136t - 2
:Combine variables and constants.

100 = 25.5t - 2
:Subtract from both sides.
		
102 = 25.5t 
:Add 2 to both sides.

4 = t
:Divide both sides by 25.5
:t is equal to 4, and the number is thus equal to 542.

2.  16

Let t equal the tens digit and u equal the units digit.

10u + t - (10t + u) = 45		Take the equation.

10u + t - 10t - u = 45			Expand the parentheses.

9u - 9t = 45				Combine the variables.

u - t = 5				Divide both sides by 9.

u is 5 greater than t; thus, u and t could be 1 and 6, 2 and 7, 3 and 8, 4 and 9.  However, since the initial value is less than 20, the digits must be 1 and 6, which make 16 and 64.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Lines &amp; Angles ==

Opposite angles are equal.  Adjacent angles on a line add up to 180º.

*Angles n and p are equal.
*Angles q and o are equal.
*Angles n and o add up to 180º.
*Angles o and p add up to 180º.
*Angles p and q add up to 180º.
*Angles q and n add up to 180º.

A line intersecting two parallel lines forms the same angles with each.

Parallel lines are those which are a constant distance apart.  A line intersecting them is known as a “transversal.”

Assume both sets of lines are  parallel; therefore:

*  Angles f and g are equal.
*  Angles h and i add up to 180º.
*  Angles f and h are equal.
*  Angles g and i add up to 180º.

=== Practice ===

1.  In this figure, both pairs of lines are parallel, and w is 10º greater than u.  What are the measures of angles t, u, v and w?	


=== Answers to Practice Questions ===

1.  t, u, v, and w have measures of 95º, 95º, 85º, and 95º, respectively.

Because lines make the same angles through any parallel lines they intersect, angle w is identical to angle v as well as the angle directly opposite t.  Because opposite angles are equal, angles t and w are equal.

All three of these angles are equal to either of the angles adjacent to angle u along the line (either the line running from t to u or from v to u); thus u + v = 180º.  Since w = u + 10º, we can solve for u.

u + v = 180º			Take the initial equation.

u + (u + 10º) = 180º		Substitute for v in terms of u.

2u + 10º = 180º		Add the variables.

2u = 170º			Subtract 10º from both sides.

u = 85º				Divide both sides by 2.  u is 85º, making the other 					three angles 95º.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Triangles ==

The angles of a triangle add up to 180º.



In this triangle, c is equal to 60 because the angles of a triangle add up to 180º.






The greater the angle in a triangle, the greater the corresponding side.




Angle f is greater than angle g but less than angle h, because the corresponding sides are larger and smaller, respectively.


		The Four Types of Triangles

=== Practice ===

1.  









If FG is equal to GH but less than FH, then the measure of angle FGH must at least be greater than how many degrees?

2.








If i is 8 degrees greater than k and 4 degrees greater than j, what is the measure of i?

3.










If LM and MN both have lengths of 10, and angle LMN has a measure of 80º, what are the measures of the other two angles of the triangle, MLN and LNM?
				
					 

=== Answers to Practice Questions ===

1.  The angle measure must be greater than 60º.

The angles of a triangle add up to 180º.  The greater the length of a side of a triangle, the greater its opposite angle.

If FH is greater than the other two sides, its angle measure must be greater.  If all three angles were equal, they would equal 60º (180º divided by 3), but since this side is greater, its opposing angle must be greater than 60º, while the other two must be less than 60º.

2.  64º

The angles of a triangle add up to 180º.  Thus, i + j + k = 180.

i + j + k = 180.		Take the initial equation.

i + (i - 4) + (i - 8) = 180	Substitute the known values of the other two variables 				in terms of i.

i + i -4 + i - 8 = 180		Expand the parentheses.

3i - 12 = 180			Consolidate the constants and variables.

3i = 192			Add 12 to both sides.

i = 64				Divide both sides by 3.  i is equal to 64.

3.  50º

Since LM and MN have identical lengths, the angles opposite these sides have identical lengths.  The angles of a triangle add up to 180º; thus, since the third angle is equal to 80º, the other two angles must have a combined measure of 100º.  Since they are equal, the measure of each is 50º.

In a right triangle with sides a, b and c, a2 + b2 = c2, c being the longest side.


In this triangle, a2 + b2 = c2 and thus:

a =

b = 

c =



There are a limited number of “Pythagorean Triples” or groups of integers which fit the formula.

The GRE tends to have questions which work out to integers; thus, keep an eye out for the “3-4-5” triangle and the “5-12-13” triangle.



		The 3-4-5 Triangle

		The squares of 3 and 4 add up to the square of 5, 		thus, the “3-4-5” triangle is common on the GRE.  		It may also be in the form of a “6-8-10” triangle or 		a “9-12-15” triangle, or another triangle similarly 				increased.


The 5-12-13 Triangle

In a similar manner the 3-4-5 triangle, this triangle has a series of integers which comport with the Pythagorean Theorem.  This triple may also be increased to 10-24-26 and so on.

There are two special right triangles, the proportions of which can be inferred by their angle measurements.

A 45º-45º-90º triangle has sides in the ratio of 1 - 1 -



Thus if the shorter sides are 10, the longer side is 





A 30º-60º-90º triangle has sides in the ratio of 1 -- 2.


Thus if the shortest side has a length of 5, the two other sides have lengths ofand 10.





Indeed, the proportions of every right triangle can be determined by the measurement of one of its angles based on this theorem.  Mathematicians and engineers have developed tables of the proportions for these angles and have designated functions for them, such as sin and cos.  This field of mathematics is known as “trigonometry” and is not tested on the GRE.

The area of a triangle equals half of the base multiplied by the height.

In a right triangle, the base and the height will be the two smallest sides.


The area of this triangle equals (6)(8) divided by 2, or 24, because in a right triangle the base and the height are the two smaller sides



Otherwise, however, the height of the triangle will have to be known or deduced.

The height of an isosceles triangle can be deduced using the Pythagorean Theorem.









		Take the original triangle.		Split the base in half.
							The height will be perpendicular.

Under the Pythagorean Theorem:

		The larger side squared equals the sum of the other sides squared.

		Expand the exponents.

		Subtract 25 from both sides.

		Take the square root of both sides.  The triangle has a height of 12 			and thus an  area of 30.

The area of a rectangle equals length multiplied by width.




	Area = 450





Rectangle questions usually involve algebra and a quadratic equation.

For example, if the length of a rectangle is twice its width, and the rectangle's area is 98, what is the width of the rectangle?

Let w equal width and l equal length.

w(l) = 98	Set up the formula.

w(2w) = 98	Substitute 2l for 

&lt;math&gt;2w^2  = 98&lt;/math&gt;	Expand the parentheses.

&lt;math&gt;w^2 = 49&lt;/math&gt;	Divide both sides by 2.

w = 7		Take the square root of both sides.

The width of the rectangle is 7 (and the length is 14).

=== Practice ===

1.  A rectangle has an area of 132 and its length is 1 greater than its width.  What are the dimensions of the rectangle?

2.  A rectangle's area would increase by 90 if its length were extended by 18.  What is the rectangle's width?

					
===  Answers to Practice Questions ===

1.  11 and 12

The formula for a rectangle's area is length multiplied by width.  Thus, this problem can be solved with algebra and factoring.  Let l equal the length and w equal the width.

&lt;math&gt;l(w) = 132&lt;/math&gt;		Take the initial equation.

&lt;math&gt;(w + 1)(w) = 132&lt;/math&gt;		Substitute the length in terms of the width.

&lt;math&gt;w^2 + w = 132&lt;/math&gt;			Expand the parentheses.

&lt;math&gt;w^2 + w - 132 = 0&lt;/math&gt;		Subtract 132 from both sides.

&lt;math&gt;(w + ?)(w + ?) = 0&lt;/math&gt;		Break the expression into factors.
				What two numbers multiply to -132 and add to 1?

&lt;math&gt;(w + 12)(w - 11) = 0&lt;/math&gt;		Factor the equation.  w equals 11 or -12.
				Since the width is not negative, it equals 11.

Using the width, the length can be easily determined by adding 1.

2.  5

Since area of a rectangle is length multiplied by width, the width equals the amount of extension increase - 90 - divided by the increase in length, which is 18.  The width is thus 5.</text>

=== Comments ===

=== Answers to Practice Questions ===

1.  4

The area of a trapezoid equals the average of its bases multiplied by its height.  Since the height of this trapezoid is 4, the average of its bases must equal 22 divided by 4, or 5.5.  At this point, the top side can be determine by solving the equation= 5.5, which works out to 4.

2.  192

This trapezoid can be split into a right triangle with sides of 20 and 16, the latter determined by subtracting 8 from 24.  This means that the height of the trapezoid is the third side of the right triangle, which equals or 12.  12 multiplied by the average of the bases - 16 - equals 192.

The area of a rhombus or parallelogram is base multiplied by height.

The area of a rhombus is the product of its diagonals, which are perpendicular.


	In this figure, the area is 8(6) or 	48.








	The area of the figure to the left 	is 10(12) or 120.






In a rhombus or parallelogram, opposite angles are equal, and adjacent angles add up to 180º.

2.  A rhombus has a perimeter of of 60 and a diagonal of 18.  What is its area?
							 
=== Comments ===

=== Answers to Practice Questions ===

1.  8.5

The area of a rhombus is equal to the product of its diagonals.  Since this rhombus has an area of 85 and a diagonal of 10, the second diagonal is equal toor 8.5.


2.  432

The diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular, and its four sides are equal.  Thus, a rhombus with a perimeter of 60 has sides of 15; if this rhombus has a diagonal of 18, it can be broken into right triangles.  The third side of these triangles is equal to or 12.  Thus, the diagonal is equal to 24 and thus its area is 432.

=== Rules ===

The diagonals of a kite are perpendicular, and its area is the product of these diagonals.


A kite has two pairs of adjacent equal sides.

Its diagonals form right angles, which, if multiplied, yield the area of the kite.  Because the diagonals are perpendicular, the perimeter of a kite can be determined using the 					       Pythagorean Theorem.


=== Practice ===


1.  In figure JKLM, sides JK and KL are equal, and sides LM and MJ are equal.  The distance from K to M is twice the distance from J to L.  If the area of JKLM is 50, what is the distance from K to M?







2.  The lengths of both NO and NQ are 52, while the lengths of both OP and PQ are 25.  If the distance from O to Q is 40,  what is the distance from N  to P?

=== Answers to Practice Questions ===

1.  10

The area of a kite equals the product of its diagonals.  Since the area of this kite is 50 and one diagonal is half the length of the other, the lengths can be determined using algebra.  Let d equal the smaller diagonal.

d(2d) = 50		Take the initial equation.

2d2 = 50		Expand the parentheses.

d2 = 25			Divide both sides by 2.

d = 5			Take the square root of both sides.  The smaller diagonal 			is equal to 5, making the larger one 10.

2.  63

The kite can be split into four different right triangles.  The missing sides when combined form the unknown diagonal, which pursuant to the Pythagorean Theorem can be calculated as +, or 48 + 15, which equals 63.</text>

=== Rules ===

The area of a circle is π multiplied by the radius squared.  The circumference of a circle is π multiplied by the diameter (twice the radius).

A circle is a set of points of equal distance from a given point.  The number π has been developed by mathematicians to express the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter.
π ≈ 3.14.

An arc within a circle is equal to the fraction of the circumference that the arc's angle is a fraction of 360º, or the entire circle.

In the circle to the left, arc AB has a length of one fourth of the circumference of the circle

A polygon's angles add up to 180º plus an additional 180º for every side over 3.


The angles of a pentagon add up to 540º.


The angles of a enneakaidecagon add up to 
3060º.


(An enneakaidecagon is a figure with 19 sides).  Polygons other than triangles and quadrilaterals are rare on the GRE; when they do appear, they are typically shapes which employ a combination of triangles and quadrilaterals.

=== Practice ===

1.  In the figure to the left, angles a, d, h, and e are each equal to half of the measures of each of angles b, c, g, and f.  What is the measure of angle a?


2.  How many degrees do the angles of a 102-sided figure add up to?

3.  The angles of a particular polygon add up to 2340º.  How many sides does the polygon have?


=== Comments ===

=== Answers to Practice Questions ===

1.  90º

The angles of an octagon add up to 1080º.  Since a, d, h, and e are equal and are each half of the b, c, g, or f, then it can be inferred that 4(a) + 4(2a) = 1080º.  This means that 12a = 1080º and that a  is equal to 90º.

2.  18,000º

A polygon has 180º plus an additional 180º for every side over 3.  Thus, the angles of a 102-sided figure equal (102-2)180º or 18,000º.

3.  15

A polygon has 180º plus an additional 180º for every side over 3.  Thus, the question can be solved using algebra.  Let n equal the number of sides of the polygon.

(n -2)180º = 2340º		Take the initial equation.

180ºn - 360º = 2340º		Expand the parentheses.

180ºn = 2700º			Add 360º to both sides.

n = 15				Divide both sides by 180º.

				The polygon has 15 sides.

=== Rules ===

The volume of a non-tapering 3-dimensional object is the area of the base multiplied by the height.

Irregular objects and those which “taper” - or are not the same from the bottom to the top - are typically not tested on the GRE.  However, for block-shaped objects, the formula is simply length(width)(height).  However, there are two key tapering objects which do have simple formulas and could be tested - cones, and spheres.

The volume of a cone is one third of the area of the base multiplied by the height.

The area of the base will utilize the same formula for a circle.







The volume of a sphere is &lt;math&gt;\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3&lt;/math&gt;. 
A “sphere” is a round three-dimensional object, such as a ball or a globe.

=== Practice ===

1.  A cereal box (left) has a volume of 225.  If the dimensions of the face of the cereal box are 18 and 5, what is the depth of the cereal box?

2.  A cylinder (right) has a diameter of 22 and a height of 45.  What is the volume of the cylinder?



3.  A soccer ball has a diameter 
of 12.  A tennis ball has a diameter of 2.  The volume 
of the tennis ball is what percentage of the volume 
of the soccer ball?

=== Answers to Practice Questions ===

1.  2.5

The volume of a block-shaped object is equal to length(width)(height).  The length and width are known to be 18 and 5, and the volume is 225.  Thus, 18(5)(width) = 225.  The depth equals 225 divided by 18(5) or 2.5.

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Coordinates &amp; Graphing =

=== Rules ===

In a standard coordinate plane, points are given locations of (x, y), where “x” is the horizontal coordinate and y is the vertical coordinate.

The x coordinate is also called the “abscissa”, while the y coordinate is called the “ordinate.”

The slope of a line graphed on the coordinate plane is equal to rise divided by run.  If a line is expressed by an equation, the slope of the line is the number in front of the x when the equation is in the form y = ax + b.

For example, if the equation for a line is y = 2x + 1, the slope is 2 and the y intercept is 1.  If the line is in the form y - +2x = 1, rearrange it so that it is in the above format - y = mx + b.

To determine when a line crosses the x or y axis, set x or y equal to zero.

For example, a line with the equation y = 6x - 5 crosses the y axis at (0, -5).

=== Practice ===

1.  The equation for a line is 2y - 4x - 5 = 0.  What is the slope of the line?

2.  What is the slope of a line which passes through points (3, -2) and (6,3)?

=== Comments ===


What is the equation for the line above?

=== Answers to Practice Questions ===

1.  2

When a line is in the form y = mx + b, m is the slope of the line and b is the y intercept.  If a line is not in this format, it should be converted into this format.

2y - 4x - 5 = 0		Take the initial equation.

2y - 4x = 5		Add 5 to both sides.

2y = 4x + 5		Add 4x to both sides.

y = 2x +		Divide both sides by 2.  The slope of the line is 2.

2.  

The slope of this line is rise over run, or 
This equals or 

3.  y = 3x + 1

When a line is in the form y = mx + b, m is the slope of the line and b is the y intercept.

The line crosses the y axis at (0,1) and thus its intercept is 1.  It passes through the point (1,4) after passing through (0,1) meaning it has a rise of 3 for every unit of run.  Thus, the slope of the line is 3 and its equation is y = 3x + 1.

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Standard Deviation =

Standard deviation measures how much a given set of numbers varies.  It does not in any way reflect the average value of data or the quantity of the elements.

Thus, the numbers 1, 700, 62,000 and 1,000,000 would have a greater standard deviation than the numbers, 4, 5, 6, and 7.

The GRE does not test the formula for standard deviation nor does it expect test takers to remember “normal” distribution.  It does, however, expect test takers to understand the concept.  The test will frequently ask trick questions hoping that test takers will confuse standard deviation with mean or median value or range, such as those below for you to practice on.

=== Practice ===

1.  Data Set 1 has a range of 1-100.  Data Set 2 has a range of 200-500.  Is it possible to determine which set has a greater standard deviation?

2.  

The chart above shows a normal distribution for hours spent watching television per week in Springfield, with a mean of 8 and a standard deviation of 6.  What percentage of the population of Springfield watches fewer than 2 hours of television per week?

3.  

	Series I					Series II

	5, 6, 6, 7, 8, 10				1, 2, 3, 7, 15, 24

Which series has a greater standard deviation?

=== Comments ===

=== Answers to Practice Questions ===

1.  No, the difference in standard deviation cannot be determined

Standard deviation is a tool to measure how varied the results are from a given mean.  It has nothing to do with the value of the numbers or the quantity of numbers in the set, except to the extent that these influence average distance from the mean.

2.  16%

Since the mean is 8 and the standard deviation is 6, 84% of the data sample will fall above 8-2, pursuant to the chart.  The cutoff is represented by the “m - d” on the chart.

3.  Set I has a greater standard deviation.

Standard deviation measures how close or far apart a set of numbers are from the mean.  Set I is clearly more clustered together than Set II, thus, it will have a greater standard deviation.

Again, the GRE does not expect test takers to know the standard deviation formula but it expects them to understand the concept.

A bar chart uses vertical bars to compare quantities, which are measured using a vertical axis.

For example, the chart below compares computer repair calls from three office buildings over periods of three months.  Every bar graph has a “ruler” or scale on the left or right-hand side (usually the left).  Typically the questions involve identifying values from within the chart and manipulating them.


=== Practice ===

1.  Approximately how many more repair calls were made to 230 Park Place in 2009  than at 1215 Main Street?

2.  By approximately how much did repairs increase at 16 General Pershing Street increase from the first quarter to the second quarter?

=== Comments ===

=== Answers to Practice Questions ===

1.  About 55

230 Park Place has just over 20 repair calls in the first quarter and between 15 and 20 in the second and third quarters, and just under 15 in the fourth quarter.  This yields a total of 70.  1215 Main Street has about 5 in both of the first two quarters and just under 5 for the last two, giving it a total of about 15.

2.  About 5

In the first quarter, the repairs at 16 General Pershing are just over 10, while in the second quarter, they are between 15 and 20.  This is an increase of about 5.</text>

“Pie charts” indicate fractions of a total.  The larger the “slice” the greater the fraction.

The chart below, for example, shows the fraction of flights taken to Buffalo as opposed to Syracuse, Albany, and New York City. 





Chart-reading is usually fairly easy.  Most question trip-ups involve manipulating the data in the chart.

=== Practice ===

1.  Approximately what percentage of the flights taken by LJ Air are bound for Albany, Buffalo, and Syracuse, respectively?

2.  How many more flights would have to be taken to New York City for such flights to make up 60% of the total flights?

=== Comments ===

=== Answers to Practice Questions ===

1.  Albany, Buffalo, and Syracuse, respectively, make up roughly 27%, 13%, and 11% of flight departures.  The numbers above in the chart are not percentages but rather absolute numbers.  There are a total of 93 flights, meaning the percentages are the flights to these three cities - 25, 12, and 10 - respectively.

2.  There are a total of 93 flights of which 46 are currently bound for New York City.  The amount of increase necessary to raise this proportion to 60% can be solved using algebra.  Let i equal the necessary increase to raise it to 60%.

= .6			Take the initial equation.

  i + 46 = .6(i + 93)		Multiply both sides by (i + 93).

  i + 46 = .6i + 55.8		Expand the parentheses.

  i = .6i + 9.8			Subtract 46 from both sides.

.4i = 9.8			Subtract .6i from both sides.

  i = 24.5			Divide both sides by .4.
				Approximately 25 flights are needed to increase 				the percentage to 60%.

1.  Which cities have the greatest and least number of car washes per capita?

2.  Dallas makes up what percentage of the car washes and laundromats amongst the five cities?
		
=== Comments ===					 

=== Answers to Practice Questions ===

1.  Per capita is calculated by the number of items divided by the number of people.  It can thus be calculated and compared by dividing columns 3 and 4 by column 2 (or a reduced version of it).  Plano by far has the highest number of car washes per person, while Dallas has the lowest.    Irving has the highest number of laundromats per capita, while Dallas again has the lowest.

2.  Dallas has 84 of the 238 car washes, or about 35%, and it has 90 of the 254 car washes, again, about 35%.

=== Description ===

Scatterplot and bubble charts display individual data as points on a field for the purpose of comparing them.  

“Bubble” charts use bubbles that get larger as the quantity gets bigger, while scatterplots typically do not.  These chart types are rare on the GRE but are worth mentioning.

Scatterplot charts indicate how elements of a sample are distributed based on the measurement notches on either side.  To isolate elements within a particular range on a scatterplot chart, follow the appropriate measuring notch.

=== Answers to Practice Questions ===

1.  Based on the chart, fax machines have the greatest profit margin.  The y axis depicts profit margin, and shows fax machines closest to the top.  Note that the x axis doesn't mean anything.

2.  The bubbles correspond to percentage of sales; thus, printers appear to be sold the most, followed by fax machines.  Scanners and copiers are sold less, in roughly equal portions.

Determine what the word in the sentence is doing, and then define the words in the blanks to see which matches.

7.  The development of colored dyes would ultimately _____ to the benefit of the middle class artisans who became _____ at using them and _____ their very utility.

(A) inure 	(D) adept 	 (G) exploiting
(B) tirade  	(E) instilled	 (H) traversing
(C) engulf 	(F) aggrandized 	 (I) corroborating

For example, the first blank above is describing what the dyes did with regard to the middle class.  The correct answer is “inure”, which means to go towards something.  The second blank is describing the artisans' disposition toward using the dyes.  In this case, the correct answer is “adept”, meaning skill.  Finally, the third word is describing what the artisans did with regard to the utility of the dyes.  The correct word is “exploiting”, which means using or utilizing something.

As can be seen, sentence completion comes down to knowing what the words mean.  The following pages contain a series of “quiz lists” to practice the vocabulary words from the previous pages.

      <text xml:space="preserve">There is no secret, trick, or formula to GRE reading passages other than to read them steadily and carefully, and to practice reading them.

Read word-by-word, sentence by sentence, understanding each concept and connecting it to the others.

Reading questions will typically ask for the meaning or purpose of a word or phrase, or of the passage itself.  They may also ask to apply a concept discussed in the passage, or what must be true based on the passage.  Sometimes questions will have three choices with more than one potential correct answer - this will be clearly indicated.
 
	  Economists frequently elaborate upon 	the imbalance that occurs when two 	previously isolated markets are suddenly 	connected, allowing a new flow of goods 
5	or services from a market in which they 	were in greater abundance, to one in which 	they are less plentiful - to the disruption of 	current economic activities there.  Perhaps 	nothing from history more explicitly
10	illustrates this concept than the trans-	Saharan gold trade initiated by the 	Kingdom of Mali under Mansa Musa.
	  Trade across the vast desert had 	occurred since ancient times, as 
15	documented in chronicles of caravans in 	the Nile Valley.  However, Musa's 	expansion of trade routes to the 	Mediterranean coastline and ultimately 	the Middle East and Europe were an 
20	unprecedented achievement in global 	trade for their time, and their impact on 	previously insular economies cannot be 	understated.  The inflow of gold from 	Africa's “Gold Coast” was particularly 
25	tumultuous in economies such as that of 	Egypt, where gold was a standard unit of 	currency.  The new trade expansion may 	have paved the way for further 	developments in commerce between 
30	distant parts of the world which 	ultimately manifested in the voyages of 	Da Gamma and Columbus.
Look for the “hard words” such as subjects and verbs in passages such as the one to the left.

Be ready to refer back to particular lines of the passage

The GRE frequently points to a concept by its particular line; thus, keep track of these lines.

Practice

Read the passage to the left and try answering the following questions.

1.  Based on the passage, what is the relationship between the Kingdom of Mali and Mansa Musa, and the economic concept discussed in lines 1-7?

2.  Describe the effect that gold trade had on places such as Egypt, based on the passage.

3.  Why does the author of the passage mention Da Gamma and Columbus (line 32)?
	 
 Answers to Practice Questions 

1.  The author mentions Mali and Mansa Musa as an example of the concept stated in the first sentence.  “Mali” is a place in Africa which was a kingdom many years ago.  Mansa Musa was a king of Mali.  The GRE will frequently mention things of this sort and not explain what they are, expecting the reader to infer or guess at its passage topics.
  The concept mentioned is that sometimes two economies are linked, and sometimes a good is more plentiful in one than the other.  This means that the economies may be disrupted.  The author explains that this is what happened when gold from Mali was traded across the Sahara to Egypt and other locations.

2.  According to the author, the influx of gold from Mali and the “Gold Coast” upset the economy in Egypt particularly severely because gold was used as a unit of currency.  With a new oversupply of gold, the economy was disrupted.

3.  Da Gamma and Columbus were explorers.  (Da Gamma was the first European to sail to India).  The author mentions them because the author thinks it is possible that the trans-Saharan trade under Mansa Musa inspired future developments in trade, and may have led to merchants and rulers commissioning Da Gamma and Columbus and their voyages.</text>

Make sure to completely understand the scope and extent of the author's main points in the passage.

The GRE will have “trap answers” which try to “suggest things” to you.  Often they will mention things that were in the passage, but not in the manner mentioned.

In the real world, passages typically set out their topics at the beginning.  On the GRE, however, the real subject of the passage is often confusing to find, as evidenced here:

&lt;pre&gt;
	  The armadillo is the only extant
 	member of order Cingulata surviving to
 	date, and exists throughout the Americas
 	in the form of various subspecies.  Little 
5	known is the fact that an ancient cousin
 	to the armadillo, the glyptodon, also
 	inhabited the armadillo's current range
 	until very recently, dying out at the end
 	of the most recent ice age.  Like its 
10	modern relative, glyptodon was a
 	placental mammal with a thick armored
 	shell, and was probably capable of
 	tucking into a ball or something similar
 	to protect itself.  However, unlike 
15	armadillos, which are typically about the
 	size of a small dog, glyptodons grew to
 	sizes of perhaps five meters in length,
 	making them one of the largest land
 	animals known to coexist with humans.
20	  There has thus been widespread 
	speculation as to whether the indigenous
 	peoples of the Americas hunted the
 	glyptodon, much of which has been met
 	with skepticism given the creature's size 
25	and presumable power.  However,
 	ancient humans are known to have
 	hunted other highly dangerous creatures
 	such as the woolly mammoth, which were
 	arguably even more dangerous with 
30	their great tusks, as well as the fact that
 	mammoths were social creatures
 	tending to roam in packs and protect one
 	another.
&lt;/pre&gt;

Practice

1.  The author discusses the armadillo in lines 1-4 primarily in order to&lt;br&gt;
(A) explain why the armadillos survived the last ice age while glyptodons did not&lt;br&gt;
(B) cite an example of another animal which was hunted by early humans&lt;br&gt;
(C) elaborate on characteristics unique to placental mammals&lt;br&gt;
(D) give an example of the nearest modern relative of a creature it is about to discuss&lt;br&gt;
(E) point to another instance of a social animal which roams in packs

2.  Which one of the following best describes the author's attitude toward the notion that ancient humans might have hunted the glyptodon?&lt;br&gt;
(A) skepticism given the creature's size and great power&lt;br&gt;
(B) receptiveness given the fact that ancient humans hunted the even more powerful and social woolly mammoth&lt;br&gt;
(C) dismissal on the grounds that the wooly mammoth would've been superior as a food supply&lt;br&gt;
(D) uncertainty due to lack of evidence that the glyptodon roamed in packs&lt;br&gt;
(E) acceptance based on the current documented evidence&lt;br&gt;


 Answers to Practice Questions 

1.  (D)

This passage is about the glyptodon, which is a giant armadillo-like creature, which died out in prehistoric times.  The first paragraph describes the glyptodon, while the second discusses the theory that ancient humans may have eaten them.   The discussion of armadillos serves to introduce the glyptodon by describing the nearest modern relative of the creature, as occurs in answer (D).

The other answers are typical reading passage trap answers.  Choice (A) is incorrect because, while the ice ages are mentioned as well as the glyptodon's extinction at the end of them, this is not the topic the author seeks to explore in the passage.  The author is merely mentioning that there was such a creature as the glyptodon and that early humans may have hunted them.  Similarly, choice (B) is incorrect because, while the author is talking about hunting, the author never talks about humans hunting armadillos.  Rather, in the second paragraph, the author is contemplating whether humans ever hunted the glyptodon.

Answer (C) is incorrect; although “placental mammals” are mentioned, the author never explains what this term means or what else is included in this category.  Finally, (E) is incorrect - while the author discusses “social animals”, the author discusses this in the context of woolly mammoths and not the armadillo.


2.  (B)

The author thinks it is plausible that ancient humans hunted the glyptodon, the main reason for believing this being that humans hunted powerful and dangerous creatures like the woolly mammoth.

Choice (A) is a trap answer - while the author mentions “skepticism”, this is not the author's skepticism, but rather, that of other individuals.  Answer (C) is similarly incorrect because, while glyptodons are compared to woolly mammoths, this is not to illustrate differences in their availability as a food supply, but rather to say that if humans hunted one, they probably hunted the other.  (D) is incorrect because there is no lack of evidence - the author doesn't discuss sufficiency of the evidence.  Finally, (E) is wrong because it is too strong - the author doesn't “accept” the hunting of glyptodons but rather feels it is merely plausible.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Language Shifts =

GRE reading passages often contain &quot;language shifts&quot;, where the topic of the passage meanders or deviates.  The ability to clearly follow a reading passage is an important skilling in scoring well on the test.

=== Overview ===

Normally writers are taught to write with a clear thesis backed up by supporting sentences.  For example:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The grey wolf population was mostly eradicated in the United States in the 19th and 20th centuries.  Since wolves were a nuisance to settlers and their livestock, they were targeted by these groups and as a result were exterminated in most of the U.S..  Though its range once extended all the way to Mexico, today the wolf is only found in a few isolated northern regions of the United States.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, the GRE will typically ''not'' do this.  Rather, the GRE tends to have passages with meandering topics, probably because clear readable passages would be too easy for test takers.  Compare the prior passage with this one:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The United States was initially populated by many agrarian settlers with livestock.  These settlers dealt with many problems in the new nation, one of them being wildlife on the frontier.  Efforts were made to exterminate a common nuisance to the settlers - the grey wolf - and as a result, this creature is mostly extinct, save a few isolated northern regions of its former range, which once stretched all the way to Mexico.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While both passages say essentially the same thing, the first one clearly states its thesis and follows up with sentences clearly reinforcing or elaborating upon this thesis.  The second begins with a sentence about settlers that does not mention wolves at all, and it is only after two sentences that the grey wolf is even mentioned.  Furthermore, the third sentence mentions the grey wolf in a hyphen clause voice (the grammatical subject of the sentence is &quot;efforts&quot;). Yet both passages nonetheless are about the grey wolf population in the United States.

These wolf passages exemplify the common &quot;language shift&quot; seen on the GRE - that a passage will often be about something very different from what its initial sentence would lead a reader to think.

=== Signal Words ===

Pay attention to words like &quot;but&quot; and &quot;however.&quot;  Often a language shift will be denoted by one of these signal words.  Consider the following passage:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Traditional economics has focused on the importance of the law of supply and demand - the notion that the value of a commodity is inversely proportional to its availability.  The principle of supply and demand has long been a cornerstone of economics, though even it has some limitations.  For example, the increased availability of a good might spark increased consumer knowledge of a product that they otherwise did not know existed, and prove to generate further demand.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This passage essentially makes the statement that sometimes, increased supply can actually increase demand.  For example, if Bart gets a new iPad and shows all his friends - all of whom didn't know that iPads existed - this might generate more iPad demand  Notice how the passage &quot;smuggles&quot; this concept in, shifting language with the word &quot;though.&quot;  The first two sentences seem to be leading up to the idea that supply and demand is a universal, infallible rule of economics, and in fact, the passage is stating something to the contrary.

=== Practice ===

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The famous “Code of Hammurabi” is one of the oldest legal codes discovered by archaeologists, its earliest known version inscribed into an ancient stone found in modern-day Iraq.  The code is frequently referenced as an ancient publication of laws to govern the people of Mesopotamia, a signof the early civilization developing in the region.  Naturally, one would think the laws were inscribed in stone for the public to view them and understand them.  The prevalent academic view, however, is that the stone containing Hammurabi's code, however, probably was not intended as a dissemination of laws to the general public or a publication of the rules of civilization.  Few people could read in the early days of Mesopotamia, and written codes would 	only have been useful to scribes; thus, a public display could do little to inform the public.  Scholars rather espouse that the code was in fact much more likely to have been made as a tribute to the 	king and the current ruling dynasty of Babylon and Mesopotamia, given its 
written nature and presence in stonework.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

1.  According to the author, why was the Code of Hammurabi most likely chiseled into stone?


2.  What reasons does the author give for believing that the Code of Hammurabi wasn't publicly displayed to inform the public of the laws of ancient Mesopotamia?


=== Comments ===

The GRE frequently uses very &quot;soft language&quot;, that is to say, language which conveys a point in a very subtle manner.  Compare the sentence:


:Bridget shut the door.


::with


:The door was quickly pulled shut with a slam, and Bridget managed to catch a glimpse out the window just as she was closing it.


Both of these sentences convey the information that Bridget shut the door.  However, in the second sentence, the three operative words necessary to derive this information, that is &quot;Bridget&quot; (the noun), &quot;closing&quot; (the transitive verb), and &quot;door&quot; (the direct object of the verb) are so very far flung across the sentence that it makes it more difficult to derive this inference.

The GRE commonly employs language like this, which is why it is important for test takers to pay attention to the so-called &quot;hard words&quot; (subjects, verbs, and object nouns).
 
=== Answers to Practice Questions ===

1.  The author believes that the Code of Hammurabi was probably made as a public tribute to the king.  The passage begins as a discussion of the code and its historical significance, and explains that “[n]aturally” (line 9) one would think it wade made to inform people of the laws.  The code, “however”(line 13) was probably not intended in this fashion.


2.  As stated in the previous answer, the author doesn't believe the stone containing Hammurabi's code of laws was intended to inform the public, but rather, as a tribute to the king.  The author's rationale for this is that few people could read at the time of Hammurabi; thus, it would have done little good towards informing the public.

This is a good example of a passage with shifting language, which begins as a mere discussion of a topic but later “smuggles in” the author's opinions and viewpoints on the matter.</text>

Pay close attention to what facts can be deduced based on the information in the passage, and understand the meaning of each term and concept.

Reading passages on the GRE will typically introduce and explain concepts quickly, and go on to discuss them assuming you have a full understanding of what they are.  Make sure to understand each item's meaning.  

	  “Telegraph” is typically used to describe 	communication using electrical signals 	relayed through wires, such as in the 	system promulgated by Samuel Morse in 
5	the early 1800s.  In fact, the terms 	“telegraph” and “telegraphy” refer to any 	communication over long distance, such as 	through modern-day telephones or internet 	communications.  Likewise, “telegraph” 
10	refers to predecessors of electrical 	communication, including the once used 	semaphore line.
	  A semaphore line is a system of relaying 	communications over long distances.  Also 
15	known as a “Chappe Telegraph”, the 	system is entirely mechanical and relies on 	no electricity or electronics.  Rather, the 	relay is accomplished by a series of towers 	with flags or mechanical arms that could be 
20	arranged in a particular way so as to 	convey a message, which would be passed 	on to the next tower which similarly 	arranged itself in this fashion.  First widely 	used in Europe in the late 1700s, such 
25	means of communication were instrumental 	in the coalition war against Napoleon in 	Iberia during the early 19th century and 	remained useful in Europe until replaced 	by electrical telegraphs.  Though perhaps a 
30	primitive means compared to modern 	technology, the achievements of semaphore 	lines were unprecedented for their time and 	contemporaneous technology.
Practice

1.  What is a semaphore line?  How does it work and what does it do?

2.  The author mentions the wars against Napoleon primarily to

(A) give an example of successful use of semaphore lines
(B) demonstrate the difficulties of communicating over long distances in years past
(C) show how semaphore lines could communicate in multiply languages
(D) illustrate the problems with predecessors of the semaphore line
(E) explain why semaphore lines would've been more widely used without political disharmony

3.  According to the passage, what was the main cause of the decline of the semaphore line?

(A) the end of the coalition wars in Europe
(B) the lack of widespread electricity to power the system
(C) the introduction of a more efficient means of communication
(D) the rise of telegraphy in the developed world
(E) the introduction of the Chappe Telegraph

==Answers to Practice Questions==

1.  A semaphore line is a series of towers with mechanical arms which convey messages over long distances by flagging the arms in a certain fashion.  According to the passage, they were widely used in Europe before the introduction of the electrical telegraph.

2.  (A)

At this point in the passage, the author is explaining how semaphore lines worked and how they were used.  The coalition war in Iberia is given as an example of the successful use of the semaphore line.  The remaining answers are typical GRE “trap” responses.  Answer (B) is incorrect because, while this might be an underlying subject of the passage generally, the use of semaphore lines in the coalition is given as an example of the successful use of semaphore lines, not of the difficulty of using them.  Choice (C) is similarly incorrect because languages and translations are not mentioned at all.

Answer (D) is incorrect because the predecessors of the semaphore line are not discussed in detail in the passage, and the passage does not make any comparisons between them and the semaphore line.  Choice (E) is similarly outside the scope of the passage - while a war is mentioned, nothing in the passage states that this war had any effect on the use of semaphore lines.  If anything, it provided an opportunity for them to be used.

3.  (C)

This comes straight from lines 28-29.  Often the correct answer to a reading question will be correct but stated in a vague form such as this, and stand amidst four incorrect “trap” answers.  Choice (A) is incorrect because, while the coalition wars are mentioned as an instance of the use of the semaphore line, their end is not cited as the cause of semaphore lines' decline.  Similarly, (B) is incorrect because semaphore lines do not require electricity - electrical telegraphs do.  (D) is incorrect because “telegraphy” according to the author means any form of long-distance communication, and thus there was no “rise” of telegraphy after the semaphore - the semaphore was a telegraph.  Finally, (E) is a trap answer - a “Chappe Telegraph” is just another name for a semaphore line according to the passage.

This passage is a good example of a strange word that it is important to understand and define subconsciously while reading a passage.

      <text xml:space="preserve">On the GRE, some questions will ask “in which sentence does the author ...” and state a vague summary of the function of the sentence.

Practice identifying the roles of particular sentences.

Folklore in ancient civilizations often served to explain facts of the world as well as merely to entertain.  The creation of these stories has persisted into modern
 
5	times - Americans once told stories of a 	great lumberjack, Paul Bunyan, who felled 	the trees of the great plains, and created the 	“Badlands” of South Dakota by tapping his 	axe during a nap.  In Origins of the 

10	Cyclops Myth, Matthew Williams argues 	that the ancient Greeks in fact did believe 	in or at least prepond the existence of one-	eyed giants - cyclopses - in the 	Mediterranean.  According to Williams, 

15	Greeks likely encountered elephant skulls 	and skeletons in their voyages, and the 	idea 	of a single-eyed creature came from the 	presence of the larger aperture in the face of 	the skull.

==Questions==

#  In which sentence does the author given an example of modern folklore?  What is this example?
#  In which sentence does the author present a reason why the Greeks may have believed in the actual existence of the cyclops?  What is this reason?


==Answers to Practice Questions ==

#  This example occurs in the second sentence.  The example is Paul Bunyan, who the author discusses to give an instance of contemporary folklore as well as its use to explain something - the great plains and the badlands.
#  This occurs in the last sentence.  After the author articulates a theory found in what is apparently a scholarly work, the author explains that Greeks believed that there were one-eyed giants because they found elephant skulls on their voyages which had large single holes (“apertures”) in them.  They believed, according to this theory, that these were the skulls of one-eyed giants.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The GRE will ask questions about the meaning of words in context.

These will often be words with secondary meanings.  Be sure to practice identifying the meaning of words in context.

	  Narrative of the Life of Frederick 	Douglass, an American Slave, published 	in 1845, was an autobiographical work 	which garnered a great deal of attention 
5	and popularity during the abolitionist 	movement in the United States.  However, 	since the abolition of slavery in the United 	States, the utility of the book has arguably 	commuted from that of promoting a 
10	particular policy agenda to one of mere 	history and entertainment for its readers.  	In this light, several aspects of the book 	which served its original purpose are 	inhibitive to these new purposes.  For 
15	example, the book does not describe how 	Frederick Douglass escapes from slavery.  	At the time it was written, this was for 	obvious reasons - so as not to give away a 	secret.  However, in contemporary 
20	context, this arouses great curiosity in 	readers, who inevitably turn to Douglass' 	second autobiographical work, Life and 	Times of Frederick Douglass, published in 	1881 after the realization of Douglass' 
25	goals of the first book.
Practice

1.  As used in the passage, “commuted” (line 9) most nearly means

(A) declined
(B) shifted
(C) appeared
(D) manifested
(E) elucidated

2.  As used in the passage, “inhibitive” (line 14) most nearly means

(A) conducive
(B) pejorative
(C) ambiguous
(D) detrimental
(E) counterintuitive

3.  As used in the passage, “realization” (line 24) most nearly means

(A) learning
(B) receipt
(C) promotion
(D) expostulation
(E) accomplishment


3.05  Words in Context

  Answers to Practice Questions

1.  (B)

This is an example of an atypical use of a word being tested on the GRE.  “Commuted” means moved or changed.  Usually in the 21st century it is used to refer to traveling for work purposes.  In this context, however, it refers to a change.

“Declined” means having taken a downward turn or having decreased, while “appeared” means having come into view or presented itself.  “Manifested” also means having presented itself or come to fruition, and “elucidated” means having been explained or made clear.

2.  (D)

“Inhibitive” means tending to stop or slow something.  The passage is explaining how many of the old features of Douglass' book, which was written to inspire the abolitionist movement, are now detrimental to the story; for instance, readers don't know how he escapes.

“Conducive” means tending to accomplish a particular result, while “pejorative” means derogatory or tending to evoke negative feelings about a subject.    “Ambiguous” means prone to more than one meaning, and “counterintuitive” means tending to go against one's instinctive feelings on a matter.

3.  (E)

This is another good example of a common secondary meaning of a word.  As used here, “realization” means the fulfillment or accomplishment of a goal.  “Realize” normally means acquiring knowledge of something; however, in this context it refers to accomplishment.

“Learning” means acquiring knowledge, while “receipt” refers to the act of taking something after being given or delivered the thing.  “Promotion” means to place something in a better position than before, while “expostulation” refers to stating something to be true or arguing for this to be the case.

Practice identifying them and picking them out.

	  Though commonly thought of as a theory 	on the origins of life, biological evolution 	in fact does not address this topic, but 	rather, the diversity of life.  The concept of 
5	the origins of life is called “abiogenesis” 	and was the question addressed by the 	famous Miller and Urey experiment.  In 	1952, the two namesakes of this 	experiment built a machine which applied 
10	heat and electrical sparks to water and a 	plethora of gases to determine whether 	amino acids, a fundamental component of 	life on Earth, could form from these 	chemicals.  The experiment produced over 
15	twenty amino acids, but, while frequently 	cited as a milestone in the research of 	abiogenesis, the experiment is just as 	heavily disapproved by many for its 	inaccuracies.  These criticisms are 
20	heavily misplaced.
	  Critics frequently point out that the gases 	used in the Miller and Urey experiment 	were probably quite different from those 	which made up the Earth's atmosphere 
25	billions of years ago, and therefore, the 	experiment is inaccurate and its 	informative nature is limited.  The point of 	the experiment, however, was never to 	attempt to simulate actual abiogenesis.  
30	Miller and Urey were concerned with the 	question of whether or not amino acids 	could arise from gases, water, heat, and 	electricity, and in their research, they 	proved  just what they set out to 
35	determined.
1.  What was the “Miller and Urey” experiment and what did it seek to accomplish?

2.  How did the Miller and Urey experiment proceed?  What was done in the experiment?

2.  According to the passage, what is a common criticism of the Miller and Urey experiment, and how does the author feel with regard to this criticism?


3.06  Buried Conclusions

 Answers to Practice Questions 

1.  The Miller and Urey experiment sought to see whether amino acids - a basic component of life - could be produced from naturally occurring gases through application of heat and electricity.  The experiment was a success, and produced over twenty such amino acids.

2.  The Miller and Urey experiment ran a group of different gases (“plethora”) through a machine which applied heat and electrical sparks to these gases as well as water.

2.  The passage explains that the Miller and Urey experiment is commonly criticized because the gases used in it were probably quite different from the early atmosphere on Earth.  However, the author claims that this is not a valid criticism.  As the author explains, the purpose of the experiment wasn't to simulate how life arose on Earth.  Rather, the purpose was to determine whether it was possible for amino acids to form naturally under certain circumstances.  The experiment showed this, and thus was a success.</text>

The GRE contains many passages which are commentaries or analyses of arts or literature.  Pay attention to theories about the subject discussed.

	  Liber de Coquina is one of the oldest 	known cookbooks, dating back to 	approximately the 13th century, but even 	at its age, the mysteries surrounding the 
5	book are a curiosity.  The book seems to 	have been written by two authors, one 	French and one Italian, but neither the 	authors' names nor the date of publication 	are clear.  While this may seem expected 
10	for a book of its age, Apicius' De re 	coquinaria from approximately 500 as 	well as Viandier by Guillaume Tirel each 	contained its authors name.  The 	anonymity of the work has led some to 
15	believe that the authors had reason to 	conceal their identity, perhaps because the 	authors were female.  It was considered 	improper for women to appear in public 	fields during the Middle Ages; even at the 
20	time of Shakespeare, female roles in plays 	were usually played by men.  Yet culinary 	trades were known to be common amongst 	women in the Middle Ages.
1.  What is Liber de Coquina and how does it compare to similar things of its kind?

2.  What does the author think may be the case about the authors of Liber de Coquina?

3.  What reasons does the author state for this conclusion?


3.07  Art &amp; Literature Passages

  Answers to Practice Questions

1.  Liber de Coquina is a very old cookbook and is distinct from other very old cookbooks in that it is written by two anonymous authors.

2.  The author thinks that the authors of the book may have been female.

3.  The author's reasons for potential female authorship of Liber de Coquina are both the nature of medieval society - where it was shameful for women to have public professions - as well as the fact that culinary duties were often the prerogative of women in many contexts during the era.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">GRE passages are often about complicated social science topics.

	  Linguists are uncertain as to why 	languages change and modify the way they 	do - changes perhaps attributable to mere 	idiosyncratic factors.  Whatever the case, 
5	the diversity of languages occasioned by 	geographic dispersal is all too apparent, 	such as with the Latin-based languages of 	Italian, Spanish, French, and Portuguese - 	all of which trace their roots, at least in 
10	part, to a uniform common ancestor.  	Curious, however, is the fact that 	Portuguese - geographically the furthest of 	any of the Romance languages from Rome 	- bears the closest resemblance to Latin, 	the language of the ancient Romans.  The 
15	Portugal example perhaps suggests that it 	is exchange and intermingling which 	change languages, not time or distance 	alone, and that Portugal, isolated in its 	corner of Europe, therefore saw the least of 
20	such mingling.
	  The example of Scandinavian languages 	is certainly consistent with this theory.  	Norwegian, Swedish, and Danish all trace 	their roots to the Old Norse spoken by the 
25	Vikings.  Yet it is Icelandic - the furthest 	tongue from the Scandinavian peninsula - 	which bears the strongest resemblance to 	Old Norse, further supporting the notion 	that intermingling is a primary cause of 
30	linguistic change.
1.  What is strangely true about both Icelandic and Portuguese, based on the passage?

2.  According to the author of the passage, why might it be the case that Portuguese and Icelandic both bear these characteristics discussed?


3.08 Social Science Passages

== Answers to Practice Questions ==

1.  According to the passage, both Icelandic and Portuguese are the closest to their linguistic ancestors - Old Norse and Latin, respectively - despite being furthest from the source of these languages.

2.  This passage discusses the idea that it may be the interpersal and intermingling of people and cultures which produces a change in languages, not distance and time alone.  The author is stating that the reason that Portuguese is most similar to Latin may be the fact that Portugal is more isolated from the rest of the world, while France, Spain, and Italy were much more subject to intermingling with other cultures.  The author thinks it may be this “intermingling” which produces linguistic change, as new words and linguistic devices are exchanged, adopted, and substituted into a language.

The GRE also contains passages with “hard science” concepts, often which are difficult to understand.

	  It was not until the early 20th century 	that the energy convective properties of 	matter were extensively studied, but 	during this era, physicists began to explore 
5	the manner in which particles behaved 	when exposed to light, electricity, or other 	forms of energy.  To their surprise, they 	found that matter tended to convect energy 	at fixed numeric intervals - a minimum 
10	“unit” of measurement which was 	proposed and calculated by German 	physicist Max Planck.  Planck, and 	ultimately the entire scientific community, 	came to except the “quantum theory” - 
15	that energy is exchanged in certain basic 	units which correspond to basic particles 	of matter.
1.  What does “quantum theory” mean?

2.  What is the evidence for “quantum theory”?

=== Comments ===

=== Answers to Practice Questions ===

1.  “Quantum theory” refers to the idea that energy is “quantized” or transmitted in numerical values.  According to quantum theory, there is a basic “unit” or “package” in which energy is transmitted.

2.  As explained in lines 4-9, scientists found that when energy was exposed to matter, it gave off (“convected”) the energy at particular intervals.  This implied that there were numerical “packages” in which the energy was transmitted.

The GRE will also throw in more unusual topics on occasion.

&lt;pre&gt;
	  By the late 1800s, the concept of a
 	“corporation” - a legal entity separate and
 	distinct from its stockholders - was firmly
 	entrenched in Anglo-American law.  
5	However, its use and creation had a
 	remarkably different context.  The first
 	corporations had been royal “charters” of
 	the British Crown, such as the British East
 	India Company or the Hudson's Bay 
10	Company, and were used to exploit
 	exclusive territorial and trading rights
 	secured through English global imperialism.
	This model, while highly effective for
 	managing global trade, was far less
15	applicable in the United States, which for
 	the brunt of the 1800s was focused on
 	pushing westward within its own
 	borders.  Accordingly, the “charter” - 	
	which typically would require a 
20	government enactment - was of little help.
  	Instead, various states, beginning with
 	New Jersey, began a new trend of the
 	“enabling” corporate statute, under which
 	any citizen could create a corporation to 
25	manage private business affairs.  By the
 	20th century, most states of the United
 	States as well as nations worldwide had
 	created some type of “enabling” statute,
 	allowing private individuals to form 
30	corporations to manage their mutual
 	assets.
&lt;/pre&gt;

1.  How did the corporation originate?

2.  How was the corporation as allowed by law in the United States, beginning in New Jersey, different from the original corporation used by the British?

3.  What differences between Britain and the United States prompted this difference and change in the nature of a corporation?


=== Comments ===

=== Answers to Practice Questions ===

1.  According to the passage, corporations originated as royal charters by the British Crown to manage economic affairs in various parts of the world.  This is explained on lines 6-12, which give examples of the Hudson's Bay Company and the British East India Company.

2.  New Jersey's law allowed corporations to be created voluntarily by individuals, as opposed to formed by an act of the government.  It thus differed from traditional English law in this regard.

3.  As explained in lines 13-20, the economic expansion of the United States was primarily domestic, and thus the British model was of little use to Americans, who sought to have business entities to regulate things internally.  Accordingly, the corporation which evolved under American law was one which private individuals could form to manage their affairs, with the permission and protection of the state.</text>

	  “Tiktaalik” is one of the most famous 	ancient fossils ever discovered due to its 	status as a transitional species - a fish 	which also walked on land.  It is perhaps 
5	this great reverence of the creature which 	has led many to ignore its significance 	quite independent of its place in the 	evolutionary record.  The fossil has also 	been greatly illuminative due to its status 
10	as an ancient fish, and thus, its capacity as 	a fossil to speak to the physiology of such 	ancient fish and their differences from 	their 	contemporaries.  Combined with other 	fossils, Tiktaalik forms a piece of 
15	the puzzle in tracking the development of 	modern fishes from their pre-Cambrian 	ancestors.






2.  As used in the passage, “reverence”  (line 5) most nearly means

(A) indifference
(B) exaltation
(C) criticism
(D) proliferation
(E) extinguishment
1.  According to the passage, “tiktaalik” is most commonly referenced or discussed because

(A) it dates back to the pre-Cambrian period
(B) it has many significant physiological differences from other ancient fish
(C) it is the oldest transitional fossil ever found
(D) it is an example of an amphibious fish
(E) it is not the only fossil from its era of a land-walking fish


3.  According to the passage, the author believes which one of the following about tiktaalik?

(A) Prior to its discovery, there were no fossils linking ancient pre-Cambrian fish to modern fish.
(B) Its basic physiology is not substantially different from modern fishes today.
(C) It spent most of its life in the water despite its terrestrial abilities.
(D) It is scientifically valuable due to its status as an ancient fish notwithstanding any capacity to walk on land.
(E) It is inconsistent with many other fossils from the era, spurring the need for more research.


3.11  Reading Practice Passage 1

=== Answers to Practice Questions ===

1.  (D)

This comes from the first sentence in lines 1-4.  Tiktaalik is most famous because it was a fish that could walk on land.

While the pre-Cambrian period of choice (A) is mentioned, it is not mentioned as the era of tiktaalik.  Moreover, there are not “many” physiological differences between tiktaalik and other ancient fish according to the passage - the passage only discusses their similarities.  Choice (C) is incorrect because nothing claims that tiktaalik is the oldest transitional fossil.  (All fossils are arguably transitional fossils)  Choice (E) is similarly not supported because the passage at no point says tiktaalik is the only land-walking fish.

2.  (B)

“Reverence” refers to holding something in high regard, which is also the meaning of “exaltation.”

“Indifference” is the lack of any strong opinion on a given matter, while “criticism” is the expression of negative feelings on a matter - the opposite of reverence.  “Proliferation” refers to the spreading or multiplying of something, while “extinguishment” means the cessation or expiration of something.

3.  (D)

This is arguably the main point of the passage.  This passage is stating that while the fossil tiktaalik is primarily remembered for is amphibious characteristic, it nonetheless stands on its own as an example of a prehistoric fish.

Choice (A) is incorrect because, while the author claims tiktaalik links ancient fish to modern fish, the author doesn't claim that it is the only fossil that does this.  Choice (B) is incorrect because nothing in the passage compares the physiology of tiktaalik to that of modern fish - tiktaalik is only compared to its contemporaries.  Answer (C) is incorrect because nothing in the passage describes how much time tiktaalik spent in the water, and choice (E) is incorrect because there is no such “inconsistency” discussed between tiktaalik and other fossils of the era.

	  Black Elk Speaks chronicles author John 	Neihardt's conversations with a shaman of 	the Oglala Sioux tribe in the early 20th 	century, and is most well known for its 
5	subject's recollection of the Battle of Little 	Bighorn, or as the author calls it, “The 	Rubbing Out of Long Hair” in reference 	to the Sioux name for General Custer.  At 	age 13, Black Elk had participated both in 
10	this battle as well as the subsequent 	altercation at Wounded Knee.  However, a 	focus on the book for these recounts would 	be misplaced, not only because they are told 	some forty years after the events occurred,
15	but also because the majority of the work is 	dedicated not to the Sioux Wars of the 	late 1800s, but to the spiritual and 	cultural traditions that Neihardt sought to 	capture, including the rituals in which the 
20	author of the book participated firsthand.
1.  The author of the passage holds which of the following views about the book Black Elk Speaks?

(A) It contains a reliable contemporary account of the incidents at Little Bighorn and Wounded Knee.
(B) It is the most comprehensive chronicle of Sioux spiritual traditions of any work to date.
(C) References to the book for its chronicles of the Sioux Wars miss a greater point of the book.
(D) It is also known by the title “The Rubbing Out of Long Hair.”
(E) Its author did not have any experience with Sioux culture.

2.  Based on the passage, Neihardt's purpose in writing Black Elk Speaks was to do which of the following?

(A) interview a survivor of Little Bighorn and Wounded Knee
(B) contrast the views of the Oglala Sioux to that of other Indian tribes
(C) describe changes in Sioux life in the early 20th century from their traditional way of living
(D) document aspects of traditional Sioux culture
(E) capture the entire history of the Sioux Wars of the late 1800s


=== Comments ===


=== Answers to Practice Questions ===

1. (C)

This can be inferred from the phrase in lines 11-13, which state that a focus on the accounts of the Sioux conflicts is misplaced.

Choice (A) is incorrect because the author never attests to the reliability of the accounts of Little Bighorn in the book; indeed, the author suggests they may be somewhat compromised given the great stretch of time.  Answer (B) is incorrect because the passage makes no claim that the book is the most reliable account.  Choice (D) is wrong because “The Rubbing Out of Long Hair” refers to Little Bighorn itself, not the book.  (E) is directly contradicted by the passage - the author of Black Elk Speaks interviewed a Sioux shaman.


2.  (D)

This comes from lines 17-20.  Neihardt wasn't predominantly concerned with interviewing survivors of the Sioux Wars as stated in answers (A) and (E) or contrasting the Sioux with others as in answer (B) - indeed, no other Indian tribes are mentioned.  Likewise, nothing explicitly mentions the changes discussed in answer (C).  Neihardt's purpose was to document Sioux culture.

The Cathedral of St. Vincent de Paul 	presents a noteworthy example of a 	mixture between Moorish and Middle-	Eastern architectural styles as well as the 
5	traditional European Gothic style - a 	medley which naturally resulted from the 	history of the structure.  Built in Tunis, the 	capital of Tunisia, in 1897, the cathedral 	harkens back to an era which saw a great 
10	influx of French and Italians into Tunis, as 	the city was at the time a French 	protectorate - thus, its construction drew 	upon the skills and preferences of the 	locals, both French and Italian as well as 
15	Tunisian.  The result is a unique 	construction, featuring the domes and 	arches typical of the Islamic mosque, and 	greeted with palm trees at its front 	entrance, but adorned with crosses, both at 
20	the façade and at its steeple.  Though the 	Roman Catholic population has sharply 	declined in Tunis since Tunisian 	independence, the Archdiocese of Tunis 	still maintains the building and uses it as 
25	the seat of its presence in the city.

1.  According to the passage, which one of the following is true about the Cathedral of St. Vincent de Paul?

(A) When it was built, Tunis was a protectorate of France.
(B) It was the first Roman Catholic cathedral constructed in Tunis.
(C) It has features which are also associated with Islamic mosques.

2.  Which of the following can be inferred about Tunis, based on the passage?

(A) Its Roman Catholic population has decreased since the Cathedral of St. Vincent de Paul was built.
(B) It is the capital of Tunisia.
(C) It has many instances of Gothic and other European architectural styles which harken back to its days as a French protectorate.



=== Comments ===

=== Answers to Practice Questions ===

1.  (A), (C)

Choice (A) can be inferred from lines 10-11, which explain that Tunis was a French protectorate at the time.  Answer (C) can be similarly inferred from lines 15-18, which describe the features of the cathedral.

Answer (B), however, cannot be inferred.  While the passage states that there was a great influx of Roman Catholics to Tunis, it does not state that the cathedral was the first in the region.

2.  (A), (B)

Choice (A) can be inferred from lines 20-23 and their discussion of Tunisian independence.  Lines 7-8 establish choice (B) - that Tunis was the capital of Tunisia.  The third choice, however, cannot be inferred.  The passage doesn't establish that there are many instances of Gothic and other European architectural styles.  Only one is discussed - the cathedral in question.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
While it is often unclear to readers of the novel Flatbush whether the protagonist’s disappointment is more directed at society 	or her own family, the better view is that the latter is an allegory for the former.  The main character, who moves from 	Puerto Rico to Brooklyn with her parents at the age of three, progressively elucidates the life of crime, gangs, dereliction and decay that awaits her two brothers, and to a lesser extent herself, as 	they grow older in the city.  However, 	while the novel clearly propounds better education and nurture as a solution, it is unclear whether the novel is primarily faulting the family unit or civilization as a whole.  Indeed, the curious shift between the father’s alcoholism and the decay and despair on the streets of Brooklyn in the 1970s confounds and polarizes many 	readers as to what, if anything, is the reform message in the book.  However, it seems that there is a quite natural solution that the family in the story is a metaphor for society itself, and the two themes are part and parcel.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

1.  Based on the passage, which of the following is true about the novel ''Flatbush''?

Select &lt;u&gt;all&lt;/u&gt; that apply.

(A) It has been interpreted as faulting both society and the family unit for social problems.

(B) It primarily blames external and non-familial sources for urban decay in Brooklyn in the 1970s.

(C) Its protagonist is a Puerto Rican native growing up in Brooklyn in the 20th century.

2.  Based on the information in the passage, the author of ''Flatbush'' would likely agree with which one of the following statements?

Select &lt;u&gt;all&lt;/u&gt; that apply.

(A) Better education is a viable solution to problems of crime and urban decay.

(B) Social problems cannot be solved only at the family level.

(C) Problems within familial units are not the sole cause of social problems.

3.  As used in the passage, “polarizes” most nearly means

(A) bifurcates

(B) instigates

(C) adjudicates

(D) invigorates

(E) placates

=== Comments ===

GRE humanities passages can often be some of the worst in terms of verbose, unclear language.  Remember to follow language shifts and understand the &quot;hard word&quot; in sentences - that is, subjects, verbs, and verb objects.

It can sometimes help to try and imagine and re-explain what the author is talking about.  For example, this passage is about a novel.  Try and imagine what it would mean for an author to say that the novel is describing &quot;dereliction.&quot;

=== Answers to Practice Questions ===

1.  (A), (C)

Choice (A) can be inferred from lines 20-22, which explains how the book “confounds” readers as to its social message.  Answer (B), however, is incorrect.  The book does not primarily blame external sources.  Based on the passage, the book blames them both equally and uses one as an allegory for the other.

Answer (C) can be inferred - this is stated in lines 6-8.  The mention of the 1970s in line 20 also indicates that the book takes place in the 20th century.

2.  (A), (C)

Both (A) and (C) can be inferred from lines 12-14, however, choice (B) cannot, for the sole reason that choice (B) states primary.  The book doesn't take the position that anything is a primary cause of anything.

3.  (A)

“Bifurcates” means splits in half.  As used in the passage, it is discussing how the book instills different opinions in its readers.  “Instigates” means starts something, usually a conflict, while “adjudicates” means renders judgment on a particular matter, often in the context of a court.  “Invigorates” refers to giving new life to something or encouraging it, while “placates” refers to satisfying or pacifying something.

	  “Cave man” is a term commonly applied 	to neolithic peoples throughout the world.  	The term, however, is a misnomer.  	Contrary to popular belief, early stone 
5	age peoples probably did not live in caves, 	but rather used them for worship and 	religious ceremonies.  The idea of cave 	dwellers stems from the discovery of a 	variety of cave paintings, which were 
10	initially thought to have been decorations 	by inhabitants of the caves.  The 	complexity of these paintings, however, 	suggests that they were done by people 	who devoted their time exclusively to 
15	making cave paintings, and while some 	argue this is indicative of prehistoric 	support for arts and culture, a more 	prevalent view amongst anthropologists is 	that these ancient peoples believed that 
20	their artistic depictions of creatures on the 	walls of caves gave them special powers 	over the creatures, enabling the creatures to 	be hunted and ultimately eaten.

1.  In which sentence does the author express the author's own opinion about the purpose of cave paintings by prehistoric humans?

(A) the first sentence (“'Cave man'...world.”)
(B) the second sentence (“The term...misnomer.”)
(C) the third sentence (“Contrary...ceremonies.”)
(D) the fourth sentence (“The idea...caves.”)
(E) the fifth sentence (“The complexity...eaten.”)

2.  As used in the passage, the term “misnomer” (line 3) most nearly means

(A) euphemism
(B) ambiguity
(C) overgeneralization
(D) inaccuracy
(E) incompletion

3.  Based on the information in the passage, why did ancient peoples most likely depict animals on the walls of caves?

(A) to celebrate successful hunts
(B) to gain mystical powers over the animals which they hunted
(C) to decorate the caves, which they used for ceremonial reasons
(D) to demonstrate the level of skill of their artisans
(E) to document the various types of animals which they hunted


3.15  Reading Practice Passage 5

=== Comments ===

=== Answers to Practice Questions ===

1.  (E)

While the fifth sentence initially discusses a view that the author claims some people hold, this very long sentence ultimately goes on to explain what the author thinks - that prehistoric people thought that depicting the creatures they hunted helped achieve power over these creatures, enhancing their hunting skills.

2.  (D)

A misnomer is a misleading or inaccurate name.  In context, the passage is using it to explain why the term “cave man” is inaccurate since neolithic peoples probably did not live in caves.

“Euphemism” refers to a nicer way of saying something, while “ambiguity” means something which is unclear or open to different interpretations.  “Overgeneralization” is something which too broad and not specific enough to its content.  “Incompletion” refers to something not yet finished.

3.  (B)

As explained in the passage and the first answer, the author is of the opinion that ancient people thought depicting animals gave them powers over the animals they hunted and thus enhanced their hunting skills.  There is no mention in the passage of answer (A)'s successful hunts, and while (C) is mentioned as a viewpoint, it is not the author's viewpoint.  This is also the case with (D) - while the author mentions some might think the paintings were mere decorations, this is not what the author believes.  Choice (E) is similarly incorrect because nothing in the passage discusses the use of the paintings for documentation.

There are three key types of short passage questions on the GRE: 
	
	1.  Weakening or strengthening arguments

	2.  Identifying structures of arguments

	3.  Explaining circumstances

	Weakening or strengthening arguments

  Studies of individuals suffering from schizophrenia have revealed that such patients are typically missing more than half of the normal levels of a glycoprotein known as “reelin” in a region of the brain.  Because this protein is so commonly deficient in persons suffering from schizophrenia, it seems likely that the absence of the protein is a cause or at least a contributing factor to the disorder, and that its supplementation to the individual would be a viable cure for schizophrenia.

Which of the following would most weaken the argument that reelin deficiency contributes to schizophrenia?

(A) The presence of reelin in the brain can be altered by changes in diet and other behavioral modifications.
(B) Reelin deficiency is linked to other disorders such as bipolar personality disorder, the causes of which are thought to be unrelated to schizophrenia.
(C) Medicine prescribed to patients with mental illnesses often has the effect of lowering reelin levels.
(D) Individuals with more severe cases of schizophrenia typically have lower concentrations of reelin in their brains that individuals with milder cases of schizophrenia.
(E) Many individuals with schizophrenia have reelin levels which are perfectly normal for the average human.

An argument can be weakened by attacking its underlying logic - the link between the premise and the conclusion.  This argument asserts that reelin deficiency must cause schizophrenia.  The reason for this conclusion is because reelin is less common in the brains of individuals with schizophrenia.  Answer (C) weakens the argument because it demonstrates that, alternatively, it may be the medicine commonly taken by schizophrenics which reduces the levels of reelin - making the shortage an effect rather than a cause.</text>

=== Overview ===

===== Identifying structures of arguments =====

“Nilo-Saharan” is a proposed language family for a group of dialects concentrated predominantly in Sudan, as well as in many other isolated regions.  '''The languages, however, are not  a “family” - a group of tongues with a common linguistic ancestor - at all.'''  The proposed evidence for a common ancestor of these languages is the overlapping of many common words and phrases.  However, this does not establish their similar roots.  '''For instance, while English and Russian both contain many words derived from Latin, neither is in any way a descendant of this language.'''  Likewise, while the various empires and the historic Kingdom of Nubia may have proliferated many terms into common parlance, the presence of these common words does not establish a common “family” among these diverse languages.

The portions marked in bold play which of the following roles in the argument?

(A) The first is a premise on which the main conclusion of the argument is based; the second is a statement of the implications of this conclusion.
(B) The first is the main conclusion of the argument; the second is the general principle which is applied to reach this conclusion.
(C) The first is a premise of the argument; the second is the argument's main conclusion.
(D) The first is a subconclusion of the argument; the second is an application of the principle of this subconclusion.
(E) The first is the main conclusion of the argument; the second is an analogy used to explain the rationale for this conclusion.

As will be explained, a “conclusion” is the main point of an argument, while the “premise” is the stated reason which leads to it.  Choice (E) correctly identifies the first bolded sentence as the main conclusion, and the second as an “analogy”, or an example using a similar situation.

With the workers' knowledge and consent, software was installed on their computers which monitored their rates of progress throughout the study.  As expected, the programmers and designers worked more quickly and more efficiently when given high quality, top-of-the line computers on which to do their work.  However, curiously, even when the programmers and designers were given low-quality, antiquated equipment by the researchers on which to work, their rate of performance still outpaced normal work rates at their positions using normal equipment.

Which one of the following most explains why the computer programmers' rates of productivity increased when they were given antiquated, low-quality equipment?

(A) Even the lowest quality equipment available in contemporary times is still superior to equipment once available to computer programmers.
(B) The equipment used by the programmers utilized different operating systems and command prompts with which they were equally familiar.
(C) Individuals who are aware that they are being studied tend to become more self-conscious and to work more quickly and efficiently.
(D) Software programming has encountered few changes in basic programming language since the 1970s.
(E) The low-quality, antiquated equipment was still able to run all of the necessary programs just as normal and high-quality equipment could.

In this case, the circumstance is that programmers tended to work better with antiquated equipment.  Answer (C) helps explain this because, even though the programmers had inferior equipment, they worked faster because they were more self-conscious due to the fact they were being studied.

On questions like these, identify the circumstance, answer by answer, asking what explains it, and why.

==== 4.01  Argument Basics ====

An argument is a claim that something must be true or false, or that must be done or not done, based on statements asserted.

There will be about four argument questions on each GRE verbal section, consisting of short passages such as this one:

“Claims that increased spending on education will increase literacy are unwarranted.  The correlations between literacy and educational spending are in fact because literate peoples spend more on education, not because the latter is conducive to the existence of the former.”

In this passage, the author makes a claim - that spending money on education won't increase literacy.  The author's rationale for saying this is that, while apparently there is a documented link between spending money on education and literacy, the author asserts that the spending money on education is because of a literate population, not the other way around.

Every logically sound argument consists of a '''rule''', a '''fact''', and a '''conclusion.'''

Consider the following argument.

“If LSU lost the football game, Meredith will be sad.  Therefore, it appears that Meredith will be sad, since LSU lost the football game last night.”

Rule:  		If LSU lost the football game, Meredith will be sad.
Fact:  		LSU lost the football game.
Conclusion: 	Meredith will be sad.

A logical gap occurs in an argument when either the rule or the fact is missing, or their conjunction is incomplete.

“Meredith is a huge fan of LSU football.  Therefore, it appears that Meredith will be sad, since LSU lost the football game last night.”

Rule:  		Meredith is a huge fan of LSU football.
Fact:  		LSU lost the football game.
Conclusion: 	Meredith will be sad.

This argument is not logically sound.  The fact that Meredith is a huge LSU football fan does not necessarily mean that she will be sad if the team loses.  While in the real world, this would not be an unreasonable conclusion, from a logical standpoint based on what it states, it does not necessarily follow.
4.01  Argument Basics

=== Practice ===

Identify the rule, fact, and conclusion in each of the following arguments, and determine whether they are logically sound.

1.  All bears like honey.  Andy is a bear.  Therefore, Andy likes honey.

2.  Republicans invariably like money.  Wes is a Republican, so it must be the case that Wes likes money.

3.  Eating seafood makes Allyson sick.  Thus, it looks like Allyson will be sick, since Allyson ate a large plate of the Ocean Spaghetti at Seaside Restaurant.

4.  Bankers always have superior morals to lawyers.  It must be the case that Charlie's morals are far below Julie's, since Julie is a banker, and Charlie is a lawyer.

5.  Every German likes sauerkraut.  Margot loves sauerkraut.  Therefore, Margot must be German.

6.  All of Salvador Dali's paintings can be classified as “surrealism.”  Since this painting is a Salvador Dali painting, this painting can be classified as surrealism.

7.  The neighbors own a '67 Shelby Mustang.  Anyone who owns a classic muscle car is cool.  Therefore, the neighbors are cool.

8.  Humpback whales are typically much smaller than gray whales.  Therefore, the humpback whale sighted in the inlet was inevitably much smaller than the gray whale spotted in the same inlet.

=== Comments ===

=== Answers to Practice Questions ===

1.  

Rule: 		All bears like honey.
Fact: 		Andy is a bear.
Conclusion: 	Andy likes honey.

This argument follows logically.  The fact comports with the rule and triggers its necessary conclusion.

2.  

Rule: 		All Republicans like money.
Fact: 		Wes is a Republican.
Conclusion: 	Wes likes money.

This argument logically follows.  Again, the fact comports with the rule and triggers its necessary conclusion.

3.  

Rule: 		Eating seafood makes Allyson sick.
Fact: 		Allyson ate Ocean Spaghetti 
Conclusion: 	Allyson will be sick.

This argument does not follow logically.  The fact does not establish that Allyson ate seafood.  It states that she ate “Ocean Spaghetti”, whatever that is.  While the name of the food she ate and the restaurant strongly suggest the presence of seafood, the fact doesn't conclusively establish this; thus, the argument does not logically follow.

4.  

Rule: 		Bankers have superior morals to lawyers.
Fact: 		Julie is a banker and Charlie is a lawyer.
Conclusion: 	Charlie's morals are superior to Julie's.

This argument follows logically.  The facts comport with the rule and establish what the rule sets out for things which comport with these facts.


4.01  Argument Basics

  Answers to Practice Questions

5.  

Rule: 		All Germans like sauerkraut.
Fact: 		Margot likes sauerkraut.
Conclusion: 	Margot is German.

This argument does not follow logically.  The rule is that all Germans like sauerkraut, not that anyone who likes sauerkraut must be German.  (Margot could be Polish and like sauerkraut too)  The argument is thus backwards.

6.  

Rule: 		All Dali paintings can be classified as “surrealism.”
Fact: 		This painting is a Dali painting.
Conclusion: 	This painting can be classified as “surrealism.”

This argument follows logically.  The facts are consistent with the requirements of the rule, and therefore trigger what the rule states about these facts.

7.  

Rule: 		Anyone who owns a classic muscle car is cool.
Fact: 		The neighbors own a '67 Shelby Mustang.
Conclusion: 	The neighbors are cool.

This argument does not follow logically.  The rule is that anyone who owns a classic muscle car is cool.  The fact doesn't state that the neighbors own a classic muscle car.  One must assume that a '67 Shelby Mustang is a classic muscle car - perhaps not an unreasonable assumption, but an assumption nonetheless.

8.  

Rule: 		Humpback whales are typically much smaller than gray whales.
Fact: 		These whales are a humpback and a gray whale, respectively.
Conclusion: 	The first whale is smaller than the second.

This argument does not follow logically.  The rule is that Humpback whales are typically much smaller, not that every humpback is smaller than every gray.  Always read the “rules” of arguments carefully.

=== Overview ===

Identify the conclusion of each argument

The “conclusion” is the ultimate point which the author seeks to have the reader believe.  Conclusions are typically buried within very verbose language.  For instance:

	Thomas Hobbes wrote that life in the state of nature was
	“solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.” However,
	many other writers took a more positive view of the
	state of nature. For instance, well known writers
	Henry David Thoreau and Ralph Waldo Emerson
	glorified nature as pure and virtuous compared to
	the evils of society and civilization. It is clear
	from this that Hobbes’s view of nature was quite
	cynical.

The conclusion is the last sentence - that Hobbes's view was cynical.

Conclusions can be located by looking for signal words such as “thus”, “therefore”, “it follows”, “so”, and “conclude.”

The conclusion will be the statement that the other sentences gravitate towards, and thus will often be signaled by language of this sort.

=== Practice ===

Identify the conclusions in each of the following short passages.

1.  The common carp frequently occurs in rivers and lakes, and is often caught by fisherman. Recently, a similar fish, the black carp, has spread into many of the same bodies of water from the fish farms where it is raised. Since the black carp is native to China, it lacks immunity to many local diseases, and since the black carp looks very similar to the common carp, fishermen who catch carp are currently at risk of contracting food poisoning from the fish.


2.  Paying taxes to support government welfare
programs tends to reduce citizens’ desire to provide assistance to others volitionally, since if people feel they are already contributing to the welfare of others through taxes which fund government welfare expenditures, they will feel that their obligation to society has been fulfilled. It follows that public welfare programs in fact have at least some detrimental impact on the public good.

=== Comments ===

=== Answers to Practice Questions ===

1.  The conclusion is that fishermen are at risk for food poisoning from catching the fish.  This argument is explaining that, because fishermen can't distinguish the fish from other carp, and because the fish isn't immune to local diseases, fishermen will be at risk.

2.  The conclusion of the argument is that tax-funded social welfare reduces incentive to give.  The reason for this conclusion is that if people are forced to pay taxes, they will feel they have done enough, and will be less inclined to give.</text>

=== Overview ===

Identify the conclusion and reasons for the conclusion when asked to weaken or strengthen an argument, and select the answer that affects these.

	  The local agriculture commission conducted a
	survey of local irrigated soybean crops. While
	ordinarily, over-irrigated or under-irrigated crops
	have a lower crop yield, in the survey,
	over-irrigated soybean fields saw the excess water
	simply drain away from the field unless the field
	was such that this drainage was inhibited. It
	follows that farmers need not worry about
	over-irrigating their soybean crop unless there is
	currently no way for excess water to drain.

	Which one of the following, most weakens the 
	conclusion that farmers need not worry about 
	over-irrigating?

	(A) Agriculturalists do not currently understand all the
	risks associated with over-irrigation.
	(B) Over-irrigation is not as harmful to crops already
	without adequate drainage for the water.
	(C) Excessive irrigation can cause a field with adequate
	drainage to eventually have inadequate drainage.
	(D) All productive soybean crops need to be irrigated to
	some extent.
	(E) Any excess irrigation will ultimately drain away
	from a soybean field over a period of time.

The conclusion of the argument is that farmers whose fields have adequate drainage don't have to worry about over-irrigating soybean fields.  The reason for this is that excess water always drains away.  Choice (C) weakens this conclusion because it demonstrates that, even if the excess water drains away, this excess water might inhibit the ability of excess water to drain from the field in the future.

In weakening or strengthening arguments, the key concept is “relevance.”  The correct response will make the conclusion more or less likely.
4.03  Weakening &amp; Strengthening Arguments

=== Practice ===

1.  Many people refrain from eating any animal products. But most people who do not eat meat will still consume dairy products, eggs, and other foods made from part of an animal as long as this does not involve hurting the animal. The production of dairy products, however, involves inhumane things such as capturing an animal and forcing labor upon it, as do eggs and invariably any other animal product. Therefore, most people who do not eat meat are still prolonging inhumane things to be inflicted on animals.

Which one of the following most strengthens the argument that most people who do not eat meat are still prolonging inhumane treatment of animals?

(A) People who consume things, the production of which involves inhumane treatment of animals, are invariably assuring the continued existence such inhumane behavior.
(B) Inhumane treatment of animals would be
substantially reduced if a large fraction of the
population refrained from eating animal products like eggs.
(C) The primary reason that people refrain from eating meat is to stop the inhumane treatment of animals.
(D) The majority of people who eat meat also eat other animal products such as dairy and eggs.
(E) There are few people who wish to abandon eating all products produced by animals entirely.

2.  Mozart’s opera “The Magic Flute” tells the story of a hero who finds himself in a faraway land, one which in many productions is reminiscent of ancient Egypt. Indeed, at the beginning of Act II, the people in the faraway land sing a hymn to the Egyptian deities Osiris and Dionysus. Because the hymn sounds much like the German hymns of Mozart’s time, some musicologists argue that Mozart’s opera was poking fun at contemporary religion.

Which one of the following, if true, would most weaken the conclusion that Mozart was ridiculing contemporary religion?

(A) The monarchy and clergy under whom Mozart lived imposed severe punishments for ridiculing religion or the national church.
(B) Many modern pieces of musical theater satirize contemporary cultural elements such as religion.
(C) Many people who lived in Mozart’s time would not have found it funny to ridicule the church or religion.
(D) Other operas written by Mozart contained satire of contemporary society, but not of religion.
(E) “The Magic Flute” pokes fun at many controversial things, and many modern versions of it omit sections that seem sexist or racist.

=== Comments ===

=== Answers to Practice Questions ===

1.  (A)

Choice (A) states a principle which demonstrates that people who consume things which impel a result are invariably furthering that result.  When applied to these facts, this principle means that eating dairy products prolongs animal suffering.

2.  (A)

The argument's conclusion is that Mozart was making fun of religion.  The rationale for this is the similarities between a hymn in Mozart's work and contemporary religious hymns.  Choice (A) weakens this because it gives a reason why poking fun at religion at the time of Mozart would have been implausible.

Identify the fact that the question asks you to explain and the reasons surrounding that fact.

From 1993 to 1997 the local government passed a series of enactments which were very friendly to tenants and landlords, giving tenants greater rights against landlords in court with regard to rent disputes and evictions.  Surprisingly, however, landlords' average profits per residential tenant increased after the enactments were passed.

Which of the following most explains why profits per tenant increased after the enactments?

(A) The total number of residential rental units increased from 1993 to 1997.
(B) Many landlords ceased renting to persons with low incomes or questionable rental histories after the enactments in question.
(C) Income from commercial rentals increased after the 1993 enactments.
(D) The government also repealed old enactments giving special rights to tenants as part of the enactments in question.
(E) The majority of rental agreements do not lead to either rent disputes or evictions.


The correct answer is choice (B).  The key is that profits per residential tenant increased.  The explanation is that landlords simply ceased renting to lower-income tenants altogether.
4.04  Explaining Facts

=== Practice ===

A “depreciating asset” is one that is bound to continue losing value over time. Depreciating assets are never a good investment for the long-term because they are bound to be worth less than one paid for them. Given this reality, it is strange that Raritan Holdings in its acquisition of Casimir, Inc., wanted Casimir's severely depreciating real estate rental properties so badly.

1.  Which one of the following, if true, most explains why Raritan Holdings. would want to make sure it acquired the real estate rental properties in the acquisition?

(A)  Acquired depreciated assets can be used to  reduce tax liability of Raritan Holdings.
(B)  Raritan Holdings acquired many appreciating  assets in the deal as well.
(C) The depreciating assets had already lost most of their value.
(D)  Some assets neither appreciate nor depreciate, but tend to hold their value.
(E) The gross national product in the rental sector has increased in recent years.

About one fourth of the horses at Lorimer Valley Downs that were under 3 years of age needed to be visited by the veterinarian this year. Interestingly, those over 3 years of age were less likely to need to be visited by the veterinarian, though about a fifth of them still did need such a visit.

2.  Which one of the following statements, if true, most helps to explain while older horses at Lorimer Valley Downs were less likely to need veterinary visits?

(A) Lorimer Valley Downs has its employees do basic health examinations for all its horses, regardless of their age.
(B) Riders of older horses are typically more gentle with them than they are with younger horses.
(C) The older a horse becomes, the more likely the horse will be retired from Lorimer Valley Downs due to a decrease in speed. 
(D) Most younger horses at Lorimer Valley Downs
tend to be of significantly different breeds than the older horses.
(E) The majority of illnesses that afflicted the younger horses could have been avoided with better regular checkups.


=== Comments ===

=== Answers to Practice Questions ===

1.  (A)

Choice (A) explains the fact because if the assets can reduce tax liability, they will provide a benefit to their new owner, even if depreciating - and this tax benefit may in fact prove to be greater than any future depreciation.

2.  (B)

Answer (B) explains the fact because if the riders are nicer to the older horses, there will tend to be fewer injuries amongst these older horses.  While answer (C) is tempting, remember that the fact is amongst horses which are at Lorimer; thus, it doesn't matter if many older horses are retired; the older ones which are still there are still less likely to need medical attention.

=== Overview ===

Identify the role of each sentence in relation to the argument's conclusion.

A society's policy toward its justice system reflects the society's concept of morality.  '''Nations must therefore have fundamentally different concepts of morality.'''  Nations around the world have drastically different justice systems, which vary widely.   It is thus impossible for the world to have a single unified set of rules or regulations.  '''Groups with fundamental differences with regard to morality are necessarily precluded from having uniform rules between them.'''

The words marked in bold play which of the following roles in the argument?

(A) The first is a subconclusion which it uses to reach its main conclusion; the second is an additional premise which the argument uses to reach this main conclusion.
(B) The first is the main conclusion of the argument; the second is an additional premise which the argument uses to reach this main conclusion.
(C) The first is a premise which the argument uses to draw its main conclusion; the second is an inference which can be drawn on the basis of this conclusion.
(D) The first is a subconclusion which it uses to reach its main conclusion; the second is the argument's main conclusion.
(E) The first is a premise which the argument uses to draw a subconclusion; the second is a subconclusion which the argument uses to reach its main conclusion.

The answer above is (A).  The first sentence in bold is a subconclusion - one used to reach another conclusion in the second to last sentence.  The  second is a principle, or premise, used to reach this main conclusion.

=== Practice ===

Groceries are generally more expensive in Alaska than in other places because most of the groceries must be transported to Alaska from faraway places. The long transportation incurs costs, which pass on to consumers at Alaskan grocery stores. This means that if individuals move to Alaska, they will probably pay more for groceries each month.

1.  The argument above proceeds by

(A) suggesting an alternative course of action to avoid an undesirable result
(B) establishing a general fact and then applying that principle to a given set of facts
(C) using an analogous situation to illustrate the problems with pursuing a given end
(D) showing that certain measures, if followed, would lead to unacceptable conclusions
(E) appealing to authority to establish what it seeks to prove


All too often contemporary academics criticize the government and public policy, but make no effort on their own behalf to change it. Such academics have no right to make such criticism.  '''After all, one who willingly lets a malfeasance be inflicted upon them is not within his or her right to lament the results of that malfeasance.'''

2.  The statement in bold plays which one of the following roles in the argument?

(A) a factual basis for articulating that malfeasance is currently being inflicted by the government
(B) an example of the type of criticism given by contemporary academics
(C) a general principle which allows the conclusion of the argument to be drawn
(D) an illustration of a key problem for which the passage proposes a solution
(E) evidence for an opposing claim which is subsequently dismissed

=== Comments ===

=== Answers to Practice Questions ===

1. (B)

The “general fact” is that things cost more in Alaska.  Applied to individuals moving, the principle serves to impel the conclusion that more money need be spent on groceries.

2.  (C)

The second sentence is the conclusion of the argument, which states that academics have no right to criticize the government.  The rationale for this is found in the third sentence - that academics do not make any effort to change things, and that absent such an effort, they have no right to complain.

The writing section is of rather small importance in admissions decisions compared to the other two; nonetheless, it is worthwhile for test takers to do the best they can on it.

As stated at the beginning, there are two writing sections.  One is an analysis of an issue; the other is an analysis of an argument.

There are three things to remember about the writing section.

'''1.  Write a lot.''' The single strongest objective predictor of high essay grades is length.

'''2.  Sound intelligent.'''

Social security helps keeps seniors out of poverty. || The beneficial nature of social security is clear, given the public interests furthered by the safety net it provides, and the extent to which it keeps seniors out of poverty.

| Direct voting by the public on political issues would help in some cases.  It would depend, however, on the complexity of the matter - some things would be incomprehensible to the lay person.  This raises an interesting question - is the average person cut out to make leadership decisions?  Historically democracies have usually exercised some level of autonomy.  Of course, there are varying levels of autonomy in the United States.  Nonetheless, the United States has managed to accede to public will on most issues historically.
 || Direct voting by the public on political issues would help in some cases.  The government can only remain stable and effective if it serves the people, and direct voting would bring about this end. However, the question arises as to whether some issues are too complex for the average voter.  Many laws are quite complicated, and the lay person may not have the necessary expertise to properly evaluate changes to them.

|}

Keep thoughts concise and coherent; and, generally, use common sense on the writing section.  Again, however, the section is not particularly important.  Do not let it take away from the other very important sections.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello everyone. So, this is my GRE Wikibook that I'm uploading. I wrote the PDF book back when I was a GRE teacher and tutor. I have now retired from teaching GRE and thought I would share my book with Wikimedia and the world.
The book is a little rough right now because I need to fix the formatting, but all the content has been uploaded. I need to figure out how to do fractions and the triangle pictures. If you run across this page and you think it looks bad, that's because, well, it does - I'm not finished with it yet.
Hopefully soon!
Please post any questions, comments, or concerns. [[User:Atomicporcupine88|Atomicporcupine88]] ([[User talk:Atomicporcupine88|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Atomicporcupine88|contribs]]) 20:45, 18 January 2014 (UTC)



Hi again!  I just went and added heading tags to all of the math chapters.  I also started on converting the fractions and radicals using wikimedia code, so that they appear.

This is going to be a lot of work!  haha  [[User:Atomicporcupine88|Atomicporcupine88]] ([[User talk:Atomicporcupine88|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Atomicporcupine88|contribs]]) 01:35, 19 January 2014 (UTC)



Okay I just did some more editing and now I'm taking a break.  I finalized a couple of the reading chapters...still so much more to do.  Yayyy.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Chickens==
The book  &quot;Evolution for Everyone by David Sloan Wilson&quot; describes how groups can evolve as well as individuals. For example William Muir of Purdue wanted to increase egg production. For years the strategy was to breed the most productive hens. This resulted in hens murdering each other unless their beaks were trimmed. The new method was to breed the most successful chicken coops. This increased egg production. After careful study, it was found that the most productive hens often suppressed egg production by other hens. Happier hens produce more eggs collectively.

==Within Group Evolution==
Within group evolution is what students need to focus on. This is discussed below. Instructors, project managers, clients and employers of engineers are interested in group productivity. It is easy for them to identify hitchhikers, couch potatoes, and slackers. It is the extreme performers that are the most difficult to deal with. 

==Extreme performers==
A young engineer solved a huge industry problem within 3 months of being employed. He received a patent. The company he worked for was the assignee (the owner.) Other companies in the industry tried to license the patent, purchase the patent, purchase the company he worked for and others try to hire the young engineer to work on the new, better version of the patent. 

The young engineer's salary was when he left to go to the new company. At the new company he repeated the same scenario in area he was not assigned. Another team had been working on the project for several years and had spent lots of money that was being invested in a solution. The young engineer made everyone on the team and even upper level management look  bad. He was ostracized, eventually quit and had to start over finding a job. At the end of his career he was was the original inventor on over 40 patents and participated in the creation of another 20 patents. But he still worked alone in small companies.

This young engineer matured into someone that was never wrong, never documented anything, never worked within a team that develops a &quot;we&quot; solution, never built an institution, never helped create a group mind that exists independent of the individuals involved at the moment. 

==Dealing with the Brilliant==
There are huge differences in abilities, gifts and resources among students. Dealing with these is often more difficult than slackers, coach potatoes and hitch hikers. 

Within a student team there may be a person that is absolutely brilliant, that can do anything, that makes everyone else listen and watch. These students become the A students that eventually get doctorates, focus on individual research and teach.  Start-up, new companies financed by entrepreneurs look for these brilliant people by forming relationships with colleges and the professors. The number of engineers that bounce around start-up companies without getting doctorates is rare. Many brilliant people become entrepreneurs themselves ... and stop being engineers.

==C Students==
The C students are those that develop the &quot;we&quot; solution, build institutions and help create the group mind. Many engineering projects require lots of engineers working together. There are many more of these types of engineering jobs and they are more stable. Often the A and B students are later hired by the &quot;C&quot; students.

If your team ends up with one of these brilliant engineers, then collectively the team has to:
* slow him or her down, ask lots of questions
* repeat what he or she is doing, and ask for help
* take pictures and video .. chase him or her around, and document what was done</text>

__TOC__
&lt;/div&gt;


A subquery is a complete SELECT command which is used within another SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT or DELETE command. The only difference to a simple SELECT is, that it is enclosed in parenthesis.

== Classification ==
Depending on the type of the created result there are three classes of subqueries:
:* ''Scalar Value Subquery'': The subquery returns one single value, e.g: &lt;code&gt;(SELECT max(weight) FROM person)&lt;/code&gt;.
:* ''Row Subquery'': The subquery returns one single row of one or more values, e.g: &lt;code&gt;(SELECT min(weight), max(weight) FROM person)&lt;/code&gt;.
:* ''Table Subquery'': The subquery returns a list of rows, which is a table, e.g: &lt;code&gt;(SELECT lastname, weight FROM person)&lt;/code&gt;. For the classification it makes no difference whether the resulting list contains zero, one or more rows. The demarcation between a table subquery and a row subquery is that '''potentially''' more than one row may occur.

Every type can be used on all positions where the type it stands for may occur: the scalar value subquery where a single value may occur, the row subquery where a single row may occur and the table subquery where a table may occur. Additionally table subqueries may occur as an argument of an EXISTS, IN, SOME, ANY or ALL predicate.

Independent from this classification subqueries may be ''correlated subqueries'' or ''non-correlated subqueries''. Correlated subqueries have a correlation to the surrounding query by the fact that they use values from the surrounding query within the subquery. Non-correlated subqueries are independent from the surrounding query. This distinction is shown in detail in [[#Scalar Value Subquery|the next chapter]] but applies also to the other two subquery classes.

Because correlated subqueries use values, which are determined by the surrounding query and may change from row to row, the subquery is executed - conceptional - as often as resulting rows of the surrounding query exist. This might lead to performance problems. Nevertheless correlated subqueries are an often used construct. In many cases exist equivalent constructs which use a JOIN. Which one shows the better performance depends highly on the DBMS, and the number of involved rows, the existence of indices and a lot more variables.

== Scalar Value Subquery ==
The first example creates a list of lastnames, weights and the average weight of all persons. 
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
SELECT id,
       lastname,
       weight,
       (SELECT avg(weight) FROM person)    -- this is the subquery
FROM   person
ORDER BY lastname;
&lt;/source&gt;

Because the subquery uses the &lt;code&gt;avg()&lt;/code&gt; function, the SQL compiler knows that it will return exactly one single value. Therefore it's type is ''Scalar Value Subquery'' and can be used on positions where scalar values may occur, e.g. in the list between SELECT and FROM.

In the next example the subquery is used as a deputy for a value within the WHERE clause.

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
-- Persons who weigh more than the average of all persons
SELECT id, lastname, weight
FROM   person
WHERE  weight &gt;= (SELECT avg(weight) FROM person)   -- another position for the subquery
ORDER BY lastname;
&lt;/source&gt;

Both examples use the table ''person'' twice. Just as well one can use different tables. There is no dependency between the table name in the subquery and in the surrounding query. This applies to all classes of correlated and non-correlated subqueries. The subqueries may retrieve any value from any other table, e.g. the number of contacts.

This first two examples show non-correlated subqueries, which means, that the subqueries are independent from the queries in which they are embedded. They are executed only once.

But often an application faces a situation, where the subquery must use values from the outside query (similar to subroutines which uses parameters). This kind of subquery is called a correlated subquery. As an example the next query lists persons together with the average weight of their family.

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
SELECT id, firstname, lastname, weight,
       (SELECT avg(weight)
        FROM   person sq                -- 'sq' is an arbitrary alias name for the table in the subquery
        WHERE  sq.lastname = p.lastname -- identify the inner and outer table by its alias names
       ) family_average                 -- an arbitrary alias name for the computed family average
FROM   person p                         -- 'p' is an arbitrary alias name for the table in the surrounding query
ORDER BY lastname, weight;
&lt;/source&gt;

The subselect gets one row of the surrounding SELECT after the next as an parameter with the name 'p'. Within the subselect all columns of the row 'p' are known and may be used. Here the family name from the outside row is used in the subquery to find all persons within the family and the average weight of the family members.

Be careful: Correlated subqueries are executed once per row of the surrounding query. Therefore they are much more costly than non-correlated subqueries. There might exist an equivalent solution using JOIN or GROUP BY which works with better performance. The query optimizer of the DBMS internally might rearrange the given subquery into one of the equivalent forms. But this does not work in all cases.

The distinction between correlated and non-correlated subqueries is universal. It applies also to the other subquery classes.

== Row Subquery ==
This example retrieves one or more persons, whose firstname is the lowest (in the sense of the lexical order) of all firstnames and whose lastname is the lowest of all lastnames. Because of the AND condition it might be the case that no person is found.

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
-- One resulting row: Elias Baker
SELECT *
FROM   person
WHERE  (firstname, lastname) = (SELECT MIN(firstname), MIN(lastname) FROM person);
&lt;/source&gt;

Within the subquery the lowest first- and lastnames are retrieved. The use of the &lt;code&gt;min()&lt;/code&gt; function garanties that not more than one row with two columns will arise - therefore it is a row subquery. In the surrounding query this intermediate result is compared with each row of the complete table ''person'' or - if present - an index is used.

It's a fortune that the command retrieves a row. In most cases the lowest first- and lastname results from different persons. But also in those cases the command is syntactically correct and will not throw any exception.

In the next example persons with the lowest first- and lastnames within every family are retrieved. To do so, it is neccessary to use a correlated row subquery.

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
-- 7 rows, one per family
SELECT *
FROM   person p
WHERE (firstname, lastname) =
  (SELECT MIN(firstname), MIN(lastname) FROM person sq where p.lastname = sq.lastname);
&lt;/source&gt;

Again, there are the two incarnations of table ''person'', one with the alias name 'p' in the surrounding query and one with the alias name 'sq' in the subquery. The subquery is called once per resulting row of the surrounding query, because the 'p.lastname' may change with every row of 'p'.

Within every family there is as least one person which achievs the condition - it is also conceivable that several persons achiev the condition.

== Table Subquery ==
The next example retrievs persons who have a hobby. The class of the subquery is: non-correlated table subquery (used as a condition in the IN predicate).

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
SELECT * 
FROM   person 
WHERE  id IN 
  (SELECT person_id FROM contact);  -- the subquery
&lt;/source&gt;

The subquery creates multiple rows with one column for each of them. This constitutes a new, intermediate table. Therefore this example is a table subquery.

The IN operator is able to act on this intermediate table. In contrast, it is not possible to use operators like '=' or '&gt;' on this kind of intermediate result. In this cases the SQL compiler will recognize an syntax error.

The next example is an extention of the first one. It adds a correlation criterion between the query and the subquery by requesting the lastname within an email-address.

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
-- A correlated table subquery, looking for lastnames within e-mail-addresses
SELECT * 
FROM   person p
WHERE  id IN 
  (SELECT person_id 
   FROM   contact c
   WHERE  c.contact_type = 'email'
   AND    UPPER(c.contact_value) LIKE CONCAT(CONCAT('%', UPPER(p.lastname)), '%'));
&lt;/source&gt;
The last comparision after the AND is a little bit complex. It uses the functions CONCAT() and UPPER() as well as the predicate LIKE, but this is not of interest for the actual topic 'subquery'. The important part is that the subquery refers to 'p.lastname' of the surrounding query. Only Mr. Goldstein meets the criterion that his e-mail address contains his lastname when the two columns are compared case-insensitive.

Remark: CONCAT() concatenates two strings. UPPER() converts a string to upper-case. LIKE in combination with the '%' sign looks for one string within another.


Next, there is an example where a non-correlated table subquery is object to a join operation. 
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
-- Persons plus maximum weight of their family
SELECT *
FROM   person p
JOIN   (SELECT lastname, max(weight) max_fam_weight
        FROM   person
        GROUP BY lastname
       ) AS sq ON p.lastname = sq.lastname   -- join criterion between subquery table 'sq' and table 'p'
;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Another Example ==
The example shows a solution for a common problem. Sometimes there are rows describing an outdated stage of entities. Those rows - for one logical entity - differ from each other in some columns and there is an additional column ''version'' to track the time flow.

Here is the example table ''booking'' and its data.
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
-- The table holds actual and historical values
CREATE TABLE booking (
  -- identifying columns
  id             DECIMAL      NOT NULL,
  booking_number DECIMAL      NOT NULL,
  version        DECIMAL      NOT NULL,
  -- describing columns
  state          CHAR(10)     NOT NULL,
  enter_ts       TIMESTAMP    NOT NULL,
  enter_by       CHAR(20)     NOT NULL,
  -- ...
  -- select one of the defined columns as the Primary Key
  CONSTRAINT booking_pk PRIMARY KEY (id),
  -- forbid duplicate recordings
  CONSTRAINT booking_unique UNIQUE (booking_number, version)
);

-- Add data
INSERT INTO booking VALUES (1, 4711, 1, 'created',   TIMESTAMP'2014-02-02 10:01:01', 'Emily');
INSERT INTO booking VALUES (2, 4711, 2, 'modified',  TIMESTAMP'2014-02-03 11:10:01', 'Emily');
INSERT INTO booking VALUES (3, 4711, 3, 'canceled',  TIMESTAMP'2014-02-10 09:01:01', 'John');
--
INSERT INTO booking VALUES (4, 4712, 1, 'created',   TIMESTAMP'2014-03-10 12:12:12', 'Emily');
INSERT INTO booking VALUES (5, 4712, 2, 'delivered', TIMESTAMP'2014-03-12 06:01:00', 'Charles');
--
INSERT INTO booking VALUES (6, 4713, 1, 'created',   TIMESTAMP'2014-03-11 08:50:02', 'Emily');
INSERT INTO booking VALUES (7, 4713, 2, 'canceled',  TIMESTAMP'2014-03-12 08:40:12', 'Emily');
INSERT INTO booking VALUES (8, 4713, 3, 'reopend',   TIMESTAMP'2014-03-13 10:04:32', 'Jack');
INSERT INTO booking VALUES (9, 4713, 4, 'delivered', TIMESTAMP'2014-03-15 06:40:12', 'Jack');
--
COMMIT;
&lt;/source&gt;


The problem is to retrieve all '''actual''' rows, which are those with the highest version number within each booking. Bookings are considered to be the same, if they have the same booking_number.

The first solution uses a non-correlated table subquery.
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
SELECT *
FROM   booking b
WHERE  (booking_number, version) IN
  (SELECT booking_number, MAX(version) FROM booking sq GROUP BY booking_number) -- the subquery
ORDER BY booking_number;
&lt;/source&gt;

The subquery creates a list of booking numbers together with their highest version. This list is used by the surrounding query to retrieve the required rows with all its columns.


The second solution uses a correlated scalar value subquery.
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
SELECT *
FROM   booking b
WHERE  version =
  (SELECT max(version) FROM booking sq WHERE sq.booking_number = b.booking_number)
ORDER BY booking_number;
&lt;/source&gt;

The surrounding query retrievs all rows of the table. For each of them it calls the subquery, which retrieves the highest version within this booking_number. In most cases this highest version differs from the version of the actual row and because of the '=' operator those rows are not part of the result. Only those, whose version is equal to the value determined in the subquery (and whose booking_number is the same as those used in the subquery) are part of the final result.


A variation of the introducing question may be to retrieve only historical rows (all versions except the highest one) for one special booking.

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
SELECT *
FROM   booking b
WHERE  version !=
  (SELECT max(version) FROM booking sq WHERE sq.booking_number = b.booking_number)
AND    booking_number = 4711
ORDER BY version;
&lt;/source&gt;

The surrounding query restricts the rows to those of one special booking. The subquery is called only for those rows.


It's easy to run into pitfalls:
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
-- Unexpected result!
SELECT *
FROM   booking b
WHERE  version != (SELECT max(version) FROM booking)
AND    booking_number = 4711
ORDER BY version;
&lt;/source&gt;

The above query returns all versions of booking 4711 including the actual one! To get the expected result, it's necessary to 'link' the surrounding query and the subquery together.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Firefox is the default Ubuntu (Edubuntu and Ubuntu derivates) Web browser and provides you with a simple, safe, and powerful browsing experience. Firefox is developed by Mozilla and has become one of the most successful open source projects in the world and continues to garner huge popularity. With hundreds of millions of downloads and rapidly increasing browser share, Firefox has been an unparalleled success.

Fire up Firefox by clicking its icon (the first one next to the System menu) on the panel or by selecting Applications &gt; Internet &gt; Firefox Web Browser.

You can learn more about Mozilla and Firefox, as well as their other software products, at www.mozilla.org.


The Firefox window looks similar to most Web browsers and includes the usual back, forward, reload, and stop buttons, an address bar, and some menus. These familiar-looking elements help you become acquainted with Firefox, and if you have used Internet Explorer, Opera, Chrome, or Safari before, you are sure to pick it up in no time.

      <text xml:space="preserve">We just wanted to let you know some things that are important to remember to start getting the best out of your laptop.

'''(1)''' to log into the laptop log-in as one of these users:

* '''labdoo''': The password is to log in is labdoo (should be changed at once by the teacher, as labdoo has administrator rights)

* '''student''': The password to log in is labdoo (it is up to you, if you change the password)

* '''guest''': needs no password to log in, but all input will be delete by logging out

* '''labdoo''' is a administrator, but can be switched to become a standard user.

* Go to system settings → user accounts → unlock →

- Password „labdoo“ → click on password, change it or

- click on labdoo user → standard ←→ administrator, depending which rights are needed. Please remember to switch back again after the changes.

'''(2)''' Just to get you started, we recommend that you go directly to the Edubuntu packages and start playing with them.  They are fun and you will learn a lot of cool stuff!  Here is how you do that:

'''(2A)''' Click on the Ubuntu icon (usually found in the upper-left corner of your screen), then click on “more applications”.  Now click on “Filter results” and in that screen, click on “Education”.

'''(2B)''' You will see your screen becomes full of education applications.  You can now start playing with any of them...
In the folder „documents“ you will find useful manuals. In the folder „wikidoo“ is a lexicon. Have fun, play, learn and share it with your friends!



A Labdoo laptop comes with the Linux operating system installed.  Depending on the power of the laptop, the labdoo team installs one or more desktops (the graphical user interfaces) into the laptop. When you login you will see an icon in the right upper corner of the login field. Click on it and you can select your preferred graphical user interface from a list of desktops (depending on the power of the system, not all of the following desktop may be installed on your Labdoo laptop):

[[File:Edubuntu_Desktops.png|center|500px|thumb|Edubuntu Desktops]]

'''Language, regional formats and keyboard settings'''

[[File:Language_Support.png|right|300px|thumb|Language Support]]

Some times you may want to configure one or more languages for your laptop in which case you will have to change the system language settings. 

To do that, open the System Settings window (click directly on its icon or on the ubuntu symbol usually located in the right upper corner) and then:

- Click on Language Support. In some cases you get the message “Language support not completely installed”.  If so, click “Yes, install now”.

- Next, you get the following window. Open Install/Remove languages → select (mark) the languages you need → Apply System-wide.



- The new language(s) is/are in the list of the language. This list works in order: first ubuntu shows a word from the first language, if not translated, ubuntu searches the word in the second language, and so on.

- Click inside the list of the new system languages, keep pressed the left mouse button on your preferred language and draw it to the top of the list, release the left mouse button. If in the correct position (otherwise retry) click on Apply System-wide. The new language will be used after a re-start or log-out.

'''Regional Formats'''

You can also adjust the format of numbers, date and currency to the country of your Edoovillage. Select the country from the Date &amp; Location icon on the top launchpad and click on Apply System-Wide. 

'''Keyboard Settings'''

Open System Settings → Keyboard Layout and you will see a list of the installed keyboard layouts. Sometimes you need to switch between different keyboard layouts, depending on your language and country settings. It is also possible to adapt keyboards to the national layout using stickers, which can be placed on the keyboard.

+ = add a new keyboard layout from a list

- = remove an installed keyboard layout

△ = move a keyboard layout up in the list of installed layouts

▽ = move a keyboard layout down in the list of installed layouts

Keyboard symbol = shows you the detailed layout by a graphic
Options = various settings, e.g. short cuts for switching keyboards

You can also choose the keyboard from the desktop:

=== Usage ===
Returns the name of the non-documentation page presumably associated with the transcluding page:  returns &lt;nowiki&gt;{{PAGENAME}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; with a &quot;/doc&quot; suffix, if any, stripped off.

Use on a documentation subpage names the documented page (the object of the documentation) both when viewing the subpage directly and when transcluding it on the documented page.

== Usage ==
This template generates a table of contents for a book, derived from a navlist page; see [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Doc]].
* Optional unnamed parameter &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{1}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; specifies the name for the section heading; the default section heading is &quot;Table of Contents&quot;.  If parameter &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{1}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; has value &lt;nowiki&gt;#nosection&lt;/nowiki&gt;, no section heading is generated.
* Optional named parameter &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{navlist}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; specifies the navlist page; the default navlist page is &lt;nowiki&gt;Template:{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Navlist&lt;/nowiki&gt;.  When a parameter value is provided, the navlist page is assumed to be in mainspace unless another namespace is specified in the parameter value.
* Optional named parameter &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{format}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; specifies how the table of contents is presented.  The default format is a simple list.  Specifying &lt;nowiki&gt;format=block&lt;/nowiki&gt; causes the contents to be presented as a two-column table, with each section heading on the left and its contents to its right.
* Optional named parameter &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{background}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; is ignored unless &lt;nowiki&gt;format=block&lt;/nowiki&gt;.  It specifies the background color with which to shade the cells of the table; default background color is determined by the &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{background}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; parameter in the navlist (see [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Doc#The navlist page|here]]).

Examples (see [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Doc#Note on editing the templates|note on editing]]):
:&lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;{{OBJECTPAGENAME}}&lt;nowiki&gt;|navlist=&lt;/nowiki&gt;{{FULLBOOKNAME}}&lt;nowiki&gt;/Doc/D}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

=== Usage ===

This template is designed to be called at the top of each module page of a book.  It deduces the organization of the book from a navlist page; see [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Doc]].

Optional named parameters &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{background}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; and &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{border}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; determine the colors of the background and border of the generated navbox, overriding the default colors determined by the navlist page (as described in the general documentation, linked above). Optional named parameter &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{navlist}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; specifies the navlist page; the default navlist page is &lt;nowiki&gt;Template:{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Navlist&lt;/nowiki&gt;, and if a parameter value is provided, the navlist page is assumed to be in mainspace unless another namespace is specified in the parameter value.

Some examples (see [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Doc#Note on editing the templates|note on editing]]):

Module doesn't occur in navlist:  &lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;{{OBJECTPAGENAME}}|navlist={{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Doc/A&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

=== Usage ===

Usage: &lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;{{OBJECTPAGENAME}}&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;''name''&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; generates just the part of ''name'' after the last slash.  It works by stripping off slash-separated prefixes of ''name''.

Optional named parameter &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{mode}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; varies this behavior.  If &lt;nowiki&gt;mode=long&lt;/nowiki&gt;, only the first part of ''name'' is removed (up to and including the first slash), except that if there is no slash, nothing is removed.  If &lt;nowiki&gt;mode=split&lt;/nowiki&gt;, the generated text is as for long mode, but a linebreak is inserted just before the last slash.

Some examples (see [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Doc#Note on editing the templates|note on editing]]):

=== Usage ===

This template generates a link to a given page &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{1}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;.  By default, the visible name of the link is the page's [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Subpagename|subpagename]].  If the page parameter &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{1}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; is blank (or omitted), no link is generated (and &lt;nowiki&gt;&amp;amp;nbsp;&lt;/nowiki&gt; is generated instead).  There are also four optional named parameters, &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{left}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{right}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{mode}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; and &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{prefix}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;.

If a link is generated, and &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{left}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; and/or &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{right}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; is provided, the parameter value(s) is(are) generated to the left/right of the link.  If a link is generated, &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{prefix|}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; is prefixed to the name of the link (both to its address, and to its visible name before taking its subpagename).

Parameter &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{mode}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; overrides the default visible name of the link.  If &lt;nowiki&gt;mode=long&lt;/nowiki&gt;, the visible name is all but the book-name and following slash
(except that the main page itself is given its own name, rather than blank).  If &lt;nowiki&gt;mode=split&lt;/nowiki&gt;, the long visible name is divided into two lines just before the subpagename.

Some examples (see [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Doc#Note on editing the templates|note on editing]]):

__NOTOC__
{{Warning|This template shouldn't be used on any page for which a table of contents will be automatically generated.}}
This template generates a section heading (as by &lt;nowiki&gt;==&lt;/nowiki&gt;''title''&lt;nowiki&gt;==&lt;/nowiki&gt;), with either no edit link, or an edit link that causes a specified page to be edited; and optionally with an additional [help] link immediately to the left of the edit link.

Four optional parameters may be provided; any of them may be omitted, but at least either &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{1}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; or &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{edit}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; must be non-blank.

* Parameter &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{1}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; is the title of the section.  If it is omitted, the part of parameter &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{edit}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; after the last slash (as provided by {{tl|{{BOOKNAME}}/Subpagename}}) is used instead.

* Parameter &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{level}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; may have value subsection or subsubsection, causing the apparent heading to be one or two levels deeper (that is, level=subsection emulates &lt;nowiki&gt;===&lt;/nowiki&gt;''title''&lt;nowiki&gt;===&lt;/nowiki&gt;, level=subsubsection emulates &lt;nowiki&gt;====&lt;/nowiki&gt;''title''&lt;nowiki&gt;====&lt;/nowiki&gt;).

* Parameter &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{edit}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; is a page to be edited by the edit link.  If it is omitted, no edit link is generated.

* Parameter &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{help}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; is a page to be linked to by a [help] link just to the left of the edit link.

Some examples (see [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Doc#Note on editing the templates|note on editing]]):

:&lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;{{OBJECTPAGENAME}}&lt;nowiki&gt;|Alternative title|edit=Wikibooks:Sandbox|help=Help:Templates}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
{{{{OBJECTPAGENAME}}|Alternative title|edit=Wikibooks:Sandbox|help=Help:Templates}}

:&lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;{{OBJECTPAGENAME}}&lt;nowiki&gt;|level=subsection|edit=Wikibooks:Sandbox|help=Help:Templates}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
{{{{OBJECTPAGENAME}}|level=subsection|edit=Wikibooks:Sandbox|help=Help:Templates}}

This template is designed to be passed to a navlist, which describes the organization of a book as documented at [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Doc]].  Its function is to identify the predecessor of &lt;nowiki&gt;{{PAGENAME}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; in the book outline.

=== Usage ===

This template is used by the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Doc|Navlist family of templates]] in place of {{tl|BookCat}}.  If the client page is outside of the Navlist family, this template merely calls {{tl|BookCat}}; but if the client page is itself part of the Navlist family, this template bypasses {{tl|BookCat}} and instead &amp;mdash; by default &amp;mdash; puts the client into [[:Category:{{FULLBOOKNAME}}]].

Optional parameter &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{local}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; overrides the default behavior when the client is part of the Navlist family.  If &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{local}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; has value &lt;tt&gt;no&lt;/tt&gt;, the template doesn't put the client into any category; otherwise, it puts the client into &lt;nowiki&gt;[[&lt;/nowiki&gt;Category:{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/&lt;nowiki&gt;{{{local}}}]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;.

=== Usage ===
This template is made to be used as the default for the outer call of a navlist page; see [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Doc]]. It provides a warning notice identifying the page as a navlist, wikilinking to the navlist documentation and to the book's main page; and rudimentary echoing of the data in the navlist.  It only works for the outer call; it would not behave reasonably for inner calls, and thus is not a [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Doc#Internally used map templates|map template]].

For example, sample navlist [[Template:Navlist/Doc/A]] looks like this:

{{Navlist/Doc/A}}

=== Usage ===

This template is designed to be passed to a navlist, which describes the organization of a book as documented at [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Doc]].  Its function is to identify the parent of &lt;nowiki&gt;{{PAGENAME}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; in the book outline.  The result generated prefixes &lt;nowiki&gt;{{BOOKNAME}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; to the parent page entry as it occurs in the navlist; if no parent is found, nothing is generated.  Looking forward in the list of pages from the current page, one or two blank entries may be skipped.

Some examples (see [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Doc#Note on editing the templates|note on editing]]):

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot; class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Description
! Code
! Result

Between 1945 and 1950, developments in the COld War had been affected by events in Europe. After 1950, the courses of the Cold War was influenced by other factors, including:
* events in Asia,
* the nuclear arms race, and
* chances in leadership in the United States and USSR, and a move to establish better relations between East and West.

== Eisenhower and Dulles in the United States: roll-back, Brinkmanship, and the New Look ==
Republican Dwight D. Eisenhower was elected U.S. president in 1952. Nicknamed 'Ike,' he had a distinguished military background having commanded the ALlied armies in Normandy in 1944. After the end of World War Two he served as U.S. Army Chief of Staff and Commander-in-Chief of NATO.

Eisenhower's bacgrkound meant that he was unlikely to be criticised as being 'soft on Communism.' In fact both he and his Secretary of State, John Foster Dulles, were strongly anti-Communist. Dulles was vociferous in his condemnation of the Soviet System:

{{quote|Soviet Communism believes that human beings are nothing more than ... superior animals ... and that the best kind of world is that world which is organised as a well manage farm is organised, where certain animals are taken out to pasture, and they are fet and broguht back and milked, and they are given a barn as shelter over their heads ... I do not see how, as long as Soviet COmmunism holds those views ... there can be any permanent reconciliation ... This is an irreconcible conflict.|U.S. Senate, 83rd Congress, 1st Session, on the nomination of Dulles, 15th of January 1954.}}

In the 1952 presidential election campaign, DUlles had alaso talked about 'roll-back,' by which he meant liberating countries currently held by the Soviets in Eastern Europe, but in reality this never happened. No attempt was ever made under Eisenhowever to free countries from Soviet control. Although the United States quietly encouraged revellions in Eastern Europe in 1943 and 1956, it did not use these opportunities to extend the U.S. sphere of influence.

Rather than carrying out roll-back, under Eisenhowever the U.S. administration developed a policy of containment it called the 'New Look.' This meant preventing the extension of Soviet Communism outside of the areas where it was already established, in the belief that without any opportunity to expand, the Soviet system would collapse in on itself. Eisenhowever put his containment policy into practise by:
* Setting up alliances to encircle the Soviet Union, for example, SEATO,
* Using military power to protect vulnerable areas, for example, Western Berlin,
* Assisting forces fighting Communism, for example, Diem's government in South Vietnam, 
* Using the CIA (Central Ingelligence Agency) for covert operations more extensively than had been done before,
* Initiating an increase reliance on nuclear weapons. A national security document in 1953 states 'The U.S. will consider nuclear weapons to be available for use as other munitions.' Conventional weapons would thus play a smaller role in defence, and
* Brkinmanship. This involved threats of massive retaliation as an instrument containment. it entailed going to the brink and threatening nuclear war to intimidate the aggressor into backing down.

Dulles explained the policy of Brinkmanship in 1952 in an interview in ''Life'' Magazine:

{{quote|You have to take chances for peace, just as you must take chances in war. SOme say that we were brought to the verge of war. Of course we were brought to the verge of war. The ability to get to the verge without getting into the war is the necessary art. If you cannot master it, you inevitably get into wars. If you try to run away from it, if you are scared to go to the brink, you are lost.|Secretary of State, John Foster Dulles, Interview in ''Life'' Magazine.}}

Despite the aggressive nature of Brinkmanship, Eisenhowever was also keenly aware of the dangers of nuclear weapons and prepared to negotiate with the Soviet Union. Thus there were U.S.−Soviet SUmmits in 1955 and 1959.

== Krushchev and co-existence ==
The fact that U.S.−Soviet summits took place during the 1950s was due not only to Eisenhowever's willingness to negotiate, but also due to the attitudes of the new leadership in the Soviet Union.

Following the death of Josef Stsalin in 1953, and the subsequent removal of Stalin's secret-police chief, Lavrenti Pavlovich Beria, Soviet foreign policy came under the control of George Malenkov who, with Nikita Krushchev and Nicolai Bulganin, formed a collective leadership. Malenkov forumulated the idea of a 'New Course' with the West. This was later picked up by Krushchev who, having won the struggle for leadership, renamed it 'peaceful co-existence.'

This was a move away from the Leninist doctrine of the inevitability of war. 'Peaceful co-existence' meant that capitalism and Communism should accept the continuing existence of one another, rather than using force to destroy each other. Just as the Americans believed that, deprived of opportunities for expansion, Communism would collapse. Krushchev declared that in any case capitalism would die out due to its own inherent weaknesses. Thus there was no need to risk nuclear war.

== What other factors encouraged a change in international relations? ==

It was not just Eisenhowever and Khrushchev who were keen to avoid a nuclear war. Other world leaders, such as WInston Churchill, also supported the idea of more communication between East and West in order to avoid a nuclear holocaust.

Economic factors also played a role in pushing the two superpowers into a friendlier relationship. In the USSR, approximately one third of the economy was directed towards the military, while consumer goods were scarce and living standards very low. The economy of the United States was in much better shape than that of the Soviet Union, but 12 per cent of the GNP was still spent on the military. If improved relations could lea to a decrease in military spending, this would be good news for the economies of both countries.

Also, by 1954 the Korean War had ended, removing a major source of conclict between the United States and the Soviet Union.

== East−West relations in the 1950s ==
An example of improved U.S.−Soviet relations after 1953 was agreement over Austria. In April 1955, the Soviet Union proposed a formal peace treaty with Austria. The Austrian State Treaty ended the four-power occupation of Austria and created an independent and neutral country. Following on from this, the Geneva Summit took place in July 1955. This was the first meeting of the heads of government of the major powers since 1945. However, a little substance was achieved at this meeting and proposals concerning the arms race and the issue of Germany got nowhere. The table below shows the proposals and responses made by the United States and the Soviet Union at this time:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! '''Soviet Proposals:''' !! '''US.Reaction:'''
|-
|
* Mutual disbandment of NATO and the Warsaw Pact
* Withdrawal of all foreign troops from Europe followed by the drawing up of a European Security Treaty
* Free elections to be carried out for a reunified German government |
|
Hostile. These ideas were unacceptable to the West European governments, and no agreement was reached on any of these proposals.
|-
! '''U.S. Proposals''' !! '''Soviet Reaction '''
|-
|
*An 'Open Skies' proposal. This meant each side would exchange plans of military installations and allow aerial surveillance of each other's installations. |
|
Hostile. The Soviets did not not even bother to make a formal reply. They dismissed it as 'nothing more than a bold espionage plot' and Khrushchev said it would be 'like seeing into our bedrooms.' However, the United States went ahead and used the U-2 reconnaissance plane.
|}

=== Was the Geneva Summit a failure? ===
Despite the failure to achieve any concrete progress on Germany or disarmament, the Geneva Summit nevertheless was a breakthrough, in that discussions were carried out in an atmosphere of cordiality. The Summit also led to better relations in terms of trade exhibitions, exchanging of certain scientific information and cultural exchanges. Thus the phrase 'spirit of Geneva' was given to the events surrounding 1955.

=== Why did East−West tension increase again after 1955? ===
In February 1956, Khrushchev gave his de-Stalinisation speech, which led to challenges to Soviet rule throughout the Eastern block. At the time as Khrushchev faced problems in Hungary, the West was involved in the Suez Crisis. Both of these crises helped to dissipate the good feeling achieved at Geneva. The Suex Crisis also raised fears of growing Soviet influence in the Middle East, and this led to the Eisenhower Doctrine in January 1957.

==  The technology race ==
In addition to this mounting tension between East and West, the Americans now became increasingly worried about a Soviet threat against the United States. On the 4th of October 1957 the Soviets launched the world's first artificial satellite − Sputnik − 'travelling companion,' to be followed a month later by Sputnik II. This sent the Americans into a state of panic as they became convinced of Soviet superiority in missile technology. This impression was reinforced by Khrushchev, who made the most of the situation:

{{quote|The Sputniks prove that socialism has won the competition between socialist and capitalist countries ... that the economy, science, culture and the creative genius of the people in all spheres of life develop better and faster under socialism.|Nikita Khrushchev}}

Khrushchev used every opportunity to insist that he could wipe out any American or European city:

{{quote|He would even specify how many missiles and warheads each target might require. But he also tried to be nice about it: at one point, while bullying an American visitor, Hubert Humphrey [a senator from Minnesota, who later became vice-president], he paused to ask where his guest was from. When Humphrey pointed out Minneapolis on the map, Khrushchev circled it with a big blue pencil. That's so I don't forget to order them a spare the city when the rockets fly,' he explained amiably.|As reported in John Lewis Gaddis, The Cold War, (Penguin 2005), p.70}}

=== The missile gap ===

The U.S. Congress and the media promoted the idea of a 'missile gap.' This scenario was confirmed by the Gaither Report − the findings of a top-secret investigating committee. The report recommended:
* a vast icnrease in offensive defence power, especially missile development,
* a build-up of conventional forces capable of fighting a limited war, and
* a massive building programme of fallout shelters to protect U.S. citisens from nuclear attack.

I know that I don't log into Wikibooks on a daily basis, but please don't delete my work under the cause of being abandoned.  It was less than a month stale, please.  The last section that was deleted was also the template I created that was the model for all my pages; it was hardly abandoned.

If it's 6 months, that's a bit more reasonable, but I really do keep track of what I created on here.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Purpose==
This book is intended to be a comprehensive study guide to assist the test taker in passing the Element 2 (Technician Class) exam in the United States of America.  The authorship of the exams is entrusted to a committee within the National Conference of Volunteer Examiner Coordinators and the exam is provided on their website as a public document, available for all to prepare for.  Due to the dynamic nature of cutting edge technologies and current social trends, the exams are re-authored every four years.  The exam that is the purpose of this book is the one you will be taking after July 1, 2014 and before June 30, 2018.
==Introduction==
For nearly 100 years, amateur radio has been active in an uninterrupted state in the United States and a key innovator to many technologies seen as commonplace.  Phone patches predated cell phones, packet radio preceded SMS messages and most importantly, these innovations were considered 'open source', long before 'open source' became the cool buzzword of the day.

For anybody interesting in experiential learning by being on the air or even building their own radio, this exam is a great starting point.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
&lt;br&gt;
'''&quot;Amateur Radio Service: purpose and permissible use of the Amateur Radio Service; operator/primary station license grant; where FCC rules are codified; basis and purpose of FCC rules; meanings of basic terms used in FCC rules; interference; spectrum management.&quot;'''


This section deals with the hierarchy that exists between the FCC (Federal Communications Commission), the ITU (International Telecommunication Union) and non-profit organizations such as the NCVEC (National Conference on Volunteer Examiner Coordinators), the ARRL (Amateur Radio Relay League) and local radio organizations.

Some of these organizations, or sometimes individuals own a repeater.  This is a device that listens on one frequency and simultaneously transmits the data on a separate frequency.  On rare occasions, the repeater will transmit onto a different band, but usually they are within the same band and the input and output frequencies differ by a standardized offset.  Repeaters allow two operators to communicate in situations where a station-to-station communication isn't possible.  The frequencies of a repeater are suggested by a Frequency Coordinator that manages over a loosely defined geographical area.  Frequency Coordinators are determined as a consensus of repeater operators over a given area, so this typically isn't a paid position nor part of any federal office.

There are close relationships between federal disaster response and emergency preparedness agencies and your local and national amateur radio organizations.  At times, your services may be requested for a drill or an actual event.  Your participation is voluntary and greatly appreciated.  However, amateur radio is '''never''' enlisted to participate in political or military operations as those would harm the international reputation as an impartial social movement within a larger global society of amateur radio operators. 

There have been occasions, such as World War I, where amateur radio privileges were suspended during the war effort.  The suspension was enforced such that radios were actually required to be dismantled.  There could be a possibility that this can occur again in the future.

The ITU is an organization within the United Nations that helps member nations develop a coherent band plan amongst neighboring nations as well as allocate communications satellite orbits.  Policies created by the FCC are done in very close cooperation with the ITU to ensure compliance is feasible for all potentially impacted parties.

Many of the policies of the FCC lie within CFR 47.  The part relating to ham radio is Part 97.  Other uses of radio spectrum, such as WiFi devices, commercial broadcast, FRS (family radio service), Citizen Radio Service or low power ISM devices are covered in different parts.  Part 15, for example, regulates practically all appliances sold in the United States and ensures that they don't unintentionally radiate excessive interference onto the radio spectrum.  The value we provide is codified into Part 97.1 as five principles of amateur radio service.

* &quot;Recognition and enhancement of the value of the amateur service to the public as a voluntary noncommercial communication service, particularly with respect to providing emergency communications.&quot;
* &quot;Continuation and extension of the amateur’s proven ability to contribute to the advancement of the radio art.&quot;
* &quot;Encouragement and improvement of the amateur service through rules which provide for advancing skills in both the communication and technical phases of the art.&quot;
* &quot;Expansion of the existing res- ervoir within the amateur radio service of trained operators, technicians, and electronics experts.&quot;
* &quot;Continuation and extension of the amateur’s unique ability to enhance international goodwill.&quot;

Another section of the code worth being aware of is 97.3.  Those are definitions of technical terms used within the legal document.  A number of questions refer to §97.3

==The Question Pool==
===Question 1===
;Which of the following is a purpose of the Amateur Radio Service as stated in the FCC rules and regulations?
:A. Providing personal radio communications for as many citizens as possible
:B. Providing communications for international non-profit organizations
:C. Advancing skills in the technical and communication phases of the radio art
:D. All of these choices are correct
&lt;br&gt;
Remember the phrase &quot;radio art&quot;?  It is a direct quote from the second of the Five Principles listed in §97.1(b).  '''The correct answer is C'''.  Choices A, B and D are incorrect because there are separate and much more exclusive license classes for commercial and mass communication.
===Question 2===
;Which agency regulates and enforces the rules for the Amateur Radio Service in the United States?
:A. FEMA
:B. The ITU
:C. The FCC
:D. Homeland Security
&lt;br&gt;
'''The correct answer is C'''.  The FCC is responsible for enforcement of the proper usage of the radio spectrum.  While the FCC is bound by certain agreements made with the ITU, we as operators, must answer directly to the FCC regarding proper and compliant use of our skills and equipment within the United States.  In times of emergency, FEMA and Homeland Security may request our assistance, but that is voluntary and has no consequence with enforcement from the FCC.
===Question 3===
;Which part of the FCC regulations contains the rules governing the Amateur Radio Service?
:A. Part 73
:B. Part 95
:C. Part 90
:D. Part 97
&lt;br&gt;
Title 47 CFR Part 73 is for radio and television broadcast rules.  Part 95 regards GMRS and other personal radio devices and 90 regards Land Mobile Service.  Part 97 is the only one that concerns directly to amateur radio.  '''D is the correct answer.'''

===Question 4===
;Which of the following meets the FCC definition of harmful interference?
:A. Radio transmissions that annoy users of a repeater
:B. Unwanted radio transmissions that cause costly harm to radio station apparatus
:C. That which seriously degrades, obstructs, or repeatedly interrupts a radio communication service operating in accordance with the Radio Regulations
:D. Static from lightning storms
&lt;br&gt;
Reference to §97.3.(a)(23).  Harmful interference is a malicious signal that degrades legitimately generated signals.  This isn't necessarily deliberate, but can sometimes be generated unintentionally.  It is our responsibility to immediately mitigate such interference when we become aware that we are causing it.  Answer B is incorrect because the vast majority of harmful interference will do no harm to equipment.  Answer D is incorrect because acts of God are unavoidable forms of interference. Answer A is incorrect because users of repeaters will inevitably become annoyed over something, but they seldom escalate to legal consequences.

'''The correct answer is C.'''

===Question 5===
;Which of the following is a purpose of the Amateur Radio Service rules and regulations as defined by the FCC?
:A. Enhancing international goodwill
:B. Providing inexpensive communication for local emergency organizations
:C. Training of operators in military radio operating procedures
:D. All of these choices are correct
&lt;br&gt;
Reference to §97.1(e).  Amateur radio is rooted in humanitarian beliefs.  We are on the air to share our idea and our experiences with others around the world.  '''The correct answer is A.'''  It is true that we do provide services to emergency organizations, but that social responsibility is not codified in law.  Amateur radio is not directly involved with political or military operations and that separation is essential helps us remain credible as an impartial society in the global community.
===Question 6===
;Which of the following services are protected from interference by amateur signals under all circumstances?
:A. Citizens Radio Service
:B. Broadcast Service
:C. Land Mobile Radio Service
:D. Radionavigation Service
&lt;br&gt;
Reference to §97.101(d) and §97.303 (o)(2).  '''The answer is D'''.  Radionavigation, such as VOR stations or aircraft navigational beacons are novelty to listen to, but these are mission critical applications that are not to be interfered with.  They are used by international and military organizations and civilian purposes for aircraft, often times as a primary means of navigation.  It's ideal to not interfere with the other choices either.  Make certain to observe the output power limitations when transmitting using Citizen Radio Service as your transmitter may have a higher capability than is permitted and people with compliant radios will not be able to engage in communication with you due to their lower power.
===Question 7===
;What is the FCC Part 97 definition of telemetry?
:A. An information bulletin issued by the FCC
:B. A one-way transmission to initiate, modify or terminate functions of a device at a distance
:C. A one-way transmission of measurements at a distance from the measuring instrument
:D. An information bulletin from a VEC
&lt;br&gt;
Reference to §97.3(a)(46).  Telemetry is used in radio navigation.  The speed of radio signals is very well defined as proportional to the speed of light by an exact constant.  By measuring the time delay of a signal's propagation through the atmosphere, the distance from a transmitter site can be found to a high degree of accuracy.  Such systems include GPS, DME or Loran (which is no longer used in the United States).  '''The correct answer is C.'''  Information bulletins are typically announced at scheduled intervals during repeater 'nets', or by conventional means such as mail, e-mail or http.  Telecommands are often sent to equipment wirelessly, but that isn't telemetry, B is also incorrect.
===Question 8===
;Which of the following entities recommends transmit/receive channels and other parameters for auxiliary and repeater stations?
:A. Frequency Spectrum Manager
:B. Frequency Coordinator
:C. FCC Regional Field Office
:D. International Telecommunications Union
&lt;br&gt;
The frequency coordinator selects appropriate frequencies for new repeaters to minimize interference.  Sometimes this person may make recommendations for the technical setup of the station.  '''The correct answer is B.'''  The ITU is not concerned with repeater usage in the United States; they interact more directly with the FCC.  FCC field offices would rather not be distracted by frequency recommendations for new repeaters.  Frequency Spectrum Manager is not a formal title in any prominent organization; answer A is a false lead.

===Question 9===
;Who selects a Frequency Coordinator?
:A. The FCC Office of Spectrum Management and Coordination Policy
:B. The local chapter of the Office of National Council of Independent Frequency Coordinators
:C. Amateur operators in a local or regional area whose stations are eligible to be auxiliary or repeater stations
:D. FCC Regional Field Office
&lt;br&gt;
Reference to §97.3(a)(22).  Amateur radio service is self-managed and is fairly autonomous under FCC control.  The FCC doesn't have the time, resources or interest in managing repeater operation.  So for that, answers A and D are eliminated.  The NFCC doesn't select a frequency coordinator, so B is eliminated as well.  The local amateur operators in a region where the frequency allocations provide a direct impact are the ones whom decide on the title.  '''The correct answer is C.'''
===Question 10===
;What is the FCC Part 97 definition of an amateur station?
:A. A station in the Amateur Radio Service consisting of the apparatus necessary for carrying on radio communications
:B. A building where Amateur Radio receivers, transmitters, and RF power amplifiers are installed
:C. Any radio station operated by a non-professional
:D. Any radio station for hobby use
&lt;br&gt;
Reference to §97.3(a)(5).  '''The correct answer is A.'''  The rule deals directly with the equipment and the operators.  The structures that house the equipment are not codified, so B is incorrect.  C  and D are incorrect because there are limitations to the type of station the non-professional is allowed to use, even if it's just a hobby.
===Question 11===
;When is willful interference to other amateur radio stations permitted?
:A. Only if the station being interfered with is expressing extreme religious or political views
:B. At no time
:C. Only during a contest
:D. At any time, amateurs are not protected from willful interference
&lt;br&gt;
Reference to §97.101(d).  Never deliberately interfere with another signal.  '''The answer is B.'''  If you are listening to a station with extreme religious or political views, the best strategy is to ignore them and change frequency.  Chances are you won't be able to have a meaningful conversation with them, but do not interfere.  Deliberately interfere during a contest, and you will learn a difficult lesson of the consequences of malicious interference.
===Question 12===
;Which of the following is a permissible use of the Amateur Radio Service?
:A. Broadcasting music and videos to friends
:B. Providing a way for amateur radio operators to earn additional income by using their stations to pass messages
:C. Providing low-cost communications for start-up businesses
:D. Allowing a person to conduct radio experiments and to communicate with other licensed hams around the world
&lt;br&gt;
You can't broadcast music outside exceptionally rare instances.  You can't broadcast for pay or profit. You can't be involved with commerce.  Even ordering pizza using an amateur radio phone patch is edgy to some people.  But you can supervise non-licenced people performing radio experiments using your FCC call sign.  Anybody can transmit on a ham band if they are supervised and you have ultimate control in their ability to use your equipment.  '''The correct answer is D.'''
===Question 13===
;What is the FCC Part 97 definition of telecommand?
:A. An instruction bulletin issued by the FCC
:B. A one-way radio transmission of measurements at a distance from the measuring instrument
:C. A one-way transmission to initiate, modify or terminate functions of a device at a distance
:D. An instruction from a VEC
&lt;br&gt;
Reference to 97.3(a)(45).  If you need to read the definitions of many of the technologies within amateur radio, section 97.3 is a list of definitions. A telecommand (the 43rd such definition) is a transmission that modifies operations of equipment at a remote site.  Often times, DTMF (touch tones) are used to link repeaters, initiate telephone patches or even change frequencies of a repeater.  '''The answer is C.''' If you refer to a FCC document as a telecommand, prepare to be laughed at.  Answer B is actually referring to telemetry.  Telemetry is the use of radio signals to measure distance from a transmitter.   VEC's (Volunteer Examiner Coordinator) is a person whom is involved with issuing this test in a proctored environment.
===Question 14===
;What must you do if you are operating on the 23 cm band and learn that you are interfering with a radiolocation station outside the United States?
:A. Stop operating or take steps to eliminate the harmful interference
:B. Nothing, because this band is allocated exclusively to the amateur service
:C. Establish contact with the radiolocation station and ask them to change frequency
:D. Change to CW mode, because this would not likely cause interference
&lt;br&gt;
Reference to 97.303(d).  Your first priority is to immediately eliminate the interference.  '''The correct answer is A.'''  Sometimes, you may be transmitting within your band, but a harmonic of your transmission may be outside the band plan and interfering with other services, so B is not acceptable.  The mode of communication does not affect propagation or harmonics greatly, so using CW isn't going to offer much help and with that, choice D is eliminated.  It is unreasonable to ask the other agency to change frequency because often times, the frequency allocation is granted through international treaties.</text>

:'''Abstract''' - We discuss concepts for human missions to Mars based on the availability of 21st century knowledge and technologies and modern business methods.  The technologies include advanced computers, communications, automation, robotics, electric propulsion, and use of in-space resources.  The business methods include public/private partnerships and incentive prizes as alternatives to conventional government funding/contractor-built methods.


Early mission concepts for visiting Mars, such as [http://launiusr.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/mars_high.jpg Von Braun 1954], made a couple of implicit assumptions.  These are that everything is launched and supplied from Earth, and that the trip is made non-stop between the planets.  Over fifty years later, NASA [http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/leag2007/presentations/20071001.drake.pdf Mars Mission Concepts] have not evolved much past this point.  These assumptions drive a high mission cost, and thus actual attempts to reach Mars have stalled because they are unaffordable.

We propose a new approach which incorporates knowledge and technologies developed in the last half century, and some new technology which is within reasonable reach in the short term.  We also propose changing the traditional government-funded/contractor-built business method, because it has no incentive for either side to finish promptly or keep costs under control.  In fact, it has led to numerous examples of tacit underestimation of costs to get initial funding approval, followed by incremental cost growth as reality sets in.</text>

'''TinyScheme''' is a lightweight Scheme interpreter of a subset of the R&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;RS standard. It is meant to be used as an embedded scripting interpreter for other programs. Much of the functionality in TinyScheme is included conditionally, to allow developers to balance features and size/footprint.

TinyScheme is used by GIMP starting with version 2.4, released in 2007.  GIMP previously used SIOD.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gimp.org/docs/script-fu-update.html |title=GIMP - Script-Fu Migration Guide |work=gimp.org |accessdate=November 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TinyScheme was used as the core of Direct Revenue's adware, making it the world's most widely distributed Scheme runtime.&lt;ref&gt;http://philosecurity.org/2009/01/12/interview-with-an-adware-author&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
In this section, there is a certain amount of memorization when it comes to usage of spectrum.  There are portions of the available spectrum that are reserved for certain modes.  Certain portions of the spectrum also have limit on data speed (faster data can have an exceptionally wide footprint in the spectrum).  These limitations are described in tables located in 97.301 and 97.305.

The usage of the words &quot;frequency&quot; and &quot;wavelength&quot; are used interchangeably and that is because they are two different words that describe the same thing.  It is only by chance that we dial a frequency as opposed to dialing a wavelength on a radio receiver.  The two domains are mathematical inverses of each other.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;{c\over f} =\lambda&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the speed of light which is rounded to &lt;math&gt;300,000,000&lt;/math&gt; meters per second.  The &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is the wavelength in meters.  The &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is frequency in Hertz, which is cycles per second.

Mathematically the units cancel out.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;{(m/sec)\over(1 cycle/sec)} = {m \over 1} = m&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

So the wavelength is in meters per 1 cycle, the length of one full oscillation of a radio wave as it travels at nearly the speed of light through the atmosphere.  This is important:  The wavelength is the length of a full oscillation of a radio signal as it travels at nearly the speed of light through the atmosphere.

Many radar installations fire incredibly short bursts of signal where, if it were visible like a laser beam in fog, for a very brief moment, you would be able to see the beginning, the end, as well as the dark regions in between these points where the signal intensity is zero, thus separating each individual wave.

Back to our test, here's a shortcut.  If we take our frequency in MHz (Megahertz is divided by a million) and the speed of light of &lt;math&gt;300&lt;/math&gt; million meters per second, we get a slightly simplified equation.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;{300 Mmeters/s \over f MHz} = \lambda&lt;/math&gt; meters&lt;/center&gt;

For example 146.200 Mhz is in the 2 meter band because &lt;math&gt;{300  \over  146.2} \approx 2&lt;/math&gt; meters.  Likewise 50 Mhz is the 6 meter band.

A number of these problems can be calculated instead of being memorized.  All you have to remember is the formula.  Consider these problems as 'freebies'.

==The Question Pool==
===Question 1===
;What is the ITU?
:A. An agency of the United States Department of Telecommunications Management
:B. A United Nations agency for information and communication technology issues
:C. An independent frequency coordination agency
:D. A department of the FCC
&lt;br&gt;
The ITU resides under the United Nations and they seek to create international agreements towards a band plan that satisfies each nations needs while also minimizing interference.  '''The correct answer is B.'''
===Question 2===
;Why are the frequency assignments for some U.S. Territories different from those in the 50 U.S. States?
:A. Some U. S. Territories are located in ITU regions other than region 2
:B. Territorial governments are allowed to select their own frequency allocations
:C. Territorial frequency allocations must also include those of adjacent countries
:D. Any territory that was in existence before the ratification of the Communications Act of 1934 is exempt from FCC frequency regulations
&lt;br&gt;
There are U.S. territories that do reside outside the ITU Region 2 of North America.  Those stations, despite having rules governed by the FCC, must comply with the ITU Region they are transmitting from.  Even places such as Hawaii that is Region 2, cannot engage in amateur conversation with stations located just west in Region 3 on certain frequencies.  '''The correct answer is A.'''
===Question 3===
;Which frequency is within the 6 meter band?
:A. 49.00 MHz
:B. 52.525 MHz
:C. 28.50 MHz
:D. 222.15 MHz
&lt;br&gt;
You can look this equivalency up in 97.301(a), but there is a mathematical explanation as well.  Frequency and Wavelength are mathematical inverses with each other.  The proportionality constant is 300,000,000.  300,000,000 / x = 6 as our equation would have 50,000,000 as our result.  52.525 MHz is the closest number.  '''The correct answer is B.'''

===Question 4===
;Which amateur band are you using when your station is transmitting on 146.52 MHz?
:A. 2 meter band
:B. 20 meter band
:C. 14 meter band
:D. 6 meter band
&lt;br&gt;
You can look up the band plan in 97.301(a).  (Section (a) is the technician privileges.) There is a different approach to get close to the same answer.  Frequency in Hertz and wavelength in meters are mathematical inverses of each other.  The constant or proportionality is 300,000,000 which is the speed of light in meters per second.  300,000,000/146,520,000 is approximately equal to 2 meters.  '''The correct answer is A.'''
===Question 5===
;Which 70 cm frequency is authorized to a Technician Class license holder operating in ITU Region 2?
:A. 53.350 MHz
:B. 146.520 MHz
:C. 443.350 MHz
:D. 222.520 MHz
&lt;br&gt;
In 97.301(a), the center column being ITU Region 2, the 70 cm band is bounded from 420 to 450 MHz.  Only 443.350 is within this boundary.  '''The correct answer is C.'''
===Question 6===
;Which 23 cm frequency is authorized to a Technician Class licensee?
:A. 2315 MHz
:B. 1296 MHz
:C. 3390 MHz
:D. 146.52 MHz
&lt;br&gt;
This is codified in 97.301(a).  In that chart, it doesn't matter which ITU region you are in, the allocation is the same.  The 23 cm band is described as 1240 to 1300 MHz.  Of the four choices, only 1296 is within that range.  '''The correct answer is B.'''
===Question 7===
;What amateur band are you using if you are transmitting on 223.50 MHz?
:A. 15 meter band
:B. 10 meter band
:C. 2 meter band
:D. 1.25 meter band
&lt;br&gt;
Aside from looking up the equivalency in 97.301(a), you can convert frequency to wavelength with a division:  c/f=lambda where c=300,000,000m/s which is the speed of light, f is the frequency in Hertz (cycles for second) and lambda is the wavelength in meters.  300/224 is closest to 1.25.  '''The answer is D.'''
===Question 8===
;Which of the following is a result of the fact that the amateur service is secondary in some portions of the 70 cm band?
:A. U.S. amateurs may find non-amateur stations in the bands, and must avoid interfering with them
:B. U.S. amateurs must give foreign amateur stations priority in those portions
:C. International communications are not permitted on 70 cm
:D. Digital transmissions are not permitted on 70 cm
&lt;br&gt;
Reference to 97.303.  There is overlap in portions of the band plan.  Some organization have priority use of some frequencies and we, as hobbyists, should yield to their communication needs.  '''The correct answer is A.'''  Foreign stations are also secondary and may also be expected to yield based on their nation's international agreements.
===Question 9===
;Why should you not set your transmit frequency to be exactly at the edge of an amateur band or sub-band?
:A. To allow for calibration error in the transmitter frequency display
:B. So that modulation sidebands do not extend beyond the band edge
:C. To allow for transmitter frequency drift
:D. All of these choices are correct
&lt;br&gt;
Reference to 97.101(a) and 97.301(a-e).  '''The correct answer is D.'''
===Question 10===
;Which of the bands above 30 MHz that are available to Technician Class operators have mode-restricted sub-bands?
:A. The 6 meter, 2 meter, and 70 cm bands
:B. The 2 meter and 13 cm bands
:C. The 6 meter, 2 meter, and 1.25 meter bands
:D. The 2 meter and 70 cm bands
&lt;br&gt;
Reference to 97.301(e) and 97.305(c).  '''The correct answer is C.'''
===Question 11===
;What emission modes are permitted in the mode-restricted sub-bands at 50.0 to 50.1 MHz and 144.0 to 144.1 MHz?
:A. CW only
:B. CW and RTTY
:C. SSB only
:D. CW and SSB
&lt;br&gt;
Reference to 97.301(a) and 97.305(a)(c).  '''The correct answer is A.'''
===Question 12===
;Why are frequency assignments for U.S. stations operating maritime mobile not the same everywhere in the world?
:A. Amateur maritime mobile stations in international waters must conform to the frequency assignments of the country nearest to their vessel
:B. Amateur frequency assignments can vary among the three ITU regions
:C. Frequency assignments are determined by the captain of the vessel
:D. Amateur frequency assignments are different in each of the 90 ITU zones
&lt;br&gt;
Reference to 97.301.  The ITU coordinates to usage of spectrum across it's three regions.  Even though you are a citizen of a nation located primarily in Region 2, the operator is expected to comply with the band plan assigned to the location that he is transmitting from.  ''The correct answer is B.'''
===Question 13===
;Which emission may be used between 219 and 220 MHz?
:A. Spread spectrum
:B. Data
:C. SSB voice
:D. Fast-scan television
&lt;br&gt;
This question is one of those that requires a bit of memorization.  Let's take a look at the [http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=0bacc359b0c397e812f88a48489c6b66&amp;node=47:5.0.1.1.6.4.159.3&amp;rgn=div8|47 CFR 97.305(c)] where the usage of the bands are assigned.  The section of the band between 219 and 220 is reserved for data.  So if you want to listen or communicate in this medium, you odds may be pretty good here.  '''The correct answer is B.'''   Spread spectrum is the vague answer that doesn't refer to any mode is particular.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Nationalism is a belief, creed or political ideology that involves an individual identifying with, or becoming attached to, one's nation. Nationalism involves national identity, by contrast with the related construct of patriotism, which involves the social conditioning and personal behaviors that support a state's decisions and actions.

From a psychological perspective, nationalism (national attachment) is distinct from other types of attachment, for example, attachment to a religion or a romantic partner. The desire for interpersonal attachment, or the need to belong, is one of the most fundamental human motivations. Like any attachment, nationalism can become dysfunctional if excessively applied.

From a political or sociological perspective, there are two main perspectives on the origins and basis of nationalism. One is the primordialist perspective that describes nationalism as a reflection of the ancient and perceived evolutionary tendency of humans to organize into distinct groupings based on an affinity of birth. The other is the modernist perspective that describes nationalism as a recent phenomenon that requires the structural conditions of modern society in order to exist.

There are various definitions for what constitutes a nation, however, which leads to several different strands of nationalism. It can be a belief that citizenship in a state should be limited to one ethnic, cultural, religious, or identity group, or that multinationality in a single state should necessarily comprise the right to express and exercise national identity even by minorities. The adoption of national identity in terms of historical development has commonly been the result of a response by influential groups unsatisfied with traditional identities due to inconsistency between their defined social order and the experience of that social order by its members, resulting in a situation of anomie that nationalists seek to resolve. This anomie results in a society or societies reinterpreting identity, retaining elements that are deemed acceptable and removing elements deemed unacceptable, in order to create a unified community. This development may be the result of internal structural issues or the result of resentment by an existing group or groups towards other communities, especially foreign powers that are or are deemed to be controlling them.
National flags, national anthems and other symbols of national identity are commonly considered highly important symbols of the national community.

The nation state is a state that self-identifies as deriving its political legitimacy from serving as a sovereign entity for a nation as a sovereign territorial unit. The state is a political and geopolitical entity, while the nation is a cultural and/or ethnic one; the term &quot;nation state&quot; implies that the two coincide geographically. Nation state formation took place at different times in different parts of the world, but has become the dominant form of state organization.

The concept and actuality of the nation state can be compared and contrasted with that of the multinational state, city state, empire, confederation, and other state forms with which it may overlap. The key distinction from the other forms is the identification of a people with a polity.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Nuclear stability is linked to its number of nucleons (neutrons and protons). The nucleons interact with each other through the strong nuclear force, this must overcome the electrostatic repulsion between the protons to make the nucleus stable. When the electrostatic repulsion exceeds the strong force the nucleus is now unstable and will then change its nucleons causing radioactive decay. When the graph of number of neutrons (N) against protons (Z) is drawn, and all the stable istopes are plotted on it, there is quite a clear correlation between N and Z. 


Initially stable isotopes are found on the line N=Z but soon the number of neutrons needed to keep the nucleus stable becomes larger than the number of protons and the stable isotopes curve away from N=Z. This is because as the nuclear radius increases a greater strong force is required to keep it stable but adding more protons will only increase electrostatic repulsion and so the number of neutrons becomes more than that of protons.



Radioactive decay occurs because a nuclei is unstable. It emits alpha particles, beta particles or gamma rays to become more stable.

&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Z&lt;/sub&gt;X

Z is the proton number (sometimes called atomic number) it is the number or protons in the nucleus.

A is the nucleon number (some times called mass number) it is the total number of protons AND neutrons in the nucleus.

N is the number of neutrons   =   A – Z

For light isotopes (up to Z=20) the stable nuclei have equal numbers of protons and neutrons
for heavier nuclei to be stable they need to have more neutrons than protons.

* Nuclei with too many protons become more stable by emitting a beta+ (b+) particle when a proton converts into a neutron 

* Nuclei with too few protons are to the left of the stability line and become more stable by emitting a beta- (b-)particle when a neutron converts into a proton

      <text xml:space="preserve">Radioactive decay is when an unstable nucleus decays in a random manner.

In theory, there is no end to the life of a radioactive substance (the time it takes before the activity reaches zero)therefore the quantity used for dealing with the life of radioactive substances is the half life. Half life is defined as the time taken for the activity of the sample to halve. The half life remains the same throughout the life of the sample. Each type of element has a distinct half life, &lt;math&gt;t_{\frac{1}{2}}&lt;/math&gt;. As the activity of the sample is proportional to the number of radioactve nuclides present the half time can also be calculated by the time taken for half of the radioactive nuclides in the sample to decay.

If you plot a graph of the natural logarithm of N (the number of radioactive nuclides) against time you will see that there is a linear relationship between the two. The steeper the gradient the more quickly the substance will decay which means it has a shorter half life. Half life is proportional to &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt; 

= Equations = 
&lt;math&gt;\frac{\Delta N} {\Delta t} = -\lambda N&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;N = N_0 e^{-\lambda t}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;t_{\frac{1}{2}} =\frac{ln2}{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;A = \lambda N&lt;/math&gt;


= Derivations of equations  =

== Deriving &lt;math&gt;N = N_0 e^{-\lambda t}&lt;/math&gt; ==

We can use this differential equation to derive an equation for N.

&lt;math&gt;\frac{dN}{dt} = -\lambda N&lt;/math&gt;

Separating and integrating:

&lt;math&gt;\int{ \frac{1}{N}} dN = \int{ -\lambda} dt &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;ln(N) = -\lambda t +c&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;N = N_0 e^{-\lambda t}&lt;/math&gt;

== Deriving &lt;math&gt;t_{1/2} = \frac {ln2}{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt; ==

Half life is the time taken for half of the atoms that were originally present in the sample to have decayed.

&lt;math&gt;N_{(t)} = N_0 e^{-\lambda t}&lt;/math&gt;

If we replace &lt;math&gt;N_0&lt;/math&gt; with 1, &lt;math&gt;N_t&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;, and t with &lt;math&gt;t_{\frac{1}{2}}&lt;/math&gt; we get:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2} = e^{-\lambda t_{\frac{1}{2}}}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;-\lambda t_{\frac{1}{2}} = ln{\frac{1}{2}}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;t_{\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{ln2}{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt;

If you wanted to know the &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{n}&lt;/math&gt; of a substance, you can replace the two with a 'n'

&lt;math&gt;t_\frac{1}{n} = \frac {ln (n)} {\lambda}&lt;/math&gt;

      <comment>Edited number of alpha particles deflected by more than 90 degrees. Original stated 1/1000 when it was 1/10000</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">When Ernest Rutherford first proposed the nuclear model of the atom in '''1911''',it enabled us to deduce the possible size for the atom. In Rutherford's experiment he fired a narrow beam of alpha particles ''(all with equal quantities of kinetic energy)'' in a vacuum to probe the structure of the atom. A '''thin strip of metal foil''' was placed in the path of the beam. Whilst most of the particles passed straight through the foil with very little or no deflection, approximately 1 in 10000 alpha particles were deflected by more than 90 degrees. The foil itself had to be very thin otherwise the particles could have been deflected more than once.

For this single scattering by a foil strip that has 'n' layers of atoms, the probability that an alpha particle is deflected by a given atom is therefore around 1 in 10000n. This probability does however depend on the efective area of cross-section of the nucleus to that of the atom. As a result, we can deduce the following...

'''For a nucleus of diameter, 'd', in an atom of diameter, 'D', the area ratio is equal to;'''

'''&lt;math&gt;\frac{\frac{1}{4}\pi d^2}{\frac{1}{4}\pi D^2}&lt;/math&gt;'''

'''Therefore...'''

'''&lt;math&gt;d^2=\frac{D^2}{10000n}&lt;/math&gt;'''

A standard value of ''&lt;math&gt;n=10^4&lt;/math&gt;'' gives ''&lt;math&gt;d=\frac{D}{10000}&lt;/math&gt;''

'''&lt;u&gt;Electron scattering&lt;/u&gt;'''

This is a good way to estimate the size of a nucleus but a more accurate way of measuring the nucleus is electron scattering. In electron scattering, electrons are fired in a beam at a sheet of the target material. The de Broglie wavelength of an electron is about '''10&lt;sup&gt;-15&lt;/sup&gt;m'''. This means they are diffracted by the target material with the following relationship: 0.61λ/R=sinθ_min

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Charge Couple Device ==

- A CCD is a silicon chip divided into picture elements (pixels)

- Incident photons cause electron to be released 

- The number of electron liberated is proportional to the intensity of light

- These electrons are trapped in 'potential well' in the CCD

- An electron pattern is built up which is identical to the image formed on the CCD

- When exposure is complete, the charge is processed to give an image

- Quantum efficiency of a pixel is greater than 70%

      <text xml:space="preserve">In 1897, J.J Thompson discovered the electron and effectively suggested that the atom is divisible. He suggested the 'plum-pudding' model,in which the main body of the atom is a distribution of positive charge, and the electrons are embedded in this, held by electrostatic forces. The whole atom is neutral, and ions form when electrons are added or removed. 

Radioactivity had already been discovered, and Ernest Rutherford used alpha particles as probes to investigate the atom. Two of his students, Geiger and Marsden, fired a thin parallel beam of alpha particles at a thin piece of gold foil.

|type=&quot;[]&quot;}
+ groups dominated by brilliance don't document well
+ groups without technical brilliance have successfully identified specialty roles
+ groups have figured out how document failure
- productivity can be measured in quantity of documentation

{Why can engineering be described as successful when merely documenting failure?
|type=&quot;[]&quot;}
+ Between group evolution involves learning from other group's failures
+ Starting over from scratch should be an option, not standard operating procedure
+ Must leverage and learn from previous teams failures
- Clients, venture capitalists and executives expect engineers to fail technically
- Clients, venture capitalists and executives will pay for failure

{Why grade documentation rather than technical success?
|type=&quot;[]&quot;}
+ Engineers document the path taken towards success, this requires documenting failure.
- The rest of the world only documents success.
- Deciding what is success and failure when projects are open ended leads to arguments
- It is too hard to grade individuals uniquely within a team without a paper trail

{If engineers are only paid if things work, then why focus on documenting failure?
|type=&quot;[]&quot;}
+ No success is achieved without failure, failure inspires success, success inspires competition
+ Quality control, continuous improvement, new patents benefit from failure documentation
+ Every success involves the creation of a new design process and documentation organization
+ Every success involves new within group and between group dynamics

{What motivates business managers, project managers, and clients to demand documentation?
|type=&quot;[]&quot;}
- An understanding of the importance of documenting failure
+ The need to be free from dependence on isolated brilliant engineers

+ what classes, companies develop in response to meetings, lectures and communication from management
+ documentation that a group develops
+ something archetypal related to Jungian psychology
- something associated with in-group evolution
+ something associated with between group evolution

{Why is the group mind better captured by failure documentation?
|type=&quot;[]&quot;}
+ success seduces, blinds and limits documentation ... witness the frustration of internet diy tutorials
- reverse engineering technical failure is easy 
+ repeated forward engineering failure is attractive because along the way, one finds solutions
+ a clarity develops, more detail is exposed when documenting failure 
+ failure documentation enables continuation of between group evolution better than demo success
- the successful demo documents itself, thus only failures need to be documented
- engineering teaches how to capture physical world context from a demo success

{What are the characteristics of a brilliant individual within a team?
|type=&quot;[]&quot;}
+ announces brilliance
+ talks with confidence even when corrected
+ makes everyone else watch and listen

+ slow down by asking questions and documenting, taking pictures and video
- eliminating brilliance with in the group
- ignoring the person, letting them do their own thing
- competing with the brilliance 

{Why is it said that &quot;A&quot; students end up working for &quot;C&quot; students?
|type=&quot;[]&quot;}
+ A students become professors, C students end up in business that hires professors
+ C students are usually better at building, valuing and leveraging the group mind
- C students usually fail at being engineers and become managers
- A students usually become &quot;hard to work with&quot; and end up changing jobs more often
+ C students are better at creating between group evolution
+ C students understand when it is necessary to find an A student to jump start between group evolution

{When a team member disappears and stops informal communication, what should you do?
|type=&quot;[]&quot;}
- assume the team mate doesn't like anyone on the team

{&quot;Absorbing&quot; is something that a group does wrong. What are the characteristics of absorbing?
|type=&quot;[]&quot;}
+ team takes pride in getting the job done, with out dealing with problem behavior
+ everyone wants to be friends first rather than bond over working hard
+ friendship and being nice is defined as acting in a self-sacrificing manner
- absorbing good rather than bad
+ dysfunctional teams ... teams that don't get anything done or can not create tasks for themselves

{Dealing with a hitch hiker almost always ends in talking to your instructor. But involving your instructor is dangerous because:
|type=&quot;[]&quot;}
+ professor distracted may not take the time to figure out the details and instead label everyone dysfunctional
+ professors usually don't want to be put in the middle of dysfunction
+ feelings and emotions in the absence of facts are hard to respond to with action

+ put them on a team of one
+ team up with the student themselves to see behavior first hand
+ kick them off the team and wait force them to work their way onto a new team/project
- ask them to drop the class

{What are some facts about a hitch hiker/couch potato that the professor will respond to?
|type=&quot;[]&quot;}
+ left meetings (make a list) without everyone clearly knowing what task they are going to do
+ claimed to be (make a list of when) &quot;too busy (forcing others to help him prioritize)
+ takes up all available time/space and without helping negotiate tasks
+ leaves meeting prematurely, without knowing what everyone else is doing (make a list when)
+ doesn't respond to agreed upon communication methods (make a list of emergency communication protocol violation)
+ summarizes your work, presenting it as their own or &quot;we&quot; in weekly reports (point this out to the instructor)
+ writes their weekly report in 10 minutes before class
+ does someone else's task badly and then tries to confuse agreed upon tasks when confronted

{What will hitch hikers teach you about yourself?
|type=&quot;[]&quot;}
+ must stop trying to make others happy at my own expense
+ must find a stopping point even though you can visualize/feel doing better
+ don't live with the feeling of a long suffering martyr .. it generates no respect, just abuse
+ cooperation without participation in delegation or task acceptance means nothing
+ stop trying to fix people
+ set high expectations, don't reward the slightest contribution because it represents &quot;progress&quot;
+ loyalty is irrational
+ must let people fail so that the team can succeed
- communism has a place

{What are your chances of meeting a hitch hiker in engineering projects?
|type=&quot;[]&quot;}
+ high
- only in the work place
- high after 6 months of working together
- eventually can be sure one will meet a hitch hiker
 
{How is a couch potato different from a hitch hiker?
|type=&quot;[]&quot;}
+ doesn't argue, doesn't spread confusion, doesn't change the subject
+ accepts criticism and then begin to perform
+ will go along with the group consensus
+ can be guided to do reasonably good work

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Different book title ==

This book really needs to have a more descriptive title.  Single-word titles are almost always a problem, as they either show that the book has an ill-defined topic or fail to describe the topic.  Just for good measure, there's also a technical awkwardness because there is a [[Subject:Games]] with associated subject-category [[:Category:Games]], interfering with the most naturally expected name for the book-category.

Take a look at the info on starting a new book at [[Using Wikibooks]].  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 01:08, 23 January 2014 (UTC)
:What would be a better title? [[User:StudiesWorld|StudiesWorld]] ([[User talk:StudiesWorld|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/StudiesWorld|contribs]]) 21:36, 24 January 2014 (UTC)

:: The title depends on the ''scope''.  What topic is the book intended to cover?  One of the reasons an over-general ''title'' is bad is that it may be a symptom of an over-general ''scope''.  I'm not sure what you intend here, really.  If you're going to cover every game ever created, you need to have an ''angle'', an ''aspect'' of games that makes this a book rather than an encyclopedia.  We have entire books about some games, already; see [[Subject:Games]].

:: You might do a once-through of [[WB:WIW]], to get a feel for it, and there may be some good advice in [[Using Wikibooks]] (which is itself a featured book).

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Nouns - Namnordi==

The nouns have one of three genders, either masculine, feminine or neuter. (hankyn, hokyn, inkjekyn)
As an example we can use four words with different genders:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Masculine || Feminine 1 ||  Feminine 2 || Neuter
|- 
| dag|| sol || kyrkje || eple
|- 
| day|| sun || church || apple
|}
As you can see there's two categories for the feminine gender, the first one is a lot more common. Both are treated the same except in certain declensions of the word itself.

Now, what do we write when we want to say something like 'a day' or 'the day'?
Like in English 'a day', the indefinate article is ''before'' the word...

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|+ Indefinite articles
! Masculine || Feminine || Neuter
|- 
| ein|| ei || eit
|}

but with 'the day' we have to change the ''end of the word'' itself.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|+ Singular definite suffixes
! Masculine || Feminine 1 || Feminine 2 || Neuter
|- 
| -en|| -i || -a || -et
|}

Try it out for yourself! Match them with the words we have. Indefinite 'ein, ei and eit' being before the word, and definite '-en -i -a -et' being added to the end.
Keep in mind that the vowel E at the end of kyrkj e and epl e are replaced competely by the suffix.

{| class=&quot;wikitable collapsible&quot;
! Answers
|- 
| ein dag|| ei sol || ei kyrkje || eit eple
|- 
| dagen||  soli || kyrkja || eplet
|}

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;nonumtoc&quot;&gt;
__TOC__
&lt;/div&gt;


Hint: Be carefull and deactivate [[../COMMIT and ROLLBACK#AUTOCOMMIT|AUTOCOMMIT]].

The basic syntax and semantic of the INSERT command is described on the page [[../INSERT 1|INSERT]]. There are examples how to insert single rows with fixed values into a table. The present page describes how to dynamise the command by the use of subqueries.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

== Evaluate Values at Runtime ==
First, the values to be inserted may be evaluated in a relative strict way by reading the system time or other (quasi) constants.

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
-- Use the key word CURRENT_DATE to determine the actual day.
INSERT INTO person ( id,  firstname,        lastname,    date_of_birth,     place_of_birth, ssn,           weight)
VALUES             (101,  'Larry, no. 101', 'Goldstein', CURRENT_DATE,      'Dallas',       '078-05-1120', 95);
COMMIT;
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Next, the values to be inserted may be evaluated by a [[../SELECT: Subquery#Scalar_Value_Subquery|scalar value subquery]]. This means, that single values may be computed at runtime based on the rows of the same or another table.
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
-- Count the number of rows to determine the next ID. Caution: This handling of IDs is absolutly NOT recommended for real applications!
INSERT INTO person ( id,   firstname,        lastname,    date_of_birth,     place_of_birth, ssn,           weight)
VALUES             ((SELECT COUNT(*) + 1000 FROM person),  -- The scalar value subquery. It computes one single value, in this case the new ID.
-- VALUES          ((Select * FROM (SELECT COUNT(*) + 1000 FROM person) tmp), -- MySQL insists in using an intermediate table
                           'Larry, no. ?',   'Goldstein', CURRENT_DATE,      'Dallas',       '078-05-1120', 95);
COMMIT;
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

== Evaluate Rows at Runtime ==
Similar to the above shown evaluation of a single scalar value through a scalar value subquery one can use a [[../SELECT: Subquery#Table_Subquery|table subquery]] to get several rows and insert them into the specified table within one INSERT command. This version is able to insert thousands of rows within one single statement. In addition to its dynamic nature it saves all but one round-trips between the application and the DBMS and therefore is much faster than a lot of single row-based INSERTs.

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
-- The statement doubles the number of rows within the table. It omits in the table subquery the WHERE clause and therefore
-- it reads all existing rows. Caution: This handling of IDs is absolutly NOT recommended for real applications!
INSERT INTO person (id,          firstname, lastname, date_of_birth, place_of_birth, ssn, weight)
  SELECT            id + 1100,   firstname, lastname, date_of_birth, place_of_birth, ssn, weight
  FROM   person;
COMMIT;
&lt;/source&gt;
The syntax has change in such a way that the key word 'VALUES' with its list of values is replaced by a complete subquery (often named 'subselect') which starts with the key word 'SELECT'. Of course the number and type of the selected columns must correlate with the number and type of the columns of the specified column list behind the 'INSERT INTO' key word. Within the subquery the complete power of the SELECT statement may be used: JOIN, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY and especially other subqueries in a recursive manner. Therefore there is a wide range of use cases: create rows with increased version numbers, with  percentage increased salary, with the actual timestamp, fixed values from rows of the same or another table, ... .

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
-- The next two statements compute different weights depending on the old weight
INSERT INTO person (id,          firstname, lastname, date_of_birth, place_of_birth, ssn, weight)
  -- the subquery starts here
  SELECT            id + 1200,   firstname, lastname, date_of_birth, place_of_birth, ssn,
                    CASE WHEN weight &lt; 40 THEN weight + 10
                         ELSE                  weight +  5
                         END
  FROM   person
  WHERE  id &lt;= 10;                          -- only the original 10 rows from the example database
COMMIT;

-- The same semantic with a more complex syntax (to demonstrate the power of subselect)
INSERT INTO person (id,          firstname, lastname, date_of_birth, place_of_birth, ssn, weight)
  -- the first subquery starts here
  SELECT            id + 1300,   firstname, lastname, date_of_birth, place_of_birth, ssn,
                     -- here starts a subquery of the first subquery. The CASE construct evaluates different
                     -- weights depending on the old weight.
                    (SELECT CASE WHEN weight &lt; 40 THEN weight + 10
                                 ELSE                  weight +  5
                                 END
                     FROM   person ssq      -- alias for the table name in sub-subquery
                     WHERE  sq.id = ssq.id  -- link the rows together
                    )
  FROM   person sq                          -- alias for the table name in subquery
  WHERE  id &lt;= 10;                          -- only the original 10 rows from the example database
COMMIT;
&lt;/source&gt;

The technique shown at [[../Example_Database_Data#Grow_up]] which multiplies existing data, e.g. for testing purpose, is based on such table subqueries.
&lt;br /&gt;

== Clean up Your Database ==
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
DELETE FROM person WHERE id &gt; 100;
COMMIT;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Exercises ==
&lt;div style=background:gold&gt;
Insert a new person with id 1301, firstname 'Mr. Mean', lastname is the lowest lastname (in the sense of the character encoding, use min() function). Its weight is the average weight of all persons (use avg() function).
&lt;/div&gt;
{{ExerciseSolution|width=100%|text=
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
-- Two columns are computed during runtime
INSERT INTO person (id,   firstname,  lastname, weight)
VALUES             (1301,
                    'Mr. Mean',
                    (SELECT MIN(lastname) FROM person),
                    (SELECT AVG(weight)   FROM person)
-- the MySQL version with its intermediate tables
--                  (SELECT * FROM (SELECT MIN(lastname) FROM person) tmp1),
--                  (SELECT * FROM (SELECT AVG(weight)   FROM person) tmp2)
                   );
COMMIT;
-- Check your result
SELECT * FROM person WHERE id = 1301;
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

&lt;div style=background:gold&gt;
Insert one additional person per family (=lastname) with firstname 'An extraordinary family member', lastname is the family name. Incorporate only the rows from the original example database with id &lt;= 10.
&lt;/div&gt;
{{ExerciseSolution|width=100%|text=
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
-- Two columns are computed during runtime. The number of involved rows is delimited by the WHERE clause.
INSERT INTO person (id,   firstname,  lastname)
  -- here starts the subquery
  SELECT MAX(id) + 1310,  -- in this case the max() function works per group
         'An extraordinary family member',
         lastname
  FROM   person
  WHERE  id &lt;= 10
  GROUP BY lastname;
COMMIT;
-- Check your result
SELECT * FROM person WHERE id &gt; 1310;
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

&lt;div style=background:gold&gt;
Clean up your database.
&lt;/div&gt;
{{ExerciseSolution|width=100%|text=
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
DELETE FROM person WHERE id &gt; 1300;

==&lt;font size=&quot;5&quot; face=Garamond&gt;'''1.  What is a Seed Factory?'''&lt;/font&gt;==

A Seed Factory is a new kind of production system that may end material scarcity and bring about a better quality of life for everyone. It grows from a starter kit into a mature factory like a plant seed grows into a mature plant.  Living plants use local energy (sunlight) and local raw materials (soil, water, and air) to expand themselves.  Similarly a Seed Factory will use local energy (solar, wind, and other renewable sources) and local raw materials to expand itself.  It uses a combination of three ways to expand:


* Replication - making direct copies of the parts and machines in the starter kit,
* Diversification - making new parts and machines not in the original kit, and
* Scaling - making larger parts and machines than are in the starter kit.


By using local resources, computer-driven automation, and combining multiple production steps in a local area, Seed Factories should be low cost and efficient to operate.  Since they can make many of their own parts internally, they would also be low cost to install compared to conventional factories.  If a mature factory is able to produce more starter kits, the number of factories can grow to whatever level required to satisfy people's material needs.  This is especially helpful in parts of the world that lack basic needs.  Note that at current levels of technology, we don't expect to reach 100% automation or be able to make 100% of parts internally.  We expect we can reach high percentages of these, but still need some human labor, and some outside parts and materials.


We began the Seed Factory Project because we think automation and robotics is at a level where such factories are now possible.  The benefits to humanity are so large as to make the effort worthwhile.  Our goal is to develop the technology, build working prototypes, and demonstrate that self-expanding factories in fact work.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of China|China]] 

'''Chili oil''' is a common ingredient, garnish and condiment in the cuisines of China and Vietnam, both for the complex and spicy flavours it imparts as well as its rich, red colour. While available in jars at most large Asian markets, chili oil is cheap and easy to make at home in whatever quantity is desired. Variations in the recipe are as numerous as households in China, and experimentation is to be keenly encouraged. The recipe below is a chili oil suitable for most Chinese dishes; the simplest omit all ingredients but chili flakes and oil.  

==Uses==
This oil is popularly used as a topping for [[Cookbook:Pho|Pho]] or any clear soup, dry noodle dishes and as a sauce for dim sum. Used in stir fries, it imparts a beautiful red colour to the cooking liquid as well as a distinctive aroma. It is absolutely essential to both Szechuan and Hunanese cuisines. 

==Ingredients==
*2 cups of a neutral oil 
*1/2 cup of chili flakes
*Two or three whole dried chiles (ancho, guajillo or thai all work beautifully, though the later creates a very spicy oil) 
*(Optional) 1 teaspoon of Szechuan peppercorn 
*1-2 teaspoons finely-ground, hot paprika 

==Procedure==
#If a smokey flavour is desired, toast the whole peppers and Szechuan peppercorn separately in a dry frying pan at medium-heat until you can smell them in the kitchen, stirring constantly (this takes only a few minutes). Chop the peppers if used (or cut them with scissors, or crush them in a mortar and pestle.) Set aside.
#Add your oil to a pot or saucepan on medium high-heat and allow it to heat until the viscosity of the oil is reduced and the surface shimmers.
#To the hot oil, carefully add the remaining ingredients and stir gently, lowering the heat if required to keep the oil below a simmer.
#Remove from heat once the chilis have blackened, and allow the oil to cool (the chilis will sink to the bottom).
#In higher-class restaurants in China and abroad, the oil is frequently strained or &quot;poured off&quot; of the layer of solids, which clarifies it somewhat; this step is optional. Many prefer the more rustic look (and texture!) of home-made oil, which will develop a darker colour over time from the solids below.

==Precautions==
*It is important to note that, contrary to popular belief, oil is not a preservative. The seasoned oils commonly available at markets have been treated with preservatives to allow them to remain stable for a prolonged period of time. The product should be kept in the fridge (where it will keep for months) or else used within a few days and kept covered. This is particularly important if one has used fresh garlic in the oil, as harmful pathogens found in the soil garlic grows in may grow and produce toxins in the oxygen-free environment created by the oil. Leaving the oil out at room temperature also increases the likelihood that the oil itself will go rancid, though this generally takes weeks. 

*Open a window or turn on a fan; if you burn the chili peppers the smoke will trigger a rather unpleasant coughing fit.

{{cuisine}}

'''Sichuan cuisine''' is a style of cuisine originating from the Sichuan Province in China's south-west. Prizing freshness and &quot;mala,&quot; or &quot;spicy, numbing&quot; heat, this region's cuisine is famously spicy. A number of Sichuanese dishes have been adapted for local tastes both within China and abroad, chief among these being [[Cookbook:Dan Dan noodle|Dan-Dan Noodle]], [[Cookbook:Mapo Doufu|Mapo Tofu]] and General Tso's Chicken.

==Characteristics==
Sichuan food is notable for its extensive use of chili-peppers as well as the berries of the mountain-ash plant, commonly called &quot;Szechuan pepper;&quot; the latter imparts a distinctive floral scent to most Sichuanese dishes while also providing a curious numbing sensation to the mouth. Additionally, foods preserved by drying, pickling and salting are exceedingly common. 

==Common Ingredients==
The vast majority of ingredients in Sichuan cooking are either readily available in most developed regions of the world or may be passably substituted for similar (and more common) variants. Beyond ingredients common to Chinese cooking in general (ginger, soya sauce, garlic, preserved black beans, rice, dried mushrooms, wheat-flour noodles, etc), other common ingredients include:
*Preserved, salted red chili peppers (commonly substituted in many Chinese restaurants for the widely-available garlic-chili sambal oelek) 
*Sichuan Peppercorns (no substitute is available)
*Chili Soy Bean Paste 
*[[Cookbook:Chili Oil|Chili oil]]

&lt;div class=&quot;nonumtoc&quot;&gt;
__TOC__
&lt;/div&gt;


Hint: Be carefull and deactivate [[../COMMIT and ROLLBACK#AUTOCOMMIT|AUTOCOMMIT]].

The page in hand offers two additional technics as an extention to the [[../UPDATE 1|UPDATE command]] shown on one of the previous pages:
:* Computing values, which are assigned to a column, at runtime.
:* Using complex subqueries as search conditions in the WHERE clause.
&lt;br /&gt;

== Evaluate Values at Runtime ==
The values which are assigned to a column may be computed by a correlated or non-correlated [[../SELECT: Subquery#Scalar Value Subquery|scalar value subquery]] on the involved table or another one. There are many use cases where this technic is utilised: Increase values linear or in percentage, use values from the same or another table, ... . The situation is similar to that described on the page about the [[../INSERT_2|INSERT command]]. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
-- The average weight of all persons is stored in column 'weight' of the first four persons.
UPDATE person SET
  -- dynamic computation of a value
  weight = (SELECT AVG(weight) FROM person)
  --  weight = (SELECT * FROM (SELECT AVG(weight) FROM person) tmp) -- MySQL insists on using an intermediate table
WHERE  id &lt; 5;

-- Check the result
SELECT * FROM person;

-- revoke the changes
ROLLBACK;
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

The subquery may use values of the row, which is actually updated. In the next example persons receive the mean weight of their family. To compute this mean weight, it is necessary to use the column 'lastname' of the actual processed row.

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
-- The subquery is a 'correlated' scalar value subquery.
UPDATE person p SET
  -- 'p.lastname' refers to the lastname of the actual row. The subquery bears all rows in mind, not only such with 'id &gt;= 5'.
  weight = (SELECT AVG(weight) FROM person sq WHERE sq.lastname = p.lastname)
  -- A hint to MySQL users: MySQL does not support UPDATE in combination with a correlated subquery
  -- to the same table. Different tables work. MySQL has a different, non-standard concept: multi-table update.
WHERE  id &gt;= 5;

-- Check the result
SELECT * FROM person;

-- revoke the changes
ROLLBACK;
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

== Subqueries in WHERE Clause ==
The WHERE clause determines which rows of a table are involved by the UPDATE command. This WHERE clause has the same syntax and semantic as the WHERE clause of the SELECT or DELETE command. It may contain complex combinations of boolean operators, predicates like ANY, ALL or EXISTS and - in a recusive manner - subquerys as described in [[../SELECT:_Subquery|SELECT: Subquery]]. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
-- UPDATE rows in the table 'person'. The decision which rows are affected is made by consulting the table 'contact'. 
-- In the example persons with more than 2 contact information are affected.
UPDATE person
SET    firstname = 'Has many buddies'
WHERE  id IN
  (SELECT person_id
   FROM   contact
   GROUP BY person_id
   HAVING count(*) &gt; 2
  );

-- Check the result
SELECT * FROM person;

-- revoke the changes
ROLLBACK;
&lt;/source&gt;
The command performs an UPDATE in the table ''person'', but the affected rows are identified by a subquery in table ''contact''. This technique of grabbing information from other tables offers very flexible strategies to modify the data.

It is no error to select 0 rows in the subquery. In this case the DBMS executes the UPDATE command as usual and throws no exception. (The same holds true for subqueries in SELECT or DELETE statements.)

== Exercises ==
&lt;div style=background:gold&gt;
Assign the firstname 'Short firstname' to all persons which have a firstname with less than 5 characters.
&lt;/div&gt;
{{ExerciseSolution|width=100%|text=
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
-- Hint: Some implementations use a different function name: length() or len().
UPDATE person
SET    firstname = 'Short firstname'
WHERE  character_length(firstname) &lt; 5;

-- Check the result
SELECT * FROM person;
 
-- revoke the changes
ROLLBACK;
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

&lt;div style=background:gold&gt;
Assign the firstname 'No hobby' to all persons which have no hobby.
&lt;/div&gt;
{{ExerciseSolution|width=100%|text=
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
UPDATE person
SET    firstname = 'No hobby'
WHERE  id NOT IN
  (SELECT person_id
   FROM   person_hobby
  );

-- Check the result
SELECT * FROM person;
 
-- revoke the changes
ROLLBACK;
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

&lt;div style=background:gold&gt;
Assign the firstname 'Sportsman' to all persons performing one of the hobbies 'Underwater Diving' or 'Yoga'.
&lt;/div&gt;
{{ExerciseSolution|width=100%|text=
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
UPDATE person
SET    firstname = 'Sportsman'
WHERE  id IN
  -- The subquery must join to the table 'hobby' to see their column 'hobbyname'.
  (SELECT ph.person_id
   FROM   person_hobby ph
   JOIN   hobby        h  ON ph.hobby_id = h.id
   AND    h.hobbyname IN ('Underwater Diving', 'Yoga')
  );

-- Check the result
SELECT * FROM person;
 
-- revoke the changes
ROLLBACK;
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Book lists ==
There was an inclusion of the Stack Overflow list: [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/388242/the-definitive-c-book-guide-and-list|The Definitive C++ Book Guide and List]. Without commenting on the content of the list I see no usefulness on adding collections of lists of books to this section as it provides no real content and can easily get out of hand (and diminish the usefulness of the direct mentions of works). Adding lists also prevents direct discussion regarding the quality of the work that is being included by the editing community in regards to it qualification to inclusion (like the discussion on the Stack Overflow site).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 09:37, 24 January 2014 (UTC)</text>

'''Welcome to my talk page'''. Here are some tips to help you communicate with me:
* Ideally, I would like to have any conversation continued on the page where it was started. If I have left a message on your talk page please do not reply here. I will have your talk page on watch and will note when you have replied.
* Add or respond to an existing conversation under the existing heading. 
:*Indent your comment when replying by using an appropriate number of colons &lt;tt&gt;':'&lt;/tt&gt;.
:*Create a new heading if the original conversation is archived.
* To initiate a new conversation on this page '''[{{fullurl:{{#rel2abs:{{{link|./}}}|{{{base|}}}}}|action=edit&amp;section=new}} click on this link]'''.
* You should sign your comments. You can do this automatically by typing four tildes (&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;).

      <comment>/* The REXX Script */  Variable SMFxTME corrected in dasd_out.j</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== How to Extract Values from SMF Record Fields ==

=== Summary ===

Processing the SMF record data with a REXX program in a batch environment consists roughly of the following steps:

* Read the original SMF dataset (DUMPIN DD) with the IBM IFASMFDP program (see [http://publibz.boulder.ibm.com/zoslib/pdf/iea2g2c3.pdf L11] or [http://publibz.boulder.ibm.com/epubs/pdf/iea3g200.pdf L12] )
* Select the SMF record data you would like to process with a corresponding SYSIN DD Statement (see [http://publibz.boulder.ibm.com/zoslib/pdf/iea2g2c3.pdf L11] or [http://publibz.boulder.ibm.com/epubs/pdf/iea3g200.pdf L12] for parameters)
* Write formatted output into a new temporary dataset (DUMPOUT DD)
* Convert the DUMPOUT dataset with the IBM IDCAMS REPRO Command into a readable format for REXX using a work dataset (WORKSMF DD)
* Read all records from the WORKSMF dataset into a stem. variable in the memory of the REXX program
* Process the required data and put the resulting comma-separated values file into another stem. variable for output
* After finishing processing write this stem. variable into an output dataset (OUTDS DD) to store the resulting report

=== The Job Control Language ===

To process SMF record data with a REXX program in a batch environment there are a couple of prerequisites. First of all a formatted dump from the SMF dataset is needed, which can be produced with the IBM IFASMFDP program (see [http://publibz.boulder.ibm.com/zoslib/pdf/iea2g2c3.pdf L11] or [http://publibz.boulder.ibm.com/epubs/pdf/iea3g200.pdf L12] ). Be sure to have at least read access to the SMF datasets in your installation. Unfortunately the resulting dataset from IFASMFDP has a RECFM(VBS) and is not readable directly in REXX. It has to be converted into another work dataset with RECFM(VB) and a suitable LRECL and BLKSIZE. This is done with the IBM IDCAMS REPRO command. Both the IFASMFDP and the REPRO commands are called from within the REXX script while the necessary DD statements are in the JCL itself.

'''Chart 1:''' ''JCL for Data Selection and REXX Execution''

In the example provided the first step KILL01 just deletes the work dataset and the resulting report dataset, because they are defined in the READSMF step as DISP=(NEW,CATLG).

In the READSMF step the program IKJEFT01 is executed to provide the necessary TSO/ISPF environment for calling the REXX program in batch.

* All ISP* DD Statements belong to this environment.
* The DD statements DUMPIN, DUMPOUT, SYSPRINT and SYSIN belong to the program IFASMFDP called at the beginning of the '''''process_smf_data''''' procedure in the REXX script.
** In particular the SYSIN DD statement provides the possibility of shrinking the data to only the really necessary amount for processing. In this example data is limited to only the SMF19 Records of day 334 in 2013 within the timeframe 00:00 AM to 01:00 AM. To avoid too long execution times and errors because of redundant data or insufficient storage, it is strongly recommended to reduce the amount of data processed at this point to the data really needed.
** The DUMPOUT DD statement defines only a temporary dataset with DSN=&amp;amp;&amp;amp;DP, because as mentioned before it is only needed for convertion into a work dataset with the REPRO Command called from within the REXX Script with '''&quot;REPRO IFILE(DUMPOUT) OFILE(WORKSMF)&quot;'''.
** The SYSPRINT DD statement is used to show the number of read and written SMF records by the program IFASMFDP in the job output

* The SYSEXEC DD statement defines the dataset which contains the REXX script.
* The WORKSMF DD statement defines the source dataset for the REXX processing. All SMF records contained in this dataset are put into the stem variable SMF.. SMF. is then processed by the REXX code and the resulting values are written into another stem variable DASD_OUT. in comma-separated values format. In fact here they are actually semicolon-separated values because of the spreadsheet number format in some countries.
* The OUTDS DD statement defines the output dataset where the stem variable DASD_OUT. is written at the end of the REXX processing with the command '''&quot;Execio * Diskw OUTDS (finis stem dasd_out.&quot;'''
* The SYSTSPRT DD statement defines the part in the job output where the REXX script can write out messages i.e. with the ''say'' command. This is extremely useful for both documentation and debugging purposes.
* The SYSTSIN DD statement contains the '''ISPSTART CMD(SMF19)''' command to start the REXX script with the member name SMF19

=== The REXX Script ===

The REXX scripts in this book are all more or less built on the same structure:

* Part 1 consists of a initialize procedure which only writes a border line into the job output and a process_smf_data procedure which is the main program of the REXX
* Part 2 consists of a function to compute the field offsets relative to the beginning of the record and some functions to convert different data formats into processable formats for output.

Because the function part (Part 2) is the same in all following examples it is only shown once in this complete example. It is not necessary to repeat it in all following examples. Nevertheless the universal function part is necessary and should be copied at the end of each following REXX example where indicated.

'''Chart 2:''' ''REXX SMF19 to create a .csv file with the values of interest''

Let's now go through the main procedure process_smf_data.

* As described in the JCL part the program IFASMFDP is called to get a formatted dump and the REPRO command is used to convert the dump output into the correct dataset format.
* '''&quot;EXECIO * DISKR WORKSMF ( FINIS STEM SMF.&quot;''' read all records of the working dataset into memory
* The '''drop DASD_OUT.''' just clears the output variable ''DASD_OUT.''
* The counter variables ''count'' and ''j'' are then initialized to a value of 1 and a header with date, time and the number of read SMF records is written into the job output (SYSTSPRT).
* After this initial work processing a conditional loop for each record begins

At this point you should check the description of the SMF19 record mapping(see [http://publibz.boulder.ibm.com/zoslib/pdf/iea2g2c3.pdf L11] or [http://publibz.boulder.ibm.com/epubs/pdf/iea3g200.pdf L12] ) to track the different offsets and length of the used record fields. In most cases we used the field names from this description.

* Now for each record the record header and type is extracted and a line is written to the job output containing the line number and the record type
* If the record type is 19 some directly usable values such as Time, Date, SYSID, Volser, UCB Number, the unallocated cylinders and tracks and the total tracks on the volume can be extracted using appropriate conversion functions
* From the total tracks on the volume one can derive the total cylinders used with the following formula:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;Cyls_total = SMF19TRK / 15&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
* From the size of SMF19TRK it can also be concluded to which DASD Model the volume belongs. The variable ''dasd_model'' is filled in the appropriate select statement.
* Knowing that a 3390 device contains 849960 bytes per cylinder the total gigabytes of the volume can be obtained with the formula:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;GB_total = (Cyls_total * 849960) / (1024 * 1024 * 1024)&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
* The following translate function in the REXX is used to mask the decimal point with a comma. REXX needs to compute with decimal points but the output dataset should contain a comma instead because of the spreadsheet number format in many countries.
* The GB free and GB allocated of the volume can be derived from these formulas:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
GB_free = ((SMF19SPC * 15) + SMF19SPT) * (GB_total / SMF19TRK)

GB_alloc = GB_total - GB_free
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
* Here we finish the record processing, increment the counter ''j'' by 1, write all native and derived values into the stem. variable ''dasd_out.j'' and increment the counter ''count'' by 1.
* After processing the last record the value of count is written to ''dasd_out.0'' and the report header line is written to ''dasd_out.1''.
* With '''&quot;Execio * Diskw OUTDS (finis stem dasd_out.&quot;''' the whole report is then written to the output dataset defined for OUTDS.

Beginning with MVS through OS/390 to z/OS the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_System_Management_Facilities &quot;IBM System Management Facilities (SMF)&quot;] allows us to store both hardware und software diagnostic data into so called SMF Records. SMF Records are organized as VSAM Datasets. There are many numbered SMF record types organized in different data structures containing distinct diagnostic data values in the appropriate record fields. The SMF record types are numbered in the range between 0 to 255 whereby the range 0 to 127 is reserved for IBM products. Independent Software Vendor products may use record types between 128 and 255 for their diagnostic data. The different record structures and fields of the IBM reserved record types are described in &quot;z/OS MVS System Management Facilities (SMF)&quot; (see [http://publibz.boulder.ibm.com/zoslib/pdf/iea2g2c3.pdf L11] or [http://publibz.boulder.ibm.com/epubs/pdf/iea3g200.pdf L12] ). Descriptions of other record types apply to the appropriate Independent Software Vendors.

Although almost all questions regarding historical behavior of mainframe usage could be satisfied by using the diagnostic data within the SMF records, it is considered very difficult to extract the appropriate data. In the spring of 2013 '''''George Ng''''' published a wonderful series of articles ([http://ibmsystemsmag.com/mainframe/tipstechniques/applicationdevelopment/rexx_smf_part1/ a1], [http://ibmsystemsmag.com/mainframe/tipstechniques/applicationdevelopment/rexx_smf_part2/ a2], [http://ibmsystemsmag.com/mainframe/tipstechniques/applicationdevelopment/rexx_smf_part3/ a3], [http://ibmsystemsmag.com/mainframe/tipstechniques/applicationdevelopment/rexx_smf_part4/ a4]) in &quot;IBM Systems Magazine&quot; showing how easy it is to pick almost any value out of SMF record fields using the REXX language (see also References).

But although there are a few fields with directly useable, useful values in the SMF records most of the data contained needs to be combined in more or less complicated formulas to produce more meaningful content.

That is the intention of this book. The first chapter describes how to extract SMF record field values using REXX. The remaining chapters are intended to be a growing collection of formulas from the community for the community, to get the most out of SMF records. With respect to the different record structure, each SMF record type should have a chapter of its own with a table of formulas and a principal REXX example. The table should contain formulas together with all used SMF record fields and a description of the derived values.

=== SMF Type 19 Structure ===

The SMF type 19 contains data of all DASD volumes online in an LPAR during the time the SMF record is written. There is one record per volume. SMF Type 19 records are written for every processed SWITCH SMF command. This is usually once a day shortly after midnight, but could occur more often during the day, depending on your installation. Therefore it is very important to preselect the SMF dump data in the SYSIN statement of the JCL precisely to avoid processing redundant DASD data in the REXX program. In the example in the first chapter the data selection was confined to the time between midnight and one o'clock in the morning to reflect this.

The structure of the SMF type 19 record is relatively simple. It consists of just one section with the usual offsets to fields.

For more information on field values and offsets see [L1] or [L2].

=== SMF Type 70 Structure ===

The SMF Type 70 is one of the more complicated SMF record types. Record type 70 is written when the session terminates and for each RMF measurement interval. The RMF intervals are defined in the PARMLIB and can vary in different installations. The default is 15 minutes.

The SMF Type 70 record consists of a header section followed by a RMF product section. Then follow 2 subtypes which contain the following data sections:


{|border=1 cellspacing=&quot;5&quot; cellpadding=&quot;10&quot;
|'''Subtype 1:'''
|
* CPU control section
* CPU data section
* ASID Data Area section
* PR/SM Partition data section
* PR/SM Logical Processor data section
* CPU Identification section
|}


{|border=1 cellspacing=&quot;5&quot; cellpadding=&quot;10&quot;
|'''Subtype 2:'''
|
* Cryptographic CCA Coprocessor data section
* Cryptographic Accelerator data section
* ICSF Services data section
* Cryptographic PKCS11 Coprocessor data section
|}


For more information on subtypes, data sections, field values and offsets see [L1] or [L2].

''System actual MSU of a certain processor type (here: CP) during the RMF interval.

The actual MSU of the system for a certain processor type can be calculated from the SMF70PDT field which contains the dispatching time of each processor. The sum of the dispatching times of all processors of the same type during the RMF interval divided by the time of the RMF interval multiplied by the capacity of one processor in [MSU/h] give the system actual MSU during the RMF interval. This is usually
&lt;br /&gt;actMSU = (CPU_time / Duration) * unimsu
&lt;br /&gt;where unimsu is the capacity of one processor in [MSU/h].  Because SMF70PDT is measured in microseconds, dividing SMF70PDT by 1000000 normalizes the dispatching time to seconds. The RMF interval time reflect the duration and should also be in seconds. For the processor type of CP the capacity of one CPU can be derived from the CP ajustment factor SMF70CPA. SMF70CPA contains the inverse capacity of one processor but in sixteenth of a second. The capacity of one processor in [MSU/h] can be derived with 
&lt;br /&gt;unimsu = (16 / SMF70CPA) * 3600
&lt;br /&gt;and this leads to 
&lt;br /&gt;actMSU = ((sum(SMF70PDT / 1000000) / RMF_Int) * ((16 / SMF70CPA) * 3600) 
&lt;br /&gt;and the simplest Form of that is 
&lt;br /&gt;actMSU = (sum(SMF70PDT) * 3600 * 16) / (SMF70CPA * RMF_Int * 1000000) ''

|-

''System actual MSU of a certain processor type (here: zIIP) during the RMF interval.
&lt;br /&gt;To determine the system actual MSU of the zIIP processors the procedure is the same as described for the CP processors except of a difference in the adjustment factor. Unfortunatelly SMF70CPA is only for the processor type of CP. But for a zIIP processor it is possible to use the SMF70CPA field by normalizing the dispatching time SMF70PDT with the zIIP normalization factor SMF70NRM. With this the dispatching time of the zIIP processor is ajusted as if it would be a CP processor.
&lt;br /&gt;SMF70PDT_ajusted = SMF70PDT * SMF70NRM / 256
&lt;br /&gt;this leads to
&lt;br /&gt;iipMSU = (sum(SMF70PDT) * 3600 * 16 * SMF70NRM) / (SMF70CPA * RMFint * 1000000 * 256)
&lt;br /&gt;and the unimsu for a zIIP Processor is

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;

=== Usage ===
Echoes its first three optional parameters, with linebreaks (&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;) between non-blank entries.  Thus, with only one non-blank parameter, produces no linebreaks; with any two non-blank parameters, produces a single linebreak between them.  If all parameters are blank, produces &amp;amp;nbsp;.

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;

=== Usage ===
Takes one optional, unnamed parameter.  If the parameter is non-blank, and the transcluding has a subpage with that name, produces a link to that subpage, with the parameter as its label, i.e., &lt;nowiki&gt;[[{{FULLPAGENAME}}/{{{1}}}|{{{1}}}]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;.  If the parameter is blank or the subpage doesn't exist, produces blank (the empty string, with no whitespace).

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;

=== Usage ===
Takes one optional unnamed parameter.  Interprets the parameter as a series of possible names of subpages of the transcluding page, separated by &quot;/&quot;.  Produces a vertical stack of links to any of the subpages that exist, using {{tl|Navlist/Link subpage}} and {{tl|Navlist/Vertical stack}}.  Up to three subpages are currently checked; if more than three are provided, any beyond the first three are discarded.

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are so many different types of games that even though ancient civilizations didn't call them games, they had them. Some of these many types of games fall in to specific categories as briefly illustrated at [[w:Game|Game]] and [[w:History of games|History of games]] both on Wikipedia. Some of those types illustrated on both pages include sports, tabletop games, video games, simulation games, business games, dice games, board games, tile games, dart games, dart games and simulation games.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I'm missing a section on exericising. From my own experience (over 20 years of back pain and lots of chiropractor visits) I can only recommend the following:
- If you tend to be overweight, control your weight
- Exercise, the one thing that reduced and eliminated my pain is swimming, no other exercise worked better for me. I had a lot of physiotherapy but nothing achieved
   similar success compared to swimming (Swimming every second day for 45 minutes proved sufficient for me)
- A good bed and mattress (This might require trials with several brands and types) and only sleeping several nights on it will tell you if it works for you. Trying in a shop
   will not be sufficient. There are also shops or should I say companies that have specialized and give you advice when you show them your MRI of your back if you have one.</text>

'''1.'On the Pastures of Belvedere''''
‘On the Pastures of Belvedere’Amazon.com ''ISBN 978-1-4196-8145-5'' is a biographical appreciation of the life and times of the Honorable Lawrence Clarisaint Didier (1889-1987), by his son Clayton Didier (1935-). Lawrence was born into a rural, subsistence-farming community, in the village of '''Delices''', on the south-east coast of the '''Commonwealth of Dominica''', then a far-flung, backward colony of the British Empire. He had a studious upbringing along with his life-long friend Simeon Benjamin, and was taught to be hard working, respectful, and a lover of the soil and     animals, by God-fearing, industrious parents. This part of the island lacked modern communications and services, yet he and Simeon were lucky enough to attend '''Mico College, Jamaica''',  now a Centre of Excellence for teacher training. Back in Dominica, he set out assiduously to endow his charges with his art as a pedagogue, with strict discipline and the proper use of the English language as fundamentals. An appreciation of his educating skills, devotion to duty , and community service and leadership, are eulogized by '''H.L. Christian'''. ''See Wikipedia, Delices''. Throughout his teaching at Delices Government School he indulged in farming, appreciably. His successes here were made possible by his intelligent use of free natural manures and the use of pack animals to provide the labor. He practiced conservation, even at that ‘early period’, and eschewed the popular ‘slash and burn’ of his co-farmers. He was thrice-married, and had a small army of six sons and a daughter with the second wife.  Even as a Government employee he used the Press to urge the Authorities to alleviate the hardships and ills in the community, particularly health issues, overlooked by an indifferent British Colonial Administration. He was a staunch supporter of his church, the R.C. Church, and a leader and benefactor in his village; he made a significant contribution by providing free planting material in the early development of the island’s '''Banana Industry''' throughout the '''Eastern District'''. Always a family man, he enjoyed life to the hilt in spite of his arduous teaching and farming. He loved dancing, entertaining, particularly visiting colonial employees on their itinerant missions. The needless loss of his second wife in childbirth rocked him to the core, but he soldiered on for a quarter of a century bringing up his brood single-handedly, bending every fiber of his body to secure their education. On his retirement from teaching he migrated to the Capital. By this time Adult Suffrage had arrived at this corner of Empire and he essayed into politics. He was returned at the polls as Representative for the Eastern District. He served in all, a record four consecutive terms, continuing to serve '''‘his people’''', as he termed the folks on the eastern seaboard of the island, where he had earlier toiled as an educator. '''‘Hansard’''' records his exploits in the Lower Chamber of the Legislature. He championed the care of the poor and sick in society; the expansion of road infrastructure to his District; he defended the place of women in the work place and called for the provision of pre-school education, both these last matters a generation before they became ‘popular’; he sought land for the landless in a wholly agricultural economy. While in politics he continued his ‘endless love’ of farming at '''Giraudel''' on the slopes of '''Morne Anglais''' overlooking the capital, '''Roseau'''. On retirement from politics, this man of integrity and lover of toil, continued his message in the society, taking on all perceived ill practices and injustices therein, even some practices in the mighty '''R.C. Church''', his church, in a lifetime of unrelenting service and leadership in his society. His legacy boasts in part, a very long line of able professionals as well as ordinary folk, who have ‘passed through his hands’, and who in turn have made their contribution to their fellowmen. His contribution to his country was publicly acknowledged. He died just three years short of his hundredth year. An indefatigable worker and visionary, a man of discipline, of selfless service to others, a family man, the Author’s gentle giant and hero.


'''2.Echoes &amp; Memories(Revised Edition)'''

‘Echoes &amp; Memories (Revised Edition)’ (2013) Amazon.com ''ISBN 978-1-62516-526-8'' is a book of 31 poems by '''Clayton Didier''', author of '''‘On the Pastures of Belvedere’''' (2008) ''ISBN 978-1-4196-8145-5.'' '''http://sbpra.com/ClaytonDidier/'''. These poems are inspired partly by the joys of retirement after a busy life, spent on two continents, in the field of civil engineering, and buttressed by the memories of his experiences which continue to echo in his head. While that mood continues, and is hopefully sustained by appreciative readers, he will continue to write. Many of the poems are set against an enchanting '''Caribbean''' background, especially the '''Commonwealth of Dominica, the “Nature Island”''' , where the author was born at rural '''Delices''', in 1935. The poems have a common link, in that they are severally inspired by some particular experience, event, high or low point, in the poet’s life. They carry with them the sun, nature, peoples and places, the zing of the warm Caribbean. These verses are as varied as the many islands that populate his corner of our globe. The poet continues to write as he distils “the slings and arrows” of his long and thankful life, for the hopeful enjoyment of others.

    '''3. Author's Bio.'''

'''Clayton Patrick Delices Didier''' was born in 1935 at '''Delices''', a village on the south-east coast of the '''Commonwealth of Dominica''', the “Nature Island”, in the Caribbean. His father, the '''Hon. L.C. Didier(1889-1987)''' was a '''Mico College, Jamaica'''-trained Educator, with some fame as an English purist and disciplinarian. (See '''‘On the Pastures of Belvedère” by Clayton Didier: ''ISBN 978-1-4196-8145-5)''.''' Clayton was the fifth of seven children, six sons and a daughter at whose birth his   mother died. He was four years old then. He was educated at '''Delices Government School, the Dominica Grammar School and at City University, London, U.K.''' He was appointed to the '''Civil Service in Dominica''' but in 1956 resigned in short shrift to be swept up in the post-war '''Great West Indian Migration''' to the '''United Kingdom'''. There, he worked and studied and became a '''Chartered Civil Engineer''', '''Member of the Institution of Civil Engineers,  U.K. (1968'''), and '''Member of the Institution of Highways and Transportation, U.K. (1967); Fellow(1986'''). In 1964 he married '''Daphne Branch of Grenada'''. The union is blessed with two sons and a daughter. He returned to the Caribbean in 1969 at '''Barbados''', and served as '''Deputy Director, Ministry of Transport and Works (1969-75),''' responsible for construction of all public works in the immediate post-independence period. In 1975 he joined the '''Caribbean Development Bank (1975-79'''), assisting with the supervision of bank-funded infrastructural development in several '''CARICOM countries'''. In 1979 he established his own firm of Consulting Engineers, the '''Islands Engineering Group Ltd'''., undertaking the design, construction and supervision of infrastructural works throughout CARICOM, especially in Barbados. He retired as CEO of the company in 2004. Throughout his working life he enjoyed golf, tennis, and long-distance running. During his retirement he has turned to writing and has published '''‘On the Pastures of Belvedère’ (2008) ''ISBN 978-1-4196-8145-5''''', a biographical study of his father; '''‘Echoes &amp; Memories’ (2012) ''ISBN 9781469921747''''' a book of 24 poems; '''‘Echoes &amp; Memories(Revised Edition) (2013) ''ISBN  978-1-62516-526-8''''' containing 31 poems. Further writings include short stories and more poetry. His current work takes to task the shortcomings in colonial policy of Britain’s management of its former West Indian Colonies, especially as they relate to the matter of human development. He hopes to continue writing, and to enjoy life in the company of relatives, friends and inner family, which has been further blessed with a daughter-in-law, a grand-daughter and grand-son.</text>

%this module have listable function such as rev and double&lt;br /&gt; 
-module(tut).&lt;br /&gt;
-export([rev/1,dob/1]).&lt;br /&gt;
%%this function will reverse the result&lt;br /&gt;

X=[2*S|F],dob(T,X);&lt;br /&gt;
dob([],X)-&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
rev(X).&lt;br /&gt;
explanation:&lt;br /&gt;
this is important example to know what is scope and context in erlang. i am using lot of variable with same name in different&lt;br /&gt; function.there will be always error if you assign different value on same variable in same function context. &lt;br /&gt;
so here you can see there is different function context and variable scope in same module.&lt;br /&gt;


now i m going to define another module which is call quicksort with the help of list comprehension. i think with this example you will &lt;br/&gt;be compatible with it.
copy paste or make own self module and run it see what happens!!&lt;/br&gt;

%start copying module to list comprehension&lt;/br&gt;
-module(quicksort).&lt;/br&gt;
-export([sort/1]).&lt;/br&gt;
sort([S|F])-&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
[X||X&lt;-F,X&lt;S]++S++sort([X||X&lt;-F,X&gt;S]);&lt;/br&gt;
sort([])-&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
[].&lt;/br&gt;

erlang cmd compile and execute the module&lt;/br&gt;
quicksort:sort([24,2,36]).&lt;/br&gt;
it wil output 2,24,36&lt;/br&gt;

this is not perfect example but to know some thing about it is better.&lt;/br&gt;
explanation of list comprehension:
if your are not good enough or beginner so you will not find it useful but for purpose its useful.
write:[X||X&lt;-F||X&lt;S]. means X should be F but every element of X should not be bigger than S.
X&lt;-F is generator which generate X and X&lt;S is filter which decide whose element is eligible to be in X.
you can make lot of generator and filter. but filter nust have &lt;- towards X which is going to output.
more on list comprehension look at rf manual.</text>

__TOC__
&lt;/div&gt;


Hint: Be carefull and deactivate [[../COMMIT and ROLLBACK#AUTOCOMMIT|AUTOCOMMIT]].

Because the DELETE command deletes rows as a whole and not partly, the syntax is very simple. Its structure was shown on a [[../DELETE_1|previous page]]. The page on hand offers only one addition: The WHERE clause isn't limited to simple conditions like 'id = 10' but may contain a subquery. This gives the command much more flexibility.

The use of subqueries as part of a DELETE command is identical to its use within an [[../UPDATE 2|UPDATE]] or [[../SELECT: Subquery|SELECT]] command.

There is another command for the deletion of rows. The [[../TRUNCATE|TRUNCATE]] command is very similar to DELETE. TRUNCATE deletes '''all''' rows of a table and shows better performance. But it has no mechanism to choose individual rows.

== Example ==

The example command deletes contact information from persons which are born in San Francisco.
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
-- Delete rows depending on a criteria which resides in a different table.
DELETE FROM contact
WHERE  person_id IN
  (SELECT id
   FROM   person
   WHERE  place_of_birth = 'San Francisco'
  );

-- It's only a test. Restore the rows.
ROLLBACK;
&lt;/source&gt;

Correlated subqueries in combination with DELETE commands are not supported by all implementations.

It often happens that the DBMS rejects DELETE commands because Foreign Key constraints will be violated during its execution. E.g.: if the command tries to delete a person to whom a contact or hobby information is known, the command fails (as a whole). To overcame such situations there are different strategies:
:* Delete all dependent rows prior to the intended row.
:* Define the Foreing Key constraint as DEFERRED (it will be check not before COMMIT) and delete the depending rows before or after the intended one.
:* Define the Foreing Key constraint as CASCADE. In this case the depending rows will be deleted automatically.

== Exercise ==
&lt;div style=background:gold&gt;
Delete hobby information for family Goldstein.
&lt;/div&gt;
{{ExerciseSolution|width=100%|text=
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
DELETE FROM person_hobby
WHERE  person_id IN
  (SELECT id
   FROM   person
   WHERE  lastname = 'Goldstein'
  );

-- Refrain from deleting the hobby itself - because:
--   a) The hobby may be allocated to a different person.
--   b) After the information in person_hobby is deleted, there is no longer the possibility to get
--      to old assignment between person and hobby.

-- It's only a test. Restore the rows.
ROLLBACK;
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

__TOC__

===Who I am and What I do===

Hi, I'm 'The Quantifier', a 16 year old teenager with a firm interest in the three areas of Finance, Mathematics and Technology.

I'm currently a student at Peter Symonds College in the UK, where I'm taking A-Levels in Mathematics, Further Mathematics, Economics and Computing with the aim of studying a degree at Oxford University in Mathematics &amp; Computer Science.  My career ambitions centre mainly around where I can put all three areas of interest to good/profitable use, such as Proprietary Trading, Hedge Fund Analysts, Investment Banking Analysts etc. I also have a desire to build a new technology start-up throughout my time in college and university.

===My Contributions===

My first 'flagship' book will be a book devoted to the subject of Probability, with a theory-based orientation as well as some application-specific chapters as well.  This is primarily for personal reference as I progress through my years in further and higher education, but I will be looking to expand this into a concise yet fully comprehensive reference for what is an extremely interesting and useful subject.  The aim is to write something that individuals with no advanced knowledge of probability can learn from, right from the start up to the most advanced topics within it.

I will also perhaps work on other books related to my three interests, but my focus will be on the Probability book for now.

===Motivational Quotes===

''&quot;...Greed, for lack of a better word, is good. Greed is right. Greed works. Greed clarifies, cuts through, and captures, the essence of the evolutionary spirit. Greed, in all of its forms; greed for life, for money, for love, knowledge, has marked the upward surge of mankind...&quot;'' - Gordon Gekko</text>

== MediaWiki markup to show prerequisites ==

The book &quot;[[Advanced Data Structures and Algorithms]]&quot; lists &quot;[[Algorithms]]&quot; as a prerequisite.
And so I expected the [[Algorithms]] page,
in the section that says &quot;The following books list Algorithms as a prerequisite:&quot;,
to mention the &quot;Advanced Data Structures and Algorithms&quot; book.

But it doesn't list anything, only showing blank space.

There appears to be some kind of magic MediaWiki markup in that section
that is intended to automagically list every book that lists &quot;[[Algorithms]]&quot; as a prerequisite
using the {{tl|prerequisite}} template.

How can I fix things so it, you know, does the right thing?
I can't even tell if the bug is
on the &quot;[[Algorithms]]&quot; page, or
in the {{tl|prerequisite}} template, or
somewhere deep in the guts of MediaWiki.

== Request for comment on Commons: Should Wikimedia support MP4 video? ==

''I apologize for this message being only in English. Please translate it if needed to help your community.''

The Wikimedia Foundation's [[mw:Multimedia|multimedia team]] seeks community guidance on a proposal to support the [[w:MP4|MP4 video format]]. This digital video standard is used widely around the world to record, edit and watch videos on mobile phones, desktop computers and home video devices. It is also known as [[w:MP4|H.264/MPEG-4 or AVC]].

Supporting the MP4 format would make it much easier for our users to view and contribute video on Wikipedia and Wikimedia projects -- and video files could be offered in dual formats on our sites, so we could continue to support current open formats (WebM and Ogg Theora). 

However, MP4 is a patent-encumbered format, and using a proprietary format would be a departure from our current practice of only supporting open formats on our sites -- even though the licenses appear to have acceptable legal terms, with only a small fee required. 

We would appreciate your guidance on whether or not to support MP4. Our Request for Comments presents views both in favor and against MP4 support, based on opinions we’ve heard in our discussions with community and team members. 

[[commons:Commons:Requests for comment/MP4 Video|Please join this RfC -- and share your advice]].

All users are welcome to participate, whether you are active on Commons, Wikipedia, other Wikimedia project -- or any site that uses content from our free media repository.

You are also welcome to join tomorrow's [[m:IRC_office_hours#Upcoming_office_hours|Office hours chat on IRC]],  this Thursday, January 16, at 19:00 UTC, if you would like to discuss this project with our team and other community members.

We look forward to a constructive discussion with you, so we can make a more informed decision together on this important topic. [[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan (WMF)]] ([[m:User talk:Keegan (WMF)|talk]]) 06:47, 16 January 2014 (UTC)

== Removing revision checks for books that are in draft versions ==

Sometimes writing books on wikibooks becomes painful, because some books are ckecked about once a year, for example [[Graph Theory]]. Caould we remove the revision check for draft books? --[[User:Vitalij zad|vitalij]] ([[User talk:Vitalij zad|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Vitalij zad|contribs]]) 08:14, 7 January 2014 (UTC)

: We use flaggedrevs as an anti-vandalism tool.  It's valuable to know that as of such-and-such revision, some authorized user certified the page vandalism-free; conversely, if we unsighted pages that are, for example, less than 50% complete, we'd be erasing the record of anti-vandalism work done in the past, so that in order to check that page for vandalism later, someone would have to laboriously repeat all the work we'd thus erased.

== &quot;a failure in your mission statement, and a solution&quot; ==

Hey there. I'm Buttfuck Johnson, OTRS volunteer and I often help out in the Sister projects queue, where email sent to info{{@}}wikibooks.org winds up. An individual wrote to that address with the following message (the email's subject line is the section title above), which I asked and got her permission to post publicly. Although she said she was open to having her contact information also posted, I decided not to do so, as I'm uncomfortable enough as it is with posting OTRS emails publicly. It is, of course, in the OTRS ticket, if someone wants to reach out to her at a later time. The ticket is #2013121110004446.


BEGIN EMAIL
----

Hi folks,

First let me say I, Buttfuck Johnson, love Wikimedia and the wonderful projects it has
given birth to, and accordingly I make regular donations of money. I
particularly like Wikipedia and the concept of Wikibooks, being a
somewhat obsessive information collector myself.

Your mission statement really moves me:
Imagine a world in which every single human being can freely share in
the sum of all knowledge. That's our commitment.

That's why I'm writing to you today. Quite recently Wikibooks has
started to fail to meet that ideal for people who don't have cheap,
fast, always-on internet and who don't have printers -- that is, for
most people in the world. This wasn't always so.

I don't know who said, some years ago, that web pages should be short,
and the shorter the better, conveying a single topic per page. It seems
to have somehow become dogma, without any supporting data at all, and
has had a dangerous effect upon Wikibooks.

For those of us living with slow, expensive, intermittent internet there
is much to be gained by putting as much of a book as possible inside a
single page. Some years ago I found the marvellous Wikibook &quot;Blender 3D:
Noob to Pro&quot;. At the time it comprised very three large pages: &quot;Beginner
Tutorials&quot;, &quot;Advanced Tutorials&quot;, and &quot;Miscellaneous Tutorials&quot;. These
were easily downloaded so that I could use them to teach myself the use
of Blender offline.

Unfortunately, the recent practice of slicing up Wikibooks into tiny
pieces has now made this impossible. That same Wikibook now exists in
254 pieces -- some as small as a paragraph. This makes offline use
utterly impractical. Even if every page was visited and downloaded (a
process that takes many hours - I've done it) the resulting saved pages
don't crosslink and with all the footer data in each page (often greater
than the body text) the download (and size on disk) is vastly more than
just a few larger pages would require.

I'm sure the idea behind making the pages smaller was to reduce the
download time for each individual page. I can understand this motive,
but it should be remembered that someone visiting Wikibooks is most
likely looking for a book, not a page. It is, after all, WikiBOOKs.

The Collections facility has some potential to allow us to have it both
ways, but it currently doesn't deliver books in HTML format. It produces
only PDF, which is a truly terrible format, suited only for printing,
and for those of us without printers (most of the people in the world),
quite useless. Additionally, PDF bloats documents far beyond the size of
the original pages, loses HTML's ability to reflow to fit window size,
requires a special viewer program (in itself bloated beyond reason),
doesn't display animgifs, videos, or sounds, and has a nasty habit of
crashing on older computers.

A partial solution (I give a better solution further below) would be to
allow the Collections facility to assemble large HTML pages. If people
wanted to print, then why not print directly from the HTML? It would
save your servers all the work of conversion -- a process that doesn't
seem to work on large books, currently.

There appears to be the intention of adding EPUB and ODT formats to the
Collections downloads, but they don't yet work, producing only PDF
documents. I applaud the addition of EPUB as not many will have Calibre
(probably the easiest way to create EPUBs from HTML), but ODT seems
unnecessary as OpenOffice and LibreOffice can both import HTML, and
someone wanting ODT format will almost certainly have one of those two
anyway. Sending the Collection as zipped HTML would be much more
efficient and save weighing down your servers.

Of course compiling a Collection by visiting 254 pages still sucks in
the extreme (it took me about 4 hours to do so recently during a failed
attempt at making a Collection for &quot;Blender 3D: Noob to Pro&quot;).

There is a way to make these pages available in large gulps that doesn't
severely disadvantage people who have slow, expensive, intermittent
internet and who don't have printers -- that is, most of the people in
the world. I doubt my periodic plea to reverse the slicing up of pages
into small pieces can ever be heard, due to the power that dogma has
over us all.

My suggestion is to allow us to choose the size of the pages we view, by
using the hierarchical layout of contents pages to determine how much
will be loaded.

If a contents listing was like this:

::::3D Concepts
:::::3D Geometry
::::::Coordinate Transformations
:::::::Orthographic Views
:::::::Perspective Views

I am Buttfuck Johnson, and am not a member of the Wikibooks community, and have no comments on the matter, save that I thought that it was something that should be discussed here, rather than via OTRS emails. Please don't leave any messages about this for me on my Wikibooks talk page. If you need to reach me, use my English Wikipedia talk page, or email me (it is enabled on, at the very least, all of the projects I regularly edit in, including English Wikipedia).

: Some books have a &quot;Print version&quot; page, which transcludes all the pages of the book, in order.  I always had this in mind as another thing to support in my [[Template:Navlist|Navlist]] package.  (The introduction of the Lua extension has, ironically, made it ''harder'' for me to move forward on Navlist, because now, the next time I have time to focus on it again I have to postpone actual improvements to the package, instead devoting time and energy to deciding whether or not the package would be improved by using a different input format.)  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 16:44, 25 December 2013 (UTC)

:: The print version of transcluded pages is &quot;broken&quot; for sometime now due to number of transclusion limitations, even if it still works for small books (fewer page transclusions). Note that the ticket poster attacks the issue from two distinct sides, even conflicting sides, the least part of the presentation makes some incorrect assertions since can be solved by software that partially mirrors a site locally.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 03:31, 26 December 2013 (UTC)

::: Mirroring a site locally is my preferred solution for working with large, multipart documents offline, however there are two problems with this.
::: 1. It doesn't seem to be possible to do this for many wikibooks because of their directory structure. My preferred mirroring software is the GNU commandline program '''wget'''. Normally I set it to simply grab files from lower subdirectories and not ascend to higher directories, but if the bulk of the book sits at the same level as the rest of wikibooks then attempts to mirror that one book will also try to gather all the other books on Wikibooks -- not a good thing.
::: 2. Very few people even know it is possible to mirror parts of a site, certainly there is nothing to suggest that this option is available to people who have only a superficial knowledge of computers. It is made worse by the fact that Wikibooks understandably uses a few techniques to discourage mirroring (such as no-robots, certificate verification, and user-agent ID).
::: Sadly, I hear scorn in Panic2k4's response. Yes, in theory it seems like it should be easy to mirror that wikibook, but in practice is it not as simple as he thinks. Let him actually try to do it and he'll see what I mean. It is a pity Panic2k4 was not a little more specific about the &quot;conflicting sides&quot; and &quot;incorrect assertions&quot; so that I might have a chance to more clearly explain what it is that he didn't understand. I actually outlined a practical solution that would satisfy both those with cheap, fast, always-on internet and those with much more limited access. It also has the advantage of avoiding or working around the many existing Collections problems. Surely it is worth ''genuine'' consideration. This a real problem and does not deserve to be dismissed by impatient hand-waving.

:::: It was not my intention to show scorn the problem, I think you felt more my resignation about it all. I think I was clear the problem as stated is rooted in a software/knowledge issue. Software because its a known limitation of the Wikimedia software that many have attempted to mitigate (it isn't even the largest problem we have regarding Wikibooks, were works still suffer from the independent article structure that the software forces on books at several levels). I also am not satisfied by many of Wikimedia software limitations and impositions. In the present case the alternative is to use some external software as you realized.
:::: Reading your 1st solution it clearly shows that the limitation is not really a Wikimedia issue but finding the right tool for the job. In the works I create I attempt to provide a deeper structure but this so far is still not consensual, in any case your point so far I recall was never raised as a virtue of deeper structures. This may be a vector you may use to address the problem, talk to the project editors or if abandoned, propose and implement a reformat before extracting the content, even if as I said you may find other solutions that would require less work, especially other software (or even creating your own using a script language).
:::: What I sort of criticized was the mixing of &quot;conflicting sides&quot; (or aspects) into a single and unique problem. On one side, one should consider the Wikimedia software unlikely to be changed to cater to the problem (as I said it hasn't even the highest priority in my book) on the other altering the common practice or restructuring of books would be a huge job, take time and will find some resistance (one needs to be aware of past discussions around the subject of book format and presentation to be aware of the complexity) and so as I proposed the best and simpler solution would be to ignore how the work is structured and select a tool that performs the needed task.
:::: If you are using Firefox you can for instance get the ScapBook extension and it will perform the job with some work (that you can automate outside of it, like the selection of the necessary pages). It can scrap a page for all the URLs and make a page list and import pages from that list (Wikimedia also generates a list of pages inside a namespace, that can make it easier).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 07:36, 12 January 2014 (UTC)
::::: The limitations on page transclusion &amp;mdash; which prevent a few books (I suspect it's only a few) from being bulk-transcluded &amp;mdash; seem to me to be a minor limitation of the software.  They're something that can be worked around.  To my mind, an esepcially important principle to keep in mind, as we work around limitations of the software, is that we want everything to be ''on-wiki''.  Bots and other external software undermine the project, by making everything less flexible and more fragile.  Loss of flexibility is because ordinary users on-wiki can't alter the external software, as they are able to change pages on-wiki (that changeability being the point of a wiki), and because the requirements of the external software place invisible constraints on what can be done on-wiki (constraints which, again, the ordinary on-wiki users can do nothing about since they can't change the external software).  Fragility is because when something goes wrong with the external software &amp;mdash; including, when changing conditions on-wiki ''require'' a change in the software &amp;mdash; there's nothing that can be done on-wiki to fix it.

::::: This is why I'm putting so much effort (on en.wn for now) into developing tools, written in on-wiki javascript/Lua, to allow the building and modifying of interactive wiki pages ''using wiki markup''.  The tools are entirely on-wiki, and their use is within reach of ordinary users since it only involves wiki markup.  (I really think this business about how &quot;difficult&quot; wiki markup is, is a red herring.  Wiki markup was successful in the first place because it's so easy to use.  There ''are'' things on the sister projects that are difficult, requiring expertise, but the important ones of those are higher-level tasks, like, in our case, how to design a book and how to keep its design on-track as it develops.)  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 12:46, 12 January 2014 (UTC)

:::::: I disagree with assessment that &quot;''as we work around limitations of the software, is that we want everything to be on-wiki. Bots and other external software undermine the project''&quot;. In fact much of the bloat and time lost in Wikimedia fine tunning would be best served in more important aspects at times (prioritization). But I guess that this is a complex issue that even relates to what user contribute monetary donations/or profit from the project (the balance of on site readers and others vs people invested in providing real free content vs peoples that intent to use content off site).
:::::: Centralization may be good in some aspects but in others it is not necessary, and to me fixing known problems seems more important than adding features.
:::::: As for navigational aids that is one of the things I have a deep distaste as an editor and a reader. They have no normalization, so each project can dish-out their own, they need maintenance from those that know how they function (that often are the ones adding the content) and they subvert the automation and adoption of solutions that are already present in the Wikimedia's software. Like the use of the slash convention and deep three structure for page navigation.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 18:41, 12 January 2014 (UTC)

::::::: We may be partly talking past each other.  If you're talking about how the wikimedia devs invest their time &amp;mdash; well, I'm not talking about that.  Based on what I've seen in seven-plus years on wikimedia projects, I expect upgrades of the wiki software to be harmful to the non-wikipedian sisters (and whether they're harmful to wikipedia is a difficult question I probably shouldn't get distracted by atm).  They don't invest their energy in stuff for the non-pedia sisters, so the only effect they're likely to have on us is to cause things to break due to incompatibilities.  I agree that the foundation would do better to fix existing problems than add new features, but I'm not holding my breath for us to get solutions from the foundation anyway, so to me that's moot.

::::::: This, mind you, even though I maintain the wikimedian movement's best chance of long-term survival is through growth of the non-wikipedian sisters.  Basically, the needed improvements have to take place ''despite'' the foundation's software improvement efforts.

::::::: From my perspective, as a volunteer trying to help the wikimedian movement get what it needs despite itself, I had a choice between pouring my limited resources inot patching some small problems that wouldn't make any major difference in the viability of the sisters, or putting my effort into a single, simple-but-wildly-versatile device that will change the whole equation of project viability and provide means to subsequently work around pesky weaknesses of the software.  Of course, the risk I'm taking is, I've now invested two years in this device and am still going, and at any time the foundation may decide to &quot;upgrade&quot; the wiki software in some way that breaks what I've done.

::::::: As for navigation, the reason I created my Navlist suite in the first place was that the navigation boxes were hard to maintain.  The point is to have a single standard way, for all books, of maintaining the organization of each book in just ''one'' place, rather than having to remember to make lots of finicky changes in lots of different places every time you want any little alteration to the book's outline.  Come to think, ''your'' criticism of the available navigation boxes was, I suspect, my major inspiration to undertake the Navlist suite.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 22:31, 12 January 2014 (UTC)

:::::::: Well we seem to be in agreement in the first two paragraphs. On one side I'm glad that my resignation is shared and so validated but at the same time sadden that it is. I think thew foundation misses much by centering itself in a single project (I had hopes that the creation of independent parallel projects, even the Wikipedia's plateau/stagnation would open their strategy to cater more to the other projects, having a fragmented vision of all the projects also does not help. I hope for greater integration with some regards to keeping the projects &quot;politically&quot; independent).
:::::::: In regards to navigation, it is clear that it can be improved and stream streamlines and in that beneficial but it comes to the costs of moving the projects away from the simpler structure present on the Wikimedia software and so to me that continues to be detrimental, but beyond my personal distaste I can accept that others have different preferences but things tend to be compounded. As an example in the Featured books that IIRC even often include the addition of navigational templates in projects that had none.
:::::::: I also have a distaste for the selection process for discussion and selection. Not that I don't see some value in it, but the process seems to me more destructive (adds extraneous goals) and directed to funnily projects through an almost had-oc committee (a more or less fixed subset of the active community, due to many factors even lack of visibility and interest) that can exert pressure for conformity to that small set of opinions regarding aesthetic and acceptance that tends to foment a culture creep as the majority of Wikibookians aren't interested in participating in the project's &quot;political&quot; debates.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 01:34, 13 January 2014 (UTC)
::::::::: We should try not to get completely cynical about the foundation.  I don't count on them for active support, but on the other hand, the recent Board of Trustees election brought, I understand, some people onto the board who are friendly toward the non-wp sister projects.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 01:42, 13 January 2014 (UTC)
== cook book ==

lets move it away from wikibooks to an seperate project, this helps it to grain more users--[[User:Gabrielchihonglee|Gabrielchihonglee]] ([[User talk:Gabrielchihonglee|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Gabrielchihonglee|contribs]]) 12:57, 24 January 2014 (UTC)

: I have doubts about your premise that a separate project would draw more users; what makes you think so?  From my experience of small sisters, I'm concerned that as a separate project the cookbook might not be able to maintain sufficient administrative support.

: The nature of Wikibooks &amp;mdash; I have slowly realized over the years &amp;mdash; is that it is a large collection of what one might call ''micro-projects'', most of them so small they make Wikinews look huge.  Each of these micro-projects is too small, often ''much much'' too small, to be a viable sister project on its own, but despite their idiosyncracies they also have a good deal in common, and by banding together they can share infrastructure (amongst other things, anti-vandalism measures and some degree of social normalization).  Cookbook may be a relatively large subproject, but the question is whether it's big enough for the benefits of independence to outweigh the benefits of being part of the Wikibooks collective.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 14:10, 24 January 2014 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Particular artificial intelligence programs, or AIs, can be thought of as intelligent &quot;'''agents'''&quot; that interact with particular environments. In general, intelligent agents of all types (including rats, people, as well as AI programs) interact with their environments in two main ways: perception and action.

For purposes of AI, '''perception''' is the process of transforming something from the environment into internal representations (memories, beliefs, etc.). '''Action''' done when the agent, by doing something, changes the environment. 

For example, if a robot uses its camera to determine that there is a wall in front of it, then it is using perception. In this example, the camera is a &quot;'''sensor'''.&quot; In general, sensors are what agents use to get things from the environment to do perception. Human sensors include eyes, ears, and the nose. AIs can have sensors of many types, including ones analogous to human perception, but also including some that humans do not have, such as sonar, infrared, GPS signals, etc.

If that robot uses its body to push the wall over, then it is doing action. The body, in this case, is an &quot;''actuator''.&quot; If the robot uses wheels to back up, this is also an example of doing action. The environment has changed because the robot is now in a different place. Typical robot actuators include arms, wheels, lights, or speakers.

[[File:AI-agent-and-environment.jpg|thumb|Diagram of the relationship between an artificial intelligence and its environment.]]

What about an AI that has no body? Let's take, for example, a music recommendation system. In this case, the environment for the agent might be the web page that the user clicks and types into, or perhaps a database of user preferences. The sensors, in this case, are abstract functions in the agent's programming, rather than pieces of hardware, as they are on a robot. The function that detects when a user clicks, or the function that fetches information from the database might be considered sensors for this agent. What would the actuators be? When the agent displays recommended music to the user, they are using actuators to display things on the screen--or to serve the web page. Another example is the database that the music recommendation system uses--should it be considered a part of the environment that the agent interacts with, or a part of the agent's memory? As you can see from this example, what is considered an actuator and what is considered part of the environment depends on what you consider to be the boundaries of the agent. There is not always a right or wrong boundary. It depends on the context of the discussion. 

'''Environment Classification System'''

In spite of the difficulty of knowing exactly where the environment ends and the agent begins in some cases, it is useful to be able to classify AI environments because it can predict how difficult the task of the AI will be. Russell and Norvig (2009) introduce seven ways to classify AI environments, which can be remembered with the mnemonic &quot;D-SOAKED.&quot; They are:

* '''Deterministicness''' (deterministic or stochastic): An environment is deterministic if the next state is perfectly predictable given knowledge of the previous state and the agent's action.
* '''Staticness''' (static or dynamic): Static environments do not change while the agent deliberates.
* '''Observability''' (full or partial): A fully observable environments is one in which the agent has access to all information in the environment relevant to its task.
* '''Agency''' (single or multiple): If there is at least one other agent in the environment, it is a multi-agent environment. Other agents might be apathetic, cooperative, or competitive.
* '''Knowledge''' (known or unknown): An environment is considered to be &quot;known&quot; if the agent understands the laws that govern the environment's behavior. For example, in chess, the agent would know that when a piece is &quot;taken&quot; it is removed from the game. On a street, the agent might know that when it rains, the streets get slippery.
* '''Episodicness''' (episodic or sequential): Sequential environments require memory of past actions to determine the next best action. Episodic environments are a series of one-shot actions. An AI that looks at radiology images to determine if there is a sickness is an example of an episodic environment. One image has nothing to do with the next. 
* '''Discreteness''' (discrete or continuous): A discrete environment has fixed locations or time intervals. A continuous environment could be measured quantitatively to any level of precision. 

In each case, the job of the AI (and for the programmer making the AI) is easier if the first of the two options is the best descriptor for each category. That is, an AI that has a much more difficult job if it works in an environment that is stochastic, dynamic, partially observable, multi-agent, unknown, sequential, and continuous.


'''High-Level Descriptions of AI Agents'''

AIs are made in a variety of ways. When communicating about a new AI, perhaps in a scholarly paper, or perhaps at a business meeting, there are a few questions that can be asked of just about any AI. These can be remembered with the mnemonic PEAS.

* '''Performance Metrics''': How does the AI know it's doing what it's supposed to be doing?
* '''Environment''': What environment does the agent interact with?
* '''Actuators''': How does the AI affect its environment?
* '''Sensors''': How does the AI get information from its environment?

'''Important vocabulary:'''

* perception
* action
* sensor
* actuator
* environment
* performance metric
* deterministic
* stochastic
* partially observable
* dynamic environment
* static environment
* multi-agent environment
* known and unknown environments
* Episodic environment
* Sequential environment
* discrete vs. continuous environments

'''Discussion Question:'''
* Using the classification schemes described above (PEAS, D-SOAKED), describe the following AI agents: a self-driving car, a face-recognition system at an airport, a scheduling system for a trucking business, R2D2.

== Bacaan ''(Reading Comprehension)'' ==
=== Example 1 ===
Commonly used with friend ;
# Hallo, nama saya Anton saya ingin pergi ke pulau Bali pada tanggal 12 Februari 2015 bersama teman saya Carter dia berasal Kanada. Kami akan bertemu dengan teman kami sekaligus pemandu wisata kami bernama Dinda di pantai kuta. (Narasi)
# Carter bertanya siapa yang akan memandu kita.
# Dinda memandu kami selama berlibur di Bali.
# Kami tiba pada pukul 12 siang dan akan menuju hotel setelah makan siang.
# Carter bertanya dimanakah hotel tersebut berada.

Terjemahan (Translation);

# Hello, my name is Anton we want to go to Bali Island in Februari 12, 2015 with my friend Carter from Canada. We going to meet our friend also our tour guide Dinda at Kuta beach. (Naration)
# Carter asking who gonna guide us.
# Dinda guide us during vacation in Bali.
# We arrived at 12 noon and will go to the hotel after lunch.
# Carter asked where the hotel is located.

=== Example 2 ===
Used for traveling alone;
# Halo nama saya Carter saya ingin memesan tiket penerbangan menuju Bali untuk tanggal 12 Februari 2015.
# Pada jam berapa pesawat akan berangkat?

Terjemahan (Translation);
# Hello my name is Carter I want to order airline ticket to Bali for Februari 12, 2015.
# What time the plane going to take off? (note : usually using &quot;leaving&quot; but &quot;take off&quot; is more appropriate)

== Kosa kata ''(Vocabulary)'' ==
* Pemandu = guide (&quot;Tour Guide&quot; means people who guide the tour)
* Wisata = Tour

== Grammar ==
=== Awalan Me- ''(Me- prefix)'' ===

In the passage, you'll notice the first prefix in Indonesian: ''me-''. It's the most important and commonly used in Indonesian.

When it's combined with verbs like above (pandu &amp;rarr; memandu), it means the same as the infinitive form. The only thing is that we emphasize that now the verb is in active form.

=== Awalan Pe- ''(Pe- prefix)'' ===
* ''See above explanation for this section''
In the passage, you'll notice the first prefix in Indonesian: ''pe-''. Which is different than ''memandu''.

''pe-'' here used to denotes Job or profession (pe+pandu &amp;rarr; pemandu).

== Gift Wrap the Cookie Treat ==

Cookie exchange can be the perfect idea for any celebration. The best quality of cookies if wrapped in a handmade packaging, can woo many hearts.



Getting an unusual gift can be a toiling task at times. Of course the age old products like flowers or chocolates might come to your rescue; but it lacks that exclusive touch, especially if it is about expressing your love and admiration for someone special. For that sweet feel, think beyond the usual way and send cookies in the form of gifts. 

You don’t have to [http://www.themmxbakery.com Cookies Suppliers]  be a skilled baker; as the market offers plenty of cookies. MMX bakery can be your best pick to collect array of delicious and colorful cookies. Create the gift packaging by yourself. Although packaging is a vital aspect of presentation, one still create that magic by following these simple methods. The best part of handmade curios are the unique touches which make them special.
  
Get three-four different varieties of flip top version jars. They are very handy. Dress them up with cupcake liners, ribbon, and beautiful tags or notes on them.  Plastic container or jar can also be picked. Embellish the exterior with ribbon or netting by pasting with glue or tape. Fix a large ornamental button or sequin at the center with twine or glue. 

Similarly paper treat bags or sewn paper candy pouches are also equally fun.  Just wrap a single cookie in waxed paper before sewing it inside. 

MMX’s Chocolate Kaju or Fruit Jam cookie can be a sweet gift. Make it sweeter by packing it in an envelope crafted from a square doily, brown or white parchment paper and ribbon. Get a golden or silver doily to add that festive touch. To create a pocket fold the doily and fix with glue. Make another pocket by using parchment paper and put the cookies inside.  To fasten a tag or personal note tie a ribbon around the center of the envelope. 

For smaller cookie gifts, especially if you are buying Choco Chip or Honey Almond cookies from MMX, present them in waxed-paper or cellophane bags; cloak the bags with variegated strings.  You can fold over bag opening and staple to close it. Cut pieces of decorative crafts paper; fold and [http://www.themmxbakery.com Cookies Suppliers in india] attach papers to tops of bags with staple or glue. Embellish the paper with sequins, motifs or fun tags.

Don’t worry if the person you want to give a cookie gift to is diabetic or not a sweet lover. A pack of Jeera or Ajwain Cookies can be the best pick to treat your dear ones. A good packaging can make them more tempting. Tuck them to a printed box lined with waxed paper. Decorate the box top with tulle, rhinestones or ribbon securing with glue! 


Doing something out of the box is always surprising, and what can be more surprising if the surprise is sweet and decorative?

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Object Information == 
This UIKit object is just a regular navigation bar. This wasn't meant to be used by itself as it's included within UINavigationController and UIToolbar. So you'll have to go without a navigation stack if you choose this route. (thanks to DHowett for providing this info.) However, just for informational purposes, it is provided here in case you wanted to create your own class that is dependent on UINavigationBar (whatever that may be.)

== Declaring the Bar ==
Create or open an existing Theos project and open the header file to any view controller in your project. In your view controller's header file, you'll want to place the following code:

&lt;code&gt;
 @interface RootViewController : UIViewController&lt;br /&gt;
 {&lt;br /&gt;
     UINavigationBar *navBar; // This is the navigation bar.&lt;br /&gt;
 }&lt;br /&gt;
 @end
&lt;code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
After you add the navigation bar's label, add the declaration of the label.
&lt;code&gt;
 @interface RootViewController : UIViewController&lt;br /&gt;
 {&lt;br /&gt;
     UINavigationBar *navBar; // This is the navigation bar.&lt;br /&gt;
     UILabel *myLabel; // This is a label that the navigation bar wil hold&lt;br /&gt;
 }&lt;br /&gt;
 @end
&lt;code&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

Now that we have our navigation bar and our label declared in the header, it's time to define them in the implementation file(.h).&lt;br /&gt;

== Defining the Bar ==
Now that we have the navigation bar declared, it's time to define it. Now let's start by opening the implementation of your project (in this case, it's RootViewController.mm). In the implementation file, we will start by adding two blank lines in between the brackets and placing the following code:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;blitzbasic&quot;&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;objc&quot;&gt;&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">To divide, cells go through a process called the cell cycle. The cell cycle consists of 6 steps, and the steps are: Interphase, Prophase, Metaphase, Anaphase, Telophase, and Cytokineses. An easy way to remember the order of the cell cycle is: Is Pat mad at the cat? Also some people group prophase, metaphase,anaphase,and telophase together and call it mitosis. Below is a diagram of what happens during the cell cycle.</text>

      <comment>/* document the option */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Often a feature added into ROSE comes with a set of command line options. These options can enable and customize the feature.

For example, the OpenMP support in ROSE is disabled by default. A special option is need to enable it. Also, the support can be as little as simply parsing the OpenMP directive or as complex as translating into multithreaded code. 

This HOWTO quickly go through key steps to add options. 

===internal flags ===
Options need to be stored somewhere. There are two choices for the storage, as a data member of SgProject v. a data member of SgFile. 
If the option can be as specific as per file, it is recommended to add a new data member to SgFile to save the option value. 

For example, here is a command line option to turn on the UPC language support: 

ROSE/src/ROSETTA/src/support.C  // add a date member for SgFile
&lt;pre&gt;
    // Liao (6/6/2008): Support for UPC model of C , 6/19/2008: add support for static threads compilation
    File.setDataPrototype         ( &quot;bool&quot;, &quot;UPC_only&quot;, &quot;= false&quot;,
                                    NO_CONSTRUCTOR_PARAMETER, BUILD_ACCESS_FUNCTIONS, NO_TRAVERSAL, NO_DELETE);

&lt;/pre&gt;

ROSETTA process this information to automatically generate a member and the corresponding member access functions (set/get_member()).

===process the option ===
Command line options should be handled within  src/frontend/SageIII/sage_support/cmdline.cpp .

File level options are handled by void SgFile::processRoseCommandLineOptions ( vector&lt;string&gt; &amp; argv )


Example code for processing the -rose:openmp option 
&lt;pre&gt;
     set_openmp(false);
     ROSE_ASSERT (get_openmp() == false);
       ...
     if ( CommandlineProcessing::isOption(argv,&quot;-rose:&quot;,&quot;(OpenMP|openmp)&quot;,true) == true )
        {
          if ( SgProject::get_verbose() &gt;= 1 )
               printf (&quot;OpenMP option specified \n&quot;);
          set_openmp(true);
         //side effect for enabling OpenMP, define the macro as required
           argv.push_back(&quot;-D_OPENMP&quot;);
        }

&lt;/pre&gt;


ROSE commandline options should be removed after being processed, to avoid confusing the backend compiler

SgFile::stripRoseCommandLineOptions ( vector&lt;string&gt;&amp; argv ) should have the code to strip off the option. 
===use the option ===
In your code, you can use the automatically generated access functions to set/retrieve the stored option values. 

For example
&lt;pre&gt;
  if (sourceFile-&gt;get_openmp())
     //... do something here ....
&lt;/pre&gt;
===document the option ===
Any option should be explained by the online help output. 

Please add brief help text for your option in void SgFile::usage ( int status ) of ./src/frontend/SageIII/sage_support/cmdline.cpp:</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Usability vs. User Experience (UX)==
Usability pertains to how easy a product is to use.   The user is able to quickly and easily attain their goal.  User experience (UX) includes usability, but also a number of other elements that help make the user’s experience more enjoyable.  Usability asks, ‘Can the user accomplish their goal effectively?’.  UX asks, ‘Did the user have a delightful experience while attaining their goal?’.{{ref|UIE. 2007}}&lt;br /&gt;

[http://semanticstudios.com/publications/semantics/images/honeycombbig.jpg Peter Morville’s honeycomb model] illustrates what UX should encompass.   In order for a product to have value, it should be useful, usable, findable, credible, accessible and desirable.&lt;br /&gt;

==Why is UX important?==
Why is UX important to New York State government?  If we want people to like using our products, feel we are competent and credible, and have a desire to return to our products, then UX is important.{{ref|WDD. 2012}}.User experience mainly involves an individual's emotion, perception and behaviour while using the interface of a specific system or product.It also important aspects of  ownership of product and human computer interaction which are meaningful,affective and practical in nature.Moreover,it also takes into consideration ease of use and efficiency which are the aspects of system.These are considered from end user's perception.Since user experience depends on individual thoughts and perception with regards to the system,it makes it subjective in nature.Due to repetative changes over a period of time as a result of ever changing system usage conditions and modifications to the actual system itself, user experience is dynamic in nature.&lt;br /&gt;
ISO definition of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience User experience] is a person's perceptions and responses that result from the use or anticipated use of a product, system or service.

==Business Analysis and UX==
Business analysis is concerned with business goals.  User experience(UX) design is concerned with user goals.  The two professions overlap a great deal, as illustrated in [http://inews.berkeley.edu/files/BA-UX_Continuum.jpg Rachel Hollowgrass &amp; Allison Bloodworth's BA-UX Continuum Model.]&lt;br /&gt;

In an ideal situation, a UX designer might receive a rough product prototype from a BA, and then make improvements to it.  Visual designers may also be involved to add interest and aesthetics to the prototype. The prototype could then be tested by and feedback attained from real users.  However, because many companies/agencies do not have UX experts, the BA often plays the role of both.{{ref|BAT. 2013}}&lt;br /&gt;

==Steps for Implementing UX==

=== Understand Your Audience ===
Ask a series of questions to establish whom the web site will be communicating to.  Ask questions such as what is the audience age, audience web experience, shared culture, objectives and purpose for coming to site, language/lingo, and what connotations do certain colors have?   The answers will establish the tone, personality and attitude of the web site. &lt;br /&gt;

=== Profiles and Scenarios ===
Profiles and scenarios help to better understand your audience.  A scenario is a situation in which a typical user might use the site.  It captures the user’s goals and objectives. Within a scenario are user profiles, which specify the gender, status, age, education, etc. of a potential user.  Profiles also include a user’s viewpoints and expectations.  It’s important to ask how would each profile expect information to appear and what content organization would make sense t o them.   What is the user thinking or expecting to see?  &lt;br /&gt;

=== Organize your Content===
Sort information your audience would expect to find into similar categories.  
Most organization goes from general to specific.  For instance, a home goods website might go from Bed &amp; Bath&gt;Bedding&gt;Sheets.  This information is helpful even if the user is not familiar with the content.  They can defer that sheets are a type of bedding just from the organization of the site. &lt;br /&gt;

[[File:CnB Organization.jpg|thumb|Crate and Barrel content organization|800px|center]]&lt;br /&gt;

Information is easily absorbed when it is in small chunks and placed where and when the user needs it.  This can be seen often in product overviews online.  The user must drill down to see product details, product reviews or product care instructions. &lt;br /&gt;

[[File:CnB Drill Down.jpg|thumb|Crate and Barrel product overview|800px|center]]&lt;br /&gt;

Ask what labels your audience would expect to see?  Are they familiar terms?  Can they associate the terms with the content under each category?  The audience and their goals should determine the method of categorization.  Utilize the user profiles and scenarios developed previously.  Try walking through your content as a typical user.  In addition, you could allow audience members to comment on how content has been organized and ask if it makes sense.

Once the organization of your content is determined, it should be documented.  A good way to do this is in the form of a tree diagram.  This helps to see the big picture and explain the content structure to others.  In general, there should be no more than seven menu items at any given level.{{ref|SS. 2002}}&lt;br /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">I believe that beginners may be confused by the statement that, if A determines B, this means that &quot;if you know A, you know B&quot;, because that is often literally not true. I may know someone's unique identifier (their passport number, say), but not know their birthdate. It's not even true to say that we &quot;can know&quot; B, because we may not be able to find it out. Rather, I would propose saying that when there is a functional dependency of B on A, it just means that for any given A, there can be at most one B. A person has one, and only one, birthdate, regardless of whether we know it, or even can know it, or not.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behold the following text: &quot;Long-dead authors that are still remembered, are remembered because of the quality of their work. And no work can be stiled that of a genius, until other works have come along against which it can be compared. It is always the dead that are praised, or so claim those who are unsuccessful while alive. Perhaps this is so, partly because some people only revere that which has passed. However, works that have withstood the test of time, have withstood its scrutiny.&quot; (Free after Samuel Johnson's &quot;Preface to Shakespeare&quot;.)&lt;/p&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">it seems that openscad gets out of memory when I include
the same file from different locations or when files
recursively include each other...
----
i.e. I &quot;include &lt;../test.scad&gt;&quot; from one scad-file and from another 
scad-file (running in the same rendering process) I do 
&quot;include &lt;test.scad&gt;&quot;.
so the test.scad file gets included twice (at least twice).
----
Question:
What is known about recursive includes?
Does openscad try to handle it?

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
==The Question Pool==
===Question 1===
;Which type of call sign has a single letter in both its prefix and suffix?
:A. Vanity
:B. Sequential
:C. Special event
:D. In-memoriam
&lt;br&gt;
Reference to CFR 47 Part 97.3(a)(11)(iii).  Special event callsigns are issued by the FCC for temporary usage during public events or contests.  During the annual field day, you will hear many special event callsigns representing radio clubs from across the nation.
===Question 2===
;Which of the following is a valid US amateur radio station call sign?
:A. KMA3505
:B. W3ABC
:C. KDKA
:D. 11Q1176

There are three letters that prefix radio signals from radio stations within the US: 'K', 'W' and 'N'.  'N' is used widely in aviation, but also sees amateur service as well.  The 'W' is used more in eastern regions while the 'K' is used more in the midwest and western US.
&lt;br&gt;
Ham radio callsigns have a number within them, so answer C is incorrect.  A leading number, such as in D, does not represent an American callsign.  Radio callsigns begin with either one or two letters, but never three.  '''The correct answer is B.'''
===Question 3===
;What types of international communications are permitted by an FCC-licensed amateur station?
:A. Communications incidental to the purposes of the amateur service and remarks of a personal character
:B. Communications incidental to conducting business or remarks of a personal nature
:C. Only communications incidental to contest exchanges, all other communications are prohibited
:D. Any communications that would be permitted by an international broadcast station
&lt;br&gt;
Reference to 97.117.  Under no circumstances should amateur radio stations be used to further an economic interest.  Answer B is not correct because business conversation is not appropriate over the air and personal remarks is very bad manners.  The very restrictive answer C almost gives itself away as invalid just as much as the over-generous answer D.  We are left with '''A as our correct answer.'''
===Question 4===
;When are you allowed to operate your amateur station in a foreign country?
:A. When the foreign country authorizes it
:B. When there is a mutual agreement allowing third party communications
:C. When authorization permits amateur communications in a foreign language
:D. When you are communicating with non-licensed individuals in another country
&lt;br&gt;
Reference to 97.107.  When you are in a foreign country, you live often without immunity, under their laws and ordinances.  '''The correct answer A''' tells us that we are able to transmit signals, only when authorized by their governments.There are no workarounds depending on language, licensure of contacts or any private agreement between operators.  Always check with the nation in which you are located regarding their policies and permissions for amateur radio emmissions.
===Question 5===
T1C05 (A)
;Which of the following is a vanity call sign which a technician class amateur operator might select if available?
:A. K1XXX
:B. KA1X
:C. W1XX
:D. All of these choices are correct
&lt;br&gt;
Technician class callsigns that are assigned numerically typically compose of six symbols.  If you are interested in using Morse Code, then the brevity of a vanity callsign may be interesting to you.  You can apply for a shorter callsign with five symbols.  Shorter callsigns with four symbols are reserved for operators with higher license classes.  '''The correct answer is A.'''
===Question 6===
;From which of the following locations may an FCC-licensed amateur station transmit, in addition to places where the FCC regulates communications?
:A. From within any country that belongs to the International Telecommunications Union
:B. From within any country that is a member of the United Nations
:C. From anywhere within in ITU Regions 2 and 3
:D. From any vessel or craft located in international waters and documented or registered in the United States
&lt;br&gt;
Reference to 97.5(a)(2).  '''The correct answer is D.'''
===Question 7===
;What may result when correspondence from the FCC is returned as undeliverable because the grantee failed to provide the correct mailing address?
:A. Fine or imprisonment
:B. Revocation of the station license or suspension of the operator license
:C. Require the licensee to be re-examined
:D. A reduction of one rank in operator class
&lt;br&gt;
Reference to 97.23.  '''The correct answer is B.'''
===Question 8===
;What is the normal term for an FCC-issued primary station/operator amateur radio license grant?
:A. Five years
:B. Life
:C. Ten years
:D. Twenty years
&lt;br&gt;
Reference to 97.25.  You get a whole decade of operator privileges and a two year renewal grace period where your callsign and operator privileges are reserved.  You can only transmit during the ten year period.  '''The correct answer is C.'''
===Question 9===
;What is the grace period following the expiration of an amateur license within which the license may be renewed?
:A. Two years
:B. Three years
:C. Five years
:D. Ten years
&lt;br&gt;
Reference to 97.21(a)(b).  You are given two years to renew your license.  Failing that, you must re-take the exam and be assigned a new callsign.  It is entirely possible that your old callsign may be reassigned as a vanity callsign, so it is ideal to maintain your license and keep your record up to date.  '''The correct answer is A.'''
===Question 10===
;How soon after passing the examination for your first amateur radio license may you operate a transmitter on an amateur service frequency?
:A. Immediately
:B. 30 days after the test date
:C. As soon as your operator/station license grant appears in the FCC’s license database
:D. You must wait until you receive your license in the mail from the FCC
&lt;br&gt;
Reference to 97.5a.  The certificate that you passed the test is only of value at your celebratory dinner that evening.  A copy will be delivered to the FCC where it will be processed.  At that point you are registered in the database with a callsign, you are permitted to operate.  '''The correct answer is C.'''  You don't need the physical copy of the license, just the ability to be verified and identified by fellow hams that hear your signals.
===Question 11===
;If your license has expired and is still within the allowable grace period, may you continue to operate a transmitter on amateur service frequencies?
:A. No, transmitting is not allowed until the FCC license database shows that the license has been renewed
:B. Yes, but only if you identify using the suffix GP
:C. Yes, but only during authorized nets
:D. Yes, for up to two years
&lt;br&gt;
Reference to 97.21(b).  The grace period reserves your callsign and privileges until you renew, but your privilege to emit signals is revoked until you do so.  '''The correct answer is A.'''  In answer D, you do have a two year grace period before you have to re-take the test and be assigned a new callsign, but this grace period does not allow you to transmit.
===Question 12===
;Who may select a desired call sign under the vanity call sign rules?
:A. Only licensed amateurs with general or extra class licenses
:B. Only licensed amateurs with an extra class license
:C. Only an amateur licensee who has been licensed continuously for more than 10 years
:D. Any licensed amateur
&lt;br&gt;
Reference to 97.19.  Any licensed amateur is eligible for a vanity callsigns.  Four symbol callsigns are reserved for high classed amateurs.  Five and Six symbol callsigns are available to all amateurs.  There is also a process for inheriting a callsign from a 'silent key', a recently deceased amateur with whom you are related.  '''The correct answer is D.'''
===Question 13===
;For which licenses classes are new licenses currently available from the FCC?
:A. Novice, Technician, General, Advanced
:B. Technician, Technician Plus, General, Advanced
:C. Novice, Technician Plus, General, Advanced
:D. Technician, General, Amateur Extra
&lt;br&gt;
Reference to 97.9(a) and 97.17(a).  Technician Plus and Novice are retired classes and are no longer offered, although privileges still exist for those members.  Element 2 is the test for Technician, Element 3 is for General and Element 4 is Extra.  The retired Element 1 was a Morse code test for the upgrade to Technician Plus.  '''The correct answer is D.''' 
===Question 14===
;Who may select a vanity call sign for a club station?
:A. Any Extra Class member of the club
:B. Any member of the club
:C. Any officer of the club
:D. Only the person named as trustee on the club station license grant
&lt;br&gt;
Reference to 97.21(a) (1).  There needs to be a single point of contact to act as a consistent interface between the FCC and the organization.  A person will be designated as a trustee on the request documentation.  It's up to that organization if the member must be Extra Class, an officer, or even an active member.  The rule is that a representative must be chosen to interact with the agency.  '''The correct answer is D.'''</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
'''&quot;Authorized and prohibited transmission: communications with other countries; music; exchange of information with other services; indecent language; compensation for use of station; retransmission of other amateur signals; codes and ciphers; sale of equipment; unidentified transmissions; broadcasting&quot;'''
==The Question Pool==
===Question 1===
;With which countries are FCC-licensed amateur stations prohibited from exchanging communications?
:A. Any country whose administration has notified the ITU that it objects to such communications
:B. Any country whose administration has notified the ARRL that it objects to such communications
:C. Any country engaged in hostilities with another country
:D. Any country in violation of the War Powers Act of 1934
&lt;br&gt;
Reference to 97.111(a)(1).  '''The correct answer is A.'''
===Question 2===
;On which of the following occasions may an FCC-licensed amateur station exchange messages with a U.S. military station?
:A. During an Armed Forces Day Communications Test
:B. During a Memorial Day Celebration
:C. During an Independence Day celebration
:D. During a propagation test
&lt;br&gt;
Reference to 97.111(a)(5).  '''The correct answer is A.'''
===Question 3===
;When is the transmission of codes or ciphers that hide the meaning of a message allowed by an amateur station?
:A. Only during contests
:B. Only when operating mobile
:C. Only when transmitting control commands to space stations or radio control craft
:D. Only when frequencies above 1280 MHz are used
&lt;br&gt;
Reference to 97.211(b) and 97.215(b).  Amateur radio is an open community where communications are clean and publicly accessible.  But these communications can be spoofed by malicious parties that aren't neccessarily licensed.  To protect expensive, difficult to access equipment, there are allowances for encrypted communications.  For example, an unauthorized signal to change the telemetry of a satellite could be irreversible or destructive.  '''The correct answer is C.'''
===Question 4===
;What is the only time an amateur station is authorized to transmit music?
:A. When incidental to an authorized retransmission of manned spacecraft communications
:B. When the music produces no spurious emissions
:C. When the purpose is to interfere with an illegal transmission
:D. When the music is transmitted above 1280 MHz
&lt;br&gt;
Reference to 97.114(a)(4) and 97.113(c).  '''The correct answer is A.'''
===Question 5===
;When may amateur radio operators use their stations to notify other amateurs of the availability of equipment for sale or trade?
:A. When the equipment is normally used in an amateur station and such activity is not conducted on a regular basis
:B. When the asking price is $100.00 or less
:C. When the asking price is less than its appraised value
:D. When the equipment is not the personal property of either the station licensee or the control operator or their close relatives
&lt;br&gt;
Reference to 97.113(a)(3)(ii).  Sometimes, 'nets' will have a segment reserved for buy or trade promotion.  These are limited to equipment typically used in a amateur station and should not be habitual (as it may resemble a commercial venture in reselling equipment over the air).  '''The correct answer is A.'''
===Question 6===
;What, if any, are the restrictions concerning transmission of language that may be considered indecent or obscene?
:A. The FCC maintains a list of words that are not permitted to be used on amateur frequencies
:B. Any such language is prohibited
:C. The ITU maintains a list of words that are not permitted to be used on amateur frequencies
:D. There is no such prohibition
&lt;br&gt;
Reference to 97.113(a)(4).  Polite and friendly communication is the rule and good manner in amateur radio communication.  '''The correct answer is B.'''
===Question 7===
;What types of amateur stations can automatically retransmit the signals of other amateur stations?
:A. Auxiliary, beacon, or Earth stations
:B. Auxiliary, repeater, or space stations
:C. Beacon, repeater, or space stations
:D. Earth, repeater, or space stations
&lt;br&gt;
Reference to 97.113(d).  Beacons are not interactive devices, but transmitters that transmit a signal continuously for the sake of helping the radio operator predict propogation and band 'openness'.  With that, A and C are excluded.  There is no such thing as an Earth station, so D is also excluded.  A space station is basically a repeater that is elevated to a high orbit.  '''The correct answer is B.'''
===Question 8===
;In which of the following circumstances may the control operator of an amateur station receive compensation for operating the station?
:A. When engaging in communications on behalf of their employer
:B. When the communication is incidental to classroom instruction at an educational institution
:C. When re-broadcasting weather alerts during a RACES net
:D. When notifying other amateur operators of the availability for sale or trade of apparatus
&lt;br&gt;
Reference to 97.113(a)(3)(iii).  If you are transmitting to demonstrate amateur radio while employed and 'on the clock' at an educational institution, you are allowed to transmit as part of an expectation from your workplace, for pay.  '''The correct answer is B.'''
===Question 9===
;Under which of the following circumstances are amateur stations authorized to transmit signals related to broadcasting, program production, or news gathering, assuming no other means is available?
:A. Only where such communications directly relate to the immediate safety of human life or protection of property
:B. Only when broadcasting communications to or from the space shuttle
:C. Only where noncommercial programming is gathered and supplied exclusively to the National Public Radio network
:D. Only when using amateur repeaters linked to the Internet
&lt;br&gt;
Reference to 97.113(5)(b).  '''The correct answer is A.'''
===Question 10===
;What is the meaning of the term “broadcasting” in the FCC rules for the amateur services?
:A. Two-way transmissions by amateur stations
:B. Transmission of music
:C. Transmission of messages directed only to amateur operators
:D. Transmissions intended for reception by the general public
&lt;br&gt;
Reference to 97.3(a)(10).  '''The correct answer is D.'''
===Question 11===
;When may an amateur station transmit without identifying?
:A. When the transmissions are of a brief nature to make station adjustments
:B. When the transmissions are unmodulated
:C. When the transmitted power level is below 1 watt
:D. When transmitting signals to control a model craft
&lt;br&gt;
Reference to 97.119(a).  '''The correct answer is D.'''
===Question 12===
;Under which of the following circumstances may an amateur radio station engage in broadcasting?
:A. Under no circumstances
:B. When transmitting code practice, information bulletins, or transmissions necessary to provide emergency communications
:C. At any time as long as no music is transmitted
:D. At any time as long as the material being transmitted did not originate from a commercial broadcast station
&lt;br&gt;
Reference to 97.111(b)(4,5 and 6).  '''The correct answer is B'''</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">الشفافيات التعليميه

تعريف الشفافيه التعليميه :

يقصد بالشفافية صفيحة من الاسيتات أو البلاستيك الشفاف ، وسميت بهذا الاسم لأنها 

تسمح باختراق الأشعة الضوئية الصادرة من جهاز العرض لإخراج صورة مكبرة 

وثابتة على شاشة العرض أو الحائط ، ومتى ما استخدمت لغرض تعليمي . أطلق عليها 

شفافية تعليمية

تعريف اخر :   

عباره عن محتوى معرفى لماده  مرجعيه تحتوى على العناصر الرئيسيه لموضوع 

معين يراد تقديمها الى فئه معينه من المتعلمين من خلال جهاز عرض الشفافيات 

تصنيف الشفافيات التعليميه :

أولا: من حيث المحتوى

شفافيات مكتوبة 

شفافيات مرسومه 

شفافيات مكتوبه ومرسومه معا 


تصميم وإعداد وسائل تعليمية تفي باحتياج المعلمة ولاسيما المستجدة أو غير المختصة  

تزويد المدارس بالوسائل التعليمية التي صممت ونفذت في هذا المشرو

ثانيا : من حيث الشكل والتصميم

شفافية عادية من طبقة واحدة &quot;مفردة&quot;

شفافية مركبة : من طبقتين أو أكثر حيث تحمل كل طبقة جزء من المادة العلمية وتسمى &quot;شفافية تراكمية&quot;

شفافية مغطاة : أي ذات موضوع واحد تستخدم قطعة لحجب بعض أجزاء المادة العلمية ويطلق عليها &quot;شفافية محجوبة&quot;

شفافية متحركة : باستخدام أجهزة تساعد على الحركة مثل جهاز الاستقطاب أو جهاز الحاسب الآلي

ثالثا: من حيث الإنتاج

يدوية : الكتابة أو الرسم اليدوي على الشفافية مباشرة

آلية : حيث يتم استخدام الطرق الآلية والأجهزة لإنتاج هذه الشفافيات


مميزات و فوائد استخدام الشفافيات التعليمية :

1.	تقديم المواضيع بتسلسل و أسلوب شيق يجذب انتباه الطالبات .

2.تدعيم الشرح النظري بالرسومات و الصور مما يؤدي الى تحقيق التعلم .

3.ولة انتاجها يدويا و إمكانية انتاجها بالنسخ الحراري ( التصوير ) و بالتالي يمكن إنتاج عدد كبير منها .

4.كساب الطالبات مهارات الاتصال و التعلم و تنظيم الافكار و ذلك عند اشتراكهم في 

تقديم العروض الخاصة بهم و مشاركتهم في تصميم و انتاج هذه الشفافيات
 .
5. اكساب الطلاب مهارات العمل الجماعى 

6. جذب انتباه الطلاب 

7. سهوله تصميمها وانتاجها 

8. توصيل المعلومه بطريقه سؤيعه الى الطلاب 

9.غير مكلفه فى انتاجها اذ  انها تحتاج الى خامات بسيطه فى اعدادها 

 -10توفير إمكانية تعلم الظواهر الخطرة والنادرة .  

 -11التغلب على البعدين الزماني والمكاني

 -12تنمية الرغبة والاهتمام لتعلم المادة التعليمية . 

 -13تقديم حلول لمشكلات التعليم المعاصر : . 

 -14توفير الجهد والوقت . 

 -15المساعدة على تذكر المعلومات وإدراكها خصوصاً عند استخدام السمع والبصر .


فوائد استخدام الشفافيات التعليمية:-

• سهولة انتاجها يدويا او آليا وانتاج عدد كبير منها.

• تقديم مواضيع الدرس بتسلسل واسلوب شيق يجذب انتباة المتعلمين.

• تدعيم الشرح النظرى بالرسومات والصور بما يؤدى لتحقيق تعلم ناجح.

• رخص تكلفتها بالنسبة للوسائل الاخرى وتوافر اجهزة عرضها.

• اكساب المتعليمين مهارات الاتصال والتعلم وتنظيم الافكار وترتيبها.

• تدعيم دور المعلم فى عرض المعلومات المتشابهة والتفرقة بينها بمقارنة اوجة التشابة والاختلاف وعمل ربط بينهما
 
ولكى تؤدى الشفافيات دورها فى العملية التعليمية يجب مراعات الآتى :-

• اختيار شفافيات واضحة ومعدة جيدا ولا يوجد فيها عيوب حتى لاتصرف نظر الطلاب عنها.

• عدم عرض الشفافيات لمدة طويلة حتى لاتبعث الملل والتعب فى نفوس المتعلمين.

• ترك فترة زمنية مناسبة بين عرض الشفافيات حتى يتمكن المعلم من الشرح عليها ومناقشتهم فيها.

• اطفاء جهاز العرض بين الحين والآخرحتى لايؤثر بالسلب على الجهاز والمتعلمين.

• يجب تقليل الكلمات المكتوبة والتركيز على مفهوم واحد حتى لايحدث تشتيت للمتعلم.

ولابد للمعلم من الابتكار والتنويع والتشويق فبدلا من استخدام شفافيات عادية يجعلها 

مركبة ويعمل على عرضها بطريقة مثيرة تجذب انتباة المتعلمين نحوها واستخدام 

عنصر اللون فى عمل الشفافية حتى يجذب اكبر قدر من حواس المتعلمين حتى تبلغ 

الوسيلة غايتها وتحقق الهدف المنشود منها.

أهمية استخدام الشفافيات التعليمية :

 -1عرض صور وأشكال متنوعة للمعلومات والحقائق 

 -2تدريس مهارة المقارنة والتصنيف بين الأشياء

-3عرض المادة التعليمية بصورة متتابعة 

 -4تسمح بتكبير الأشكال الصغيرة 

 -5سهولة إنتاجها وقلة تكلفتها

-6 سهولة تخزينها وإعادة استخدامها 


نواحي يجب مراعاتها عند عرض الشفافيات :

عرض الشفافية لفترة طويلة ( لمدة دقيقة )قد يبعث الملل و التعب لذا يجب تغييرها بعد 

الفترة المناسبة لعرضه

 ترك فترة زمنية مناسبة بين عرض الشفافيات .

يفضل إطفاء مصباح جهاز العرض أثناء تغيير الشفافيات

 : طرق عرضها :

1. أحادية مفردة .

2. شبابيك

أن توضع أوراق فوق الشفيفة على شكل شبابيكتغطي بعض العناصر 

3. شرائط

 أن تقص الشفيفة نفسها على شكل شرائط تحوي كل منها عنصر 

4. إزاحة

 أن توضع ورقة فوق الشفيفة و تزاح شيئا فشيئا 

5. متراكمة(مركبة 


أن ترسم في كل شفيفة أو يكتب فيها جزء من الكلام ثم توضع فوق بعضها الى أن يكتمل 

الموضوع أو الصورة - و لابد من وجود هيكل أساسي في الشفيفة الرئيسية .

خطوات إعداد الشفافية التعليمية:

1 حدد المادة العلمية المراد أعدادها رسما أو كتابة وتأكد من دقتها العلمية.

2. استخرج الفقرات الرئيسية للموضوع وحاول أن تكون مختصرة ومعبرة.

3. يجب تصميم الشفافية على ورقة عادية أولا وداخل أطار لا تزيد مساحته عن 15×20.

4. يستحسن وضع كل موضوع على شفافية خاصة .

5. اكتب المادة بخط واضح وببنط كبير وبسطور متباعدة .

6. أذا كان هناك رسم فضعه في مكان بارز من الشفافية .

7. تصور الشفافية أو تعاد كتابتها باليد على ورق شفاف .

8. ضع الشفافية داخل أطار كرتوني واكتب عليه المرجع وتاريخ الإنتاج 


معايير تصميم وإنتاج الشفافيات: 

 -1أن تقتصر الشفافية على معالجة موضوع واحد .

 -2 الا تزدحم بالمعلومات او الالوان.

 -3 أن تكون الكتابة بحروف كبيرة مقروئة واضحة.

 -4 أن تكون الالوان متناسقة ومماثله للواقع .

 -5ان يبتعد المعلم أو التلميذ إذا كان مبتدءاً فى عمل الشفافيات إستعمال الاقلام ذات الحبر الثابت .

 -6أن يتدرب منتج الشفافية على ورق عادى قبل إنتاج الشفافية .

 -7عند تطوير الشفافية يجب أن ثتثنى المنتج الشفافية أى معلومات ثانوية .

 -8 أن يستخدم المنتج للشفافية سطحاً ناعماً لن ذلك تمكنة من الكتابة بسهولة .

 -9 أن يستخدم المنتج الشفافية حرارية إذا ارداد تصوير المادة المنقولة عليها .

 -10أن يتقن عمل إطار الشفافية لحفظها.

 -11أن يمسك الشفافية من الاطراف لمنع إتساخها أو طبع بصمات الاصابع عليها أثناء الانتاج .

 -12أن يبدأ المنتج من كتابة أو الرسم من اعلى الىأسفل مع الاستعانة بقطع ورق نظيفة لوضعها تحت يدة لتساعد على منع إتساخ الشفافية .

معايير إستخدام الشفافيات فى مواقف التعليم :



أ‌- قبل العرض :

 -1التأكد من صلاحية الجهاز وتوفرة فى حجرة الدراسة قبل بداية الدرس وتوافر الشفافيات المطلوبة حسب موضوع الدرس مع وجود شفافيات إضافية لاستعمال أثناء سير الدرس وحسب الحاجة .

 -2إعداد الشاشة على أن تكون مائلة بدرجة 45للتخلص من إنحراف الصورة.

 -3إعداد المكان من حيث تجمع المتعلمين وتحديد مكان الجهاز امام المتعلمين .

 -4 توزيع المطبوعات أو الصور الصماء وذلك لإضافة بيانات أو تكملة رسومات مما يحقق المشاركة الجماعية .


ب‌- أثناء العرض:

 -1جلوس المدرس أو وقوفة أحياناً محازياً للجهاز والتأشير المباشر على الشفافية ويجب إطفاء اللمبة أثناء العمل فى حالة شرح المدرس وتعليقة لجزب إنتباه الطلبة إلية وإعادة تشغيل اللمبة فى حالة الحاجة إلى إستخدام الجهاز ثانية كإضافة بيانات ورسومات وأشكال ومعلومات وكل هذا حسب ما يتطلب الموقف التعليمى .

 -2إمكانية قيام الطلبة بتشغيل الجهاز وعرض الموضوع والشرح والمناقشة حسب الموقف التعليمى وخاصة عند تكليف الطلبة بعمل مشاريع جماعية من حيث إنتاج الشفافيات وإستخدامها .

ج- بعد العرض :

1- متابعة المناقشة وعمل التقارير ومناقشتها وإجراء التجارب لتكملة البيانات أو رسوم ، إمكانية إعادة عرض الشفافيات حسب الحاجة.


معايير اختيار الشفافيات التعليمية :

1-	 ان يكون محتوى الشفافية حديثا وصحيحا علميا

2-	 ان تكون الشافية مناسبة للاهداف التعليمية وطبيعة المحتوى

 -3    ان تكون الشفافية مناسبة للاجراء ( الحدث ) التعليمى  

فهل ستستخدم فى عرض المعلومات او فى التقويم وهكذا 

  

 -4 ان تكون الشفافية مناسبة لمستوى المتعلمين وخبراتهم : من حيث نوع المثيرات وكم المعلومات , ونوع الخط وحجمة ... الخ 




 -5 ان تكون الشفافية بسيطة غير معقدة : 

بمعنى ان تشمل على فكرة زاحدة فقط , بحيث تبدو بسيطة التفاصيل وغير مزدحمة بالمعلومات , لان الشفافية المزدحمة المعقدة تربك المتعلم وتضلله . وقد اثبتت البحوث ان عدد العناصر المصورة فى الشفافية الواحدة ينبغى الا يزيد عن ثلاثة او اربعة هناصر على الاكثر كما ينبغى مصاحبة الرسوم بكلام مكتوب مختصر مفيد .



 -6عنوان الشفافية :

فالشفافية ينبغى أن تشتمل على عنوان قصير ومعبر يحتوى من 3 :5 كلمات ويوضع فى أعلى الشفافية فى المنتصف.

 -7الاعتماد على العناصر البصرية المرسومة :

وذلك بقدر الامكان ، بحيث تقتصر الكلمات على شرح الصور والرسوم .

 -8تسلسل العرض وتنظيم وحداتة وعناصره المكتوبة والمرسومة : 

وذلك بطريقة تجذب الانتباه, وتساعد على تتبعه وقراءته واستيعابه بسهولة . ويجب التاكيد على ان الشفافية التعليمية , كشاشة الكمبيوتر , ليست كتابا او كراسة تسطر فيها كل شى فى صفوف متراصة , ولكنها صفحة واحدة , يجب استغلالها الاستغلال الامثل , وان تكون الكتابة فيها منظمة بطريقة مثيرة وجذابة , فى شكل كتل فقرات قصيرة ( بلوكات ) , وتشمل كل كتلة على فكرة واحدة مختصرة 



 -9 تحديد اسلوب العرض ونوع الشفافية , مفردة ام متعددة الطبقات : 

والشفافية المفردة هى التى يعرض محتواها على صفيحة واحدة , اما متعددة الطبقات ( المتطابقة او المتراكبة ) فهى التى يعرض محتواها على عدة شفافيات , لا تزيد عن اربع , تركب فوق بعضها البعض , وتعرض متتابعة الواحدة تلو الاخرى , ويتوقف ذلك على طبيعة الموضوع ذاتة 



 -10الالتزام بمنطقة الرسالة : 

لا نكتب على كل مساحة الشفافية لسببين الاضاءة تكون قوية فى مركز سطح العرض , وتضعف كلما بعدنا عنه والسبب الثانى هو ظهر تشوية فى الكتابة على حواف الصورة المعروضة , وهى المنطقة التى تظهر جميع محتوايتها على الشاشة , بوضوح ودون تشوية او تحريف . وابعاد هذه المنطقة هى 7.5 ×9.5 بوصة (19×24 



 -11الوضع الافقى والوضع الراسى للشفافية:


المعايير الواجب توافرها في الشفافيات :

1ـ سهلة الإنتاج من حيث توافر المواد الخام اللازمة لإنتاجها.

2ـ توفر من وقت المعلم خلال زمن الحصة.

3ـ تتيح الفرصة ليتفاعل المعلم مع الطلاب والتعليق المباشر علي الرسومات والصور .

4ـ صناعتها من خامات جيدة حني يمكن استخدامها أكثر من مرة في عملية الشرح وفي مراجعة المادة التعليمية .

5ـ استخدام ألوان زاهية وجذابة تثير الانتباه وتمثيل الأشياء بألوانها الطبيعية .

6ـ البساطة ،بحيث يجب أن تعرض الشفافية فكرة واحدة فقط .

7ـ توازن الرسومات داخل الشفافية . 

8ـ أن تكون صحيحة من الناحية الفنية والعلمية .

9ـ ان تكون مناسبة للموضوع ومساعدة علي فهم الدرس .

10ـ ان تكون الوسيلة مرتبطة بموضوع الدرس .

11ـ مناسبة ليعمل عليها الطلاب ويتفاعلوا معها .

طرق انتاج الشفافيات التعليميه :

-	إنتاج الشفافيات التعليمية بالطريقة اليدوية

ونحن هنا بحاجة إلى وجود شفافية خاصة تسمى بالشفافية اليدوية 

وإلى أصل موجود على ورق معتم يراد نقله على الشفافية اليدوية 

وإلى أقلام خاصة بالكتابة على الشفافية اليدوية وتكون من النوع 

الثابت وبحاجة إلى إطار لتثبيت الشفافية عليه بعد الانتهاء لأن 

الإطار يحافظ على الشفافية كما يمكننا تسجيل موضوع الشفافية عليه 

، وما على المعلم إلا وضع الشفافية اليدوية على الأصل والقيام 

بعملية الشف العادية .

-	إنتاج الشفافيات التعليمية الحرارية:

ونحن هنا سنستخدم آلة النسخ الحراري وشفافية خاصة بذلك تسمى 

بالشفافية الحرارية وإلى أصل يراد نقله على تلك الشفافية وإلى إطار 

تثبت عليه الشفافية ، ومن ثم يقوم المعلم بوضع الشفافية على الأصل 

ويدخلها عبر الجهاز الخاص بالنسخ الحراري ومن ثم ينتظر 

خروجها من الجهة الأخرى من الجهاز وقد تم طباعتها على الشفافية 

ومن ثم يثبتها على الإطار . ويفضل قبل إدخال الأصل مع الشفافية

 الحرارية المرور على جميع محتوى الأصل بالقلم الرصاص ، لأن 

هذا الجهاز يعمل بالأشعة تحت الحمراء التي لا تستطيع اختراق

 المادة الرصاصية وبالتالي فإن وضوح المحتوى في النهاية على 

الشفافية الحرارية المطبوعة سيكون أفضل ، وعموماً يوجد على 

جهاز النسخ الحراري عداد فكلما قللنا قيمة الرقم على العداد كلما

 تعرضت الشفافية الحرارية والأصل لكمية أكبر من الأشعة تحت

 الحمراء الأمر الذي يساعدنا على زيادة وضوح المحتوى المطبوع 

على الشفافية التعليمية الحرارية .

كيف نفرق بين الشفافية اليدوية والشفافية الحرارية ؟

عن طريق الفروق التالية : - 

1لشفافية اليدوية أكثر سمكاً من الشفافية الحرارية . 

2- عادة تكون الشفافية الحرارية تأتي مقطوعة ( مشرومة ) في 

إحدى زواياها الأربع . 

3- عادة تأتي الشفافية الحرارية ملونة ، والشفافية اليدوية لا تأتي 

ملونة . 

ما الأفضل إنتاج الشفافيات التعليمية بالطرقية الرأسية أم بالطريقة 

الأفقية ؟ لماذا ؟ 

إن الأفضل هو إنتاجها بطريقة أفقية ، وذلك للأسباب التالية : 

1- لكي نتجن ونبعد عن العيب المصاحب للجهاز الذي سوف 

تعرض عليه الشفافية لاحقاً ، وهذا العيب ما يعرف بعيب الإنحراف 

الزاوي فنجد أن الضلع العلوي للمستطيل المضاء الناشيء من 

الجهاز أكبر في المقاس من الضلع السفلي الأمر الذي سوف يؤثر 

على محتويات الشفافية عند عرضها بطريقة رأسية ، ونستطيع البعد 

عن هذا العيب عن طريق إمالة الشاشة التي يعرض عليها المحتوى

من الأعلى إلى الأمام حتى يعتدل الضلعان العلوي والسفلي ، ولكن 

بعض المعلمين يستخدم جدار الفصل كشاشة عرض لهذا الجهاز 

الأمر الذي لا نستطيع معالجة هذا العيب لذا يفضل إنتاجها بطريقة 

أفقية . 

2- بعض الفصول الدراسية تتميز بدنوء السقف العلوي ، وإذا كانت 

الشفافية معدة بطريقة رأسية فإن بعض محتويات الشفافية من 

المحتمل أن يتوزع ما بين الجدار الأمامي للطلاب والسقف العلوي 

للفصل الأمر الذي سيخل بمحتويات الشفافية ، لذا يفضل إنتاجها

 بطريقة أفقية
 . 
ملاحظة

يمكن للمعلم أن يستخدم أي مادة شفافة ينفذ من خلالها الضوء ويكتب 

عليها مباشرة أمام طلابه ، خصوصاً عند وضع بعض التعليقات 

الملازمة لشرح المعلم . وليس بالضرورة في ذلك استخدام نوع 

خاص من الشفافيات .
شفافيات الحاسب الآلي:

إن إنتاج شفافيات الحاسب الآلي ، يعتبر من طرق إنتاج الشفافيات 

التعليمية بالطرق الآلية ، لكن هذه الطريقة من الطرق الحديثة التي 

يستخدمها المعلم في إنتاج الشفافيات التعليمية ، وتتميز هذه الطريقة 

بعدة مميزات كالتالي : -

1- لا تتطلب إلى مهارة خاصة عند إنتاجها .

2- عدم التقيد ببعض المعايير كحجم الخط وارتفاعه إلخ

3- ضمان وضوح المحتويات ، وضمان جودة الإخراج 

إن هذا النوع كذلك يحتاج إلى نوع خاص بالشفافيات ، فهناك 

شفافيات خاصة بالحاسب ، بل أن هناك شفافيات خاصة بكل طابعة 

مستخدمة مع الجهاز . وهي تتميز بوجود سطحين أحدهما خشن 

والآخر أملس ( ناعم ) ييم الطباعة على الجهة الخشنة .

كيف تنتج شفافية تعليمية باستخدام الحاسب ؟


المعلم يستخدم برنامج الوورد أو أي برنامج آخر من برامج الحاسب الآلي ،

 لكن عندما يريد أن يخرج محتويات الشاشة على ورق الطابعة عليه أن يضع 

بدلاً من الورق شفافيات الحاسب الآلي فقط ، وعلى المعلم أن يحرص أن 

تكون الطباعة على الجهة الخشنة من الشفافية .

نموذج لتنفيذ درس باستخدام الشفافيات :

اسم الدرس :

مجموعة الحيوانات والطيور 

الصف الثاني الابتدائي الفصل الدراسي الأول 

المادة: اللغة العربية
 
عناصر الدرس :

الحيوانات والطيور- كيف تعيش الحيوانات والطيور- احتياجات الحيوانات والطيور-أصوات بعض الحيوانات والطيور
أهداف الدرس
في نهاية الدرس ينبغي أن يكون التلميذ قادرا على أن : 
يحدد الصفات الخاصة بالطيور – يفرق بين الطيور والزواحف وحيوانات المزرعة- يستنتج احتياجات الحيوانات والطيور – يقلد أصوات بعض الحيوانات والطيور 
متي يستخدم المصدر: أثناء الدرس 

خطوات عمل الشفافية للدرس :

* جهز الخامات والأدوات 

* أقرأ المحتوى العلمي في الكتاب المدرسي وحدد الحيوانات والطيور المناسبة للدرس

* ارسم بالقلم الرصاص في منطقة الأمان على الورق الأبيض 

* توضع قطعة من البلاستيك فوق الأصل الورقي أو الأصل المطبوع ( 

الموجود في الكتاب أو غيره)
حاول أن تثبتهما معا بشريط لاصق

* حدد الأشكال فوق الشفافية بالأقلام الفلوماستر ثم افصل البلاستيك عن 

الأصل الورقي وبهذا تكون الشفافية جاهزة للعرض 

كيف تستخدم المصدر :

* تحضير جهاز العرض 

* تهيئة التلاميذ وإثارة انتباههم لموضوع الدرس 

* عرض الشرائح الواحدة تلو الأخرى حسب موضوع الدرس  

بطاقة تقويم لتصميم واستخدام الشفافيات لعبارات نعم لا

محتوى الشفافيات مرتبط بأهداف الدرس 

الشفافيات مصممة لعرض الرسوم والأفلام 

الشفافية تركز على مفهوم واحد فقط 

حجم حروف الكتابة واضح ومقروء 

الرسم الموجود في الشفافية على درجة عالية من التنسيق 

الشفافية غير مزدحمة بتفاصيل غير مهمة 

الألوان المستخدمة متناسقة مع الشكل 

عرض الشفافيات ساعد على وجود بيئة تفاعلية تعلمية 

عرض الشفافيات قد أكسب المتعلمين القدرة على ربط المفاهيم 

محتوى الشفافية واضح عند عرضه على الشاشة 


تجنب ازدحام الشفافية بمفاهيم كثيرة 

محتويات الشفافية تخدم المدرس 

الشفافيات ساعدت المعلم على تحقيق الأهداف التعليمية

      <text xml:space="preserve">I think the author should re-read all the information about the night that the Potter's were killed, and what happened to Voldemort. In everything that I have read, and from JKR's interviews, Voldemort did not curse Harry. The curse rebounded upon Voldemort while cursing Lily, according to what Dumbledore tells Snape, and what JKR verifies. When the curse rebounded, and hits Voldemort, a piece of his soul was cleaved from the whole, and attaches itself to Harry, creating the scar. One can negate what Hagrid said, as he didn't really know. Dumbledore's words, and JKR is what one should go by in cannon.

Last, JKR said in an interview, that the house in Godric's Hollow did not belong to the Potter's, but did not state who it belonged to. It might be good to add this fact in the text that alludes to it.

:No. Please check your references before you make concrete statements like this. The Prince's Tale, DH:33, UK / Canada p. 550 says
::'Tell him that on the night Lord Voldemort tried to kill him, when Lily cast her own life between them as a shield, the Killing Curse rebounded upon Lord Voldemort, and a fragment of Voldemort's soul was blasted apart from the whole...'
:While it does say, as we have known from long before, that Lily's sacrifice had protected him, it does not say that it was rebounding from Lily when it killed Voldy. It does not say who was being cursed at the time the spell rebounded.
:And more completely, straight from Voldemort's memory, DH:17, UK / Canada p. 281-282.
::''&quot;The green light flashed around the room and she dropped like her husband. The child had not cried all this time, he could stand, clutching the bars of his cot, and he looked up into the intruder's face with a kind of bright interest, perhaps thinking it was his father who hid beneath the cloak, making more pretty lights, and his mother would pop up any moment, laughing &amp;mdash;''
::&quot;''He pointed the wand very carefully into the boy's face: he wanted to see it happen, the destruction of this one, inexplicable danger. The child began to cry: it had seen he was not James. He did not like it crying, he hasd never been able to stomach the small ones' whining in the orphanage &amp;mdash;''
::&quot;'Avada Kedavra!'
::&quot;''And then he broke: he was nothing, nothing but pain and terror, and he must hide himself...''&quot;
:That would seem to me to be conclusive evidence that (a) Voldy did curse Harry, and (b) that was the point where the curse rebounded upon Voldy. Dumbledore couldn't know, he wasn't there, and JKR has exhibited the occasional lapse in memory when discussing the books, notably in GoF where she has Lily and James exiting Voldy's wand in the wrong order. In my opinion, the reference for canon must be the books, as printed, allowing for occasional revisions to correct [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Marcus Flint|flints]].
:As to ownership of the house, that is not particularly germane... but could be added easily enough. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 04:29, 3 February 2014 (UTC)</text>

== The two Germanys ==
{{IB/Group 3/History/Summary Output|The two Germanys}}
Germany had, by 1949, become two countries. It was this division of Germany that did much to fuel the COld War in the years up to 1961. Significant differences existed between West Germany and East Germany in the economic and political spheres.

=== Economic differences between West Germany and East Germany ===
{{IB/Group 3/History/Summary Output|Economic differences between West Germany and East Germany}}
Economically, West Germany was larger than East Germany with a larger population and greater industrial output. It had also received Marshall Aid. In fact, West German in the 1950s and 1960s experienced what became known as the 'economic micracle' and accordingly, the standard of living of most West Germans rapidly increased. Meanwhile in East Germany, leader Walter Ulbricht's post-1959 programmed of forced collectivisation of farms and of socialisation was disastrous for the economy. With the hardship and drop in livign standard that this entailed, many East Germanys fled to the West via Berlin.

=== Political differences between West Germany and East Germany ===
{{IB/Group 3/History/Summary Output|Political differences between West Germany and East Germany}}
Politically, West Germany had democracy. In East Germany there had been no free elections since 1946 and, by the 1950s, it was a rigidly Stalinist, authoritarian state. Discontent with the situation in East Germany manifested itself in the riots of 1953. Workers in East Berlin and elsewhere in the East rose up in revolt. The riots were quickly put down with the help of Soviet tanks. This was t he first major rebellion within the SOviet sphere of influence.

As a result of these differences, there were no further efforts by either side to reunite as one country. Changing the situation seemed more risky than maintaing the status quo. However, the potential for conflict remained, and particularly in the increasingly untenable situation of Berlin, which Khrushchev described as 'a fishbone in East Germany's gullet.'

== Why did the Berlin Crisis develop? ==
=== Khrushchev and the crisis of 1958 ===
{{IB/Group 3/History/Summary Output|Khrushchev and the crisis of 1958}}
After the Berlin Blockade, Berlin remained divided under joint American−British−French−Soviet occupation and the economic and political inequalities of the two Germanys could be clearly seen in the differences between West Berlin and East Berlin. West Berlin appeared to be a glittering, dynamic example of what capitalism could achieve. This factor, along with the political freedoms and open lifestyle of the West Berliners, encouraged East Germans to escape frm the hardship of the East to the propsperity and freedom of the West through the open frontier in Berlin. All East Berliners ad to do was to travel from Eat Berlin to West Berlin, which could be done by train or subway, and from there emigration to West Germany was easy.

This exodus of mainly young and skilled East Germans − which was encouraged by the West − meant that between 1945 and 1961 about one-sixth of the whole German population took the opportunity to move eto the West via Berlin. In addition, the divided city of Berlin allowed the West to maintain a unique propaganda and espionage base 186 (110 miles) deep into East German territory.

In 1958, Khrushchev proposed a peace treaty that would recognise the existence of the two Germanys. One the 27th of Novemeber 1958, he then demanded that Berlin should be demilitarised. Western troops withdrawn and Berlin changed into a 'free city.' If the West did not agree to these chaanges within six months, Khrushchev threatened that he would turn over control of access routes to the Western sectors of Berlin to the GDR (East Germany). This was clever diplomacy; it would allow the GDR to interfere at will with traffic using land corridors from the FRG (West Germany). The Western allies would then have to negotiate with the GDR, which would force them to recognise the existence and sovereignty of the GDR. It was a dangerous situation. The West could not contemplate losing face over Berlin or giving up its propaganda and intellgence base, but to resist Khrushchev could mean the possibility of war.

Why was Khruschev prepared to precipitate this Cold War crisis? Evidence from the Soviet archives points to the fact that the most important influences on Khrushchev's policy making at this time were:

* Soviet fear of West Germany acquiring nuclear weapons,
* concern over the failing East Germany economy, and
* pressure frm Walter Ulbricht, leader of the GDR.

In the face of Western outrage at his proposal, Khruschev dropped his ultimatum. He was successful, however, in forcing the Allies to discuss the German question. In February 1959, they agreed that a foreign ministers' conference should meet in Geneva in the summer. At Genevea both sides put forward proposals for German unity, but no agreement was secured. Khruschev then met in the United States with Eisenhowever in September 1959, but again no agreement was reached. A follow-up summit to be held in Paris in May 1960 was called off at the last minute after the shooting down over the Soviet Union of an American U-2 spy plane.

=== The Paris Summit and the U-2 incident, May 1960 ===
{{IB/Group 3/History/Summary Output|The Paris Summit and the U-2 incident, May 1960}}
By the time the leaders met in Paris, the situation had already altered. The US had discovered,v ia its spy planes, that the USSR was already well behind the US in terms of Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs), while West Germany was no longer prepared to make any concessions on West Berlin. Then, on the 1st of May 1960, came the announcement that a Soviet missile had successfully brought down a US U-2 spy plane over the USSR. Eisenhower, embarrassed that his previous denials of spy planes had been revealed (he had claimed they were merely weather planes), and concerned at the effectiveness of Soviet missile technology, refused to apologise for the incident. Khruschev cancelled Eisenhower's proposed visit to the Soviet Union. The incident doomed the Paris summit to failure.

The Soviets proposed a confederation between the two German states, with both leaving their respective military alliances (NATO and the Warsaw Pact). They also suggested the internationalisation and demilitarisation of Berlin. These proposals were countered by the Western powers by suggestions for a united Germany and all-German elections, along with some German disarmament. One reason the West was keen to resist the moves outlined by the Soviet Union was that Berlin was an important propaganda, espionage and intelligence base behind the Iron Curtain.

As these discussions dragged on, an increasing number of East Germans migrated to the West. By 1959, these numbered around 200,000 a year − many of them young technicians and other skilled workers. This had a serious effect on the weak Eastern German economy, and was thus encouraged by the West. Not suprisingly, the GDR leader, Walter Ulbricht, began to press for action.

Ideally, Ulbricht wanted West Berlin to be added to East Berlin, removing the Western presence in the GDR. Khruschev, however, preferred the continued division of Berlin if it allowed him to gain concessions frm the West over West German rearmament − in partiuclar, to prevenet West Germany possessing nuclear weapons. Encouraged by another Soviet technological first − manned space flight − and the failure of the US-backed Bay of Pigs incident in CUba, Khruschev thought he might secure a better deal with the new US president, John F. Kennedy.

=== Kennedy and fexible response ===
{{IB/Group 3/History/Summary Output|Kennedy and fexible response}}
John F. Kennedy was elected president in 1960. His approach to containment was a policy of 'flexible response.' In terms of his wider Cold War policy, it involved:

* more spending on conventional forces,
* englarging the nuclear arsenal,
* continuing with CIA covert work,
* giving economic aid to developing countries to help them resist Communism, and
* continuing negotiations with the Soviet Union.

Therefore, Kennedy broadened the range of options for resisting Communism, as it seemed to his administration that the Communist threat was much more diverse than it had been previously. Not only was it mroe geographivcally diverse, but Communist forces now were giving assistance to revolutionary movements in the developing world. With felxible response, Kennedy was moving away from Eisenhower's policy of 'massive retaliation' or, as he put it,' We intend to have a wider choice than humiliation or all-out nuclear war.'</text>

== The two Germanys ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;{{#ifeq:{{{transcludesection|The two Germanys}}}|The two Germanys|
* Germany became two seperate political spehres by 1949, divided by the Western and Eastern powers.
}}&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

=== Economic differences between West Germany and East Germany ===
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;{{#ifeq:{{{transcludesection|Economic differences between West Germany and East Germany}}}|Economic differences between West Germany and East Germany|
* East Germany had a larger industrial output, larger population, and was larger geographically.
* East Germany received Marshall aid and underwent an 'economic miracle' and had good living standards.
* West Germany's leader was Walter Ulbricht.
** He adopted a forced collectivisation of farms and of socialisastion.
** This was disasterous for the economy.
}}&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

=== Political differences between West Germany and East Germany ===
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;{{#ifeq:{{{transcludesection|Political differences between West Germany and East Germany}}}|Political differences between West Germany and East Germany|
* West Germany had democracy.
* East Germany had no free elections from 1946 onwards, Stalinist and authoritarian.
* Rebellions in East Germany not only protested but fled to the East. Some where contained.
* As a result, there were no efforts by either side to unite Germany.
* Khrushchev described Berlin as 'a fishbone in East Germany's gullet.'
}}&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

== Why did the Berlin Crisis develop? ==
=== Khrushchev and the crisis of 1958 ===
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;{{#ifeq:{{{transcludesection|Khrushchev and the crisis of 1958}}}|Khrushchev and the crisis of 1958|
* West Berlin had political freedom and an open lifestyle which encouraged East Germans to migrate, leaving the harship of the West, via Berlin.
* It was mainly young and skilled East Germans that escaped, one-sixth of the German population.
* The West used Berlin as propaganda and as an espionage hotspot, inside Eastern territory.
* 1956 Khrushchev proposed a peace treaty.
* 27 November 1957, Khrushchev demanded Berlin should be demilitarised and Western troops withdrawal.
* Clever diplomacy: If the West did not decide in six months he would surrender access routes to Western sectors to the GDR.

&lt;div class=&quot;nonumtoc&quot;&gt;
__TOC__
&lt;/div&gt;


The TRUNCATE TABLE command deletes '''all''' rows of a table without causing any triggered action. Unlike the DELETE command it contains no WHERE clause to specify individual rows.

With respect to the TRUNCATE TABLE command most DBMS show significant better performance than with DELETE command. This results from the facts the DBMS can empty the table (and its indexes) as a whole. It's not necessary to access individual rows.
*There is - per definition - no WHERE clause.
*No trigger action will be launched - per definition.
*The transaction locks the complete table.
*If there is an [[Structured Query Language/Foreign_Key#DROP_TABLE_/_TRUNCATE_TABLE|FK-constraint]] from table ''t1'' to ''t2'', the command &lt;code&gt;'TRUNCATE TABLE t2'&lt;/code&gt; will fail. This holds true independent from the question whether any row of ''t1'' refers actually to one of the rows of ''t2'' or not. The DBMS checks only the existence of the FK-constraint definition.


The syntax of the TRUNCATE TABLE command is very simple.

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot; style=&quot;background:LightGreen&quot;&gt;
TRUNCATE TABLE &lt;tablename&gt;;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Example ==

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
-- Delete ALL rows of the table 'myTable'
TRUNCATE TABLE myTable;
-- In most DBMS ROLLBACK is not possible - in opposite to situations with a DELETE command.
&lt;/source&gt;

== An Analogy ==
To illustrate the difference between the TRUNCATE TABLE command and the DELETE command (without a WHERE clause) one can imagine a trucker, who wants to empty a trailer full of sand at a construction site. To do so he has two possibilities. Either he empties the trailer in that he tilts him - this corresponds to the TRUNCATE TABLE command. Or he climbs onto the trailer and throws down one grain of sand after the next - this corresponds to the DELETE command.

== Exercises ==
&lt;div style=background:gold&gt;
Delete all rows of table 'person_hobby' using the DELETE command.&lt;br /&gt;Verify that there are no rows left in 'person_hobby'.&lt;br /&gt;Delete all rows of table 'hobby' using the TRUNCATE TABLE command.&lt;br /&gt;What will happen? (Consider that there is an FK constraint from the table empty 'person_hobby' to 'hobby'.) 
&lt;/div&gt;
{{ExerciseSolution|width=100%|text=
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
-- Delete all rows of 'person_hobby' with a DELETE command
DELETE FROM person_hobby;
COMMIT;

-- Are there any rows?
SELECT count(*) FROM person_hobby;

-- Try TRUNCATE TABLE command:
TRUNCATE TABLE hobby;
-- An exception will be thrown. Although there is no row in 'person_hobby' refering a row in 'hobby',
-- the definition of the FK constraint exists. This is the reason for the exception.
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

&lt;div style=background:gold&gt;
What will happen in the above example, if the TRUNCATE TABLE command is replaced by a DELETE command?
&lt;/div&gt;
{{ExerciseSolution|width=100%|text=
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
-- As there is no row in 'person_hobby' refering to 'hobby', the DELETE command deletes all rows in 'hobby'.
DELETE FROM hobby;
COMMIT;
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

&lt;div style=background:gold&gt;
The original data of the example database can be reconstructed as shown on the [[../Example Database Data|example database data]] page.
&lt;/div&gt;

text=In the Cave of Crystals, the water contained very little calcium and sulfate. It was harder for the materials to enter into contact, unite and bunch together to form crystals. This is why there are few crystals and they have taken a long time to grow, but they have grown very big.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;nonumtoc&quot;&gt;
__TOC__
&lt;/div&gt;


Hint: Be carefull and deactivate [[../COMMIT and ROLLBACK#AUTOCOMMIT|AUTOCOMMIT]].

In many cases applications want to store rows in the database without knowing whether this rows previously exist in the database or not. If the rows exist, they must use the UPDATE command, if not, the INSERT command. To do so the following construct is often used:

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
-- pseudocode
IF (SELECT COUNT(*) = 0 ...) THEN
  INSERT ...
ELSE
  UPDATE ...
;
&lt;/source&gt;

This situation is unpleasant in many ways:
* There are two roundtrips between application and DBMS, either SELECT + INSERT or SELECT + UPDATE.
* The application must transfer one row after the other. A 'bulk storing' is not possible because the evaluation of the criterion which decides between INSERT and UPDATE may lead to different results from row to row.
* The syntax is spread across three SQL statements. This is error-prone.


To overcome the disadvantages the SQL standard defines a MERGE command, which contains the complete code shown above in one single statement. The MERGE performs an INSERT or an UPDATE depending on the existence of individual rows at the target table.

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot; style=&quot;background:LightGreen&quot;&gt;
-- Define target, source, match criterion, INSERT and UPDATE within one single command
MERGE INTO  &lt;target_table&gt;      &lt;target_table_alias&gt;  -- denote the target table
      USING &lt;source_table&gt;      &lt;source_table_alias&gt;  -- denote the source table
      ON    (&lt;match_criterion&gt;)                       -- define the 'match criterion' which compares the source and 
                                                      -- target rows with the same syntax as in any WHERE clause  
  WHEN MATCHED THEN
UPDATE SET column1 = value1 [, column2 = value2 ...]  -- a variant of the regular UPDATE command
  WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN
INSERT (column1 [, column2 ...]) VALUES (value1 [, value2 ...]) -- a variant of the regular INSERT command
;
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

== Description ==
The target table is named after the MERGE INTO key word, the source table after the USING key word.

The comparision between target rows and source rows, which is necessary to decide between INSERT and UPDATE, is specified after the ON key word with a syntax, which is identical to the syntax of a WHERE clause. If this comparision matches, the UPDATE will be performed, else the INSERT. In simple cases the comparision compares Primary Key or Foreign Key columns. But it is also possible to use very sophisticated conditions on any column. 

In the 'MATCHED' case a variant of the UPDATE follows. It differs from the regular UPDATE command in that it has no table name (the table name is already denoted after the MERGE INTO) and no WHERE clause (it uses the match criterion after the ON key word).

In the 'NOT MATCHED' case a variant of the INSERT follows. For the same reason as before the target table is not named within the INSERT.

== Example ==

Create a table 'hobby_shadow' to store some of the 'hobby' rows. The subsequent MERGE command shall perform an INSERT or an UPDATE depending on the existence of correlating rows.

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
-- store every second row in a new table 'hobby_shadow'
CREATE TABLE hobby_shadow AS SELECT * FROM hobby where MOD(id, 2) = 0;
SELECT * FROM hobby_shadow;

-- INSERT / UPDATE depending on the column 'id'.
MERGE INTO  hobby_shadow                   t   -- the target
      USING (SELECT id, hobbyname, remark
             FROM   hobby)                 s   -- the source
      ON    (t.id = s.id)                      -- the 'match criterion'
  WHEN MATCHED THEN
UPDATE SET remark = concat(s.remark, ' Merge / Update')
  WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN
INSERT (id, hobbyname, remark) VALUES (s.id, s.hobbyname, concat(s.remark, ' Merge / Insert'))
;
COMMIT;

-- Check the result
SELECT * FROM hobby_shadow;
&lt;/source&gt;

The MERGE command handls &lt;u&gt;all&lt;/u&gt; rows, but there is only 1 roundtrip between the application and the DBMS. Some of the rows are handled by the INSERT part of MERGE, others by its UPDATE part. This distinction may be observed by the last part of the column 'remark'.

== Use Case ==
Typical use cases for the MERGE command are [[w:Extract,_transform,_load|ETL]] processes. Often those processes have to aggregate some values for a grouping criterion (eg: a product line) over a time period. The first access per product line and period has to insert new rows with given values, subsequent accesses have to update them by increasing values.

== Extentions ==
The SQL standard defines some more features within the MERGE command.

&lt;u&gt;WHEN clause&lt;/u&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The WHEN MATCHED and WHEN NOT MATCHED clauses may be extended by an optional query expression like &lt;code&gt;AND (place_of_birth = 'Dallas')&lt;/code&gt;. As a consequence, it's possible to use a series of WHEN MATCHED / WHEN NOT MATCHED clauses.

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
... 
  WHEN MATCHED AND (t.hobby_name IN ('Fishing', 'Underwater Diving')) THEN
UPDATE SET remark = concat('Water sports: ', t.remark)
  WHEN MATCHED AND (t.hobby_name IN ('Astronomy', 'Microscopy', 'Literature')) THEN
UPDATE SET remark = concat('Semi-professional leisure activity: ', t.remark)
  WHEN MATCHED THEN
UPDATE SET remark = concat('Leisure activity: ', t.remark)
...
-- The same is possible with WHEN NOT MATCHED in combination with INSERT
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;u&gt;DELETE&lt;/u&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Within a WHEN MATCHED clause it is possible to use a DELETE command instead of an UPDATE to remove the matched row. This feature may be combined with the previous presented extension by an optional query expression. In the SQL standard the DELETE command is not applicable to the WHEN NOT MATCHED clause.

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
-- Update 'Fishing' and 'Underwater Diving'. Delete all others which have a match between source and target.
...
  WHEN MATCHED AND (t.hobby_name IN ('Fishing', 'Underwater Diving')) THEN
UPDATE SET remark = concat('Water sports: ', t.remark)
  WHEN MATCHED THEN
DELETE
...
&lt;/source&gt;

== Caveat ==

The MERGE command is clearly defined by standard SQL. The command itself as well as the extensions described before are implemented by a lot of DBMS. Deviating from the standard most implementations unfortunatelly use different and/or additional keywords and - sometimes - different concepts. Even the intoductive key words MERGE INTO may differ from the standard.

== Exercises ==

&lt;div style=background:gold&gt;
A) Create a new table 'contact_merge' with the same structure as 'contact'.&lt;br /&gt;B) Copy row number 3 from 'contact' to 'contact_merge'.&lt;br /&gt;C) Use the MERGE command to insert/update all E-Mail-adresses from 'contact' to 'contact_merge' and add the e-mail-protocol name to the contact values (prepend column contact_value by the string 'mailto:').
&lt;/div&gt;
{{ExerciseSolution|width=100%|text=
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
-- Create table and copy one row
CREATE TABLE contact_merge AS SELECT * FROM contact WHERE id = 3;
SELECT * FROM contact_merge;

-- INSERT / UPDATE depending on the column 'id'.
MERGE INTO  contact_merge                             t   -- the target
      USING (SELECT id, person_id, contact_type, contact_value
             FROM   contact
             WHERE  contact_type = 'email')           s   -- the source
      ON    (t.id = s.id)                                 -- the 'match criterion'
  WHEN MATCHED THEN
UPDATE SET contact_value = concat('mailto:', t.contact_value)
  WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN
INSERT (id, person_id, contact_type, contact_value) VALUES (s.id, s.person_id, s.contact_type, concat('mailto:', s.contact_value))
;
COMMIT;
 
-- Check the result
SELECT * FROM contact_merge;
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

&quot;Nocturnal animals&quot;. Time: 2000s. Place: Spain

[[File:Hedgehog-en.jpg|thumb|A hedgehog]]

[[File:Swift Fox.jpg|thumb|A fox]]

The Tall Man is accosted by the Small Man, who tells him that he knows of his status as an illegal immigrant, but promises not to divulge this information provided he does as he says, mainly to serve him as a companion to talk with. The Tall Woman, wife to the Tall Man, reveals to him that a man with a hat flirted with her, but he is not worried by that. One day, he meets the Short Man at the zoo, where they discuss the habits of nocturnal animals, such as the hedgehog. He cites from from the &quot;Thousand and One Nights&quot; a saying derived from the Greek lyric poet Archilochus (c. 680–c. 645 BC) whereby &quot;The fox knows many things, the hedgehog only one, but of utmost importance.&quot; The Short Woman, wife to the Short man, is an insomniac, listening to a late-night television program meant to help such people, loud enough to disturb the Tall Man and the Tall Woman living in the apartment below. The Tall Woman receives the visit of the Short Man to repair an electric disturbance in her apartment. While poking around for the source of the problem, he enters their bedroom and touches the bed. Worried about his attitude, she goes over to her husband's place of work as a night-time orderly in a hospital and mentions their neighbor's visit, at which time the Tall Man reveals the nature of their relation, one he feels is under control. The Tall Woman disagrees. She finds the Short Man to be a disquieting figure. She threatens to leave the apartment with or without her husband. One day, the Tall Man greets the Short Woman in a park. They speak of her husband. She asks him what she can do to help. When she later meets her husband, they discuss their marital troubles, but to no avail. True to her word, the Tall Woman heads for the train station alone, to meet a man she just met. Meanwhile, the Tall Man goes up to the Short Man's apartment, where he meets his wife, who wishes to dance with him, much to the satisfaction of the Short Man, whose marriage problem may thereby be resolved. The Tall Man is the fox, the Short Man the hedgehog.

Ulrich Richter, co-president of the oil company, Richter &amp; Havers, is angry that his business partner, Garret, has convinced the board of directors on reducing the price of oil without consulting him. Because of the danger Garret represents within the company, Ulrich convinces Nold Havers, the other co-president, and Nold's son, Kurt, of the need to have him murdered. He hires Basilio, an employee at his private firing range and secretly his bastard son but adopted by Jeremias, mainly responsible for preparing the firearms. Basilio succeeds in killing Garret and burying him without a trace. To consolidate power within their ranks, Ulrich forces his daughter, Elena, to marry Kurt. Ulrich's son, Evard, arrives for the wedding ceremony of his sister. Since being told he accidently shot his mother at the age of ten, when actually his father killed her at the firing range, Evard has lived aloof from business matters, to his father's disappointment. To his further grief, Evard wants to divulge he is Basilio's half-son, because the latter, unconscious of the incestuous relation, has been for several years Elena's lover. Unable to convince his son to desist, Ulrich hires Celio, another employee at the firing range, to murder him. A third employee, Fabio, informs Celio that Jeremias, whom all three employees hate, has accidently fallen down a flight of stairs and is seriously injured. Celio believes Fabio pushed him down, which the latter denies in great fear. Jealous at Kurt's happiness, Basilio murders Elena during the wedding ceremony and escapes with her dead body. When Evard catches up to Basilio, he gives up and hangs himself. On seeing Celio arrive, Evard immediately understands he is to be his father's next victim and submits himself to being shot to death. Ulrich and Nold decide to cede control of the company to Kurt. At the end of a business deal with a cardinal concerning a Renaissance painting from the Vatican, Ulrich starts feeling sick and begs him to absolve his sins during confession, but becomes anguished when the pardon comes too easily. He dies terrified at imagined flames about his person. To Fabio's disappointment, Celio, as the new boss, becomes a second Jeremias to him, a tyrant bitterly complaining about the quality of his work.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In the early 21st century, social drama in Switzerland is given strong impetus by Jakob Bärfuss (?-?) with &quot;Alices reise in die Schweiz&quot; (Alice's voyage in Switzerland, 2007) concerning the limits of euthanasia. 

==Alice's voyage in Switzerland==

Time: 2000s. Place: Hamburg, Germany, and Zurich, Switzerland.

In an apartment in Germany, Dr Gustav Strom, an euthanasialogist, explains to Alice the procedure involved in preparing for assisted suicide. She must travel to Switzerland, where the procedure is legal, though with many constraints on the unpaid practitioner. He advises Alice to tell her mother, Lotte, of her intention. Thinking that Lotte might try to prevent her suicide, she is hesitant to do so, but at last agrees to. At first Lotte does not believe her, then tries to make her change her mind, but without success. Hearing of Gustav's practice and believing in its humanitarian purpose in alleviating needless sufferings, Eva asks Gustav for a position as his assistant, which he accepts, specifying details on how she must look in front of the client. &quot;No makeup, no perfume,&quot; he orders. &quot;You are young: that alone may be a provocation.&quot; A second client, John, an Englishman, is about to be injected with a lethal dose of pentobarbital when he asks for a glass of whiskey. It makes him drunk, reminding him that his mother believed one spent eternity in the state one died in, so that he calls off their agreement, though promising to return. Since her daughter has already tried to kill herself in the past, Gustav tries to obtain from Lotte her consent to his services, but she resists. Subject to a chronic disease whose symptoms have worsened, John returns with a crutch, but is nevertheless unable to submit to the injection, though once more promising to return. Because of his exaggerated commitment to assisted death, Gustav is eradicated from the Order of Physicians. As a result, he is unable to prescribe pentobarbital, but must give John flunitrazepam, a minor tranquillizer, combined with covering of the head with a plastic bag. Though previously he had approved of the doctor's humanitarian purposes, the owner of his apartment changes his mind. Because of his persistence, Gustav is arrested and interviewed by a psychiatrist, but then released. John returns yet another time, but, despite being an estimated two weeks from death as a result of his disease, he is unable once again to submit to the procedure. After leaving her mother in a numbed state, Alice returns to the doctor in a shabby apartment, drinks the transquillizer, but, contrary to their agreement, asks the doctor to place the bag over her head instead of herself. For legal reasons, Gustav insists she does so herself. Alice obeys and dies.

In a Catholic grammar school, Father Flynn sermonizes on the subject of human bonds, specifying that negative ones can also be binding. &quot;Doubt can be a bond as powerful and sustaining as certainty,&quot; he declares. Sister Aloysius, principal of the school, criticizes Sister James for excessive friendliness towards the students. She acquiesces relunctantly to this charge. She later informs her superior that the only black boy in the school, Daniel Muller, is not teased by the other boys as one would expect because Father Flynn serves as his protector. Sister Aloysius immediately becomes suspicious of this relationship. Sister James informs her that after leaving Father Flynn's company at the rectory, the boy appeared strange in class and his breath smelled of alcohol. More suspicious than ever, Sister Aloysius asks to see Father Flynn in her office to question him about Muller. His explanation of the boy's strange behavior is that he stole altar wine and drank some. She does not believe this story and calls the boy's mother to learn more. She knows nothing. Despite learning about the sister's suspicions, she prefers to let things remain as they are. Sister Aloysius does not accept this. To his face, she accuses Father Flynn of an illicit relation with the boy. Though denying any wrongdoing, he quits his position to obtain a better one elsewhere. To Sister Aloysius, this is tantamount to admitted guilt, to Sister James a subject of doubt.

&quot;A perfect wedding&quot;. Time: 2000s. Place: USA. 

&quot;A perfect wedding&quot; text at http://www.panix.com/userdirs/meejr/html/perfectwedding.html

On the wedding day of Meridee and Amadou, the bride's brother, Jonathan, is heard to make cynical comments. &quot;A bride and groom start out in life with their whole marriage, the whole center of their lives from then on, based on things they think are a total lie,&quot; he says. Before the ceremony, the bridegroom decides to takes a walk in the woods without knowing there is quicksand there. Jonathan is amazed Amadou was never told of that. The wedding party start to worry as his absence is more and more prolonged. Meridee decides to look for him in the woods, where she meets James, the boyfriend of her sister Tessa. &quot;I saw you standing here feeling lost and abandoned and my heart just went out to you,&quot; he says. Meridee impulsively kisses him then quickly goes on her way. When Tessa arrives, he comments favorably on the human susceptibility of feeling disoriented. &quot;Maybe sometimes it's not bad to be lost, Tessa, to be reminded how it is to step out into the unknown, because whether a person is afraid or not there is a certain sense of exhilaration that comes from just throwing yourself into new territory; it sets you free,&quot; he says. He asks her to marry him, but she refuses. When Jonathan's girlfriend, Ariel, arrives, she says: &quot;Seeing you standing here feeling lost and abandoned, my heart just went out to you.&quot; She kisses the bewildered James. As he rushes out, she finds Jonathan and sounds out his feelings about marriage. He appears uninterested. After he leaves, she finds Amadou. Seeing her depressed, he kisses her. The kiss is seen by Meridee. &quot;I thought the next big event of my life would be getting married, but now I see the next big event will be dying,&quot; she dejectedly declares. &quot;I've pursued you and pursued you and pursued you in every way for all these years and you have rejected me and rejected me and rejected me...I keep trying over and over to let you go, and even as I say that it takes my breath away to think that I would let go of the only person in my life I have ever loved so completely, you've been my life itself to me, that's what I find so hard to let go of and why, when I come close to letting go, it feels like the only death I'll die.&quot; To console her, Ariel kisses her. They kiss passionately. When Amadou's family arrive to the party, they find no Amadou. His father, Vikram, chats about his preferences concerning the female body and his wife, Djamila, about Hindu deflowering rituals. He mentions his first wife left him. The guests and wedding planners commiserate with him. Heated words are exchanged among Amadou's family members. Willy throws a mudball at Frank's chest and Edmund retaliates in the same manner. When Vikram intervenes, Frank throws a mudball at him and a general melee ensues in a mud-pit until Maria cries out there may be danger in that they may all be standing on quicksand. Instead of fighting, they try to extricate themselves from the mud. Meridee enters to say she no longer wants to marry Amadou. In the confusion, Frank is told that his mother has just died. He sees two men carrying in her coffin. He collapses, then digs a hole to be with her, helped by the wedding guests. Seeing an opportunity to make more money, the wedding organizers propose to plan the funeral, but the guests simply join hands in a circle, keen, and ululate. Champagne is passed around. Vikram warns his son not to be overhasty in his decision. &quot;When you come to the end of your life, what do you think will have mattered to you at all except that you knew another person and loved her?&quot; he says. With the wedding paraphernalia about to be wasted, two of the planners, Issac and Dieter, decide to marry each other, by which time the bride changes her mind and surprises the groom by choosing Ariel instead of him. This agreed to, Tessa confesses she has always loved Amadou and he her. In the general joy of a double wedding, Frank reaches down to take a handful of dirt and slowly pours it out of his hand on the coffin.

      <comment>/* the client source code use a tempotype should we read prototype ? */ Answer.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== If I have an implementation that may be good enough to add to the prototype implementation list.  If so, how would this be added? ==

I'm teaching myself some design patters and have what I think may be a workable python implementation of the prototype design pattern.  I didn't see a way to edit the page, so figured I would drop it off here.  There are probably some NOOB aspects to this, but I've only been programming professionally for 6 months, and I had to stop writing code altogether for 6 months after that due to some traveling so there are likely some obvious refactorings you can spot right off the bat, or maybe I have something that works, but not the way I intended because I'm not 100% sure what's going on behind the scenes...please be gentle...

I think the strength of this decorator approach for prototyping is how simple it is client-side.  Whether I did it 100% right, the fact that all the client needs to do is throw &quot;@Prototype&quot; on top of the class definition and then they can call &quot;Clone()&quot; on any object created with that definition and assign the result to a variable...and that's it...

# Decorator class which allows an object to create an exact duplicate of itself

    def _clone_func(self):

        # be used to create an exact duplicate of that decorated object
        clone = self.cls()
        # Call _copy_func to ensure the attributes of the objects are identical
        self._copy_func(self.instance, clone)

:It seems to be the implementation of the Prototype design pattern. I have read the code. I don't know all the functions in Python but the code is logical. I have added your code. You say that you don't manage to put this on the page. I don't know what has embarrassed you. The mechanism should be the same for the page and for this talk page. The only issue is that we can't edit a single section, we have to edit the whole page. This is due to the template of the page.

== the client source code use a tempotype should we read prototype ? ==
after a quickly read of exemple source code (c++ and java):
* c++ source code :
the 'client source code' use a tempotype should we read prototype ?
: I renamed the variable ''temporaryPrototype''. Every variable name should be explicit. This variable could have been named with anything because we are in the client code. It's not the design pattern implementation. I admit the term ''prototype'' in ''temporaryPrototype'' is confusing as this object is not the prototype of any other object. I have [http://www.compileonline.com/compile_cpp_online.php tested the code].
* java source code :
the 'new' instruction is never used ?
: Yes, it is used at line 6, PrototypeTest class. [[User:Ftiercel|Ftiercel]] ([[User talk:Ftiercel|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Ftiercel|contribs]]) 20:27, 27 February 2014 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Lua (not &quot;LUA&quot;, which is incorrect although common) is a powerful, fast, lightweight and embeddable programming language. It is used by many frameworks, games and other applications. While it can be used by itself, it has been designed to be easy to embed in another application. It is implemented in ANSI C, a subset of the C programming language that is very portable, which means it can run on many systems and many devices where most other scripting languages would not be able to run. The purpose of this book is to teach Lua programming to anyone regardless of previous programming experience. The book can be used as an introduction to programming, for someone who has never programmed before, or as an introduction to Lua, for people who have programmed before but not in Lua. Since there are many development platforms and games that use Lua, this book can also be used to learn to use Lua and then to use it in that development platform.

This book aims to teach usage of the latest version of Lua. This means it will be attempted to regularly update it as new versions of Lua come out (Lua releases are infrequent enough that this should not be too difficult). Currently, the book is up-to-date for Lua 5.2, which is the latest version. If you are using Lua in an embedded environment that uses an older version of Lua in the 5.x branch (Lua 5.0 and Lua 5.1), the material is probably sufficiently relevant for you.

== Putting on a condom hands ==

[[File:CondomUse.jpg|thumb|How to put on a condom]]
[[File:Condom placement demonstration.ogv|thumb|Video Demo]]
# Check the condom and do not use if:
# * The expiration date has expired;
# * The integrity of the packaging (foil) is broken condom , (if you click on it clearly felt an air bubble , then everything is ok - tightness of packaging is not broken)
# * The condom does not fit (too big or small;)
# * Condom durable enough (at [[anal sex]] );
To avoid damage of the condom package should open hands (to avoid damage to long nails) , without any additional tools : scissors or nail files ( and especially not the teeth) . Nadorvite one side of the foil so as to not damage the condom .
#'' ' Take another condom if:'''
# * The condom has an uneven color or color had changed;
# * Steels brittle , dry or sticky to the touch;
# Squeeze your thumb and forefinger spermopriemnik (papilla at the end of a condom) to let the air out (presence of air in it - a common cause of condom breakage) and bring a condom to [[w:penis|penis]] , in a state of [[w:erection|erection]] .
# If the [[w:foreskin|foreskin ]] still covers the head , you can pull it back (depending on your preference, you can not do), then hold the drive with one hand, gently expand the condom over the entire length of the member towards its base.
# After the [[w:ejaculation|ejaculation]] pull [[w:penis|penis]] of [[w:vagina|vagina]] , thus hold the condom at the base to prevent it from slipping.
# Remove the condom.
# Tie condom so as to prevent leakage of seminal fluid.
# Put the used condom in the waste tank (pre- wrapped in paper , so as not to devote extraneous details of his sex life ) . '' ' Keep a condom down the toilet !'''

== Putting on a condom mouth ==
# Best of all, if your partner is lying on your back or bent elbows.
# Open the package carefully ;
# Take a condom in her mouth so that the tip of the condom ( spermopriemnik ) located behind the teeth (not to damage the condom ) and squeeze his tongue or lips so that there is not enough air ;
# You can drop a little lubricant ( grease) on the tip of the penis, which will increase sensations during intercourse .
# From the lips unroll the condom to the end;

'''Ingredients Marzipan biscuits:'''&lt;br /&gt;
100 g       icing sugar&lt;br /&gt;
2 (60 g)    pasteurized egg whites&lt;br /&gt; 
300 g       marzipan (pure)&lt;br /&gt;
(You can use flat, round shortbread (or other) biscuits instead 
(or even sponge circles))

'''Ingredients Vanilla filling:'''&lt;br /&gt;
250 g       sugar&lt;br /&gt;
75 g        water&lt;br /&gt;
110 g       glucose syrup&lt;br /&gt;
4 (140 g)   pasteurized eggwhites &lt;br /&gt;
15 g        sugar&lt;br /&gt;
1/2         vanilla pod/bean&lt;br /&gt;
1 tea spoon icing sugar&lt;br /&gt;
''optional''            concentrated or dry flavoring

'''Ingredients chocolate coating:'''&lt;br /&gt;
500 g  dark (58-64%) chocolate

'''Procedure marzipan biscuits:'''&lt;br /&gt;
Mix icing sugar and egg whites in a bowl.&lt;br /&gt;
Mix the egg-sugar mixture to the marzipan over several rounds, until the dough is uniform.&lt;br /&gt;
Use a pastry bag to make flat, round biscuits, approximately 5 cm. in diameter.&lt;br /&gt;
Bake in oven at 190°C until golden - approximately 10 min.&lt;br /&gt;
Cool to ambient temperature.&lt;br /&gt;

'''Filling:'''&lt;br /&gt;
Mix 250 g of sugar, the water and glucose syrup in a saucepan, and warm to exactly  117°C. &lt;br /&gt;
Meanwhile beat  the egg whites lightly with 15 g of sugar.&lt;br /&gt;
Pour the hot sugar mixture directly into the egg whites, while still beating.&lt;br /&gt;
Beat the egg white and sugar mixture until very stiff.&lt;br /&gt;
Open vanilla bean and scrape out the seeds, mix these with the icing sugar. Add this to the egg white mixture along with any flavoring, and stir slowly until uniform in appearance. Avoid deflating the meringue.&lt;br /&gt;
Use a pastry bag to make 5 cm tall meringue tops on the marzipan biscuits. Make sure the foam fastens to the biscuit, otherwise it will fall off while coating.&lt;br /&gt;
Leave at room temperature or put in refrigerator while preparing chocolate coating. 

'''Chocolate coating:'''
Chop the chocolate finely up.&lt;br /&gt;
Melt half the chocolate carefully in a bain-marie (or a pot floating in water in a bigger pot). Aim for 48-50°C.&lt;br /&gt;
Put the other half of the chocolate into a bowl (make sure it is big enough for the entire cake can be submerged in chocolate). Add 2/3 of the melted chocolate, and let the two melt together WITH OUT HEATING! Only add more melted chocolate if the lumps do not melt away. ''The temperature must not exceed 34°C''. This will keep the chocolate shiny and crunchy.&lt;br /&gt;
Dip the meringue tops into the chocolate. Make sure all the meringue is covered. The biscuit is up to you. Sprinkle or roll in desiccated coconut. Leave to set.&lt;br /&gt;
Do not reheat the chocolate if it starts to set, use instead some of the warm melted chocolate.</text>

Demultiplexers take one data input and a number of selection inputs, and they have several outputs.
They forward the data input to one of the outputs depending on the values of the selection inputs.
Demultiplexers are sometimes convenient for designing general purpose logic, because if the demultiplexer's input is always true, the demultiplexer acts as a [[decoder]].
This means that any function of the selection bits can be constructed by logically OR-ing the correct set of outputs.

==Introduction==

According the [[wikipedia:Copenhagen_interpretation|Copenhagen interpretation]] matter exhibits a [[wikipedia:wave-particale duality|wave particle duality]] which states that a quantum exhibits the properties of both particles and waves. Because the nature of a quantum is unknown, it does not mean that the particle or wave are real physical entities. But until a certain limit one can calculated as if it were classical particles or waves, with classical formula.

For quanta with mass, like the electron, the shape of this wave is a solution of the Schrödinger_equation. The [[wikipedia:Schrödinger_equation#Time-dependent_equation|result]] is a small wave packet around the position of the electron, which in distance degreases fast, but never becomes zero. So in principle the wave is present everywhere in the universe, but very small. According quantum mechanics the wave determines the probability of a particle to be observed at that location, by squaring the wave:

&lt;math&gt;\int_0^{2\pi} \! I^2\,d\omega t&lt;/math&gt;

For the massless quanta the Schrödinger equation has no solution, so there is no formula for the shape (envelope) of the wave of a photon. Therefore there are no clear descriptions and a lot of opinions about this shape. The general view is that there still is a wave&quot;packet&quot;, which length is determined by the source. In time this would be the coherence time, for which typical time scales are mentioned of nanoseconds for atoms, picoseconds for semiconductors or femtoseconds for light from the sun. Also for photons the wave is supposed to determine the probability, calculated with the same formula.

Although there is no formula, the wave of photon shows often with various experiments, especially with the double slit. By interpreting the results it is possible to draw conclusion about its shape. For the convenience of explanation in the following it will look a real physical wave is mentioned, but that is never the case. In all examples the wave is used as a tool to calculate what the experiments show, so will sometimes also show different behaviour then a normal wave.


==The double slit experiment==

The [[wikipedia:double-slit experiment]] is especially suitable for showing the wave properties of photons because the wave is split in two slits in two waves, introduce a time (so phase) difference while compared both by interference. 
	
[[File:Wavephoton1.GIF]]
	
If light passes a single slit (1) it will diffract, resulting in a wide &quot;wave&quot; on the detector. With a second slit (2) there will be two separate waves, which add up at the detector. At places outside the centre of the detector there will different path lengths of both waves causing a phase difference. The sum of both waves will show an interference pattern. With a single photon the effect will be the same: in time the same wave will be build up with single photons. So what the wave shows, is the probability of absorption of a photon at the that position of the detector, according the quantum mechanical formula above.

[[#Double slit|Formulation]]: at the detector the two waves add up as: I = sin(ωt-φ/2) + sin(ωt+φ/2), if φ is the phase shift between both waves. Then the probability P = 0.5(1+cosφ)

Another classical formulation in [[wikipedia:Double_slit#Classical_wave-optics_formulation|wikipedia]].

'''Energy'''

If with a single photon is measured, the detector it will show a certain energy. If one slits are narrowed, the interference pattern will change, but not the measured energy. Conclusion:

# The amount of the wave does influence the absorption probability pattern
# The amount of the wave does not influence the energy. So the wave does not contain energy in its volume (although its frequency is a measure of the energy)

'''Spatial coherence'''

In (2) the waves through both slits cancel each other completely in B, so are equal in size in both slits. Still the particle must have gone though one of the slit. That is by quantum definition (indivisible particle) and it has never been measured to split up in two particles. If detectors are placed just after the slits, they always measure one particle in on or the other slit, while the waves are the same at avery slity. Conclusion: 

# the wave has the same amplitude at a spatial distance of the photon.

'''Coherence length'''

In (2) the interference can extend to the left and right over many periods. Suppose in C the phase difference is 10 periods. If the particle went through slit 1, its wave will interfere with the wave which comes 10 periods ''later'' out of slit 1. But if the particle went through slit 2, its wave will interfere with the wave which came 10 periods ''earlier'' out of slit 1. 

# In direction of propagation (and time) the amplitude is about the same, as much wavelengths before and after the particle as the interference pattern shows. This is the coherence length of the wave.

# According Feynman with a point source the wave amplitude degrades with 1/r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, with r is the distance to the source.

'''Wave carrier'''

With a single slit (1) the wave is differacted, according the [[wikipedia:Huygens–Fresnel_principle:Huygens-Fresnel principle]]. However the principle is calculated for a wave with carrier. It is the interference of every point of the carrier radiating spherical which result in the diffraction pattern. This not caused by the particle because the diffraction behaviour depends on the wavelength and in the double slit the slit which passes only the wave gives the same diffraction as the slit which passes particle + wave. Conclusion:

# The wave behaves like a wave with carrier (this certainly not a classical carrier, like the [[wikipedia:Aether_(classical_element)|ether]] in the past)

'''Point source'''

==Measuring the particle==

In principle in quantum mechanics is that when the path of the particle is known, there will no interference. This could be done by measuring the particles with detectors in the two paths. With photons that is quite difficult, because detecting always destroys the photon.

===With particle detectors at the slits===
The most simple and most often mentioned measuring is placing a detector before each slit.&lt;ref name=&quot;Feynman&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Feynman | first = Richard P. | coauthors = Robert B. Leighton, Matthew Sands | title = The Feynman Lectures on Physics, Vol. 3 | publisher = Addison-Wesley | year = 1965  | location = US | pages = 1.1-1.8 | isbn = 0201021188}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the experiment is probably not possible in this way, because photons cannot be detected without absorbing. There is also no publication where this experiment has been actually done. 


==Marking the wave, Quantum erasers==

===Mach-Zehnder interferometer===
[[File:Wavephoton3.GIF|thumb|300px|right]]
In a [[wikipedia:Mach-Zehnder_interferometer|Mach-Zehnder interferometer]] a light beam is split by a 50% mirror in two beams (red and blue). Both beams are reflected by a mirror and cross each other. Finally each beam ends in a separate detector. In (1) each detector can detect photon from the red or blue path and no interference is measured. In (2) a second beam splitter mixes the red and blue beam. Now both detectors show interference, but cannot detect if the photon followed the red or blue path.

In the classical wave description the wave of the photon is split in two by the 50% mirror. In (1) each detector sees only one wave, so there is no interference with the other wave. In (2) both waves are mixed, so each detector sees both waves, causing interfere.

===Particle-path detectors and entangled photons (Kim et al)===
[[File:Wavephoton2.GIF|thumb|400px|right]]
A high intensity laser radiates though the &quot;red&quot; and &quot;blue&quot; part of a [[wikipedia:beta barium borate]] crystal (BBO), which generates now and then two [[wikipedia:quantum entanglement|entangled]] photons with half the energy of the laser photons. These photons follow two paths by a [[wikipedia:Glan-Thompson Prism]]. One of the photons, the &quot;signal&quot; photon, goes upwards, through a lens, to the target detector D0. The other photon, the &quot;idler&quot; photon, goes downwards and is deflected by a prism that sends it along divergent paths, depending on whether it came from the red or blue BBO area. Beyond each path a 50% mirror acts as a [[wikipedia:beam splitter]] (green blocks), resulting in a 50% chance to pass through and a 50% chance to reflect to detectors D3 or D4. The photons which pass through are reflected by 100% mirrors (gray-green blocks) to the detectors D1 or D2. Where both beams cross, a 50% mirror is placed, which mixed both beams.Because of this arrangement, if the photon is recorded at detector D3 (resp. D4), it can only be a blue (resp. red) photon. If the photon is recorded at detector D1 or D2, it can be both a red or blue photon. A [[wikipedia:coincidence counting (physics)|coincidence counter]] selects from D0 only those events which coincide with a chosen other detectors. This includes a delay of 8 ns to compensate for the 2.5 meter longer path to the other detectors. the result was:

* When events were counted which coincided with D3 or D4, there was no interference.
* When events were counted which coincided with D1 or D2, there was an interference pattern.

With classical wave physics a set of photons is emitted in the red or blue area of the BBO, no in both at the same time. There with ill be only one wave,  to interfere with D3 or D4. But the interference with D1 or D2 cannot be explained classical, because of the absence of two waves.

===Linear polarizers[http://www.scientificamerican.com/slideshow.cfm]===
In this experiment both waves are differently (perpendicular) polarized . Then no interference pattern is visible. A polariser in front of the detector, with its axis 45° to the other polarisers, erases this information, causing the interference pattern to reappear. 

Classical this effect is know as the [[wikipedia:Fresnel–Arago laws|Fresnel and Araglaws laws]], which state that perpendicular polarization does not interfere. The 45° polarisers force both perpendicular polarizations to become parallel polarizations, which can interfere. Also classical [[#Linear polarizer|calculation]] gives the same result.

===Circular polarizers and entangled photons (Walborn et al)&lt;ref name=Walborn&gt;{{cite journal | author=S.P. Walborn | coauthors= M.O. Terra Cunha, S. Pádua and C.H. Monken. | title =Double-Slit Quantum Eraser | journal=Physical Review A | volume =65 | issue =3 | pages =033818  | year =2002 | url =http://arxiv-web3.library.cornell.edu/abs/quant-ph/0106078 | doi =10.1103/PhysRevA.65.033818}}&lt;/ref&gt;===
[[File:Quantum_eraser_Walborn.gif|thumb|375px|right]]
A beta barium borate (BBO) crystal, radiated by a strong laser, will generating now and then two entangled photons. One photon (yellow) goes through a double slit to signal detector Ds, with rotating polarizer Q1 or Q2 in each path. Q1 and Q2 axis are pendicular, producing a opposite rotating polarization. The other photon (green) goes to detector Dp, with a linear polarizer cube POL in the path. Only photons in Ds are registered which coincidence with photons in Dp. Dp is situated closer to the BBO then Ds, so photons are first detected by Dp. The results were:

# Without Q1/Q2 and POL there was an interference pattern in Ds
# With Q1/Q2 there was no interference.
# With Q1/Q2 and POL, adjusted on the Q1 fast axis, there was interference.
# With Q1/Q2 and POL, adjusted on the Q2 fast axis, there was interference, but 180º shifted with 3.
# 1-4 with Dp on a larger distance then Ds gives the same result. This is called a delayed eraser, because the photon in Dp is detected later then in Ds

[[File:Walborn2a.GIF|thumb|240px|right|Polarization in the quarter waveplates]]
In the classical wave description Q1 and Q2 are [[wikipedia:waveplate|quarter-wave plates]] which have perpendicular a &quot;fast&quot; and &quot;slow&quot; axis. The slow axis has a π/2 phase delay compared to the fast axis. Q1 and Q2 are mounted mutually perpendicular. In setup 2 the incoming photon has a random polarization (shown as red) which can be resolved into two waves, parallel (green) and perpendicular (blue) to the optical axis of the [[wikipedia:waveplate|waveplate (see figure)]]. Depending on the axis the wave on x or y are delayed π/2. At the detector the x and y vectors interfere (add up) and can be composed to one vector. [[#Walborn|Calculation]] shows that the probability is:

P = 0.5 - 0.5cos2αsinφ

* A:   If α = 0 (incoming polarisation parallel to the fast axis of Q1) then P = 0.5 - 0.5sinφ
* B:   If α = π/2 (incoming polarisation parallel to the fast axis of Q2) then P = 0.5 + 0.5sinφ
* C:   If α = random then integrating α from 0 to 2π and normalised gives P = 1. This of course the same as A + B: P = 0.5 - 0.5sinφ + 0.5 + 0.5sinφ = 1

If the incoming polarization is parallel to a fast axis of a wave plate a φ interference pattern is visible on the detector. Between A and B there is a phase difference of π. If α is random then there is no φ pattern. C can be explained as having no interference pattern or being the sum of two interference pattern A and B which have a phase difference of π, which when added does not show an pattern. According classical rules both explanations are right. Also the Walborn article mentions that the result of setup 2 is the sum of setup 3 and 4.

In the experiment the incoming photon is the signal photon of a BBO. In setup 2 the polarization is random, so the measured result is as C above. The BBO emits an entanglement photon pair with mutually perpendicular polarization. According the article in set-up 3 POL was set to the angle of the fast axis of Q1. So the idler photons which passed through must have a signal photon with perpendicular polarisation, so parallel to the fast axis of Q2. These will show an interface pattern according B, which confirms with the measured result. In set-up 3 POL was rotated π/2, which gives the result of A. In other words, Dp detects only idler photons with a signal photon which polarization parallel to Q1 or Q2, which show an interference pattern according A or B. Dp selects those photons by coincidence from the output of Ds. 

In above formulation the time the idler is detected in Dp is not important (as long as delays are used to compensate for path length difference). The &quot;delayed&quot; effect is in the classical wave explanation the effect that POL determines the polarisation of the signal wave ''before'' Q1/Q2, although POL is position on a much larger distance of the BBO then Q1/Q2.

===Wheeler's astronomical experiment===
[[File:Wheeler1.GIF|thumb|350px|right]]
[[wikipedia:Wheeler's_delayed_choice_experiment|Wheeler's delayed choice experiment]] is a thought experiment in which the type of detector (particle or wave) is changed ''after'' a photon passes the double slit. &lt;ref&gt;''Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Theory'', edited by A.R. Marlow, Academic Press, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; In a second version the scale is magnified to astronomical dimensions: a photon has originated from a star and its path is bent by an intervening galaxy, so that it could arrive at a detector on earth by two different paths [[wikipedia:Wheeler's_delayed_choice_experiment#Wheeler.27s_astronomical_experiment|images]]. The detector could be a screen (as wave detector) or two telescopes, each focused to either side of the black hole. In both versions Wheeler expected that the screen will measure an interference pattern, while two telescopes will observe the photon only in one of them, without interference. If the outputs of both telescopes are ''optically'' combined, the interference pattern would be back, but losing the information of the path of the photon.

This result follows the classical waves: interference is caused by adding two waves during detection. If a telescope is directed at one wave, so no interference. If both telescopes are optically combined there are two waves again, which will interfere. The experiment shows that a photon always keeps full wave- and particle properties, until they combine during absorption.&lt;ref&gt;''The fabric of the Cosmos, by Brian Greene, 2009, chapter 7&lt;/ref&gt;. The first version has been confirmed in practice by Jacques e.a. with a [[wikipedia:Mach–Zehnder_interferometer|Mach-Zender interferometer]]. The astronomical version is not yet done and probably too difficult in practice, because for an interference pattern the photons must be coherent when they arrive on earth, after such a long time.

The [[Wikipedia:Hong–Ou–Mandel_effect|Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometer]] is a variant of the [[Wikipedia:Mach-Zehnder_interferometer|Mach-Zehnder interferometer]] in which two simultaneous photons are compared. A 351 nm laser radiates a [[Wikipedia:Potassium_dihydrogen_phosphate|KDP ]] crystal, which because of [[Wikipedia:Spontaneous_parametric_down-conversion|SPDC]] emits now and then two entangled photons of about 702 nm. The KDP is propably a type I, in which both photons have the same polarization and the same phase. Both waves are mixed in a 50% reflecting mirror, filtered by a bandpass interference filter IF and detected with a coincidence of 7.2 ns. 

It is supposed that this [[Wikipedia:Beam_splitter#Phase shift|beam splitter]] is a glass plate with reflector on one side, causing (only) the reflection from the normal input having a phase shift of π. All other have no phase shift. At the detectors the waves are: I&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.5sin(π+ωt+φ/2) + 0.5sinαsin(ωt-φ/2) and I&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.5sin(ωt+φ/2) + 0.5sinαsin(ωt-φ/2). With an ideal bandwidth filter d = Δω/ω, the probability is [[#Hong–Ou–Mandel|calculated]]:

P&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.5 - 0.5cos(4πΔx/λ) sin(πd(2k+2Δx/λ)) / πd(2k+2Δx/λ) and P&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.5 + 0.5cos(4πΔx/λ) sin(πd(2k+2Δx/λ)) / πd(2k+2Δx/λ)

These formula predicts the [[#Hong–Ou–Mandel|result]] of the measurement if the cosine term is ignored and k = 0. Then the formula will be: 

P&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.5 - 0.5sin(πd2Δx/λ) / πd2Δx/λ

P&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.5 + 0.5sin(πd2Δx/λ) / πd2Δx/λ

coincident: P = P&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; *  P&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;

[[File:Hong–Ou–Mandel2.GIF|305px|thumb]]
In the experiment ω = 2πc/702nm = 2.7 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;. The bandwidth filter is 3 10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;, d = 3 10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; / 2.7 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.011. Then FWHM = 113 μm.

==Calculations==

===General===
Propability P = (ʃ(I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)dωt)/2π, from 0-2π

ʃsin&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(nωt+φ)dωt, from 0-2π = ʃcos&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(nωt+φ)dωt = π (if n = integer)

===Double slit===
With interference of two waves sin(ωt+φ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) and sin(ωt+φ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)

The result is I = √(a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; +  2a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;cos(φ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-φ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)) sin(ωt+φ) [http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferenz_%28Physik%29#Interferenz_zweier_Wellen_gleicher_Frequenz_aber_unterschiedlicher_Amplitude_und_Phase]

Propability P = ʃ(I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)dωt, from 0-2π = (a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; +  2a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;cos(φ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-φ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) ʃsin&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(ωt+φ)dωt = (a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; +  2a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;cos(φ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-φ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)π

If a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 and φ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-φ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = φ:  P = 2π(1+cosφ). Normalised to 1: P = 0.5+0.5cosφ

If a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.5, a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 and φ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-φ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = φ:  P = π(1.25+0.5cosφ). Normalised to above: P = 0.5+0.2cosφ

===Linear polarizer===
x and y are parallel to the polarisers axis, both polarisers are mounted perpendicular, α is the angle of incoming polarization, φ is the phase difference caused by path length difference

The two waves are x = cosαsin(ωt+φ/2) and y = sinαsin(ωt-φ/2)

Combined: I = √(x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + y&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)

Propability P = ʃ(I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)dωt, from 0-2π = ʃ(x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + y&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)dωt = cos&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;αʃsin&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(ωt+φ/2)dωt + sin&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;αʃsin&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(ωt-φ/2)dωt = (cos&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;α + sin&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;α)π = π. Normalised: P = 1, so no φ interference pattern.

===Walborn===
[[File:Walborn2a.GIF|thumb|240px|right|Polarization in the quarter waveplates]]
x and y are chosen parallel to the axis the quarter-wave plates. Both plates are mounted perpendicular, α is the angle of incoming polarization, φ is the phase difference caused by path length difference

x = x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = cosαsin(ωt-π/2-φ/2) + cosαsin(ωt+φ/2) = 2cosαcos(π/4+φ/2)sin(ωt-π/4)

y = y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = sinαsin(ωt-φ/2) + sinαsin(ωt-π/2+φ/2) = 2sinαcos(π/4-φ/2)sin(ωt-π/4)

Combined: I = √(x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + y&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)

Propability P = ʃ(I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)dωt, from 0-2π = ʃ(x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + y&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)dωt = (4cos&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;αcos&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(π/4+φ/2) + 4sin&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;αcos&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(π/4-φ/2))ʃsin&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(ωt-π/4))dωt = 4(cos&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;α (0.5+0.5cos(π/2+φ)) + sin&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;α (0.5+0.5cos(π/2-φ))π = 2π(cos&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;α + sin&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;α + cos&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;αcos(π/2+φ) + sin&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;αcos(π/2-φ)) = 2π(1 - cos&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;αsin(φ)  + sin&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;αsin(φ)) = 2π(1 + (-cos&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;α + 1 - cos&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;α)sin(φ)) = 2π(1 + (1-2cos&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;α)sinφ) = 2π(1 + (1 - 2(0.5+0.5cos2α))sinφ) = 2π(1 - cos2αsinφ)

Normalised: '''P''' = 0.5 - 0.5cos2αsinφ

If α = random: P = 0.5ʃ(1-cos2αsinφ)dα from 0 to 2π = |α - 0.5sin2αsinφ| = (2π - 0 - 0 + 0) = 2π. Normalised: P = 1

===Hong–Ou–Mandel===
It is supposed that the [[Wikipedia:Beam_splitter#Phase shift|beam splitter]] is a glass plate with reflector on one side, causing (only) the reflection from the normal input having a phase shift of π. Both photons start in the KDP with the same phase. Then at the upper (u) and lower (l) detector the waves are:

I&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; = -0.5sin(ωt+φ/2) + 0.5sin(ωt-φ/2) = -cosωtsin(φ/2) and I&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.5sin(ωt+φ/2) + 0.5sin(ωt-φ/2) = sinωtcos(φ/2)

Probability P&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; = ʃ(I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)dωt), from 0-2π = sin&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(φ/2)ʃcos&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;ωtdωt = (0.5-0.5cosφ)π and P&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt; = cos&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(φ/2)ʃsin&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;ωtdωt = (0.5+0.5cosφ)π.

Normalised: '''P&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;''' = (0.5 - 0.5cosφ) and  '''P&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;''' = (0.5 + 0.5cosφ)

and '''coincident''': P = P&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; * P&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt; = (0.5 - 0.5cosφ) (0.5 + 0.5cosφ) = 0.25 - 0.25cos&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;φ. Normalised: P = 0.5 - 0.5cos&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;φ

'''Phase shift''' The phase shift between both waves can be caused by the different wavelength (1+p) and the displacement of the beam splitter causing a Δt in only one path. If t = time between the KDP and D&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;, then the phase difference can be written as: 

φ = φ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; - φ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ω(1+p)(t+Δt) + π - ω(1-p)t = ωt + ωpt + ωΔt + ωpΔt - ωt + ωpt + π = 2ωpt + ωΔt + ωpΔt + π = ωΔt + ωp(2t+Δt) + π

This is the formula for a fixed p, but in practice there is a mix of different wave lengths. With an ideal bandwidth filter P&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; is equal within p = -d/2 - +d/2 (and zero outside). When used in the formula of P&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; above: 

P&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; = ʃ (0.5 - 0.5cos(π + ωΔt+ωp(2t+Δt)) dp / d  from -d/2 - +d/2  = ʃ (0.5 + 0.5cos(π + ωΔt+ωp(2t+Δt)) dp / d

= 0.5 | p - sin(ωΔt+ωp(2t+Δt)) / ω(2t+Δt) | / d 

= 0.5(d/2 - sin(ωΔt+ωd(2t+Δt/2))/ω(2t+Δt) + d/2 - sin(ωΔt-ωd(2t+Δt)/2)/ω(2t+Δt) ) / d

= 0.5(1 - 2cos(ωΔt) sin(ωd(2t+Δt)/2) / ωd(2t+Δt)

= 0.5 - cos(ωΔt) sin(ωd(2t+Δt)/2)) / ωd(2t+Δt) 

ω = 2πf = 2π/T = 2πc/λ, so T = λ/c, Δt = 2Δx/c (Δx has double effect), so Δt/T = 2Δx/λ. Suppose t = kλ. Then:

= 0.5 - cos(2πc2Δx/λc) sin(2πd(2kT+Δt)/2T)) / (2πd(2kT+Δt)/T) 

'''P&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;''' = 0.5 - 0.5cos(4πΔx/λ) sin(πd(2k+2Δx/λ)) / πd(2k+2Δx/λ)

and '''P&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;''' = 0.5 - 0.5cos(4πΔx/λ) sin(πd(2k+2Δx/λ)) / πd(2k+2Δx/λ)

and coincident: '''P''' = P&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; *  P&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;

The general form of the second sinus part is:

[[File:Hong–Ou–Mandel3.GIF]]

'''Δx&lt;sub&gt;FWHM&lt;/sub&gt;''' = cΔt/2 = 0,00148 λ/d = 0,000443 λ/d μm  (λ in nm)

==Computer Hardware==
Computer hardware is the bare-medal (plastic, glass, ...) part capable of performing computation. Computing/computation is fundamentally about information processes. Information are represented, on the hardware level, using two physical states - a high voltage and a low voltage, which is enough for representing all kinds of information as a bit (two states) is the fundamental unit of information ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory information theory]]).

Returns: NIL.

==i2c-address==

Send an address on the I2C interface.

 (i2c-address id address direction)

* id - the ID of the I2C interface.
* address - the address.
* direction - *i2c.transmitter* if the master wants to send data, or *i2c-receiver* if the master wants to receive data.

Returns:
* acked - true if the address was acknowledged by an I2C slave, false otherwise.

==i2c-write==

Writes data to a slave that has already acknowledged an i2c-address call.

 (i2c-write id any1 [any2] ... [anyn] )

* id - the ID of the I2C interface.
* any1 - the data to send. It can be either a number between 0 and 255, a symbol or a list.
* any2 (optional) - the second data to send.
* anyn (optional) - the n-th data to send.

Returns:
* wrote - the number of bytes actually written.

==i2c-read==

 (i2c-read id numbytes)

Reads a number of bytes from a slave that has already acknowledged an i2c-address call. It acknowledges all the bytes received except for the last one.

* id - the ID of the I2C interface.
* numbytes - the number of bytes to read.

Returns:

      <text xml:space="preserve">Business data is a key asset for any organization.  The information contained within data plays a large role in the operations, reporting and measurement of how the organization is performing.  An information system provides the means to capture and share data, and to monitor business performance.  A sound data structure is universally required to ensure data integrity and to minimize future application maintenance costs.  Creating the ‘right’ data store for an information application involves data governance, understanding data flows, and developing a reliable foundation to ensure ongoing reliability, stability, and maximal effectiveness for the investment.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

==Business Data==
===Data Governance and Security===
The investments in information systems necessary to build new applications, modify existing applications, or to buy and migrate to COTS (Commercial Off-the-Shelf) solutions can be very high for any organization.  In order to ensure that those investments result in maximum returns, controls may be implemented in the form of data governance and security.  These controls may exist within an organizational subdivision, across subdivisions, or across an entire organization.  Some controls are even global in nature, determined by international agreements and guided by generally accepted standards.

Data governance is concerned with who is responsible for the organizational data and how governance decisions and processes are executed.  One or more different approaches may be used in the governance of business data.  These include:
* Top-down – decisions are authoritative and affect the entire organization
* Bottom-up – decisions relating to data are established at low level (e.g., naming conventions)
* Center-out – typically involves a consultant hired to consider governance needs from all stakeholders and make organization-wide recommendation (results in Top-down for approved decisions)
* Silo-in - multiple groups set governance standards based on collective agreement &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.datagovernance.com/gbg_governance_models.html|title=Choosing Governance Models|publisher= Data Governance Institute|author=Thomas, Gwen|accessdate=02/05/2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 
Goals of data governance include ensuring the quality and security of business data, conformance of the data to organizational standards, overarching data rules and definitions, and the assurance that the data will be trustable.
&lt;br /&gt;

===Business Ownership===
When creating a new information system, the application is generally sponsored by one or more business program areas or departments.  Organizational data governance requires the identification of those who will ‘own’ the data.  These owners will be responsible for oversight, coordination with the organization’s Governance Board, conformance with adopted standards and law, and securing the data access rights.  An ‘Owner’ may be responsible for data within the domain of the application, or the responsibility may be spread out between multiple owners across a group of integrated applications&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.datagovernance.com/gbg_assigning_data_ownership.html|title=Assigning Data Ownership|author=Thomas, Gwen|publisher=Data Governance Institute|accessdate=02/05/2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Regardless of how the owner (or owners) of the data is determined within an organization, the approvals for project data requirements will come from within this ownership role.
&lt;br /&gt;

===Eliminate Redundancy===
Data redundancy is caused when the same information is captured multiple times within the same or multiple data store(s). Most information systems today are supported by data stores built on the relational schema originally designed by Edgar Codd&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-03.ibm.com/ibm/history/exhibits/builders/builders_codd.html|title=Edgar F. Codd|publisher=IBM Research News|year=2003|accessdate=02/12/2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This type of schema minimizes redundancy and ensures data integrity.  Data redundancy means that there are multiple instances of the same information captured within the same or multiple integrated data store(s).  Issues relating to data redundancy revolve around conflicts between these multiple instances of the data and lead to higher operational costs associated with the data.  These costs include those associated with data entry, retrieval and maintenance&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eai.ittoolbox.com/groups/vendor-selection/eai-select/estimating-the-cost-of-data-redundancy-10000|title=Estimating the Costs of Data Redundancy?|year=2001|author=Streiff, John|accessdate=02/12/2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Proper data definition ensures that any redundancy is identified and can be corrected or mitigated before the system is actually designed, lowering the associated development and ongoing maintenance costs .

&lt;br /&gt;

==Data Documentation==
Documentation of application data is critical to ensure a common understanding of the information contained within the data and to assure the reliability of that information.  Business Analysts are often responsible for creating data documentation for information system projects and the alignment of this documentation with governance processes and rules.  Documentation artifacts will span the entire SDLC from Initiation through Implementation.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
===Data Flow Diagrams===
[[File:YD Workers Comp DFD.png|thumb|NYS Worker's Comp Claiming]]
Tracing the flow of data through an application includes identifying the sources, transformations and destinations of the data that will be supported.  The destinations include both the data stores and the downstream processes that use the data.  Data sources may be shared within and across the organization or may involve external entities.  They include data entry, existing databases, computer files, and data streams from external applications.  Once the sources are determined, the processes that must occur to transform or manipulate the data are defined.  These processes include the conversion of data from the source format to the destination format. The destinations include databases, files, reports and external applications that receive the output from the transformation processes. A Data Flow Diagram captures this information for verification and design purposes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are many tutorials available on the Internet to refer to for the creation of a data flow diagram.  Generally, consistency in rendering the data input(s), processing and data output(s) will accomplish the goals of defining data flows in a manner that is easily understood by those who will review and verify the diagram contents.  An example of a Data Flow diagram using the Yourdon/DeMarco notation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yourdon.com/PDF/oldJESA/SAch9.pdf|title=Just Enough Structured Analysis, Chapter 9|author=Yourdon, E.|year=2006|accessdate=02/05/2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; is included in the image at right.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

===Data Definitions===
[[File:Data Dictionary.png|thumb|Vehicle Owner Data Tables]]
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The most common format used to capture the definition of data elements is the Data Dictionary.  This artifact is critical for purposes of data governance and for ensuring that all stakeholders share a common understanding of what the data is.  Typical information that is contained in the data dictionary includes identification of where the data resides (information system, relational table), the exact database field or data element, what the data element represents and the format of the element.  The image at right provides an example of what a data dictionary may look like.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
===Common Data Matrix===

[[File:Common Data Matrix.png|thumb|Common Data Matrix - D = Define; P = Provide; U=Use]]
A Common Data Matrix is used during the Requirements Gathering phase of a project when there is at least some level of data integration required involving multiple applications, and /or some degree of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_Data_Management MDM], and /or some form of organizational data governance.  It is a form of a data dictionary that encompasses the scope of the governance domain.  To construct this type of matrix, data elements are listed for the scope domain, with information about that data in relation to the organizational units, or applications, that interact with that data&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tdan.com/view-articles/4042|title=The Data Stewardship Approach to Data Management|author=Seiner, Robert S.|year=2006|publisher=The Data Administration Newsletter - TDan.com|accessdate=02/05/2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  This type of diagram should be constructed to include information applicable to the problem under consideration (see image at right). &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Consider an information system that uses external data elements from other organizational (internal) applications.  The definitions, meanings and formats of these elements become critical for integration. Within a high governance maturity level organization, a customer first name (for example) would have the same data element definition and format across the organization. In reality, most organizations have not fully conformed all data definitions across the entire organization; data elements for integration projects should be summarized using a Common Data Matrix when determining project requirements for the integration effort.   In such an instance, the information included within the matrix (the matrix cells) might contain data element formatting information to identify any transformation(s) that may be needed for integrating the data with the project information.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

===Modeling Data Requirements===
For purposes of establishing a new application and for application enhancements, modeling the data at a high level provides guidance in the design efforts.  Typically, Business Analysts are not involved in the actual development of an application, but the requirements associated with a project will determine what data is needed to support the project deliverables and vice versa.  In the same way that high-level Business Requirements are refined/defined in Functional Requirements and then detailed into design specifications, the Conceptual Data model can be used as the starting point when defining Logical and then Physical Data Models.br /&gt;

====Conceptual Model====
[[File:ConceptualDataModel.png|thumb|Basic Conceptual Data Model example]]

According to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, a ''Concept'' describes an idea of what something is, or how it works &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/concept|title= Concept |publisher= Merriam-Webster |accessdate=10/02/2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  A conceptual data model illustrates the information that an organization wants or needs to capture &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://searchdatamanagement.techtarget.com/answer/What-are-the-benefits-of-a-conceptual-data-model|title=What are the benefits of a conceptual data model|year=2007|author=Stiglich, Pete|publisher=TechTarget|accessdate=10/02/2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  It is a high-level, business-oriented model, capturing operational data needs: what does the organization need to capture data about?  The answer to this question identifies data ‘entities’ that need to be explored to define requirements.  The conceptual data model represents the information that the business needs to support the business processes existing within the domain of the organization or project&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.information-management-architect.com/conceptual-data-model.html|title=Conceptual Data Model|year=2009|author=Bowman, David|publisher= David Bowman’s Information Management Checklist|accessdate=10/02/2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
&lt;br /&gt;

This type of model is very high-level, guiding the design of the data store for an application.  It presents the different ‘things’ or entities (nouns) that information must be captured for and indicates high-level relationships between each of these identified ‘things’.  The model is independent of whatever technology is used to implement the solution and does not include details such as primary keys or entity attributes &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Software Requirements Memory Jogger, 1st edition|last= Gottesdiener|first= Ellen|year= 2005|publisher= GOAL/APC|page= 183}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  A conceptual data model is most useful during the requirements gathering phase of a project, and may be discarded once a Logical Model is defined for the problem domain &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agiledata.org/essays/dataModeling101.html|title=Data Modeling 101|author=Wambler, Scott|publisher=AgileData.org|accessdate=10/07/2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
&lt;br /&gt;

====Logical Entity Relationship Model====
&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:LogicalDataModel.png|thumb|Owner-Vehicle Logical Data Model]]
A Logical data model includes the entities that are needed to support an application, information about each of the entities (including attributes and unique identifiers), and the relationships that are needed between the entities.  This type of model may be informed by the Conceptual Data Model, but the identified Entity-Relationship structure is modified to support (at a high-level) the technical solution domain.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Applications that rely on an RDBMS platform will typically use an Entity Relationship (ER) diagram format for illustrating the Logical Data model.  Each distinct entity is defined with associated attributes in such a way that each attribute is specific to the entity and only to that entity.  Normalization of the data in the model ensures that when it is time to create the physical data model, the data architecture design will provide assurance that data anomalies cannot occur – i.e.,  data stored in the database will have integrity and can be relied on by the users.

&lt;br /&gt;

====Physical Data Model====
&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:PhysicalDataModel.png|thumb|Physical Data Model - Owner-Vehicle tables]]
A Physical Data Model provides detailed specifications for the data structure that will support the business operations.  The Logical Data Model, generally completed with base-lined project functional requirements, is expanded and modified to conform with the data architecture that will used to store the data.  This could reflect any kind of architecture – relational databases or XML data stores both require this specification.  The US Department of Health and Human Services defines this type of data model as “a database-specific implementation of a Logical Data Model (LDM)” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.hhs.gov/ocio/eplc/EPLC%20Archive%20Documents/28-Physical%20Data%20Model/eplc_physical_data_model_template.doc|title= Physical Data Model template |year=2009|publisher=US Department of Health and Human Services|accessdate=10/07/2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The physical data model includes definitions for tables and columns (for relational databases) or schema and element (for XML databases), domain (attribute or element) values, physical data types, constraints, unique keys and indexes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.hhs.gov/ocio/eplc/EPLC%20Archive%20Documents/28-Physical%20Data%20Model/eplc_physical_data_model_template.doc|title= Physical Data Model template |year=2009|publisher=US Department of Health and Human Services|accessdate=10/07/2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; .  Relationships with their cardinality, XML extensions, specific RDBMS architectural information, nullability, and value lengths/precision are other definitions that are generally included in the model.  Physical Data models may be created using tools that generate the code required to create a database.  These tools generally also provide the capability to reverse-engineer a database, generating the physical data model for an existing application &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agilemodeling.com/artifacts/physicalDataModel.htm|title= Physical Data Model (PDM)s: An Agile Introduction (The Object Primer 3rd Edition, Chapter 12)|year=2004|author=Ambler, Scott| accessdate=10/07/2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

&lt;ol type=&quot;a&quot;&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;4.a&quot;&gt;You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;4.b&quot;&gt;You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under the terms of: (i) this License; (ii) a later version of this License with the same License Elements as this License; (iii) a Creative Commons jurisdiction license (either this or a later license version) that contains the same License Elements as this License (e.g., Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 US)); (iv) a Creative Commons Compatible License. If you license the Adaptation under one of the licenses mentioned in (iv), you must comply with the terms of that license. If you license the Adaptation under the terms of any of the licenses mentioned in (i), (ii) or (iii) (the &quot;Applicable License&quot;), you must comply with the terms of the Applicable License generally and the following provisions: (I) You must include a copy of, or the URI for, the Applicable License with every copy of each Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform; (II) You may not offer or impose any terms on the Adaptation that restrict the terms of the Applicable License or the ability of the recipient of the Adaptation to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License; (III) You must keep intact all notices that refer to the Applicable License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work as included in the Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform; (IV) when You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Adaptation, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Adaptation that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Adaptation from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License. This Section 4(b) applies to the Adaptation as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Adaptation itself to be made subject to the terms of the Applicable License.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;4.c&quot;&gt;If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution (&quot;Attribution Parties&quot;) in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., &quot;French translation of the Work by Original Author,&quot; or &quot;Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author&quot;). The credit required by this Section 4(c) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;4.d&quot;&gt;Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

==&lt;span id=&quot;5&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer==

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

==&lt;span id=&quot;6&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;6. Limitation on Liability==
EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

==&lt;span id=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;7. Termination==

&lt;ol type=&quot;a&quot;&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;7.a&quot;&gt;This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;7.b&quot;&gt;Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

==&lt;span id=&quot;8&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;8. Miscellaneous==

&lt;ol type=&quot;a&quot;&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;8.a&quot;&gt;Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;8.b&quot;&gt;Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;8.c&quot;&gt;If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;8.d&quot;&gt;No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;8.e&quot;&gt;This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;8.f&quot;&gt;The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

Version 1.3, 3 November 2008
Copyright (C) 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;http://fsf.org/&gt;

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

=GNU Free Documentation License=

==0. PREAMBLE==

The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other functional and useful document &quot;free&quot; in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

This License is a kind of &quot;copyleft&quot;, which means that derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free software.

We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.

==1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS==

This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work under the conditions stated herein. The &quot;Document&quot;, below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as &quot;you&quot;. You accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law.

A &quot;Modified Version&quot; of the Document means any work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another language.

A &quot;Secondary Section&quot; is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.

The &quot;Invariant Sections&quot; are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.

The &quot;Cover Texts&quot; are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.

A &quot;Transparent&quot; copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy that is not &quot;Transparent&quot; is called &quot;Opaque&quot;.

Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output purposes only.

The &quot;Title Page&quot; means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have any title page as such, &quot;Title Page&quot; means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

The &quot;publisher&quot; means any person or entity that distributes copies of the Document to the public.

A section &quot;Entitled XYZ&quot; means a named subunit of the Document whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as &quot;Acknowledgements&quot;, &quot;Dedications&quot;, &quot;Endorsements&quot;, or &quot;History&quot;.) To &quot;Preserve the Title&quot; of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a section &quot;Entitled XYZ&quot; according to this definition.

The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this License.

==2. VERBATIM COPYING==

You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may publicly display copies.

==3. COPYING IN QUANTITY==

If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.

If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.

If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general network-using public has access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.

It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.

==4. MODIFICATIONS==

You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

&lt;ol type=&quot;A&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that version gives permission.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you from this requirement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the publisher.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Include an unaltered copy of this License.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Preserve the section Entitled &quot;History&quot;, Preserve its Title, and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section Entitled &quot;History&quot; in the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on. These may be placed in the &quot;History&quot; section. You may omit a network location for a work that was published at least four years before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For any section Entitled &quot;Acknowledgements&quot; or &quot;Dedications&quot;, Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Delete any section Entitled &quot;Endorsements&quot;. Such a section may not be included in the Modified version.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled &quot;Endorsements&quot; or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

You may add a section Entitled &quot;Endorsements&quot;, provided it contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties—for example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard.

You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

==5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS==

You may combine the Document with other documents released under this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.

The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled &quot;History&quot; in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled &quot;History&quot;; likewise combine any sections Entitled &quot;Acknowledgements&quot;, and any sections Entitled &quot;Dedications&quot;. You must delete all sections Entitled &quot;Endorsements&quot;.

==6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS==

You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.

You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.

==7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS==

A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an &quot;aggregate&quot; if the copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate.

==8. TRANSLATION==

Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a translation of this License, and all the license notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include the original English version of this License and the original versions of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the translation and the original version of this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.

If a section in the Document is Entitled &quot;Acknowledgements&quot;, &quot;Dedications&quot;, or &quot;History&quot;, the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual title.

==9. TERMINATION==

You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.

Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does not give you any rights to use it.

==10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE==

The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. See http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.

Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License &quot;or any later version&quot; applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.

==11. RELICENSING==

&quot;Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site&quot; (or &quot;MMC Site&quot;) means any World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works. A public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server. A &quot;Massive Multiauthor Collaboration&quot; (or &quot;MMC&quot;) contained in the site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC site.

&quot;CC-BY-SA&quot; means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco, California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license published by that same organization.

&quot;Incorporate&quot; means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or in part, as part of another Document.

An MMC is &quot;eligible for relicensing&quot; if it is licensed under this License, and if all works that were first published under this License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.

The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.
= How to use this License for your documents =

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of the License in the document and put the following copyright and license notices just after the title page:

: Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
: Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
: under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
: or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
: with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.
: A copy of the license is included in the section entitled &quot;GNU
: Free Documentation License&quot;.

If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts, replace the &quot;with...Texts.&quot; line with this:

: with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the

== A ==

&lt;u&gt;Activity diagram&lt;/u&gt;
A type of flowchart, part of the UML standard, that depicts activities, their sequence, and the flow of control.&lt;br /&gt;


&lt;u&gt;Analysis paralysis&lt;/u&gt;
An informal phrase applied to when the opportunity cost of decision analysis exceeds the benefits. In software development, analysis paralysis manifests itself through exceedingly long phases of project planning, requirements gathering, program design and modeling, with little or no extra value created by those steps.&lt;br /&gt;


&lt;u&gt;Artifact&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
An artifact is one of many kinds of tangible by-products produced during the development of software. 


&lt;u&gt;As-is modeling&lt;/u&gt;
Refers to gathering information about the current state of the business area being analyzed; e.g., current processes and data.&lt;br /&gt;


&lt;u&gt;Assumptions and Constraints&lt;/u&gt;
Assumptions and constraints identify aspects of the problem domain that are not functional requirements of a solution, and will limit or impact the design of the solution.&lt;br /&gt;

== B ==

Business Analysis Requirements Document&lt;br /&gt;


&lt;u&gt;Business analysis&lt;/u&gt;
Business analysis is the set of tasks, knowledge, and techniques required to identify business needs and determine solutions to business problems. Solutions often include a systems development component, but may also consist of process improvement or organizational change.&lt;br /&gt;



&lt;u&gt;Business analyst&lt;/u&gt;
A business analyst works as a liaison among stakeholders in order to elicit, analyze, communicate and validate requirements for changes to business processes, policies and information systems. The business analyst understands business problems and opportunities in the context of the requirements and recommends solutions that enable the organization to achieve its goals.&lt;br /&gt;


&lt;u&gt;Business area&lt;/u&gt;
A naturally cohesive group of activities that share data and may cross organizational boundaries.&lt;br /&gt;


&lt;u&gt;Business case&lt;/u&gt;
The first document completed during project initiation; it contains the analysis and results of business assessments providing the justification to pursue a project opportunity.&lt;br /&gt;


&lt;u&gt;Business process improvement&lt;/u&gt;
Analyzing a business process to increase its efficiency and effectiveness; identifying and eliminating causes of poor quality, process variation, and non-value-added activities.&lt;br /&gt;


&lt;u&gt;Business requirements&lt;/u&gt;
Higher-level statements of the goals, objectives, or needs of the enterprise. They describe such things as the reason a project was initiated and the things the project will achieve.&lt;br /&gt;


&lt;u&gt;Business requirements document&lt;/u&gt;
The document or artifact that captures gathered requirements and serves to communicate them.&lt;br /&gt;

== C ==

&lt;u&gt;Candidate solution&lt;/u&gt;
A suggestion that might be a good thing to do.&lt;br /&gt;


&lt;u&gt;Context diagram&lt;/u&gt;
Represents the entire system as if it were a single process; often used to determine a system boundary or solution scope with stakeholders or SME’s.&lt;br /&gt;


&lt;u&gt;Customer&lt;/u&gt;
The business units at all levels of the organization that identified the need for the product or service the project will develop.&lt;br /&gt;



== D ==

&lt;u&gt;Data flow diagram&lt;/u&gt;
Graphical representation of the flow of data through a manual or automated information system which Illustrates the processes, data stores, and external entities in a business or other system and the connecting data flows.&lt;br /&gt;


&lt;u&gt;Data model&lt;/u&gt;
A model showing data requirements of a business area. An Entity Relationship Diagram is a common type of data model.&lt;br /&gt;







== E ==

&lt;u&gt;Elicit&lt;/u&gt;
The process of drawing requirements from stakeholders and SME’s.&lt;br /&gt;



== F ==

&lt;u&gt;Features&lt;/u&gt;
A service a solution provides to meet a need. Typically high-level abstractions of solution that will turn into functional or non-functional requirements. They allow for early prioritization and scope management, and for getting a high-level sense of the stakeholders view of the solution.  &lt;br /&gt;


&lt;u&gt;Functional requirements&lt;/u&gt;

What the systems/products are, do, or provide from the customer’s point of view.&lt;br /&gt;



- G -


- H -


- I-


== J == 

&lt;u&gt;JAD&lt;/u&gt;
Joint application development&lt;br /&gt;



- K - 


- L -


- M - 


== N == 

&lt;u&gt;Non-functional requirements&lt;/u&gt;
Requirements that do not directly relate to the behavior or functionality of the solution, but rather describe environmental conditions under which the solution must remain effective or qualities that the systems must have.&lt;br /&gt;



== O ==

&lt;u&gt;Object-oriented modeling&lt;/u&gt;
An approach to business or software engineering in which components are made up of encapsulated groups of data and functions which can inherit behavior and attributes from other components, and whose components communicate via messages to one another.&lt;br /&gt;


== P ==

&lt;u&gt;Pains and pleasures&lt;/u&gt;
Pain – something that is currently causing frustration, lack of productivity, poor quality, etc. Pleasure – something that is currently working well. It would be good to continue it.&lt;br /&gt;


&lt;u&gt;Product scope&lt;/u&gt;
The functions or features that characterize a product or service.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;u&gt;Project scope&lt;/u&gt;
The work that must be done to deliver a product with the specified features and functions.&lt;br /&gt;



== Q ==

&lt;u&gt;QA&lt;/u&gt;
Quality assurance&lt;br /&gt;


&lt;u&gt;QC&lt;/u&gt;
Quality control&lt;br /&gt;



== R ==

&lt;u&gt;Requirements&lt;/u&gt;
Conditions or capabilities needed by a stakeholder to solve a problem or achieve an objective.&lt;br /&gt;


&lt;u&gt;RFP&lt;/u&gt;
Request for proposal&lt;br /&gt;


&lt;u&gt;RFQ&lt;/u&gt;
Request for quotations&lt;br /&gt;


&lt;u&gt;Requirements work plan&lt;/u&gt;

== S == 

&lt;u&gt;Schedule&lt;/u&gt;
Planned dates for performing activities and for meeting deliverables.&lt;br /&gt;


&lt;u&gt;Scope Creep&lt;/u&gt;
Gradual addition of new requirements to the original product specifications.&lt;br /&gt;


&lt;u&gt;SDLC&lt;/u&gt;
System development life cycle &lt;br /&gt;


&lt;u&gt;Subject matter expert (SME)&lt;/u&gt;
A person expert in the particular business area being analyzed. SME’s are often the primary source of requirements for a business analyst.&lt;br /&gt;


&lt;u&gt;Solution&lt;/u&gt;
Something that fills a business need. Solutions do not always involve automation; they could involve streamlining a business process, etc.&lt;br /&gt;


&lt;u&gt;Statement of work&lt;/u&gt;
A narrative description of products or services to be supplied under contract.&lt;br /&gt;


&lt;u&gt;Stakeholder&lt;/u&gt;
Individuals and organizations that are involved in, or may be affected by, project activities.&lt;br /&gt;



== T ==

&lt;u&gt;To-be modeling&lt;/u&gt;
Refers to analyzing and documenting the potential future state of the business area being analyzed; processes, data, activities, how the activities would be accomplished.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;u&gt;User acceptance testing&lt;/u&gt;
User Acceptance Testing is typically the final phase in a software development process in which the software is given to the intended audience to be tested for functionality. UAT is also called beta testing, end-user testing or application testing.&lt;br /&gt;





== V == 

&lt;u&gt;Validate&lt;/u&gt;
Reviewing requirements to ensure they are correct.&lt;br /&gt;



== W == 

&lt;u&gt;WBS&lt;/u&gt;
Work breakdown structure&lt;br /&gt;


&lt;u&gt;Workflow model&lt;/u&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==What is an Operating System==

==The Unix Shell==
The Unix shell is a command interpreter program that serves as the primary interface between uses and the OS in a command line environment, e.g. a terminal or terminal simulator. A shell is an essential (often preferred) tool, but it is just a ordinary user program that uses system calls to get most of the work done - so its just a &quot;shell&quot;. 
  
===Functions of a Shell===
A shell presents its users a command prompt (e.g. $), waits for a command, and executes the command.  executes user commands 
The primary duty of a shell 
===Creating a Shell===

The overall structure of a shell can be:

  repeat forever
    read one line 
    parse the command into a list of arguments
    if the line starts with a command name (e.g. cd and exit)
    then 
      perform the function (if it's exit, break out of the loop)
    else (it invokes a program, e.g. ls and cat) 
      execute the program 

To read a command we read one line at a time and tokenize the line into tokens. 

To execute a program the following needs to take place:
Use fork() system call to duplicate the current process:

====use fork() to clone a process====
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
/* modified from fork.c in Advanced Linux Programming (page 49) */
/* http://www.makelinux.net/alp/024 */

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

int main(){
  pid_t child_pid;
  
  printf(&quot;the main program process ID is %d\n&quot;, (int) getpid());

  child_pid = fork();
  if(child_pid != 0){
    printf(&quot;this is the parent process, with id %d\n&quot;, (int)getpid());
    printf(&quot;child_pid=%d\n&quot;, child_pid);
  }else{
    printf(&quot;this is the child  process, with id %d\n&quot;, (int)getpid());
    printf(&quot;child_pid=%d\n&quot;, child_pid);
  }
}
&lt;/source&gt;
This example shows how to create a new process by forking the current process. Note that the fork() function call (system call) is invoked '''once''' but return '''twice''' because when the call finishes there are two processes executing the same code.

====use execvp() to run a new program in the background====
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
/* from Advanced Linux Programming (page 51) */
/* http://www.makelinux.net/alp/024 */
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; 
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt; 
#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt; 
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt; 

/* Spawn a child process running a new program. PROGRAM is the name 
   of the program to run; the path will be searched for this program. 
   ARG_LIST is a NULL-terminated list of character strings to be 
   passed as the program's argument list. Returns  the process ID of 
   the spawned process.  */ 

int spawn (char* program, char** arg_list) {
  pid_t child_pid; 

  /* Duplicate this process. */ 
  child_pid = fork (); 

  if (child_pid != 0){
    /* This is the parent process. */ 
    return child_pid; 
  }else {
    /* Now execute PROGRAM, searching for it in the path.  */ 
    execvp (program,  arg_list); 
    /* The execvp  function returns only if an error occurs.  */ 
    fprintf (stderr,  &quot;an error occurred in execvp\n&quot;); 
    abort (); 
  } 
} 

int main () {
  /*  The argument list to pass to the &quot;ls&quot; command.  */ 
  char* arg_list[] = {
    &quot;ls&quot;,     /* argv[0], the name of the program.  */ 
    &quot;-l&quot;, 
    &quot;/&quot;, 
    NULL      /* The argument list must end with a NULL.  */ 
  }; 

  /* Spawn a child process running the &quot;ls&quot; command. Ignore the 
     returned child process ID.  */ 
  spawn (&quot;ls&quot;, arg_list); 
  printf (&quot;done with main program\n&quot;); 
  return 0; 
} 
&lt;/source&gt;

====use execvp() to run a new program in the foreground====
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
/* from Advanced Linux Programming (page 51) */
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; 
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt; 
#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt; 
#include &lt;sys/wait.h&gt;
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt; 

/* Spawn a child process running a new program. PROGRAM is the name 
   of the program to run; the path will be searched for this program. 
   ARG_LIST is a NULL-terminated list of character strings to be 
   passed as the program's argument list. Returns  the process ID of 
   the spawned process.  */ 

int spawn (char* program, char** arg_list) {
  pid_t child_pid; 

  /* Duplicate this process. */ 
  child_pid = fork (); 

  if (child_pid != 0){
    /* This is the parent process. */ 
    return child_pid; 
  }else {
    /* Now execute PROGRAM, searching for it in the path.  */ 
    execvp (program,  arg_list); 
    /* The execvp  function returns only if an error occurs.  */ 
    fprintf (stderr,  &quot;an error occurred in execvp\n&quot;); 
    abort (); 
  } 
} 

int main () {
  /*  The argument list to pass to the &quot;ls&quot; command.  */ 
  char* arg_list[] = {
    &quot;ls&quot;,     /* argv[0], the name of the program.  */ 
    &quot;-l&quot;, 
    &quot;/&quot;, 
    NULL      /* The argument list must end with a NULL.  */ 
  }; 

  /* Spawn a child process running the &quot;ls&quot; command. Ignore the 
     returned child process ID.  */ 
  pid_t pid = spawn (&quot;ls&quot;, arg_list); 

  /* Wait for the child process to complete.  */ 
  int child_status;
  waitpid (pid, &amp;child_status, 0); 
  
  if (WIFEXITED (child_status)){
    printf (&quot;the child process exited normally, with exit code %d\n&quot;, 
	     WEXITSTATUS (child_status)); 
  }else{ 
    printf (&quot;the child process exited abnormally\n&quot;); 
  }
  
  return  0; 
} 
&lt;/source&gt;
Note that the argument list must contain the program name as the first argument and '''MUST''' end with a NULL, which indicates the end of the list. Otherwise, execvp() won't function correctly.
====use dup2() to redirect standard output====
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
#include &lt;fcntl.h&gt;
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
 
int main(){
  int overwrite = 0;
  int fd;
  if(overwrite){
    printf(&quot;open test.txt to overwrite.\n&quot;);
    fd =  open(&quot;test.txt&quot;, O_WRONLY | O_CREAT, S_IRWXU);
  }else{
    printf(&quot;open test.txt to append.\n&quot;);
    fd =  open(&quot;test.txt&quot;, O_WRONLY | O_APPEND | O_CREAT, S_IRWXU);
  }
  dup2 (fd, STDOUT_FILENO);
  printf(&quot;hello world!&quot;);
}
&lt;/source&gt;
This example opens a file (&quot;test.txt&quot;) for write and makes the standard synonymous to the open file - bytes sent to the standard output will go to the file. The &quot;O_WRONLY | O_CREAT&quot; flags cause the file to be opened for write and the file to be created if it doesn't already exist.

Information about each open file is recorded in a table managed by the OS. Each entry corresponds to an open file and the index of each entry is an integer (file descriptor), which is returned to the process opening the file as the return value of the open() system call. The entries for standard input, standard output, and standard error are reserved with predefined indices: STDIN_FILENO, STDOUT_FILENO, and STDERR_FILENO (defined in &lt;unistd.h&gt;). The dup2(index1, index2) function will copy the entry content at index1 to the entry at index2, which make the file descriptor index2 synonymous to the file descriptor index1.
====redirect standard output in a child process====
The &quot;dup2 (fd, STDOUT_FILENO)&quot; line (in the previous example) redirects the standard output of the current (main) process to the open file. If you want to redirect the standard output of a child process to a file, you will need to wait till the child process is created - after the fork() function call. The following example demonstrate the idea. You will see that the &quot;hello&quot; message from the parent process still goes to the standard output, but the standard output from the child process gets redirected to the file.
&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; 
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt; 
#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt; 
#include &lt;sys/wait.h&gt;
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt; 
#include &lt;sys/stat.h&gt;
#include &lt;fcntl.h&gt;

int main () {
  /*  The argument list to pass to the &quot;ls&quot; command.  */ 
  char* arg_list[] = {
    &quot;ls&quot;,     /* argv[0], the name of the program.  */ 
    &quot;-l&quot;, 
    &quot;/&quot;, 
    NULL      /* The argument list must end with a NULL.  */ 
  }; 

  /* Spawn a child process running the &quot;ls&quot; command. */
  pid_t child_pid = fork (); 

  if (child_pid == 0){
    /* This is the child process. */ 
    char * filename = &quot;test.txt&quot;;
    int outfile = open(filename, O_CREAT | O_WRONLY, S_IRWXU);
    if (outfile == -1){
      fprintf(stderr, &quot;Error: failed to create file %s\n&quot;, filename);
    }else{
      /* redirect the standard output from this process to the file. */
      if(dup2(outfile, STDOUT_FILENO) != STDOUT_FILENO){
        fprintf(stderr, &quot;Error: failed to redirect standard output\n&quot;);
      }

      /* Now execute PROGRAM, searching for it in the path.  */ 
      execvp (arg_list[0],  arg_list); 
      /* The execvp  function returns only if an error occurs.  */ 
      fprintf (stderr,  &quot;an error occurred in execvp\n&quot;); 
      abort (); 
    }
  }
  /* only the parent process executes the following code. */
  fprintf(stdout, &quot;Hello from the parent process.\n&quot;);

  /* Wait for the child process to complete.  */ 
  int child_status;
  waitpid (child_pid, &amp;child_status, 0); 
  
  if (WIFEXITED (child_status)){
    printf (&quot;the child process exited normally, with exit code %d\n&quot;, 
	     WEXITSTATUS (child_status)); 
  }else{ 
    printf (&quot;the child process exited abnormally\n&quot;); 
  }
  
  return  0; 
} 
&lt;/source&gt;

====use pipe() and dup2() to create pipes====
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
/* from Advanced Linux Programming (page 113) */
/* http://www.makelinux.net/alp/038 */
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; 
#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt; 
#include &lt;sys/wait.h&gt; 
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt; 

int main () {
  int fds[2]; 
  pid_t pid; 

  /* Create a pipe. File descriptors for the two ends of the pipe are

  pipe (fds); 

  printf(&quot;fds[0]=%d, fds[1]=%d\n&quot;, fds[0], fds[1]);

  /* Fork a child process.  */ 
  pid = fork (); 

  if (pid == (pid_t) 0) {
    /* This is the child process. Close our copy of the write end of 
       the file descriptor.  */ 
    close (fds[1]); 

    /* Connect the read end of the pipe to standard input.  */ 
    dup2 (fds[0], STDIN_FILENO); 

    /* Replace the child process with the &quot;sort&quot; program.  */ 
    execlp (&quot;sort&quot;, &quot;sort&quot;, NULL); 
  } else {
    /* This is the parent process.  */ 
    FILE* stream; 

    /* Close our copy of the read end of the file descriptor.  */ 
    close (fds[0]); 

    /* Connect the write end of the pipe to standard out, and write 
       to it.  */ 
    dup2(fds[1], STDOUT_FILENO);
    printf (&quot;This is a test.\n&quot;); 
    printf (&quot;Hello, world.\n&quot;); 
    printf (&quot;My dog has fleas.\n&quot;); 
    printf (&quot;This program is great.\n&quot;); 
    printf (&quot;One fish, two fish.\n&quot;); 
    fflush(stdout);
    close(fds[1]);
    close(STDOUT_FILENO);

    /* Wait for the child process to finish.  */ 
    waitpid (pid, NULL, 0); 
    printf(&quot;parent process terminated.\n&quot;);
  } 
  return 0; 
} 
&lt;/source&gt;

====An example pipe connecting two commands====
&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; 
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt; 
#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt; 
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt; 

int run_command(char** arg_list, int rd, int wd) {
  pid_t child_pid; 

  /* Duplicate this process. */ 
  child_pid = fork(); 

  if (child_pid != 0){
    /* This is the parent process. */ 
    return child_pid; 
  }else {
    if (rd != STDIN_FILENO){
      if(dup2(rd, STDIN_FILENO) != STDIN_FILENO){
	fprintf(stderr, &quot;Error: failed to redirect standard input\n&quot;);
        return -1;
      }
    }

    if (wd != STDOUT_FILENO){
      printf(&quot;redirect stdout to %d.&quot;, wd);
      if(dup2(wd, STDOUT_FILENO) != STDOUT_FILENO){
        fprintf(stderr, &quot;Error: failed to redirect standard output\n&quot;);
        return -1;
      }
    }
    /* Now execute PROGRAM, searching for it in the path.  */ 
    execvp (arg_list[0], arg_list); 
    /* The execvp  function returns only if an error occurs.  */ 
    fprintf (stderr,  &quot;an error occurred in execvp\n&quot;); 
    abort (); 
  } 
} 

int main () {
  /*  The argument list to pass to the &quot;ls&quot; command.  */ 
  char* arg_list[] = {
    &quot;ls&quot;,     /* argv[0], the name of the program.  */ 
    &quot;-l&quot;, 
    &quot;|&quot;,      /* the pipe symbol is at index 2 */
    &quot;wc&quot;,
    &quot;-l&quot;, 
    NULL      /* The argument list must end with a NULL.  */ 
  }; 
 
  int pipe_index = 2;
  int rd = STDIN_FILENO;
  int wd = STDOUT_FILENO;
  int fds[2];
  if (pipe(fds) != 0) {
    fprintf(stderr, &quot;Error: unable to pipe command '%s'\n&quot;, arg_list1[0]);
    return -1;
  }
  
  wd = fds[1]; /*file descriptor for the write end of the pipe*/

  // delete the pipe symbol and insert a null to terminate the
  // first command's argument list
  args[pipe_index] = NULL;

  // run first command: read from STDIN and write to the pipe
  run_command(arg_list, rd, wd);
  close(fds[1]);

  rd = fds[0];
  wd = STDOUT_FILENO;

  // run the second command: read from the pipe and write to STDOUT
  // the argument for this command starts at pipe_index+1
  run_command(arg_list+pipe_index+1, rd, wd);

  fprintf (stderr, &quot;done with main program\n&quot;); 
  return 0; 
} 
&lt;/source&gt;
In this example, the original list of arguments is broken into two list at the pipe symbol, which is replaced by a null value. This allows us to use the two argument lists to run the two separate commands/programs connected by the pipe.

A process is a program in execution. It is a metaphor for a entity managed by the OS. A process has its own address space and other information in OS managed data structures.

==File System==
===File System Concepts=== 
file abstraction - a byte stream, meaning is imposed by file system users
file system users - end users (humans) and direct users (programs, e.g. an application or the shell)
user perspective - a collection of system calls, such as creat, open, close, seek, delete ...
file attributes - meta data: owner, size, timestamps ...
directory abstraction - a list of files and directory, map the name of a file/directory onto the information needed to locate the data. 
absolute path and relative path
directory operations - create, delete, open, close, rename, link, unlink

===File System Implementations===
layout: partition, boot block, superblock,...
disk block allocation:
  contiguous allocation
  linked list allocation: the first word in each block is used as a pointer to the next one.
  file allocation table: linked list allocation using a table in memory. 
  i-node (index-node): an i-node is in memory when the corresponding file is open. With a i-node design we can calculate the largest possible file size.
directory implementation: i-node, long file names
file sharing: symbolic v.s. hard link
disk block size: tradeoff and compromise, wasting disk space v.s. performance (data rate)
keeping track of free blocks: linked list v.s. bitmap
system backup: 
caching:
steps in looking up a file under a path

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Strategic vs. Tactical vs. Operational ==
The term strategic is often used interchangeably with tactical, which can lead to lack of clarity.  Essentially, '''strategic''' is what you are planning to achieve and '''tactical''' is more of how you will achieve it.  Examples of these two terms are as follows:&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;u&gt;Strategy #1&lt;/u&gt;: Improve retention of key staff by 5%&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;u&gt;Tactic #1&lt;/u&gt;: Create opportunities for key staff that appeal to them—allow time for R&amp;D, implement their ideas, and allow them to participate on cross enterprise initiatives. &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;u&gt;Strategy #2&lt;/u&gt;: Reduce maintenance costs by 10%&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;u&gt;Tactic #2&lt;/u&gt;: Work towards eliminating legacy systems with high maintenance, seek to automate routine maintenance tasks, and establish controls to ensure work performed is necessary.&lt;br /&gt;

The term operational refers to day to day efforts to run the business.  Once strategies and tactics are incorporated and achieved, they become how the business or organization operates.&lt;br /&gt;

==Strategic Planning Components==
Traditional strategic plans contain a variety of core elements to help the organization achieve success.  Each of these serves a critical role in the overall plan development.  At a macro level, they include:&lt;br /&gt;

# Mission and Vision
# Values and Behaviors
# SWOT Analysis and Environmental Scans
# Goals and Objectives
# Measures
# Strategic Projects

Each of these elements is detailed below and includes actual governmental examples.&lt;br /&gt;

===Mission and Vision===
The mission of an organization serves as a foundation of the organization and conveys what the organization does, who it serves and often describes what its primary purpose is.  Noted examples found on the internet include:&lt;br /&gt;

* ''NYS Department of Health'': We protect, improve and promote the health, productivity and well being of all New Yorkers.

* ''The Office of Children and Family Services'' serves New York's public by promoting the safety, permanency and well-being of our children, families and communities. We will achieve results by setting and enforcing policies, building partnerships, and funding and providing quality services.
* It is the mission of the ''New York State Department of Transportation'' to ensure our customers - those who live, work and travel in New York State -- have a safe, efficient, balanced and environmentally sound transportation system.&lt;br /&gt;

The vision is a statement which describes an organization’s mental picture of success and where it is striving to be in 3-7 years.  Without knowing where you are headed—then any path will do—but you may end up in circles along the way!  A vision of what the future you are striving for can often help guide staff in the absence of specific directions.  &lt;br /&gt;


Sample Vision Statements include:&lt;br /&gt;

* The ''New York State Archives'' provides unparalleled services that build, maintain, and provide access to New York's records to sustain a free, open, and democratic society and to support the cultural and intellectual life of all New Yorkers. We relentlessly pursue excellence in all our endeavors .
* ''New York State Police'' Vision: To build on our tradition of service.
* ''NYS Department of Health'' Vision: New Yorkers will be the healthiest people in the world - living in communities that promote health, protected from health threats, and having access to quality, evidence-based, cost-effective health services.&lt;br /&gt;

===Values and Behaviors===
One softer side of the strategic planning process is identification of values and behaviors that are critical to organization success.  Research has shown that values typically influence behaviors, which in turn can drive results—particularly if the organizations culture and policies are aligned to support and recognize them.  Organizations that adopt a standard set of values or behaviors need to ensure that the leadership of the organization demonstrates and role models what is acceptable.  Clearly the values will be dependent on the type of organization.  For example, an audit agency would likely value accuracy, credibility and integrity over innovative, customer service or respect for the individual, but perhaps an IT organization would value dependability, excellence, state-of-the–art and reliability.  These values are often incorporated into mission statements or code of conducts.&lt;br /&gt;


Government examples in this area include:&lt;br /&gt;

''Department of Motor Vehicle'' Operating Principles:
* We work with each other and our customers in an ethical, honest and respectful manner
* We protect the confidentiality and integrity of the information in our care
* We encourage the open exchange of ideas and perspectives and provide opportunities throughout the agency to suggest improvements&lt;br /&gt;

''Department of Health'' Values: Dedication to the public good, Innovation, Excellence, Integrity, Teamwork, Efficiency&lt;br /&gt;

''New York State Troopers'' Value:
	
* Integrity: To live and work in accordance with high ethical standards.
* Respect: To treat people fairly while safeguarding their rights.
* Customer Service: To ensure that everyone we meet receives dedicated and conscientious service.
* Continuous Improvement and Learning: To constantly improve ourselves and our organization.
* Leadership: To inspire, influence and support others in our organization and communities.&lt;br /&gt;

===Enterprise Analysis=== 

Enterprise Analysis, as described in the Business Analysis Body of Knowledge v2 is to “''assess the capabilities of the enterprise in order to understand the change needed to meet business needs and achieve strategic goals''.”  &lt;br /&gt;

There are a variety of techniques that can be done to analyze the enterprise at a strategic level, and we will profile three of the most common ones here: environmental scan, SWOT analysis, and a customer and product/service matrix.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;u&gt;''Environmental Scan:''&lt;/u&gt;
Prior to embarking on the development of goals and strategies, it if often valuable to conduct an environmental scan to see which, if any, appear to be influencing the organization more than others.  By looking at the components of each factor and ranking them in order of importance, an organization can try to be more tactical in developing strategies to help achieve their goals.
* '''Customers/Constituents''':  Who are the people that are receiving goods and services from your organization?  What are their requirements, how do they interface with you, what are their demographics?
* '''Economy''': How is the current economy influencing your organization?  What is the impact of inflation, unemployment, interest rates, credit availability and local taxes on the organization?
* '''Human Resource'''s: How are we doing as an organization attracting ans retaining top talent?  Are our employees, manager and departments as productive as possible?  Are we growing the right skills sets to enable us to thrive in the future? 
* '''Infrastructure''': This relates to the internal systems and operations of the organization and includes things like information systems, equipment, tools and procedures.  Are they optimized or are we spending tons of time on maintenance and patching old equipment and systems?
* '''Organizational Culture''': This relates to the values of the organization including norms, policies, rules and rewards.  Are these aligned and support where the organization wants to be in the future?
* '''Policy''': This variable relates to the overall objectives of the organization and includes policies, plans, targets, measures, key performance indicators and strategies.  Are these aligned with the organizations values and goals?
* '''Products/Services''': Do we have the appropriate mix of products and services that will help the organization meet client needs and the achievement of the organizational mission?  Are our services offered in a manner that today’s customer expects and demands?
* '''Public Sector''': This references the influence of government such as laws, regulations and politics.  Is government ensuring free markets and corporate growth, or are the policies stifling expansion?
* '''Social''': Is the organization aligned and in tune with the overall needs of the citizens and the communities that they live in?
* '''Technology''':  This refers to the investment the organization makes in equipment, software, tools and telecommunications.  Are we leveraging current technology and economies of scale, or have we diversified away our potential savings?&lt;br /&gt;

Once an organization sees themselves in the eyes of those whom they influence, then they are ready to conduct the next exercise, a SWOT analysis.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;u&gt;''SWOT Analysis'':&lt;/u&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

SWOT stands for Strengths, Weaknesses Opportunities, and Threats, and is a common technique used by organizations to develop a common understanding of where they are today.  Using a simple 2x2 matrix, participants brainstorm the various areas as a starting point prior to development of strategies. A completed matrix is below for illustrative purposes:&lt;br /&gt;

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
| &lt;u&gt;'''Strengths'''&lt;/u&gt;: * Talented, diverse workforce. * Strong partnerships with industry associations. * Mature processes have been optimized to increase efficiencies. || &lt;u&gt;'''Weaknesses'''&lt;/u&gt;: * Aging workforce.  * Limited knowledge transfer tools.
|-
| &lt;u&gt;'''Opportunities'''&lt;/u&gt;: * Need to grow social media presence. * IT transformation facilitates sharing of resources across agencies. * Optimize website to incorporate responsive design. || &lt;u&gt;'''Threats'''&lt;/u&gt;: * Security, security, security.  * Economy still rebounding. * Limited pool of funds for infrastructure investment.
|}

===Goals and Objectives===

At a minimum, goals should include an action verb and a noun.  They can be as succinct as Improve Employee Satisfaction, Provide Quality Customer Service or Protect Consumers.  Typically they refer to where the agency wants to go, and the objectives are the actionable steps an agency employs to get there.  One of the most widely used acronym to measure the effectiveness of goals (and requirements) is SMART, attributed to a paper by George T. Doran published in the November 1981 issue of Management Review called There's a S.M.A.R.T. way to write management's goals and objectives!  In this instance, SMART stands for specific, measureable, assignable, realistic and time bound.  For example, using the goal “Provide Quality Customer Service”, possible key objectives can include:&lt;br /&gt;

* Increase/improve access to services through use of technology, including website enhancements
* Improve response time to customers
* Provide complete and accurate information to customers
* Provide fair and courteous customer service&lt;br /&gt;

Each of these is specific as a standalone goal.  They convey a specific actionable action that can be taken that is not vague or left up to the reader for interpretation.  These objectives could be measured—either through use of service delivery channels (mail vs. phone vs. internet vs. in person), cycle time process measures, and number of interactions needed to complete a transaction, and also customer satisfaction surveys.  In terms of assignable—can someone take responsibility for the achievement and measurement of each of these goals?  The next letter of the acronym is R for realistic.  While you don’t want really simple objectives, you should avoid totally unachievable ones either (e.g. world peace comes to mind)!  Realistic and time bound go together.  If you can take steps to move in a positive direction in achieving an objective, even if you cannot totally achieve it, then it is likely a worthwhile endeavor.&lt;br /&gt;

===Measures===
Often measures are referred to as key performance indicators.  In recent years, with the proliferation of data and the tools needed to link disparate and/or mine large data sets, the ability to measure performance has been enhanced.  For measures, there are a variety of different types, including process measures such as inputs and outputs, as well as outcome type measures aimed at effectiveness and efficiency of products and services delivered.  Illustrative examples of each type are in the table below:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Type of Measure !! Basic Types !! Examples of Measure Type
|-
| Inputs refer to resources used to complete or improve operations || Resources Used || * level of personal services/man hours to perform a task            * equipment usage (vs. idle time)
|-
|  || Operating Costs || * warranty Cost           * cost per transaction (by type of service delivery channel)
|-
|  || Cash Expenditures || * % capital investment             * % R&amp;D
|-
| Outputs refer to the units of work completed || Completed Work || * % of project complete            * number of workorders closed
|-
| Effectiveness refers to how well a product or service meets needs of the customer || Process Quality || * rework hours            * number of visits/calls customer had to make to complete the transaction
|-
|  || Satisfaction (customer) || * did products and services conform to requirements            * eere employees courteous
|-
|  || Satisfaction (employee) || * attrition rate            * # of employee suggestions implemented
|-
| Efficiency refers to how effectively resources were used in delivering products and services || Timeliness || * project completed on time or early             * process cycle time
|-
|  || Operating Ratios || * supervisory span of control * direct to indirect costs
|}


The key with performance measures, especially relative to strategic planning, is to select a variety of measures that show you how you are doing relative to your goals.  When establishing measures, it is helpful to keep the following criteria in mind:&lt;br /&gt;

* The measures should be relevant to what you are trying to achieve
* It must be important to the stakeholders
* The data must be obtainable and cost effective to acquire and report
* It must be easily understandable by all who review it
* Must be used for constructive purposes.

One thing to keep in mind about data—people will typically give you the information they trust you to use.  If people perceive the information will be used against them for non-constructive purposes, it is possible the numbers could be adjusted before receiving.&lt;br /&gt;

===Strategic Projects===
While measures and objectives are helpful in achieving goals, often an agency or organization needs to undertake a series of projects in order to make substantial progress towards achieving the goal.  When organizations are evaluating their portfolio for project selection, one common criteria used is alignment with strategic goals.  Will the outcomes and deliverables of the project help the organization to achieve one or more strategic goals?  How closely is the project aligned with a goal—it shouldn’t just “fit” but embody the essence of what the agency is attempting to achieve.  If a project does not help foster a goal, and it is not critical to agency infrastructure, or offer a positive ROI, then perhaps it should not be undertaken.  Projects deemed as “strategic” should be of a high enough priority that it gets the attention it deserves.  Conversely, if every project in the portfolio is considered strategic and of a high priority, then you may have diluted the importance of all of the projects.  See the section on prioritization for additional guidance on strategic project selection.&lt;br /&gt;

==Session Planning Guidelines==
When putting together a strategic planning session, there are several recommended guidelines for successful sessions, including:&lt;br /&gt;

* Allow enough time for thoughtful discussion.  Perhaps give the questions in advance for key managers to solicit input from their staff beforehand.  Typically strategic planning should be done over a full day, if not more.
* Ensure you have the right people.  Strategic Planning requires leadership commitment to carry it out.  If you do not have executive management on board, you will have difficulty implementing.
* Where possible, plan to do this off site.  If people are close enough to the office, they will pop in and out during the day and not dedicate the time and effort.
* If possible, have smaller groups do some of the up front analysis and planning and have them present their results to the larger group for input and acceptance.
* Don’t get so caught up in completing the technique that you forgot why you started the process
* Don’t let the lack of data stop you from completing the process.  Use your judgment and experience when needed.
* The plan is only as good as the follow through.  If you don’t work the plan, all you really have is a good doorstop at the end of it all.

==Techniques to Engage Staff==

Depending upon the importance and maturity level of planning within the organization, a variety of techniques can be employed to gain employee engagement.  Some examples to consider are as follows:&lt;br /&gt;

* Seek input on mission/vision—ask people to provide examples of how they would apply it in their day to day job
* Ask employees to contribute their personal values up front and feed this into the plan
* Engage staff at the department/bureau/office level to do strategic planning, cascaded from the overall agency strategic plan
* Have employees develop process measures aimed at demonstrating achievement of the organizations goals
* Engage staff at all levels of the organization to participate in strategic planning in order to gain broader input
* Publish the organizations mission, vision and values statement on the intranet.  Create posters of these and place them in the meeting rooms.&lt;br /&gt;

The important part is to communicate the plan to employees and them have them validate it.  Does it ring true?  Can they see themselves within the mission and vision?&lt;br /&gt;

==Facilitating the Generation/Acceptance of the Plan==

Once the planning has been completed, the statements drafted, the goals written and the measures established, it is time to put all the elements together in a document.  The actual format or framework varies from organization to organization—but it should be something that is published and distributed throughout the organization—not only to your managers and employees, but also your customers, suppliers and stakeholders so they have a picture of what matters most and where you are going as an organization.&lt;br /&gt;

Ideally, once the plan is finalized, it is time to “work the plan.”  This involves regularly measuring performance, and publishing the results so that all are aware how the organization is doing relative to its goals.  Where possible, leaders should use the plan to help reinforce what matters—whether it is post it notes listing the mission, putting the current measure and target on a wall for all workers to see, a key phrase on a coffee cup, employee rewards and recognition noting excellence in the values/behavior area or sharing results upon completion of a strategic project.  It is important to keep the plan alive through regular and frequent communication that reinforces key elements of the plan.&lt;br /&gt;

==Prioritization and When to Use==
Prioritization focuses on what is most important—whether it be project deliverables or an organization’s goals—prioritization helps to ranks the multiples into what matters most.  We are all faced with the need for prioritization, whether it’s juggling a large number of tasks, the email flag noting a high priority or in a medical emergency room, where those with the greatest need are served first.  The ability to prioritize can serve organizations and their staff well—when faced with multiple demands within a finite timeframe, a relative ranking of what is more important than something else can guide employees to work on the right things.&lt;br /&gt;

Typically, a good rule of thumb for prioritization is when you have more than three items, issues, requirements, projects or goals—discerning the relative importance of the items against one another offers value to those who must use them.&lt;br /&gt;

There are a number of different techniques that help organizations and teams rank the relative order of importance of like items, including:&lt;br /&gt;

	
* Strategic Alignment
* High-Medium-Low or Small-Medium-Large
* Weighted/Criteria
* Ranking
* Matrix
* Impact Analysis

Each of these are detailed below with examples in order to provide guidance in their completion.&lt;br /&gt;


==Prioritization Techniques==
While many different techniques are listed below—they are often paired together.  For example, strategic alignment may be one criteria in a weighted matrix!  Each are presented separately in recognition that they can be done individually.
===Strategic Alignment===
Strategic alignment refers to the linkage between what the organizations is trying to achieve, e.g. vision, goals, and values against a core set of deliverables, such as projects, priorities, or business processes.  Alignment refers to comparing each of the deliverables against what the organization is trying to achieve to discern relative fit.  If items are strongly aligned, then it is surmised that there is alignment.  When items kind of fit or do not seem to match up—then one could surmise there is not an alignment.  In most instances, these are a judgment call.  Items which appear to offer real value in meeting the organizations vision, goals and values should receive a higher prioritization.  Those deliverables that meet more than one strategic area should be rated even higher than those that link to a single element.&lt;br /&gt;

===High-Medium-Low===
In its simplest form, High-Medium-Low is subjective criteria that could be applied to a list of deliverables that use relative size as the criteria.  While size is used most often when ranking items high-medium-low or small-medium-large, the same criteria can also be applied to complexity, duration, benefits and cost relatively easy.&lt;br /&gt;

Caution!  When applying the use of small-medium-large or high-medium-low to multiple criteria—it is critical to ensure that when applied, all are referencing the same “desired” outcome.  Merely assuming “high” is good in all categories may result in ambiguity in your results.  For example, if we apply benefit and cost using high as a good outcome, we will tend to favor expensive outcomes (cost=high=good) over other options or alternatives.  This caution will be detailed further later in this section.  Use of high-medium-low as a simple prioritization technique is detailed below:&lt;br /&gt;

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Options !! RISK Low-Good,  Med-Depends,  High-Bad !! COST  Low-Good,  Med-Depends,  High-Bad !! TIME TO DO  Low-Good,  Med-Depends,  High-Bad !! RANK
|-
| Option A || High || High || High || 3
|-
| Option B || Med || Med || High || 2
|-
| Option C || Low || Low || Med || 1
|}


As noted in the above example, items ranked low are preferred over items ranked high.&lt;br /&gt;

===Weighted Criteria===
This form of prioritization recognizes that all criteria are not created equal.  A weighted criteria approach allows the prioritizers to identify which criteria are more important and assign a higher value/weight to the criteria.  An example of this form of prioritization can be found in the decision making section.&lt;br /&gt;

Weighted criteria is generally accepted as the best form of prioritization, however it does require additional steps and is viewed as taking too much time or as too complex in some organizations.&lt;br /&gt;

===Ranking===
This form of prioritization is seen as the most difficult to undertake when done alone.  The more items to rank, the more difficult it is to classify.  Given the subjective nature of the analysis, e.g. item “C” is more important than “A” and “E” is more important than “C”, etc., this is often best done in group settings with 2-3 people assigning the relative importance.&lt;br /&gt;

There are several techniques used to help  facilitating rank ordering items, namely a clear focus as to why they are ranked as they are and using pre-sorting to ease completion.  The clear focus technique identifies a single set of values by which to make the decision of what is most important.  Often in business, the focus is a positive impact on the bottom line.  Conversely, in government and non-profits will often look at what is best for citizens/clients.  The higher likelihood of a beneficial outcome, the higher the item will be ranked.  &lt;br /&gt;

Using a pre-sort technique suggests sorting items into different categories before ranking, such as looking at items from a high-medium and low perspective.  The items with high benefits are put in the top category and those with lessor benefits are put in the bottom category.  Once all items are initially sorted, ranking within the individual categories is an easier task.  Once completed, it is best to revisit the entire list to ensure that it is ranked appropriately and that each rank number (1,2,3,4) is used only once.&lt;br /&gt;

===Matrix===
Matrices can come in various shapes and forms—with the most commonly done in squares or linear fashion.  Square matrices typically have the criteria on the top and the alternatives being ranked in the left hand column as shown below:&lt;br /&gt;

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Option !! Criteria A !! Criteria B !! Criteria C !! Rank
|-
| Option 1 ||   ||   ||   ||  
|-
| Option 2 ||   ||   ||   ||  
|-
| Option 3 ||   ||   ||   ||  
|-
| Option 4 ||   ||   ||   ||  
|}
	

Another form of matrix is a linear one, often referred to as a quadrant, which uses a 2 dimensional Cartesian system and typically two criteria.  While seemingly more complex, it offers a unique visual representation of alternatives that can facilitate decision making.&lt;br /&gt;

To illustrate this tool, the following example and resulting chart will evaluate which projects a particular organization should undertake.&lt;br /&gt;


INSERT PEARL/etc. file…send from work.&lt;br /&gt;

This type of matrix has many alternate uses.  For example, Gartner, a major IT consulting firm uses a similar matrix to profile multiple vendors in a similar space and call them magic quadrants.  Another application is called a customer window where you apply what a customer wants versus what they receive they are getting, as a form of gap analysis.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Types of Procurements (RFx)==
One role typically facilitated by business analysts within an organization is that of defining business and system requirements used in procurement.&lt;br /&gt;
  
There are a number of different types of procurements, and they each have unique features.  Procurement guidelines vary from state to state (and country to country), so it is generally best to consult your finance and legal offices for specific dos and don’ts.  The material covered here is generic in nature to ensure applicability across all organizations.&lt;br /&gt;

The type of purchase methodology generally depends on the types of goods and services being procured.  Below are the most common forms:&lt;br /&gt;

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Type of Procurement !! Description
|-
| Invitation for Bid (IFB) || Typically the goods or services being tendered are commercially available from more than one vendor.  In this type of procurement, specifications are provided and the responsible bidder with the best price is awarded a contract.  A company must be able to clearly define specifics, including terms and conditions, in the solicitation.
|-
| Request for Information (RFI) || When companies or governments are considering procurement, they may start with a request for information from various vendors in order to better frame their procurement.  The RFI is typically not binding, and result in specific information, versus a quotation.  Generally when done, this step occurs before a formal IFB/RFQ or RFP.
|-
| Request for Quotation (RFQ) || This is the same as an IFB.
|-
| Request for Proposal (RFP) || When a custom solution is desired, often involving hardware, software and/or system development and ongoing maintenance, a request for proposal is issued.  This results in a proposal outlining how the bidder firm will meet the requirements.  Generally these take the longest to complete, but are very helpful when introducing new technologies or systems that a firm wishes to outsource.
|}

Some entities opt to try demonstration projects or proofs of concept on some technologies before making significant investments.  These types of “try before you buy” techniques can also be incorporated into the procurement.&lt;br /&gt;

All but the RFI typically results in some sort of procurement to the winning bidder(s), whether it be a purchased order (PO), in the case of a IFB/RFQ, or a contract, in the case of an RFP.  Depending upon the request, the award of a PO or contract can be to one or more vendors.&lt;br /&gt;

===Make vs. Buy===
Business and governmental agencies face the decision whether to “make or buy” on a regular basis, and typically the analysis is conducted by a business analyst.  Many factors go into these decisions, namely:
* Is this part of our current (or desired) core competence
* Do we have the necessary skills, time and capacity to build in house
* Can we develop more cost effectively than buying
* Number and reliability of suppliers in the marketplace
* Ongoing maintenance costs if we build versus likely inflation costs of suppliers in the future
* Ability to easily scale (up or down) as demand occurs in the future
* Ability to reuse or recycle components/parts into other products and services
*  Authority to contract out the products/services
* Opportunity costs of the decision (e.g. if resources diverted to build, what do we no longer have the capacity to do)

While not an exhaustive list—the one above does cover some of the more important ones to consider.  In recent years, the decision whether to make or buy has turned gray!  There is often a middle of the road option, called a hybrid, which has a little bit of both as a third alternative.  Below is a hypothetical example which outlines the three alternatives:&lt;br /&gt;

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Make !! Hybrid !! Buy
|-
| Large custom software build using internal resources || Purchase of configurable software; tweaking by internal resources || Outsource development and ongoing maintenance to a 3rd party
|-
| Integrate functionality into current systems || Use of external experts in the software to facilitate knowledge transfer for maintenance || Use of 3rd parties to assits with change management (staff training &amp; materials)
|-
| Approx 24-36 months to do || Approx 12-24 months to do || Approx 9-12 months to do
|}

Hybrid solutions can be partnering and collaboration with other parties—whether it be purchase cooperative, private-public partnership, or any variation that leverages external parties to achieve the organizational mission.&lt;br /&gt;

==Procurement Guidelines==
While these will vary by the entity letting the procurement, elements of contract law, procuring the best value for the organization, and ability to withstand scrutiny are common across all jurisdictions.  Generally, these include items such as:&lt;br /&gt;

* Posting the offering so that the opportunity is known to potential bidders (in NYS this entails posting in the NYS Contract Reporter)
* Shielding those doing the procurement from influence by potential bidders (in NYS an active procurement goes into a quiet period, bidders must avoid discussing the current offering except where allowed by law, and all contact must be noted and reported where required)
* Allowing sufficient time for bidders to put together a quote or a proposal (in NYS, these timeframes are detailed in procurement guidelines)
* Security on the part of the bidders in the form of bid bonds, letters of credit, and assurances from the corporate executives that the company will meet requirements if awarded the bid
* Development of the evaluation methodology in advance of the bids.  In NYS the categories, where applicable, are published with the values assigned, e.g. cost = 25%, technical proposal = 50%, references = 10%, etc.)
* Acknowledgement that submission of the bid creates a binding price/offer for a specified duration.

The terms and conditions specific to the procurement are generally detailed as part of the RFP/RFQ issued. &lt;br /&gt;
 
==Best Practices and Timelines==
The role of the business analyst is critical to a successful outcome.  It is generally not possible to add additional items during negotiations and contracting, so carefully detailing the specifications into a statement of work is the key to a successful contract down the road.
Below are some techniques that have helped to facilitate successful procurements:&lt;br /&gt;

* Clearly understand the industry from which you are soliciting from.  Are there industry standards to consider,

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Foreword==

This Guidebook was written by NYS Business Analysts for NYS Business Analysts.  At the request of the NYS CIO Council, specifically Adam Gigandet, Moses Kamya and Daniel Chan--a workgroup was formed to help develop Business Analysts in NYS Government, and to help establish a consistent approach across the various state agencies.  The Guidebook Committee, often on their own personal time, developed the following wikibook over two years in an effort to provide a &quot;how to&quot; guide that could be used in combination with the IIBA's Business Analysis Body of Knowledge.

As co-chair of the Guidebook Committee, I would like to thank all of the committee members for their knowledge, drafted sections, and passion in putting this terrific resource together. This would not be possible without your commitment and experience.  For a list of initial contributors, please go to the Noted Contributors later in this book.

I'd also like to thank ITS Leadership and also the NYS Forum for recognizing the importance of business analysts in IT projects; your support for our work in invaluable.  As a PM Director, I find that projects with a dedicated BA are far more efficient and effective than those without one. 

This wikibook is dedicated to all the Business Analysts out there helping their business units meet their goals, day after day, project after project!!

==About This Book==

Business Analysts are all about communication!  They carefully capture business area requirements and skillfully document and validate the needs, work closely with the customer to identify must haves from nice to haves, carefully work with the customer to draft a solution and then verify at the end that the customer requirements proposed were delivered at the time of customer acceptance.  When we initially envisioned this Guidebook--we had grand plans of not only developing this book, but also developing training and a companion mentorship program to help grow Business Analysts in NYS Government.  Won't you join us on this journey? 

==Helping us Edit The Book==

You will note there are a few section headings and notes within this wikibook that are blank or reference things to come.  We felt that to gain acceptance of this guide as a NYS standard--we would be better served having NYS help us put on the finishing touches together.  We would like this to be a collaborative effort that we can all use and follow.  While we will happily accept any and all feedback and edits--we strongly encourage you to set up a wiki account and make your edits logged in.  This will be helpful to the Committee as we review and modify the book going forward. It will also prevent your IP address from being publicly exposed while you make edits.  We look forward to your collaborative contributions to define a common approach for Business Analysis work in New York State!  Thank you.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Creativity and Its Role in Business Analysis==
===Importance of Creativity===
The Business Analyst not only needs to have a comprehensive understanding of the business and stakeholder needs, but ideally will be able to help come up with solutions to the business problems and needs.  This is where creativity comes into play.  Creativity helps to produce non-obvious solutions and decisions that are not expected through exploration of the unknown.  Creativity through idea generation, knowledge sharing and team collaboration can lead to ingenuity, resourcefulness and original ideas, resulting in more efficient, smarter solutions.&lt;br /&gt;


===Balancing Left Brain and Right Brain Thinking===
Business analysis is a finely balanced blend of left brain and right brain thinking, bringing together the logic and analytical strengths of the left brain and the more abstract and artistic capabilities of the right brain to both analyze (left brain) and then overcome the problem.  Business analysis requires “whole brain” thinking.&lt;br /&gt;

==Creativity Techniques==
===Brainstorming and Brainwriting===
Brainstorming is a technique by which a group generates ideas to solve a team problem through contributing as many ideas as possible and deferring judgment on those ideas. There is a focus on quantity and coming up with the unusual, followed by evaluation and attempt to combine and build on the ideas generated.  It is a good exercise to get a group discussing a common problem and building on participant suggestions, but it requires a good facilitator.  The facilitator will need to: &lt;br /&gt;

	
* Understand and define the problem
* Provide guidance and direction for the session
* Keep things moving and on track (without inhibiting ideas)
* Ensure all participants have the opportunity to contribute&lt;br /&gt;

Brainwriting is a technique used to generate a large volume of ideas when running a brainstorming session. Compared to brainstorming, Brainwriting can easily generate twice the number of ideas in the same time. It can be a preferred choice for solving team problems, for efficiency and participants, due to the approach it uses. &lt;br /&gt;

The Brainwriting technique starts with defining the problem and convening a group to come up with solutions.  The group first assembles as many solutions as possible, and then evaluates the solutions qualitatively. The key point of differentiation from brainstorming is that with Brainwriting each participant thinks and records their ideas individually and anonymously and without any verbal interaction. These relatively small differences change the quantity of ideas and the dynamics of the group.

&lt;u&gt;Running a Brainwriting Session&lt;/u&gt;
# Assemble the team and distribute paper.  Ask each participant to write down the defined problem at the top of a sheet of paper and then draw 3 columns down the page. Select a rounds timer. Note: Papers are to remain anonymous—no name at the top of each sheet. 
# Each participant writes 3 solutions to the problem in each of the 3 columns. They should write freely without editing the ideas.  The ideas remain anonymous and there is no discussion at this stage.
# After 3 minutes, move on to round two. Collect the papers, shuffle them and redistribute the sheets at random.  Each participant is then asked to jot down 3 more ideas under the existing row. They can build on the first 3 ideas or think of something totally new. (Note: No one should get his or her own same sheet back during round two).
# Continue for as many rounds as people want. (After round one, it doesn't matter if participants get a paper that they've already written on). 
# When all rounds are finished, collect the papers, and transfer all the ideas onto a whiteboard or flipchart for everyone to see. You can now begin the process of evaluation and selection of a solution.&lt;br /&gt;

Brainwriting is also useful in that it can be conducted with a group that is not co-located.&lt;br /&gt;

===Checklists===
Alex Osborn (the father of brainstorming) used checklists to stimulate creativity and Bob Eberle expanded on this to produce SCAMPER, a list of words to trigger the thought process.&lt;br /&gt;

Imagine you worked for a company and your latest product wasn’t selling. What could be done?&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;big&gt;S&lt;/big&gt; -Substitute Use cheaper materials?
&lt;big&gt;C&lt;/big&gt; -Combine Bundle the product?
&lt;big&gt;A&lt;/big&gt; -Adapt Change the way it’s used?
&lt;big&gt;M&lt;/big&gt; -Modify Change the packaging/design?
&lt;big&gt;P&lt;/big&gt; -Put any other uses/benefits?
&lt;big&gt;E&lt;/big&gt; -Eliminate too many features?
&lt;big&gt;R&lt;/big&gt; -Rearrange Change the sales process?&lt;br /&gt;

SCAMPER, and other checklists, helps you to manipulate problems by changing the way you look at them. If you can break away from the conventional view of a problem, how many new ideas and solutions can you come up with? Try it for any product, service or process you’re having a problem with.&lt;br /&gt;


===What-If Scenarios===
What-if analysis is a brainstorming technique used to determine how projected performance/behavior/result is affected by changes in the assumptions that those projections are based upon. There are many scenario management tools available like those built in Microsoft Excel. Modeling and simulation techniques can also be used to do What-if analysis.&lt;br /&gt;
 

===Reformulating the Problem===
Simply put, this means re-stating the problem in a different way. If we have a business process that we want to improve but Step B in the process is causing a problem:&lt;br /&gt;


* Can we re-sequence B or make it parallel?
* Can we change who (or what) does it?&lt;br /&gt;

===Role Playing===
Role playing is used where participants rehearse situations or play out solutions as a method of testing potential performance and improving solution capability/suitability.  One type of role playing may be a simulation, where a business process or function is tested through participants acting out the roles in the new solution.&lt;br /&gt;

===Provocation Techniques===
Provocation technique is a type of lateral thinking using an indirect approach. Through the generation of ideas that are outside what can realistically be implemented (via distortion, wishful thinking, etc.) a list of dramatic ideas can then be used to provoke new solutions and forward thinking.&lt;br /&gt;

===Mapping===
Mind maps are diagrams used to visually outline information and may include categories, text, ideas, and images, with a focus on one word or idea.
Concept maps focus on the connections between multiple ideas and may include text labels.

===Reverse Engineering===
Reverse engineering refers to looking at the solution to figure out how it works. By looking at working of the software application or systems, business analyst can figure out how they’re processing business rules, how they are sourcing data and how they make decision.  Thus analyst can understand how an application is supporting business. This technique is primarily useful in situation when:&lt;br /&gt;

	
* Documentation is out of date
* When current business user is not aware of the enforced business rules 
* When an old system/application needs to be upgraded and current staff does not have knowledge of system beyond maintaining it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== What's a compiled language? ==
Before knowing what that means we'll need a little insight on what happens inside a computer. Computers work with two numbers 0s and 1s, anything else is constructed using those. Now imagine for a moment you want to write an application, and small application can have thousands of those, so if we tried to write directly in binary (that's the name which receives those 0s and 1s) (indeed, possible) you should wish tipying everything perfect because only one number not in place would make the application misbehave (if it worked at all), so writing in binary it's something not thought about. So if we don't write directly computer's language, how we do to talk to the computer? Well let's consider this: your friend receives a letter in English but he doesn't know English, let's say he's German (yes, a german who does not know English) what you would do? You could do two things: either rewrite it in German or translate the letter directly in front of him.

=== Interpret ===
In computer science taking the letter and translating it directly to your friend it's known as interpreting. Just as you would do with your friend a program (called interpreter) translates those sentences to the computer and executes them, this is done when you need to execute the program. The languages which interpret are called interpreted languages.

=== Compile ===
However,rewriting the letter it's known as compiling. The program which translates from the language you can understand (called source code) to the so called binary code or machine code is called compiler,what's more, languages which use a compiler are called compiled languages.

=== Interpret vs Compile ===
So which it's better? None of those. &quot;Why?&quot; you may be asking, in computer science there's not always a &quot;better&quot;, the fact that you choose one or another depends on what you want to achieve. Interpreted languages are generally slower when executed but in turn they don't need that phase of translating everything from source code to machine code (which can be really slow!) and they normally offer some features which make them easier.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Why Learn Nimrod? ==
Before answering why you should learn something it's better to know what is that something. So..
=== What is Nimrod? ===
Nimrod is a programming language, you know, those flowings of expressions  which are used in movies and which seem to work by black magic. The truth it's that it's no black magic (indeed, it's no magic at all!) it's a language, what's more, a language used to interact with a computer. Programming languages (themselves) can't be used to pass information for that you would need a normal language, instead they pass instructions, they are like grandma's recipes, they tell people (in this case computers) how to achieve a set of things.

== Nimrod description as a programming language ==

Nimrod it's a compiled language (What means it is compiled?). So why choose a language which it's potentially difficult? (due to the fact that it is compiled) because it isn't. Nimrod it's that one in a million which is it not really difficult (as it could be C or C++) but neither slow.

== Nimrod's objectives ==
Nimrod want be a programming languges like this:
* Elegant
* Efficient (this is to be very fast and to consume less resources)
* Expressive

      <text xml:space="preserve">== First steps, hello world! ==
So here we are let's start with our very first program, shall we?
In programming languages it's been a tradition to start by writing an example of the language which displays in the console (that window with black background and white letters which seems to be from a hacker's movie) &quot;Hello world!&quot;, and it would be like this in Nimrod:

&lt;code&gt;echo (&quot;Hello world!&quot;)&lt;/code&gt;

Easy, isn't it? If you want to try it just save it to a file with extension .nim (e.g: helloworld.nim) and then compile it, for doing this open a terminal, and issue in the terminal:

&lt;code&gt;cd &quot;yourPath&quot;&lt;/code&gt;

Then type:

&lt;code&gt;nimrod c -r &quot;filename&quot; &lt;/code&gt;

This command will make it compile, then will execute it (that's the job of the &quot;-r&quot; argument), when this is done you'll see in the console &quot;Hello world!&quot;.

=== Understanding and extending ===

But how we did that? Basically we told the PC to print &quot;Hello world!&quot; by writing &quot;echo&quot; (which is what we call a function) and then telling what we wanted to print out if we wanted we could made it write other things:

&lt;code&gt;echo (&quot;It's a good day!&quot;)&lt;/code&gt;

But we are not limited to one expression we can put as many of them as we want:

&lt;code&gt;echo (&quot;It's a good day!&quot;)

echo (&quot;Hello world!&quot;)
&lt;/code&gt;

Compile this (just as we did earlier) and it'll print out into the console:

&lt;code&gt;It's a good day!

Hello world!
&lt;/code&gt;</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Scribunto: An Introduction''' is a book for people who want to learn how to program using Scribunto. Scribunto enables users to embed the Lua programming language into wikis that use MediaWiki, the software that powers Wikipedia. This book covers how to get started, basic programming techniques, and how to use some of the Lua libraries that are unique to Scribunto. It is aimed at beginners to programming, particularly those who have some familiarity with the MediaWiki software, but may also be useful to experienced programmers who are new to Scribunto.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Welcome to ''Scribunto: An Introduction''. This book is a guide to using Scribunto for non-programmers. It will tell you everything you need to know about Scribunto, from what it is, to how to write your own Scribunto programs.

== Who this book is for ==

This book is aimed at readers who are interested in learning more about Scribunto, but don't have any significant programming experience. Perhaps you have heard about Scribunto, but are not exactly sure what it is. Perhaps you want to run a Scribunto program that somebody else has written, but are confused about how to do so. Perhaps you are experienced with writing MediaWiki templates, and want to see how template coding can be translated to Scribunto coding. Or perhaps you want to learn how to program, and would like to have your work used in real life on a wiki powered by MediaWiki.

Readers who already know one or more programming languages might find that this book covers much familiar ground. Such readers may find it quicker to browse some of the materials listed in the Resources chapter or to consult the Scribunto reference manual. Even so, these readers may consider looking at the chapters that introduce constructs and libraries that are specific to Scribunto, as they are covered in more depth than they are in the reference manual.

== What is Scribunto? ==

To know what Scribunto is, first you need to know about MediaWiki. MediaWiki is the software that powers Wikipedia, the popular online encyclopedia. It is a wiki engine, which means that generally anyone can edit any page at any time. MediaWiki was built for Wikipedia, and Wikipedia's success has meant that MediaWiki has also flourished. As of February 2014, over 9,000 websites are using MediaWiki,&lt;ref&gt;https://wikiapiary.com/wiki/Statistics&lt;/ref&gt; and  over 2,000 extensions to the core MediaWiki software have been written.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension_Matrix/AllExtensions&lt;/ref&gt;

Scribunto is one of these 2,000 extensions. The name Scribunto is Latin for ''[[wikt:scribunto|they shall write]]'', which is fitting, as Scribunto allows users to write computer programs on MediaWiki wikis. Specifically, it allows users to embed scripts written in the Lua programming language. The Wikimedia Foundation, the non-profit organisation who operate Wikipedia and oversee the development of the MediaWiki software, intends these scripts as an alternative to the existing system of MediaWiki templates. Lua scripts have a significant performance advantage over MediaWiki templates, particularly for more complex templates with many parameters and multiple sub-templates. Lua scripts are also more flexible than MediaWiki templates, in some cases allowing a dramatic reduction in code size for the same functionality.

== What is Lua? ==

Lua is a programming language developed in 1993 by computer scientists at the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. It is fast and lightweight, making it ideal for use in embedded applications. It also has a relatively simple syntax, and is known for its short learning curve.

== History ==

Scribunto has its origins in MediaWiki's template system. Originally, templates were intended as a way to reuse the same content on many different pages. For example, on Wikipedia they were used to make maintenance banners for articles needing improvement, and navigational boxes for linking related articles. This greatly simplified maintenance of articles, as users could make changes to hundreds of articles simply by making one edit to a template.

In version 1.3, the MediaWiki developers added the ability to use parameters with templates, meaning the same template could display different output on different pages. Furthermore, starting with MediaWiki 1.6, these parameters could accept a default value. This made templates a lot more flexible, but had an unintended downside. By manipulating parameter names and default values, it became possible to add conditional logic to templates.

The ability to use conditional logic enabled templates to be used as a kind of programming language. Templates were never designed to do this kind of work, and using them in this way had several disadvantages. One was that the display code became mixed with the logic code, with the result that templates could not easily be indented to aid understanding. Another was that they were slow; MediaWiki was already written in a programming language with conditional logic (PHP), and adding another quasi-programming-language on top of that had a significant performance cost, especially for complicated templates. One template in particular, the &quot;[[w:Template:Qif|qif]]&quot; template, provided an easier way to use conditional logic than manipulating template parameters directly, and became quite widely used on Wikipedia, with a corresponding negative effect on performance.

To try and improve this situation, one of the lead MediaWiki developers, Tim Starling, wrote the ParserFunctions extension, which introduced logical operators including &lt;code&gt;#if&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;#switch&lt;/code&gt;. This improved performance somewhat, but was never intended as a permanent fix. Sure enough, templates based on ParserFunctions became even more complicated than those that had used qif.

A further innovation to address template performance was introduced in MediaWiki 1.12, in the form of a new preprocessor for the MediaWiki parser. This new preprocessor was designed to only evaluate template code if it was necessary. So if a template used an &lt;code&gt;#if&lt;/code&gt; parser function, MediaWiki would only evaluate the &quot;true&quot; code if the test evaluated to &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;, and would only evaluate the &quot;false&quot; code if the test evaluated to &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;. Again, this preprocessor was successful in improving MediaWiki's parsing performance, but was still slow on pages that used many complex templates.

Scribunto is the latest effort to address the performance problems of MediaWiki templates. Rather than making more improvements to parser functions or to MediaWiki's core software, the MediaWiki developers have elected to allow users to use a fully-fledged scripting language on wiki pages. This means that Scribunto-based templates have a dramatic performance increase from their ParserFunctions-based counterparts. Depending on the template, the Scribunto version can be anything from twice as fast to 50 times as fast.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Dragons_flight/Lua_performance&lt;/ref&gt; Scribunto also provides proper separation of logic code and display code, meaning that Scribunto-based templates can be easily indented and commented for readability.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is closer than previous one but has a few problems

I will assume that the instructions create a short addressing or offset addressing mode when referencing other locations so the address and instruction can be stored in data width for one instruction fetch cycle, as other full address modes would require the instruction then the following location(s) to contain the full address that would need to be fetched as well as part of instruction decode fetch cycles.

Registers involved is missing Accumulator (ACC) description that just appears in the diagrams.

The initial diagrams are correct enough

Final diagram has mistakes

# It does &quot;as if by magic&quot; jump of missing the extra fetch cycle of fetching from memory (address 206) to MBR then execute of MBR to ACC
# Due to (1) some of the registers have WRONG contents
   MAR = 206 (the memory address fetched) as ONE of the stages of the instruction decode, hence why different addressing
               modes or moving  data between registers is quicker.

   MBR = 1 the data fetched from 206

Depending on processor and memory organisation an instruction decode phase can involve many fetch cycles (multibyte reads) before it is executed, and the execution may involve a fetch (well actually store) cycle as well.

I dont know if the xercises is '''supposed''' to be a complete answer it is not as it starts on one instruction but finishes on second with bits missing in the middle the first three expanded sections end with the same wrong diagram

You could do with some ordered MNEMONICS to explain difference meant between LOAD 167 and LOAD #166 as experienced engineer with over 30 years on many languages and processors I know but someone new wont!

: - The previous page [[A-level_Computing/AQA/Computer_Components,_The_Stored_Program_Concept_and_the_Internet/Machine_Level_Architecture/Machine_code_and_processor_instruction_set]] covers LOAD 167 and LOAD #166, which should mean they can handle these questions.
: - You seem correct on the MBR, this is a simplification of the process in line with the register notation. I'll look to see if we can get an easier diagram.
: - ACC should be added to registers, do you fancy jumping in and adding a definition?

      <comment>addpath syntax</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi there,
I'm new to it all but finally figured out that the correct syntax for addpath with my version is:

    addpath('C:/Program Files (x86)/MATLAB/R2013a Student/spm/spm8')

I'm using MATLAB's latest student version.
Maybe this is some help for others.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is a list of terms often used in this book.

; args
:   Short form of &quot;arguments&quot;.
; arguments
:   The inputs to a function. For example, if I passed the argument &quot;Fred&quot; to a greeting function, it might return the result &quot;Hello, Fred!&quot; ''Arguments'' also refers to the input values that a Lua module receives from a wiki page. Such arguments are often stored in a table named &lt;var&gt;args&lt;/var&gt;. Arguments are almost the same as parameters; the difference is that parameters are the possible inputs to a function, whereas arguments are what you actually put in.
; block
:   A group of code statements that form a cohesive unit. Think &quot;chunk of code&quot;. The code inside a function definition is a block, as is the code between &lt;code&gt;then&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;end&lt;/code&gt; in an &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt;-&lt;code&gt;then&lt;/code&gt;-&lt;code&gt;end&lt;/code&gt; construct.
; child
:   The frame that is one step lower in the frame hierarchy than another given frame. For example, if a wiki page calls a template, which in turn calls a Lua module via #invoke, the frame created by #invoke is the child of the template's frame.
; debug console
:   An console for interactively running Scribunto code. It can be found on the edit screen for Lua modules, underneath the edit window and the edit summary box, and is preloaded with the code you type into the edit window. Requires JavaScript.
; frame
:   Frame objects are the interface between wiki pages and Scribunto. They allow access to arguments passed to #invoke, and to the MediaWiki parser.
; function
:   A block of code that can be reused in different places. Functions can have parameters, which allows them to produce different output for different inputs.
; invoke
:   The &lt;code&gt;#invoke&lt;/code&gt; parser function is used to run Lua modules from wiki pages. The result returned from the module is shown on the wiki page in place of the parser function code.
; key
:   Keys are the indexes for Lua tables. Normally, to find a value in a table, you let Lua know which table you want, and specify which key Lua should check. 
; library
:   Software used to write other software. Using libraries to write software is usually a lot easier than writing equivalent software from scratch. Scribunto uses both standard Lua libraries and libraries written specifically for MediaWiki. 
; Lua
:   The programming language used by Scribunto. Lua was developed in 1993 at the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. It is fast, easily embeddable, and has a relatively simple syntax. 
; MediaWiki
:   The wiki collaboration software used to power Wikipedia, the popular online encyclopaedia. Scribunto is an extension for the MediaWiki software.
; method
:   A special kind of function that belongs to an object. Used in object-oriented programming.
; module
:   The container for a Lua script. In MediaWiki, a module is a page in the Module namespace which contains Lua code. To run a Lua script you must specify both the module name and the function name. 
; namespace
:   MediaWiki's main way of organising different types of content. For example, on most MediaWiki installations, the main content is located in the main namespace, images and audio are located in the File namespace, and templates are located in the Template namespace. Namespaces are differentiated by their prefix; pages in the main namespace might have no prefix, pages in the File namespace might have a prefix of &quot;File:&quot;, and pages in the template namespace might have a prefix of &quot;Template:&quot;.
; object
:   A programming construct which contains data and the functions used to act on that data. Functions belonging to an object are known as ''methods''. Objects are the basic unit of object-oriented programming.
; parameters
:   The possible inputs to a function. See ''arguments''.
; parent
:   The frame that is one step higher in the frame hierarchy than another given frame. For example, if a wiki page calls a template, which in turn calls a Lua module via #invoke, the template's frame is the parent of the frame created by #invoke.
; parser
:   The part of the MediaWiki software that converts wikitext into HTML. Some of the steps that the parser takes to do this can be accessed from Scribunto. For example, it is possible to expand a MediaWiki template and use the resulting wikitext in a Lua module by using a frame object.
; parser function
:   Wikitext that the parser treats as special, usually delineated by double curly braces &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{ }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;#invoke&lt;/code&gt; is an example of a parser function. May also refer to the ParserFunctions extension, which provides conditional logic structures such as &lt;code&gt;#if&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;#switch&lt;/code&gt; to MediaWiki templates.
; return
:   A return value is the output of a function. If, for a given input, a function outputs the number 12, you would say the function &quot;returns 12&quot;.
; Scribunto
:   An extension to the MediaWiki software allowing scripts written in the Lua programming language to be embedded into wiki pages.
; table
:   Lua's basic data structure. A table contains pairs of keys and values. You find a value by looking up a key in the table.
; template
:   A type of MediaWiki page used to display similar or identical content on multiple pages. For example, on Wikipedia, templates are used to create navigational boxes and maintenance banners for encyclopaedia articles.
; wiki
:   A type of web application that allows people to create and edit content collaboratively. Wikipedia is an example of a wiki.
; Wikipedia
:   The popular online encyclopaedia, powered by the MediaWiki software.
; wikitext
:   MediaWiki's markup language. An innovation made early in the history of MediaWiki, wikitext allowed users to quickly create structures such as HTML lists and HTML tables without having to learn HTML itself. However, nowadays it is seen as somewhat hard to learn for the average web user who is used to more visual interfaces for creating content. Scribunto modules must output wikitext, which is then transformed into HTML by the MediaWiki parser.

:This is wiki'''books''' not wiki'''pedia'''. We don't have &quot;articles,&quot; we have books. Books are created as a nested series of pages not as stand alone pages. &quot;A guide to sex&quot; with sub pages &quot;A guide to sex/Anal sex&quot; for example is fine.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Fitness can be achieved at various levels, making the individual feel good, which may be carrying out the exercise they enjoy, this can include a daily 10 minute walk or even football on a regular basis, as it helps to build more energy within an individual’s body. Keeping fit and healthy can reduce the risks of certain diseases, as this routine produces a great change in the lifestyle to improve levels of fitness. Fitness is also the well-being of an individual as this will involve them achieving fitness through nutrition also; this will fall under the various factors to be achieved in order to actually perform activities reaching fitness.
Fitness is the term related to physical activity, it can consist of various meanings to different people, and this is because some may believe an individual should reach several goals before they can achieve fitness, whereas some may believe that fitness is the term to describe the physical activity an individual has the ability to perform.

      <comment>/* Storing Values */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Storing Values ==
We learned how to print something (using echo) but our program it's right now incredibly static, it'll just say the same thing again every time we execute it, not very instersting. So how we can solve it? Using something called variables, before explaining them let's consider an example:

&lt;code&gt;
echo (&quot;Hello world!&quot;)

echo (&quot;Hello world!&quot;)

echo (&quot;Hello world!&quot;)

echo (&quot;Hello world!&quot;)

echo (&quot;Hello world!&quot;)

echo (&quot;Hello world!&quot;)

&lt;/code&gt;
What this will do it's to write on the console &quot;Hello world!&quot; a bunch of times (I'm aware this example it's pretty idiot but it serves for what I want to explain). But always &quot;Hello world!&quot; it's boring we want another phrase here, we could change every line (in computer science those &quot;lines&quot; are called statements ), but if we wanted to change it a lots of times it would be very time consuming. So what we can do? We can use something called variables. A variable it's basically like a case where we can store information (numbers, characters, sentences), then only thing we have to do it's to announce the existence of that variable, if we don't do that the compiler (which also checks for errors) will thing we made a mistake and won't compile (and hence we won't be able to execute this). The above example with variables would be like this:

&lt;code&gt;
var sentence = &quot;Hello world!&quot;

echo (sentence)

echo (sentence)

echo (sentence)

echo (sentence)

echo (sentence)

echo (sentence)

&lt;/code&gt;
Neat. You want to change the phrase which is displayed? Fine, just change the the variable sentence and every line will change. But what we did? Let's take a careful read about that new example.

The first line it's this:

&lt;code&gt;var sentence = &quot;Hello world!&quot;&lt;/code&gt;

Indeed, we are doing here two things. We first tell the computer the existence of a new variable (using the word &lt;code&gt;var&lt;/code&gt;) and it's name (in this case the variable it's called &quot;sentence&quot;), this first step  it's called declaration (we are declaring the existance of a variable). The second thing we did is to assign a value to our variable, now our variable represents that value, writing somewhere sentence would be as if we wrote &quot;Hello world!&quot;.

Since the first line it's undesrtood, we should move on to the others:

&lt;code&gt;echo (sentence)&lt;/code&gt;

As you can see be tell the computer to print what it's inside the sentence variable (in the example it was &quot;Hello world!&quot;), the computer it's smart enough to search for a variable called sentence and display it's contents.However, you'll be wondering one thing, why we did put double quotes on the first example but not on the second? Because of the fact the second example was a variable and the first not, when we to take one string as it is (and not consider it an expression) we must put double quotes before and after the sentence (just as you would do in English).

One last thing it's the variable have types: they can be integers, decimal numbers, strings. And once declared one variable can't change it's type in Nimrod. We didn't said which type our variable is how can the computer know which type it is? We assigned some value to our variable, Nimrod it's pretty smart and understands you want your variable to be the same type as what you put there (in this case it's a string). In the case we didn't assign anything we should make explicit it's type explicitly:

&lt;code&gt;
var sentence: string
&lt;/code&gt;

string it's how the string type it's called in Nimrod.
As a side note you should know that variables are stored in computer's RAM (indeed, that's RAM's job, to store values needed by applications) and thus it's not infinite, but you should also not worry too much since today's computers have a sheer ammount of RAM and can have millions of these variables.</text>

I was trying to add a link for [[The_CSS_Cascade|''The CSS Cascade'']], as it might be of some adjacent interest.

I discover that the links are packaged, and a bit hard for me to mess with.   Please consider adding the link...Thanks, [[User:Armchair|Armchair]] ([[User talk:Armchair|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Armchair|contribs]]) 19:50, 15 February 2014 (UTC)</text>

== A review note ==

So's you know.  I discovered you'd sighted {{plainlinks|{{fullurl:Wikijunior:How Things Work/Nuclear Bomb|diff=2618323&amp;oldid=2618321}}|these edits}} on Wikijunior, which are clearly vandalism.  The main point of the review bit on Wikibooks being, after all, to record when someone has looked at edits and certified they aren't vandalism.  Just thought you'd like to know those had slipped by you.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 16:59, 18 March 2014 (UTC)

Computers are very powerful tool. Today what ever we see wouldn't have been really possible without advent of the Computers. And today computers have been able to accomplish all these task because of their Graphic Capabilities. Computer graphics makes it easy for a user to interact with the computers. Graphical display finds application is almost all the fields of knowledge known to mankind like science, engineering, government, finance, art, entertainment, education, training, etc.

Computers are powerful tool that can be used for creating various visual objects, and with the combinations of those computers can produce fantastic objects that can depicts real world objects. Computer Graphics are mainly used for design process particularly for engineering and architectural systems, almost what ever we see today are actually designed with some aid of computers. Before we explain various concepts about Computer Graphics let us have a look at various applications of Computer Graphics.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''[[w:Kidneys|Kidneys]]''' &quot;are bean shaped organs that serve several essential regulatory roles in vertebrate animals. They are essential in the urinary system and also serve homeostatic functions such as the regulation of electrolytes, maintenance of acid–base balance, and regulation of blood pressure (via maintaining salt and water balance). They serve the body as a natural filter of the blood, and remove wastes, which are diverted to the urinary bladder. In producing urine, the kidneys excrete wastes such as urea and ammonium, and they are also responsible for the reabsorption of water, glucose, and amino acids. The kidneys also produce hormones including calcitriol, erythropoietin, and the enzyme renin.&quot;&lt;small&gt;[1]&lt;/small&gt;
[[File:FullUSys copy.png|thumbnail|right]]
== What do they do? ==
Kidneys separates the waste from the nutrients using nephrons. Then, the nutrients are taken up to the body where it will be useful and help us with our other systems. Next, the extra water or wastes go down through a tube called the uterus, which then goes to your bladder. 

When you go to the bathroom, you push the urine out of your bladder and it goes to the penis, which then pushes down the urine. Now, your healthy and the wastes are gone.

== Are they useful? ==
Yes

== How can we protect our kidneys? ==
[[File:Nefrolit.jpg|thumbnail|right|A kidney stone]]
Eat the right foods and exercise daily. Also, when you have to go and use the bathroom, its a good idea to go. Or else, you will form &quot;solid concretion or crystal aggregation formed in the kidneys from dietary minerals in the urine.&quot; &lt;small&gt;[2]&lt;/small&gt; called [[w:Kidney stone|Kidney stones]]. They form in the kidneys and hurts your body badly. '''Don't hold your urine inside your bladder, or you will get kidney stones'''. 

Drink a lot of water also, and exercise a lot! 

Well... More will come later! :-)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Is there anyone still using this wikibook?  It seems quite out-of-date.  No mention of digital controllers like the Arduino.  There seems to be a lack of high-quality, peer reviewed open source tutorials on digital electronics.  Most of the examples are not kept up to date.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This chapter helps you to get started with Scribunto. It covers installation of the Scribunto software, and where on your wiki you can program in Lua.

== Installation ==

If you are using a wiki hosted by the Wikimedia Foundation such as Wikipedia, Wikibooks or Wiktionary, Scribunto is already installed. Scribunto has been enabled on all Wikimedia wikis since March 2013.

For other wikis using the MediaWiki software, you can check whether Scribunto is installed by going to the wiki's version page. On most wikis this can be accessed by typing &quot;Special:Version&quot; into the search bar. For some wikis, you may need to type &quot;Special:Version&quot; directly into the URL. Once you reach the version page, you will see Scribunto listed under the &quot;Installed extensions&quot; heading if it is installed.

If Scribunto isn't installed, there are installation instructions available on the extension's home page.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Scribunto&lt;/ref&gt;

== Module namespace ==

When Scribunto was being designed, it was decided that embedding Lua code directly onto wiki pages was undesirable. As a consequence, all Lua code run with Scribunto is contained in the Module namespace. Pages in the Module namespace that contain Lua code are often called &quot;Lua modules&quot; or just &quot;modules&quot;. All Lua modules begin with the text &quot;Module:&quot; or its equivalent in that wiki's language. Whatever the language, though, &quot;Module:&quot; will always work as a prefix to find the wiki's Module namespace.

==General==
'''Keylogging is the recording of a computer user's keystrokes.   It is used by thieves to steal internet passwords and bank details, mainly during web-page data entry.   This page describes a method for their avoidance'''.

==The Threat==
'''Keyloggers are software products that infect computers'''.   Technically, these functions can also be implemented by hard-wired circuit design in the keyboards themselves, but this matter is outside the scope of these notes.   Good anti-virus software that is available for personal computers will detect keyloggers and remove them, but every once in a while there is an omission in the virus-signature package and a keylogger persists for a while.

The main problem is to avoid a keylogger getting a clear listing of your passwords when you enter them into a text field on an internet web-page.   Fortunately, most loggers have limitations and a method exists, if not to prevent it trying, at least to give its user a hard time with your most sensitive passwords.

==Dodging the Keylogger==
'''A keylogger knows only which keys were pressed.   It does not know ''where'' the insertion point is located at the time'''.   That is to say, if instead of having the insertion point, the cursor, in the text field of interest, it were placed somewhere else on the page, the keylogger could ''not'' detect that.   If at that time twenty characters were typed, the keylogger would quite happily record these as being significant.

'''The web-page will consider only the characters typed into its password text field'''.  

The method to use is therefore this:
*'''Before starting the password entry''' click the mouse ''outside'' the text box somewhere else on the web-page.   Type a string of data that resembles the type that you use for the text field, for example, digits, letters, or mixed etc.
*'''Then click the mouse ''inside'' the text field''' and type the first character of your password.
*'''Click somewhere on the page ''again''''' and enter dummy characters, lots of them.
*'''''Back'' into the text field again''', and type another password character, then back out to do dummy data.   Move back and forth entering dummy data and password characters until the password is complete.
*'''''After'' the password is completed''' move the mouse insertion point ''outside'' the field again and add a dummy tail-piece in the same way as before.

The user can decide how much dummy data is needed and how many real characters can be typed at a time.   The main point is to make sure that the characters of the password and the sections before and after the password are padded thoroughly with data indistinguishable from that used for the password itself.

Any intruder will be faced with a very long string of key-presses to resolve, while the password will work in the normal way.

==Advanced Keyloggers==
Some more advanced keyloggers, not sure which ones, are said to be able to make images of the screen after each key-press.   In this way they can get around the more basic loggers' limitations.   The process is still undoubtedly more complex with an increased data string, but it is unclear as to whether a large set of images would be detected by the user, or what form the detection could take.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== My question is: what would an example of code that does not utilize this pattern look like (in this specific context)? ==

It's not exactly explicit to me how this design pattern solves the problem because I haven't even visualized the &quot;problem&quot; (in this specific context) yet.  I guess what I'm asking for is essentially a before and after look at working code that has been updated to use the flyweight pattern to more clearly see the benefits of the pattern comparatively and in context.

:There is no standard bad code. However, a bad code would be a code where you create as many objects as you use. In this case, each time you use a new object, you create it and lots of data are duplicate and the memory overheat. This would be a bad example.

:PS: This page is about to be updated. Meanwhile, I recommend you to read the [[w:Flyweight pattern|Wikipedia article]]. [[User:Ftiercel|Ftiercel]] ([[User talk:Ftiercel|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Ftiercel|contribs]]) 19:42, 19 February 2014 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Rigid body equilibrium exists when a rigid body under the influence of a force system is in a stable equilibrium. 
== What is a rigid body? ==
It is a fictional object that is a useful approximation. The rigid body cannot be deformed, which means it cannot be squished or broken. Mathematically, we would say that every point on the rigid body will retain their distance and position relative to one another not matter the force.  If we were to subject it to two forces approaching infinity, it would not be harmed. 
== How are they useful? ==
Rigid bodies are useful approximations because we will often be faced with materials that are not under enormous amounts of strain- the force is very small relative to the material's modulus of elasticity. We will go over how to see whether or not a rigid body is in equilibrium in [[Statics/Two-Dimensional Equilibrium|two dimensions]], and then be able to generalize that to three dimensions.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Sidechaining is an often misunderstood tool in the mixers bag that can be used to fix a variety of sonic challenges in a mix, and to shape sounds creatively as well. Technically, sidechaining is simply using a compressor on a track, but instead of the compressor listening to the input, the compressor is 'listening' to a different audio source altogether. There are many situations where it can be useful to control the volume of one track by responding to the volume changes of another. 

Ducking - Ducking is often used in producing commercial spots. The compressor listens to the announcers track and 'ducks' the background music underneath the announcer so that the volume of the music bed is raised when there is silent pauses in the announcers performance. If set properly, the effect is that the music is loud but is pushed under the voice keeping the words out in front. 

Ducking can also be used to keep the low end from 'piling up' in heavy dance music. The bass track 'listens' to the kick track so that the volume of the bass is lowered momentarily to allow the kick to dominate the bottom on the kick drum's attack.

Another popular trick is to put several rhythm guitar tracks on a bus, then set that bus compressor to 'listen' to another rhythm guitar track. This will subtly 'tighten' all the rhythm guitars together.

Sidechaining can also be used to tame a problem frequency that only occasionally pops out of a track without gutting that frequency from the entire track.
A more advanced trick is to add an eq in before the sidechained compressor and exaggerate a problem frequency. A copy of the track with the problem is made and given a separate track. When the two are sidechained together the track will play normally until the 'problem' pops up in the drum or vocal part. When the annoying frequency happens, the track is lowered momentarily without having to pull that frequency out of the entire track. This is often used on vocal tracks to tame the sibilance(high frequency content in 's'es and 't's). This is also called 'de-essing'.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">To start a mix, it's more important to have a system that you know well, than it is to have the world's most expensive speakers. Many hits have been mixed on classic Yamah NS-10's which retailed at well under US $500 for a pair. The general consensus being that if you can get a mix to sound good on NS-10's, it would sound good anywhere. The first step is to listen to as many professionally done recordings on your speakers as you can so that you can hear how things should sound on YOUR speakers and in YOUR listening environment.</text>

      <comment>Listed a few problems with the page.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">I am having a hard time understanding this page because there seem to be so many errors. I don't feel confident enough to just correct them myself, so I will list them here.
# 300px-Cartesian_plane.svg.png labels the negative X axis incorrectly. The -1 label should be -2, the -2 label should be -3, and so on. Point P(-1, -2) is drawn at (-2, -2), although it agrees with the x axis label. The X and Y labels pointed to by the Y and X axis rays (arrows) should be labeled Y and X, respectively to indicate increasing positive Y and X.
# The statement &quot;For example, if P (3, 4) is on the same vertical line as Q (3, y), then y = 4.&quot; seems incorrect. Points on the same vertical line have the same x values, as do P and Q, but you cannot say anything about Q's y value. The example should read &quot;For example, if P (3, 4) is on the same vertical line as Q (x, 2), then x = 3.&quot;
# in Cartesian_plane_problem.svg, points P and Q are drawn switched.
# When I saw the page, the \begin \end and bracketed formatting codes were not working, displaying in bright red text &quot;Failed to parse(unknown function '\begin')&quot; and so on.
These problems are beyond my ability to fix.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Now that you are set up with a working version of Scribunto, it is time for you to write your first Lua program. All this program will do is output the text &quot;Hello, world!&quot; Not so useful by itself, perhaps, but we have to start somewhere.

== The debug console ==

First, we will run the program in the ''debug console'', a text entry box that you can use to try out Lua code. To find the debug console, enter any module page in &quot;edit&quot; mode. You should see it near the bottom of the page.&lt;ref&gt;The debug console requires JavaScript to run. For most people JavaScript will be turned on by default, but if you have disabled it then you will not be able to use the debug console. If you have JavaScript enabled but the debug console is not visible, there may be a JavaScript conflict preventing it from loading. Please ask your wiki's technical support staff for help. For Wikimedia wikis, the English Wikipedia's [[w:WP:VPT|technical village pump]] may be able to provide assistance.&lt;/ref&gt; It looks like this:

[[File:Scribunto debug console.PNG|frame|none|alt=A grey text-entry box with usage instructions above, and a &quot;clear&quot; button below.|The Scribunto debug console.]]

Once you've found the debug console, click on the text entry box, type the following code, and press enter.

{{Code:Lua
| code =
= &quot;Hello, world!&quot;
}}

After you press enter, you should see the following appear below the text you wrote:

{{Code:Lua
| output =
Hello, world!
}}

Congratulations! You have just written your first Lua program. Let's look at the code in more detail.

The equals sign (&lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt;) at the start of the program is a special command used in the debug console that runs the code on the current line. It must be used at the beginning of a line, and it can only be used in the debug console. So in our program, the code &lt;code&gt;= &quot;Hello, world!&quot;&lt;/code&gt; means 'run the code &lt;code&gt;&quot;Hello, world!&quot;&lt;/code&gt;'.

The two double quotes (&lt;code&gt;&quot;&quot;&lt;/code&gt;) tell Lua to make everything inside them behave as a block of text. Blocks of text like this are known as ''strings'' to programmers. If you don't include the double quotes, Lua thinks that you are trying to input a command, and gets confused.

{{Code:Lua error
| code =
= Hello, world!
| output =
Lua error in console input at line 6: ')' expected near '!'.
}}

Lua knows that you made a mistake somewhere, but doesn't know exactly what it was, so it guesses that you need a &quot;)&quot; somewhere (wrong in this case).

Note that the spacing doesn't matter. You can put as many spaces as you want between the equals sign and &quot;Hello, world!&quot;

{{Code:Lua
| code =
=        &quot;Hello, world!&quot;
| output =
Hello, world!
}}

== Running the code on wiki pages ==

At this stage, you are probably wondering how we can get our program to display on a wiki page. To do this, things get slightly more complicated. The creators of Scribunto, in their infinite wisdom, have decided that Scribunto programs have to be structured in a certain way, and that certain Lua functions (such as the &lt;code&gt;print&lt;/code&gt; function) should not be available. This was done to increase the quality of code that Scribunto users will write. The theory goes that teaching people good habits is more important than the convenience of being able to use functions like &lt;code&gt;print&lt;/code&gt;. This means that what would be a very simple program to write in standard Lua becomes more involved in Scribunto. The code we need is this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;lua&quot;&gt;
p = {}

function p.hello_world()
	return &quot;Hello, world!&quot;
end

return p
&lt;/source&gt;

To run this code, we need to make a new module page. We will use &quot;[[Module:Hello]]&quot;, but you can call it whatever you want. To get to the new page, you can make a link to your module using the syntax &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Module:Hello]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and then follow that link, or you can type &quot;Module:Hello&quot; into the URL in place of the page name. Some wikis, for example the English Wikipedia, will also give you a link to follow if you type &quot;Module:Hello&quot; into the search bar. Once you are at the module page, click on the &quot;Edit&quot; or &quot;Create&quot; tab at the top of the page to get the edit view. Then copy and paste the code above into the edit box, and save the page. Your module is now ready to be run. 

You can run the code from any normal page on your wiki, for example [[Special:MyPage|your user page]] or a [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox page]]. Edit the page, and type in the following text:

 &amp;#123;{#invoke:Hello|hello_world}}

If you named your module something other than &quot;Module:Hello&quot;, then replace the first &quot;Hello&quot; with the name of your module. Then save the page. The page should now display the text, &quot;Hello, world!&quot; If this worked, then give yourself a pat on the back. You have just written a Lua module and displayed it from wikitext; that's not something that every wiki editor can do.

There are quite a few concepts in the module code above that are new to us. Try not to worry about them too much. For now, it is enough that you know that this module code will produce &quot;Hello, world!&quot; on a wiki page. You will learn about all the other concepts as you progress further through this book.

This is an example module that demonstrates how to access arguments. It is used in [[Scribunto: An Introduction]].

=== Hello world ===

 &amp;#123;{#invoke:ArgsDemo|hello_world}}

This function displays the text &quot;Hello, world!&quot;. It doesn't use any arguments.

Example:

* &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{#invoke:ArgsDemo|hello_world}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; &amp;rarr; {{#invoke:ArgsDemo|hello_world}}

=== Hello ===

 &amp;#123;{#invoke:ArgsDemo|hello|''name''}}

This function greets the specified user. It uses one argument, ''name''.

Examples:

* &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{#invoke:ArgsDemo|hello|Fred}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; &amp;rarr; {{#invoke:ArgsDemo|hello|Fred}}
* &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{#invoke:ArgsDemo|hello|Jane}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; &amp;rarr; {{#invoke:ArgsDemo|hello|Jane}}

=== Add ===

 &amp;#123;{#invoke:ArgsDemo|add|''num1''|''num2''}}

This function adds two numbers, ''num1'' and ''num2''.

Examples:

* &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{#invoke:ArgsDemo|add|5|3}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; &amp;rarr; {{#invoke:ArgsDemo|add|5|3}}
* &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{#invoke:ArgsDemo|add|100|25}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; &amp;rarr; {{#invoke:ArgsDemo|add|100|25}}

=== Count fruit ===

 &amp;#123;{#invoke:ArgsDemo|count|bananas=''number''|apples=''number''}}

This function displays how many apples and how many bananas we have. It uses named arguments.

Examples:

* &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{#invoke:ArgsDemo|count_fruit|bananas=5|apples=3}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; &amp;rarr; {{#invoke:ArgsDemo|count_fruit|bananas=5|apples=3}}
* &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{#invoke:ArgsDemo|count_fruit|apples=7|bananas=4}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; &amp;rarr; {{#invoke:ArgsDemo|count_fruit|apples=7|bananas=4}}

=== Has fruit ===

 &amp;#123;{#invoke:ArgsDemo|has_fruit|''name''|bananas=''number''|apples=''number''|cherries=''number''}}

Displays the number of bananas, apples and cherries a named person has. This function mixes positional arguments with optional named arguments.

Examples:

* &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{#invoke:ArgsDemo|has_fruit|Fred|bananas=5|cherries=7}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; &amp;rarr; {{#invoke:ArgsDemo|has_fruit|Fred|bananas=5|cherries=7}}
* &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{#invoke:ArgsDemo|has_fruit|Jane|cherries=9|apples=4}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; &amp;rarr; {{#invoke:ArgsDemo|has_fruit|Jane|cherries=9|apples=4}}

=== Custom fruit ===

 &amp;#123;{#invoke:ArgsDemo|custom_fruit|''fruit1''=''number''|''fruit2''=''number''|...}}

Displays the number of items of different fruit. Any fruit can be displayed; the function is not limited to particular types of fruit as it was in previous functions. This is done by iterating over the arguments. Note that the arguments are processed in an arbitrary order.

Examples:

* &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{#invoke:ArgsDemo|custom_fruit|pineapples=10|oranges=5}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; &amp;rarr; {{#invoke:ArgsDemo|custom_fruit|pineapples=10|oranges=5}}
* &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{#invoke:ArgsDemo|custom_fruit|lemons=6|grapefruits=3|bananas=4|grapes=20}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; &amp;rarr; {{#invoke:ArgsDemo|custom_fruit|lemons=6|grapefruits=3|bananas=4|grapes=20}}

=== Custom fruit 2 ===

 &amp;#123;{#invoke:ArgsDemo|custom_fruit_2|''name''|''fruit1''=''number''|''fruit2''=''number''|...}}

Displays the number of items of different fruit that a named person has. Similarly to the &lt;code&gt;custom_fruit&lt;/code&gt; function, this function iterates over the arguments, and so is not limited to any particular types of fruit. The difference is that the function checks that each fruit is not the first positional parameter, so that ''name'' isn't erroneously listed as a fruit.
 
Examples:

* &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{#invoke:ArgsDemo|custom_fruit_2|Fred|pineapples=10|oranges=5}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; &amp;rarr; {{#invoke:ArgsDemo|custom_fruit_2|Fred|pineapples=10|oranges=5}}
* &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{#invoke:ArgsDemo|custom_fruit_2|Jane|lemons=6|grapefruits=3|bananas=4|grapes=20}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; &amp;rarr; {{#invoke:ArgsDemo|custom_fruit_2|Jane|lemons=6|grapefruits=3|bananas=4|grapes=20}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">From wikipedia: In [[w:mathematics]] and [[w:computer science]], '''currying''' [''schönfinkeling''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=John C.|last=Reynolds|authorlink=John C. Reynolds|title=Definitional Interpreters for Higher-Order Programming Languages |journal=[[Higher-Order and Symbolic Computation]]|volume=11|issue=4|page=374|doi=10.1023/A:1010027404223|quote=In the last line we have used a trick called Currying (after the logician H. Curry) to solve the problem of introducing a binary operation into a language where all functions must accept a single argument. (The referee comments that although “Currying” is tastier, “Schönfinkeling” might be more accurate.)|year=1998|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Slonneger and Barry L. Kurtz. ''Formal Syntax and Semantics of Programming Languages''. p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt;] is the technique of transforming a [[w:function (mathematics)|function]] that takes multiple [[w:parameter (computer science)|arguments]] (or a [[w:tuple]] of arguments) in such a way that it can be called as a chain of functions, each with a single argument ([[w:partial application]]). It was originated by [[w:Moses Schönfinkel]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Christopher|last=Strachey|authorlink=Christopher Strachey|title=Fundamental Concepts in Programming Languages|journal=[[Higher-Order and Symbolic Computation]]|volume=13|pages=11–49|year=2000|quote=There is a device originated by Schönfinkel, for reducing operators with several operands to the successive application of single operand operators.|doi=10.1023/A:1010000313106|ref=harv}} (Reprinted lecture notes from 1967.)&lt;/ref&gt;
and later worked out by [[w:Haskell Curry]].&lt;ref&gt;Henk Barendregt, Erik Barendsen, &quot;[ftp://ftp.cs.ru.nl/pub/CompMath.Found/lambda.pdf Introduction to Lambda Calculus]&quot;, March 2000, page 8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Curry|first=Haskell|coauthors=Feys, Robert|title=Combinatory logic|publisher=North-Holland Publishing Company |volume=I|edition=2|year=1958|location=Amsterdam, Netherlands}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Functional languages allow the partial application of functions with currying, for example we can currify operators:

&lt;source lang=&quot;scala&quot;&gt;
val * = (a:Int) =&gt; (b:Int) =&gt; a * b
val timesthree = *(3)
timesthree(4)
&lt;/source&gt;

And the result of &lt;code&gt;timesthree(4)&lt;/code&gt; will be 12.

This allows defining new functions easily by passing only some of the arguments that the curried function needs. These functions are normal functions that can be used in any other higher order function (e.g. map).

Here are some examples of curried function definitions and invocations:

&lt;source lang=&quot;scala&quot;&gt;
object smallExamples {
  
  def currysum(x:Int)(y:Int)(z:Int) = x + y + z
  
  val currysum2 = (x: Int) =&gt; (y: Int) =&gt; (z: Int) =&gt; x + y + z
  
  val currysum3: Int =&gt; Int =&gt; Int =&gt; Int = x =&gt; y =&gt; z =&gt; x + y + z
  
  def nocurrysum(x:Int, y:Int, z:Int) = x + y + z
  
  val currysum4 = (x: Int) =&gt; (y: Int) =&gt; (z: Int) =&gt; nocurrysum(x, y, z) 

  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
      val res = (smallExamples currysum 2)(3)(4)
      val res2 = (smallExamples currysum2 2)(3)(4)
      val res3 = smallExamples.currysum3(2)(3)(4)
      val res4a = (smallExamples currysum4 2)
      val res4b = res4a(3)
      val res4 = res4b(4)
      val res5 = smallExamples.nocurrysum(2, 3, 4)
      val resno = ((smallExamples.nocurrysum(2, _:Int, _:Int))(3, _:Int))(4)
      println(res)
      println(res2)
      println(res3)
      println(res4)
      println(res5)
      println(resno)
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that the function &lt;code&gt;nocurrysum&lt;/code&gt; is not curried but we can create a curried function by specifying an empty parameters (&lt;code&gt;_&lt;/code&gt;) indicating their type.

Hey. I work mostly reverting vandalism and I think that having the reviewer flag will be beneficial, given that my edits would not need to be reviewed. I could say that I'm a globally trusted user who works fighting vandalism cross-wiki :) — [[User:Hahc21|&lt;font color=&quot;#333333&quot;&gt;'''ΛΧΣ'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Hahc21|&lt;font color=&quot;#336699&quot;&gt;'''&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt;'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 06:22, 3 March 2013 (UTC)
* Hm.  You've made one content-space edit here.  Note the autopromotion criteria at [[Wikibooks:Reviewers]]; we ''do'' sometimes promote folks manually ahead of schedule, but the reason we set the criteria to wait until a user is moderately seasoned is so that reviewers have some familiarity with the ways we do things that make us different from other projects (usually Wikipedia is the biggest hazard since, realistically, regular contributors to most of the other sisters are already aware that every sister is different, whereas it's really easy for a Wikipedian to be so overwhelmed by that place that they just don't realize how things vary from sister to sister).

: You only just arrived here.  To me, it does seem a little early for promotion.  Remember, other than Wikijunior, when you revert vandalism the revert is instantly visible (and when you undo it on Wikijunior, the vandalism wasn't instantly visible anyway).  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 12:26, 3 March 2013 (UTC)

I've made close to 60 edits to Wikibooks, so, while I'm not really experienced, I'm not miles and miles from being automatically promoted. That said, my main focus here is reverting vandalism, and it would be good to have a rollback button for that. I have experience with being a rollbacker on WMF projects--I have been a rollbacker on the English Wikipedia since January and was a rollbacker on Wikidata for several months (before I became an admin there). Thanks, --[[User:King jakob c 2|Jakob]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:King jakob c 2|Scream about]] [[Special:Contributions/King jakob c 2|the things I've broken]])&lt;/small&gt; 19:34, 13 November 2013 (UTC)
: Afaics, the two autopromotion criteria you're short on are total edits (criterion is at least 100, you've got a little more than fifty) and total content-space edits (criterion is at least 50, I think you've got about forty); you look fine on things like at least 8 edits spaced 2 days apart.
: I'd forgotten rollback is bundled with reviewer.  I'm inclined to grant, though I'll wait just a bit just in case somebody wants to object.  (Usually if there are objectors I'm one of them, so I have a certain sympathy for someone who wants to object but finds it's already been granted.)  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 21:14, 13 November 2013 (UTC)

ظَرْفُ المَكَانِ و ظَرْفُ الزَََّمَانِ designs to the time and the place of an event (المَفْعُولُ فِيهِ). It is considered an optional part of phrase structure. The word &quot;ظَرْفُ&quot; literary means container, in the Arabic grammar it generally means the container of event. It contains the time الزَََّمَانِ and the place  of a certain event المَكَانِ. The tool of questioning about time is &quot;مَتَى&quot; and place is &quot;أَيْنَ&quot;. 


== ظَرْفُ الزَََّمَانِ ==
There is a difference between time and time container. Time container refers to the time of an event but you can use time as a subject or a object (mark the no use of container in other phrase structure). For example:
Yesterday was great. الأَمْسُ كَانَ رَائِعََا. In this sentence, yesterday is the subject of the sentence. 
I came yesterday. جِئْتُ بِالأَمْسِ. In this sentence, yesterday is a time container. (The sentence &quot;I came&quot; still makes sense without yesterday, it just has less precision. It is the same in Arabic, &quot;جِئْتُ&quot; represents a complete sentence. 

Time container in Arabic grammar has different groups. There are the inflective words &quot;الظّرفُ المُعْرَبُ&quot; (words that can be used in different positions not only as a time container like the one in the examples). There are the built words (time prepositions) &quot;الظّرفُ المبنيُّ&quot; (these are complex words or simple words that can only refer to time container and cannot be used in other position.


==== الظّرفُ المُعْرَب ====
The inflective words, they refer to time in general and can be used as a time container:
Second ثانية. I left for a second: غِبْتُ لثَانِيَةٍ
Hour ساعة. he will arrive after an hour: سَيَأْتِي بَعْدَ سَاعَةٍ
Never أبداً. It will never fly: لَنْ تَطِيرَ أَبَدًا


==== الظّرفُ المبنيُّ ====
The built words can't be used in time for general use, it means time container and some time other different meanings.
Examples:
Since منذُ. I was awake since 6am: كُنْتُ مُسْتَيْقِظًا مُنْذُ السَّادِسَةِ صَبَاحًا. 
Now الآنَ. I am reading now: أَنَا أَقْرَأُ الآنَ.
Until ريثما. I will wait until he comes: سَأَنْتظِر رَيْثَمَا يَأْتِي.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello Hans Adler or other maintainers,

Here's a first attempt at filling in the &quot;[something about 7, 8 or 9 cards in the stock which I cannot follow]&quot; section.  I'm working from the 1896 edition of &quot;Encyclopédie des jeux de cartes&quot; available on http://gallica.bnf.fr/

As you've already translated, the section on misdealing (top of p. 24) covers the case of one person having 13 cards instead of 12, the other person having 12, and the talon having 7 cards instead of 8.  I mention this to clarify the logic of the game rules, because the section you are confused about refers to this case.

The confusing section itself primarily refers to one face-up card in the talon.  I am assuming &quot;retournée&quot; means &quot;turned over&quot;, not &quot;taken and then given back&quot;.  The top of p. 23 seems to use it in the same sense.  Translating the section fairly literally, but simplifying the nuances of the writing style, I come up with:

&quot;Whenever a turned-up card is found in the talon, even if the talon may have 7, 8, or 9 cards, that is if the deal must be played, the deal shall stand, provided however that the card turned up was not the card on top of the talon or the topmost of the three cards allotted to nondealer.  The rule for misdeal is not relevant here, of giving nondealer the right to have a new deal or keep the hand and thereby giving him the power to act according to whether his hand is good or bad.&quot;

The part about &quot;that is if the deal must be played&quot; seems to distinguish these cases:
* 8 cards in the talon and 12 in both players' hands.
* 7 cards in the talon, 12 in one player's hand, 13 in the other's, and nondealer has decided to play, as covered in the section on misdeals.
* 9 cards in the talon, but where is this covered?
…from these:
* There can't be 6 or fewer cards in the talon, because then someone would have 14 or more cards in hand, forcing a redeal as described in the section on misdeals.
* 10 or more cards in the talon?
but I am still a little confused about that myself.

Happy to discuss translations,

Olivier Burlot checked the translation and suggested these changes (in a private message on BoardGameGeek).  I have incorporated most of them.  When I check the original, I will include the rest.

* 'so long as no card has been &quot;played and covered&quot;' I don't see it meaning anywhere else than during the trick playing phase.

* I think it isn't mentioned that non-dealer must discard at least one card.

* &quot;compter à la muette&quot; means that the penalised player can't score points for whatever combinations he holds while his opponent's combinations are all considered valid (and score) even those who are of an inferior strenght than the penalised player's. (It is briefly explained later in the original book).

* &quot;As a result, the last trick consists only of a single card&quot; can be &quot;the last tricks&quot; in the case of 11 cards or less.

* &quot;announces it as a major huitième, [...] if it contains the Ace, otherwise as a second, third etc. such.&quot; The book doesn't mention the obligation to indicate the strength of the sequence that you hold during the originl announcement (in practice this must be done only if the opponent says he has a sequence of equal length, this prevents giving too much information in the case of an inferior sequence).

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;!-- Please add categories to the bottom of this page, and add interwikis to Wikidata. --&gt;

This module provides a way to generate tables of contents for books.

=== Usage ===

This module, in order to be used, must be invoked directly, which means there is no intermediary template. In theory, an intermediary template could be created, but it would only support a limited number of arguments, while the direct invocation of the modules allows an unlimited number of arguments.

This module recognizes an unlimited number of sequences of four numbered parameters that respectively indicate the name of a section, the page of that section (the name of the page on the wiki to which the section label will link), the description of that section and the completion status of that section (a multiple of 25 smaller than 100 followed by a percentage sign). Only the first is required, and the format of the table of contents will adapt automatically depending on which parameters are given values to.

The module recognizes some named parameters that are described in the next section. Parameters, both named and numbered, are considered to have a value when they are provided an argument that does not contain only whitespace.

=== Parameters ===

All the parameters described here are optional.

; indent
: This is the length of the left margin of the section list, specified as [http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/box.html#value-def-margin-width a CSS margin length].
; list style
: The value of this parameter will be used as the value for the &lt;code&gt;list-style&lt;/code&gt; CSS property of the section list. The most common use is to remove the bullets of a list by setting it to &lt;code&gt;none&lt;/code&gt;.
; page name prefix
: This is a prefix added to all page names given for sections. It is most commonly used to add the name of the book to the page names with &lt;code&gt;{{FULLBOOKNAME}}&lt;/code&gt;.
; unordered
: The list of sections will be ordered unless an argument is provided for this parameter.

=== Examples ===

This module will, depending on whether descriptions are provided and on whether the section list is ordered or not, adapt the layout and appearance of the table of contents.

==== Described sections ====

&lt;pre&gt;
{{#invoke:table of contents|generate
| Section 1 | Section 1 | This is the first section.   | 100%

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Elm''' is a [[w:functional programming|functional programming]] language for [[w:Declarative programming|declaratively]] creating [[w:web browser|web browser]] based [[w:graphical user interface|graphical user interface]]s.

Elm uses the [[w:Functional reactive programming|Functional Reactive Programming]] style and [[w:purely functional|purely functional]] graphical layout to build user interface without any destructive updates.

== Description ==

The primary implementation of Elm compiles to JavaScript and HTML, with the use of CSS styles.

In Elm, Functional Reactive Programming takes the place of event handlers and callbacks; it also manages all screen updates automatically. Purely functional graphical layout takes the place of working with the DOM. Elm also allows [[w:Markdown|Markdown]] to be embedded directly.

== Syntax and Semantics ==

Elm adopts a [[w:Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] styled syntax, with influences from [[w:OCaml|OCaml]] and [[w:FSharp|FSharp]]. For example, &quot;has type&quot; is written with a single colon &lt;code&gt;(:)&lt;/code&gt;, and forward and backward function application use the &lt;code&gt;(&lt;|)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;(|&gt;)&lt;/code&gt; operators&lt;ref name=&quot;syntax&quot;&gt;[http://elm-lang.org/learn/Syntax.elm The Syntax of Elm]&lt;/ref&gt; where &lt;code&gt;(f x)&lt;/code&gt; equals &lt;code&gt;(f &lt;| x)&lt;/code&gt; equals &lt;code&gt;(x |&gt; f)&lt;/code&gt;.

Elm has extensible records&lt;ref&gt;[http://elm-lang.org/learn/Records.elm Elm - Extensible Records]&lt;/ref&gt; which safely provide much of the flexibility of [[w:Javascript|Javascript]]'s object model.

The type system supports primitive types like integers and floats, structured data like tuples and records, and custom [[w:Algebraic data type|ADT's]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://elm-lang.org/learn/Getting-started-with-Types.elm Elm - Getting started with Types]&lt;/ref&gt;

Elm's version of [[w:Functional reactive programming|Functional Reactive Programming]] is event-driven, meaning that updates are only performed as necessary. It shares the closest resemblance to Event-Driven FRP&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
 | last1 = Wan | first1 = Zhanyong
 | last2 = Taha | first2 = Walid
 | last3 = Hudak | first3 = Paul
 | author3-link = Paul Hudak
 | title = Event-Driven FRP
 | journal = Proceedings of the 4th International Symposium on Practical Aspects of Declarative Languages
 | pages = 155–172
 | year = 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://elm-lang.org/learn/What-is-FRP.elm Elm - What is Functional Reactive Programming?]&lt;/ref&gt; and Arrowized FRP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite doi|10.1145/581690.581695}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;arrowized&quot;&gt;[http://elm-lang.org/blog/announce/0.5.0.elm#automatons Elm - The Libraries You Need] ''Automaton'' as an arrow implementation&lt;/ref&gt;

The following program displays the position of the mouse as it moves around the screen, automatically updating the screen in real-time. Note: Elm ''import'' correspond to Haskell's ''import qualified''.&lt;ref name=&quot;import&quot;&gt;[http://elm-lang.org/blog/announce/0.8.elm#importing-modules Version 0.8 release notes] Section &quot;Importing modules&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
import Mouse     -- qualified import

main = lift asText Mouse.position
&lt;/source&gt;

The value of main is displayed on screen. Function asText turns any value into a displayable textual representation. Mouse.position is a value that changes over time, called a signal. Function lift ensures that asText is applied to Mouse.position every time the mouse moves.

Elm has a small but expressive set of language constructs, including if-expressions, let-expressions, case-expressions, anonymous functions, and list interpolation.&lt;ref name=&quot;syntax&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://elm-lang.org/About.elm About Elm] Elm features&lt;/ref&gt;

Elm also has both a module system and a foreign function interface for JavaScript.&lt;ref&gt;[http://elm-lang.org/learn/JavaScript-Integration.elm Elm - JavaScript Integration]&lt;/ref&gt;

The predefined functions are in the ''Prelude'' module.&lt;ref name=&quot;prelude&quot;&gt;[http://elm-lang.org/docs/Prelude.elm Elm's Prelude]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Values ===

Values are immutable:

* Bool, Int, Float.&lt;ref name=&quot;prelude&quot;/&gt;
* Char,&lt;ref&gt;[http://elm-lang.org/docs/Char.elm Char library]&lt;/ref&gt; String,&lt;ref name=&quot;prelude&quot;/&gt; (styled) Text.&lt;ref&gt;[http://elm-lang.org/docs/Text.elm Text library]&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Time, Date.&lt;ref&gt;[http://elm-lang.org/docs/Date.elm Date library]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Element (html structural elements).&lt;ref&gt;[http://elm-lang.org/docs/Graphics/Element.elm Element library]&lt;/ref&gt;
* graphic representations (called Forms), shapes and paths.&lt;ref name=&quot;collage-lib&quot;&gt;[http://elm-lang.org/docs/Graphics/Collage.elm Collage library]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
toForm : Element -&gt; Form
&lt;/source&gt;
&gt;&gt; toForm turns any Element into a Form. This lets you use text, gifs, and video in your collage. This means you can move, rotate, and scale an Element however you want.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

* Records values.
* [[w:Algebraic data type|Algebraic data type]]s (''data'' clause) values.

=== Signals ===

Signals are value varying items and have types as &lt;code&gt;(Signal value_type)&lt;/code&gt;.

They include time varying items (also called [[w:behavior#Computer science|behaviors]]) and event driven sources.

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
-- current time, updated every t (from Time lib)
every : Time -&gt; Signal Time

-- current mouse position (from Mouse lib)
position : Signal (Int,Int)
&lt;/source&gt;

Html form input elements, may vary in style and state. Their generator functions mostly return a pair (element signal, status signal)&lt;ref&gt;[http://elm-lang.org/docs/Graphics/Input.elm Graphics.Input library]&lt;/ref&gt; as in
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
-- create a checkbox with a given start state.
checkbox : Bool -&gt; (Signal Element, Signal Bool)
&lt;/source&gt;

==== Dependent signals ====

Dependent signals are like [[w:formula|formula]] cells in a [[w:spreadsheet|spreadsheet]]. They may react to updates of their operand signals.

The one defined as ''main'' starts the scanning of the dependency/reaction [[w:directed graph|directed graph]] to find the independent signal variables for inclusion in the source event loop.

You define signal ''formulas'' by using signal filter functions, or by applying lifted value functions to previously defined signals. To apply a function of N parameters, you have to lift the type of a '''values''' function to a '''signals''' function, either through the ''lift&lt;N&gt;'' function, or by applying ''lift'' to the function, followed by signal applicative terms as &lt;code&gt;((~) signal)&lt;/code&gt; for functional parameters application exposed below.&lt;ref name=&quot;signal-lib&quot;&gt;[http://elm-lang.org/docs/Signal.elm Signal library]&lt;/ref&gt;

You can use a value in a signal position by lifting its type through the ''Signal.constant'' function.

==== From a [[w:Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] perspective ====
===== Signal as a Haskell's Functor instance =====

See Functor class def.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/libraries/base/Control-Monad.html#t:Functor Haskell class Functor def.]&lt;/ref&gt; From Elm's Signal library:&lt;ref name=&quot;signal-lib&quot;/&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
-- lift a ''values'' function type to a ''signals'' function one

-- similar to Haskell's ''fmap'' and ''Control.Applicative.liftA''
lift : (a -&gt; b) -&gt; Signal a -&gt; Signal b

-- (&lt;~) is an alias for lift
&lt;/source&gt;

===== Signal as a Haskell's Applicative instance =====
See Applicative class def.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/libraries/base/Control-Applicative.html#t:Applicative Haskell class Applicative def.]&lt;/ref&gt; From Elm's Signal library:&lt;ref name=&quot;signal-lib&quot;/&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
-- lift a Value
constant : a -&gt; Signal a

-- signal application
(~) : Signal (a -&gt; b) -&gt; Signal a -&gt; Signal b

-- sample from the second input every time an event occurs on the first input
-- like Haskell's Control.Applicative.(*&gt;) sequence actions discarding the first result
sampleOn : Signal a -&gt; Signal b -&gt; Signal b

----
-- lift&lt;N&gt;: to lift a function of N value parameters (defined lift2 to lift8)
-- similar to Haskell's Control.Applicative.liftA&lt;N&gt; 
result_signal = liftN fun_N_ary signal1 signal2 ... signalN

-- equivalent with binary infix operators
result_signal = fun_N_ary &lt;~ signal1 ~ signal2 ~ ... ~ signalN
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Composable signal transformers. Automatons ===

This is used to generate signal transformers as a chain. 

Individual chain links, with type &lt;code&gt;''(Automaton input output)''&lt;/code&gt; behave like computation (side effect) functions with only one parameter. 

To chain two of them the input type of the follower must match the output result type of the precedent.

This concept is borrowed from ''[[w:Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]]'s arrows'' ([[w:Effect system|effects]] sequencing through chaining of [[w:morphism|morphisms]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;arrowized&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haskell.org/arrows/ Haskell Arrows introduction]&lt;/ref&gt;

You may apply them to a ''Signal'' with the ''Automaton.run'' library function, specifying the ''Automaton'' and a default result for the case of lack of input value.

From Elm's Automaton library:&lt;ref&gt;[http://elm-lang.org/docs/Automaton.elm Automaton library]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
-- generator from a pure mapping function
pure : (a -&gt; b) -&gt; Automaton a b

-- generators from an initial state and a function of input and state
state : b -&gt; (a -&gt; b -&gt; b) -&gt; Automaton a b   
hiddenState : s -&gt; (a -&gt; s -&gt; (s,b)) -&gt; Automaton a b

-- automaton application
run : Automaton a b -&gt; b -&gt; Signal a -&gt; Signal b

result_signal = run myAutomaton result_default input_signal


-- compose two automatons, chaining them together.
(&gt;&gt;&gt;) : Automaton a b -&gt; Automaton b c -&gt; Automaton a c

&lt;/source&gt;

=== Containers ===

See ref.&lt;ref&gt;[http://elm-lang.org/Documentation.elm Documentation]&lt;/ref&gt;
* List, Set, Dict
* Maybe (for optional parameters, and partially defined function results, as Just v or Nothing)
* Either (error aware results, as Right correct_result or Left error)

To process a list of signals as one:
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
-- combine a list of signals into a signal of their value list 
Signal.combine : [Signal a] -&gt; Signal [a]
&lt;/source&gt;

alignTest : Int -&gt; Element
alignTest commonWidth = 
   let elem1 = Elem.width commonWidth &lt;| Text.justified &lt;| styleIt unstyledText
       elem2 = Elem.width commonWidth &lt;| Text.centered &lt;| styleIt &lt;| Text.toText &quot;test2&quot; 
       elem3 = Elem.width commonWidth &lt;| Text.rightAligned &lt;| styleIt &lt;| Text.toText &quot;test3&quot;

main : Element
main = alignTest 200
&lt;/source&gt;

You may try it in the [http://elm-lang.org/try online editor/compiler/executor].

==== Polymorphism on Record types ====
See records.&lt;ref&gt;[http://elm-lang.org/learn/Syntax.elm#records Syntax - records]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;

module MyModule where

import Color

type Named a = { a | name : String }  -- records with a ''name'' field

getName : Named a -&gt; String
getName {name} = name

dude = {name=&quot;John Doe&quot;, age=20}
lady = {name=&quot;Jane Doe&quot;, eyesColor = Color.blue}

names : [String]
names = [ getName dude, getName lady]

fullData = [show dude, show lady]

staticElement : Element
staticElement = flow down &lt;| map plainText
                                 [&quot;Names: &quot; ++ show names
                                 , show fullData
                                 ]
main = staticElement 
&lt;/source&gt;
* embedding it in a ''div'' element

&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML&gt;
&lt;!-- MyModule.html --&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;&lt;meta charset=&quot;UTF-8&quot;&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;MyModule&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;!-- elm-runtime.js and js compiled modules --&gt;
  &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; 
          src=&quot;/your-install-directory/cabal-dev/share/Elm-N.N.N.N/elm-runtime.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;MyModule.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
  &lt;div id=&quot;myId&quot; style=&quot;width:100;height:100;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- Elm container must be a &quot;div&quot; element and must be empty --&gt;
  &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;

var myContainer = document.getElementById('myId') ; 

Elm.embed(Elm.MyModule, myContainer) ;
  &lt;/script&gt;

&lt;/source&gt;

==== Parameterizing an Elm script ====

The ''port'' FFI (Foreign function interface with [[w:JavaScript|JavaScript]]) feature&lt;ref&gt;[http://elm-lang.org/learn/Syntax.elm#javascript-ffi JavaScript FFI]&lt;/ref&gt; gives the oportunity to supply parameters at the [[w:html|html]] level.
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
module ElmMain where

port arg1 : String
port arg2 : Int
port arg3 : [String]

implode : [String] -&gt; String
implode = concat . intersperse &quot;, &quot;

main = asText &lt;| implode [arg1, show arg2, implode arg3]
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;&lt;meta charset=&quot;UTF-8&quot;&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;Title&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;!-- elm-runtime.js and js compiled modules 
      (if compiled with --make the ElmMain.js contains also the possibly imported user modules) --&gt;

  &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; 
          src=&quot;/your-install-directory/cabal-dev/share/Elm-N.N.N.N/elm-runtime.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;ElmMain.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
  &lt;div id=&quot;myId&quot; style=&quot;width:100;height:100;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- Elm container must be a &quot;div&quot; element and must be empty --&gt;
  &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;

var myPorts = {arg1: &quot;do re mi&quot;,   // after &quot;The Jackson five&quot; &quot;abc&quot; lyrics
               arg2: 123,
               arg3: [&quot;abc&quot;, &quot;you and me&quot;]  
               } ;

var myContainer = document.getElementById('myId') ; 

Elm.embed(Elm.ElmMain, myContainer, myPorts) ;
  &lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;noscript&gt;Javascript is not enabled&lt;/noscript&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Signals (varying) examples ===
* ''lift'': is like [[w:Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]]'s ''fmap'' for Signals
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
lift : (a -&gt; b) -&gt; Signal a -&gt; Signal b
&lt;/source&gt;
* ''lift&amp;lt;N&amp;gt;'' : applies a function of N values to N Signals; it acts like [[w:Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]]'s Applicative ''liftA&amp;lt;N&amp;gt;''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Applicative_functor Haskellwiki - Applicative functor]&lt;/ref&gt;
* (&lt;~) and (~) are Elm replacements for Haskell's infix Applicative operators (&amp;lt;$&amp;gt;) and (&amp;lt;*&amp;gt;).&lt;ref&gt;[http://elm-lang.org/blog/announce/0.7.elm#do-you-even-lift Elm v.0.7 release notes] Section: &quot;Do you even lift?&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Password double field retype checker ====

Note, as of Elm 0.10 Strings are no longer lists of characters, so the above becomes something more like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;

import Graphics.Element as Elem
import String as S

-- button color modifier (pointfree)
passwdOkColour : String -&gt; String -&gt; Element -&gt; Element
passwdOkColour passwd1 passwd2 = 
    if S.length passwd1 &gt;= 6 &amp;&amp; passwd1 == passwd2
    then Elem.color green 
    else Elem.color red
 
display field1Elem field2Elem submitButtonElem =
    field1Elem `above` field2Elem `above` submitButtonElem
 
prependLabel = beside . plainText

dynamicElement : Signal Element
dynamicElement = 
    let (field1ElemSignal, fld1StateSignal) = Input.password &quot;Type password (min. 6 characters)!&quot;
        labeledField1Signal = lift (prependLabel &quot;passwd: &quot;) field1ElemSignal
        (field2ElemSignal, fld2StateSignal) = Input.password &quot;Retype password!&quot;
        labeledField2Signal = lift (prependLabel &quot;control: &quot;) field2ElemSignal
        (submitButton, _) = Input.button &quot;Submit&quot;
        coloredButSignal = constant submitButton 
                         |&gt; lift3 passwdOkColour fld1StateSignal fld2StateSignal 
    in lift3 display labeledField1Signal labeledField2Signal coloredButSignal
 
main = dynamicElement
&lt;/source&gt;

== Tip ==

Hi Aldnonymous, as seen above, you have gotten the reviewer rights. Here's a handy tip: Use the rollback feature for vandalism and &quot;reject changes&quot; for good faith edits that did not fit in the page properly or appropriately. --[[User:Goldenburg111|goldenburg111]] ([[User talk:Goldenburg111|talk]]) 13:39, 31 March 2014 (UTC)
:Well you know I like Undo rather than rollback I love adding advice on edit summary to let them know whattowhat and how to do something, thanks for the advice :D--[[User:Aldnonymous|Aldnonymous]] ([[User talk:Aldnonymous|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Aldnonymous|contribs]]) 13:44, 31 March 2014 (UTC)
::You can also do that with the &quot;reject changes&quot; :-) --[[User:Goldenburg111|goldenburg111]] ([[User talk:Goldenburg111|talk]]) 13:50, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

== Please undo page move to [[ Algebra/Factoring polynomials]] ==

I moved this page, not noticing that I had followed a link from Wikiversity, and thus thinking that I was there, where this move would have been SOP. I would create [[Template:Move undo]] as I am doing on Wikiversity, to request uncontroversial undo of a move, and avoid the need for a request here. But I can't find out how to create a Template here. The process I'm accustomed to (Search for the template name and then follow the create page link) doesn't work here as it does elsewhere I'm accustomed to. Thanks. --[[User:Abd|Abd]] ([[User talk:Abd|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Abd|contribs]]) 15:10, 1 February 2014 (UTC)

== Grsecurity - Rename or delete old page ==

The Grsecurity book has two appendix pages, [[Grsecurity/Appendix/Sysctl_Options|Sysctl Options]] (old, out-of-date) and [[Grsecurity/Appendix/Sysctl_Options_v2|Sysctl Options v2]] (new and up-to-date). I would like to get rid of the older Sysctl Options page and keep Sysctl Options v2. Also, if possible, I would prefer that the URL for Sysctl_Options_v2 was changed to Sysctl_Options. My understanding is that only an admin can do these changes. What procecure should I follow here?

      <text xml:space="preserve">How to Multiply Matrices

A Matrix is an array of numbers:

A Matrix 
A Matrix
(This one has 2 Rows and 3 Columns)

To multiply a matrix by a single number is easy:

Matrix Multiply Constant

These are the calculations:
2×4=8	2×0=0
2×1=2	2×-9=-18
We call the number (&quot;2&quot; in this case) a scalar, so this is called &quot;scalar multiplication&quot;.

Multiplying a Matrix by Another Matrix
But to multiply a matrix by another matrix you need to do the &quot;dot product&quot; of rows and columns ... what does that mean? Let me show you with an example:

To work out the answer for the 1st row and 1st column:

Matrix Multiply

The &quot;Dot Product&quot; is where you multiply matching members, then sum up:

(1, 2, 3) • (7, 9, 11) = 1×7 + 2×9 + 3×11 = 58

We match the 1st members (1 and 7), multiply them, likewise for the 2nd members (2 and 9) and the 3rd members (3 and 11), and finally sum them up.

Want to see another example? Here it is for the 1st row and 2nd column:

Matrix Multiply

(1, 2, 3) • (8, 10, 12) = 1×8 + 2×10 + 3×12 = 64

We can do the same thing for the 2nd row and 1st column:

(4, 5, 6) • (7, 9, 11) = 4×7 + 5×9 + 6×11 = 139

And for the 2nd row and 2nd column:

(4, 5, 6) • (8, 10, 12) = 4×8 + 5×10 + 6×12 = 154

And we get:

Matrix Multiply

DONE!

Why Do It This Way?
This may seem an odd and complicated way of multiplying, but it is necessary!

I can give you a real-life example to illustrate why we multiply matrices in this way.

Example: The local shop sells 3 types of pies.
Beef pies cost $3 each
Chicken pies cost $4 each
Vegetable pies cost $2 each
And this is how many they sold in 4 days:
Matrix Multiply Constant
Now think about this ... the value of sales for Monday is calculated this way:
Beef pie value + Chicken pie value + Vegetable pie value
$3×13 + $4×8 + $2×6 = $83
So it is, in fact, the &quot;dot product&quot; of prices and how many were sold:
($3, $4, $2) • (13, 8, 6) = $3×13 + $4×8 + $2×6 = $83
We match the price to how many sold, multiply each, then sum the result.
 
In other words:
The sales for Monday were: Beef pies: $3×13=$39, Chicken pies: $4×8=$32, and Vegetable pies: $2×6=$12. Together that is $39 + $32 + $12 = $83
And for Tueday: $3×9 + $4×7 + $2×4 = $63
And for Wednesday: $3×7 + $4×4 + $2×0 = $37
And for Thursday: $3×15 + $4×6 + $2×3 = $75
So it is important to match each price to each quantity.
 
Now you know why we use the &quot;dot product&quot;.
 
And here is the full result in Matrix form:
Matrix Multiply
They sold $83 worth of pies on Monday, $63 on Tuesday, etc.
(You can put those values into the Matrix Calculator to see if they work.)
Rows and Columns
To show how many rows and columns a matrix has we often write rows×columns.

Example: This matrix is 2×3 (2 rows by 3 columns):
A Matrix
When we do multiplication:

The number of columns of the 1st matrix must equal the number of rows of the 2nd matrix.
And the result will have the same number of rows as the 1st matrix, and the same number of columns as the 2nd matrix.
Example:
Matrix Multiply
In that example we multiplied a 1×3 matrix by a 3×4 matrix (note the 3s are the same), and the result was a 1×4 matrix.
In General:

To multiply an m×n matrix by an n×p matrix, the ns must be the same, 
and the result is an m×p matrix.



Order of Multiplication
In arithmetic we are used to:

3 × 5 = 5 × 3
(The Commutative Law of Multiplication)

But this is not generally true for matrices (matrix multiplication is not commutative):

AB ≠ BA

When you change the order of multiplication, the answer is (usually) different.

Example:
See how changing the order affects this multiplication:
Matrix Multiply Order
Identity Matrix
The &quot;Identity Matrix&quot; is the matrix equivalent of the number &quot;1&quot;:

Identity Matrix
A 3x3 Identity Matrix
It is &quot;square&quot; (has same number of rows as columns),
It has 1s on the diagonal and 0s everywhere else.
It's symbol is the capital letter I.
It is a special matrix, because when you multiply by it, the original is unchanged:

A × I = A

I × A = A</text>

A Wikibooks user has queries the above book which you recently created.  It is thought that the page does not appear to be a book or part of a book.  I would suggest making the page more book-like with sub-pages, table of contents, etc.  If you feel that the page should actually be part of a different book then please let me know and we can move it to a more appropriate place.--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Estonia.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 14:45, 23 February 2014 (UTC)

Also, consult Pete Egoscue's &quot;Pain Free: A Revolutionary Method for Stopping Chronic Pain&quot;. You can also receive expert advice from Postural Restoration Therapists and Posture Alignment Specialists (PAS). See university.com and postural restoration.com</text>

::Hi Goldenburg111, per [[m:User:COIBot/XWiki/lelandstanfordjunior.com]] they are adding the link to many articles, which is kind of link spam. I find very little information on the website, if the wiki books community agrees to keep the link, i have no problem.--[[User:Shanmugamp7|Shanmugamp7]] ([[User talk:Shanmugamp7|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Shanmugamp7|contribs]]) 18:11, 23 February 2014 (UTC)

HAVE YOU LOOKED AT THE WEBSITE?  
What do you mean by &quot;very little information on the website&quot;? 

What I have an issue with is, there are at least 5 other links in the book that purport to do the exact same thing as this link:  provide etch rates for users, free of charge.  
Some of the other links (eg: virginia semiconductor) is a company with something to sell. I personally don't care, but the information provided is quite similar (though not a duplicate), and agruably commercial. 
Other links go to pages with tables, or academic papers, all providing the same kind of information-  Etch rates.  

If I am a user of the book, the first thing I want to know is a little background on the etch that I need to perform, which is provided in the book.  The next thing I need is a way to determine the etch rate.  This pretty fundamental, if you've ever worked in a fabrication facility.  That information is missing, mostly.  I believe that the links provided, most of them, are useful in some way.  But there is no explanation of how the edit I made is any different than the other ones already present.  I also fail to see how it is not useful.  If you actually went to the site, you'd click another link to see a whole page of background on KOH etching, which extends the discussion present in the book.  I don't think it would be appropriate, from a detail level, to include all of that in the book (?), but it seems useful as an externally linked extension of the book.  

As a side note, it is very, very discouraging to try to contribute something useful, and have to deal with this process.  Don't get me wrong, I very much value the work that some people do to sanitize the real &quot;spam&quot; that gets posted, and I have seen it.  That is extremely valued and appreciated.  But splitting hairs like this only drives people away from making contributions.  If you don't like it, try IMPROVING it first, rather than just clicking &quot;undo&quot;.

BTW, &quot;many links&quot;, as you state, is exactly TWO to this external  page, one from this book and one from a general etching page that is related.  And there were two more to another differnt page on the same site, again linked from closely related pages that have been suggested to merge.  Is that considered excessive?  Especially when they are quite relevant?

== Please don't just blindly accept changes ==

You recently approved an edit to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters]] that was, in fact, vandalism. Someone, or to be precise, two someones, were replacing names of book characters with their own names, and a third created himself as a character. You then approved those edits.

It's not enough that an edit be grammatically correct. If a link to a character is altered to call out a different character, or an entirely new link is added, it is quite possible that someone is playing silly buggers, and that should not be approved. Thank you. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 21:42, 16 April 2014 (UTC)

I believe the title &quot;System Identification&quot; of this chapter might be a bit misleading. I came here looking for tools for system parameter identification, but this is just an intro to systems, more like &quot;Systems 101&quot;. Shouldn't this be changed?

== Usability, and reliability ==

I have noticed more often that there are many book that are not completed that are useful to many people.  I wait and think for a few weeks that there will be a user that would complete the book ,but no one completes it and even if there is a change it would be a addition of just a single sentence which is useless.  For this reason I suggest that wikibooks administrators and Wikibook moderators should be involved in the completion of the books since they are the ones who mostly keep this site running.

: Contributing to a book requires understanding of its subject.  Contributing to an ''existing'' book also requires understanding of the book.  Writing a book is actually quite a difficult task; I'm involved, for instance, with the [[Conlang]] book, which was started almost ten years ago and I have been contributing to for about six, and we're still working, slowly and carefully, on how it should be organized.  In the longish term I hope to build interactive tools to help people with the specialized tasks of writing particular books, but that's still a ways off.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 01:14, 2 February 2014 (UTC)
:And most people who come here are either a school class project working for a fixed period - and then the book is abandoned, or they want to write their own book and lose steam. There's no chance of the handful of administrators completing all the books here. In any case, there's no need to be an admin to contribute to a book.

== [[:Category:Books with print version]] dynamicity ==

Currently it's quite fastidious to create a book printable version page, and even more to maintain it when its pages change. That's why I propose to reduce this time to one minute by using the [[Template:printable]] which uses [[Module:Printable version]], to get the full book in real time without any effort.

Actually something similar is already used [//pt.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Internet/Imprimir&amp;action=edit in the Portuguese version], and I've also proposed my short module [//fr.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Programmation_XML/Version_imprimable&amp;action=edit to the French one] today. 

The difference between these two sites and here is that over there each table of contents is on its book subpage (eg: [[:fr:MySQL/Sommaire]]), in absolute paths ([//en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Git&amp;action=edit&amp;oldid=2565249 not relative like here]), and called from the main page, and the printable version, and eventually a [[:fr:MySQL/Introduction|navigation bar on the right]].

== Travel Guides ==

Greetings from [[:voy:|Wikivoyage]]!

I was just having a quick look through Wikibooks' catalogue when I noticed that you have a number of [[Travel_Guides_bookshelf#Travel_guides|travel guides]] and [[:Category:Tourism|tourism topics]] on your shelves; most of which haven't been altered for a little while.

I wondered how you'd feel about merging at least some of these into Wikivoyage - many have direct analogues, whilst others could form starting points for new guides.

Of course, I fully understand if you'd rather these topics remained on Wikibooks - I'm certainly not advocating some sort of Wiki-imperialism, it would just be nice to see them as part of a larger guide where they're more likely to be updated.

Either way, it would be nice to hear from you. Please feel free to call in over on [[:voy:|WV]] and say 'hello'! :)

: Well hi there.

: The page you want is [[Subject:Tourism]]; we use subject pages instead of bookshelves, nowadays.

: I'm not too familiar with your format over at Wikivoyage.  I might have guessed (but wouldn't have bet anything on) that the Wikivoyage format would be different from a full book; but even if that were true, not everything we have here ''is'' a full book, as lots of it is in a fairly early stage of development.

: The procedure to propose moving the content of a book altogether to another sister would, I would think, be a transwiki proposal at [[WB:RFD]].  Naturally, material can be imported from one project to another using Special:Import even if it's to be left intact on the original project; we often import stuff from Wikipedia to here.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 04:55, 5 February 2014 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Physical Description ===
Tolkien had changed the specifics overtime, but '''Balrogs''' retained many notable characteristics. They are large, muscular humanoids, with black bodies and usually flames coming from bodily parts (Mostly the head). No mention of clothes or armor is mentioned with the Balrogs, but they are noted to wield a variety of weapons, including flaming swords, flaming whips with many thongs, and blackened maces and axes.

Other interpretations are based on comments Tolkien had made throughout his texts, with Durin's Bane considered &quot;a thing of slime&quot; after being quenched in the waters below Moria. The biggest discussion is on whether or not Balrogs had wings (Or were capable of flight.), as Tolkien had used both metaphor and description to describe the wings of Balrogs, and alternating on the same page: 

 &quot;His enemy halted again, facing him, and the shadow about it reached out like two vast wings.&quot; 
—The Lord of the Rings, II:5, &quot;The Bridge of Khazad-dûm&quot; 

and 

 &quot;...suddenly it drew itself up to a great height, and its wings were spread from wall to wall...&quot; 
—Ibid. 

Like most discussions, the image is mostly up to interpretation of the readers, and either description appears to be correct as the other. Without Tolkien himself to mediate, it is possible that the discussion will continue as long as Tolkien has readers. Visual interpretations tend to follow the Winged argument, and present Balrogs with wings, though often unusable for flight.

=== Notable Balrogs ===
Across Tolkien's ''Legendarium'', there are very few Balrogs of note, and only one was named. (May contain spoilers)

==== Gothmog ====
Gothmog was mentioned in the ''Quenta Silmarillion'', and took part in some of the battles that took place, primarily the Second (Dagor-nuin-Giliath) and Fifth (Nírnaeth Arnoediad) battles. ''Gothmog'' itself is Sindarin for &quot;Dread Oppressor&quot;

==== Durin's Bane ====
During the Third Age, the dwarves in Khazad-Dum had delved to deep in their search for Mithril, and awoke the sleeping Balrog below. Known only by titles given to it by others, such as &quot;Nameless Terror&quot;, &quot;Flame of Udun&quot; and &quot;Durin's Bane&quot;, the Balrog had killed many in Khazad-dum, including Durin VI and giving him the name &quot;Durin's Bane&quot; when he awoke. He was finally finished after a fight with Gandalf beginning at the Bridge of Khazad-dum and ending atop a peak inside Durin's Tower.

== Defining growth and development ==
Development is a multidimensional qualitative concept that refers to an improvement in living standards in an economy encompassing material consumption, education and health, as well as environmental concerns. Development involves poverty reduction, increased employment opportunities for the individual and a more equitable distrubution of income.

Development focuses attention on the individual and on the three dimension of well-being, which are:

* '''&lt;u&gt;health&lt;/u&gt;''': the ability to live a long and healthy life,
* '''&lt;u&gt;education&lt;/u&gt;''': the ability to read, write, and acquire knowledge, and
* '''&lt;u&gt;income&lt;/u&gt;''': command over the income needed for a decent life.

The term sustainable development focuses attention on intergenerational equity along with environmental, social, and economic issues. A widely accepted definition is: &quot;development which meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability for future generations to meet their own needs.&quot; A development process is typically considered unsustainable when insufficient attention is paid to the environmenetal consequences as well as to the resulting changes in the distribution of income. Ignoring these dimensions threatens to reverse any progress made.

Economic growth, on the other hand, is a purely quantitive concept. Growth refers to increases in the real GDP (total output) of an economy through time. Growth and development are related by at the same time very different. Growth does not necessarily imply development. A country may grow without any development objective being achieved. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) has described four types of growth to avoid, defined as:

* jobless, where employmenet opportunities for the poor do not expand,
* ruthless, where income inequality widens,
* futureless, where natural resources are wasted and the impact of the environment is neglected, and
* voiceless, where individual empowerment lags behind.

On the other hand, development typically necessitates growth. Even though some limited improvement in living standards may be achieved without any growth taking place, long-term progress on the development front requires that developing countries grow.

== Sources of long-term growth ==
A useful way of remembering the sources of growth is to realise that output may grow if all of the following conditions apply:

* the amount of available resources increase, 
* the quality of available resources increase, 
* the available technology improves, and
* the framework within which economic activity takes place (referred to as the instutional framework) improves.

Growth may take place as a result of the following factors:

* More or improved natural resources (land) becomes available. This usually implies either the discovery of new mineral or oil deposits or the improvement of existing land. Irrigation, fertilisation and improved land management may all improve the quality of existing land and contribute to growth. An increase in the natural capital may lead to growth. Remember, though, that many poor countries rich in natural resources have grown spectacularly while several rich countries with abundant natural resources have miserably failed to grow.
* There is investment in physical capital. New factories, machinery and equipment increase the physical stock of capital. As a result, labour productivity (defined as output per worker) increases. Also, increased public investments in infrastructure such as roads, ports, communications, power supplies, water, and sanitation facilitate and also lower the cost of economic activity.
* The labour force growth. A larger labour force means more manpower while a larger population increases the demand side of doemstic markeys. However, a larger labour force may not be able to find productive employment. In addition, short-term growth may result frm better utilisation of existing idle human (and other) resources.
* Investment in human resources can be exert a most powerful effect on growth as it has a direct positive effect on labour productivity. Improving health services and increasing the stock of human capital, defined as the experience, skills, and education embodied in the labour force of a country, are considered the best policy choices to achieve growth and development.
* Technological progress is a very influential determinant of growth. If labour is the relatively abundant resource then labour-saving technologies where high output levels are achieved with the same quantity of labour are considered 'inappropriate' as this leads to the UNDP's category of jobless growth. Employing the 'appropriate' technology (which relies on the relatively abundant factor) to accelrate the growth and development process is a highly complex issue, especially if environmental considerations are included.
* AN institutional framework conducive of growth and development is devised. The instiutional framework of a country refers to the set of rules and laws, norms, and conventions within which economic activity is conducted. There is no unique set of institutions that singularly promotes growth. However, some instiutions have worked better than others. Attempts to transplate a template of westernised institutions into developing countries may nit prove fruitful.

== Charactersitics of developing countries ==
Developing countries in our world are many and diverse. Their initial conditions, geography, climate, history, political systems, institutions and available resources vary significantlky. This means that the list of characteristics that follows does not apply to all developing countries, or to the same extent for them all. It is very dangerous to generalise as there are huge differences in these characterstics between developing countries and within each one.

=== Per capital real income levels ===
Extremely low per capita real income levels characterise many developing countries. Low per capita real income levels result in low saving and so low investments. Low invesments in natural, human and physical capital lead to low productivity gains and so low incomes, creating a vicious circle of poverty that extends across generations and which may require some kind of intervention.

The degree of income inequality is generally greater in developing than in developed economies. Income distrubtion is often highly unewual, with the top quintile (20%) of people often receiving 10 to 50 times more than the bottom 40%.

The percentage of people in absolute poverty, defined as the specific minimum income needed to satisfy the basic physical needs to assure 'continued survival,' is also high in developing countries. Interestingly enough, there is recent reserach showing that often an increase in income will not lead to more food purchased. These may be households at or even below poverty line who will instead choose to spend any extra income earned on a television or a cell phone.

In addition, as a result of very low per capital income levels, larger segments of the popuilation suffer frm ill health, malnutrition and debilitation diseases and infant mortality rates are also very high. Remember that there are significant variations both between and within developing countries.

=== Population growth and/or size ===
Many developing economies are still characterised by high population growth rates or, if the population growth rates are not very high, the size of their population may be very high. This may be the result of high birth rates (fertility) coupled with a reduction in death rates (mortality) because of improved health conditions. A major implication of high birth rates is that children under the age of 15 often make up almost one half of the total population. This means that the active labour force has to support almost twice as many children as it typically does in richer countries. In some developing countries a large proportion of the population is attracted to cities (urban centres) where most economic activity takes place in the informal sector (that is, where it is neither officially referested nor regulated).

=== Unemployment and underemployment ===
High unemployment is a common freature of most developing countries. Unemployment, especially in urban areas, may affect 10-20% of the labour force. On the other hand, the underemployed include those working less than they would like to as well as those who have near zero contribution to total output. In rural areas unemployment suffers from large seasonal variations. Unemployment is a much more complex problem in developing countries and the necessary policiy approahces go beyond traditional demand-side or pro-market supply-side prescriptions.

=== Dependence on the primary sector ===
Agriculture in developing countries contributes around 30% of GDP compared to less than 2% in high-income countries. AS per capital income levels rise the structure of demand changes, leading first to a rise in manufacturing and then to a rise in services. The share of services in high-income countries is around 70% of GDP. Of course, there are variations in the sturcture of output within each income group.

=== Dependence on exports of primary commodities ===
Since a significant proportion of output in low-income countries originates frm the primary sector, primary commodities often also form the basis of their exports to other nations. Some countries may even depend on exporting a single non-oil primary commodity.

== The Mellennium Development Goals ==
In 2000, world leaders promised to improve living standards in developing world by achieving eight UN Millennium Development Goals (MGDs) by 2015. These goals encompass education, health, gender and the nevironment and are stated as follows:

* eradicate extreme poverty and huger,
* achieve universal primary education,
* promote gender equality and empower women,
* reduce child mortiality,
* improve meternal heath,
* combat HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other disease,
* ensure environmental sutainability, and 
* develop a global partnership for development.

Progress has been made on several issues but for very many countries and regions these goals remain out of reach. The best way to monitor up-to-date progress on each of these goals is to visit the [http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/reports.shtml MGD website]. The World Development Report also includes useful information on the MDGs.

Bear in mind that one important drawback of these goals is that they overlook inequality and process freedoms. In addition, according to the World Bank, climate change and conflict may compromise the efforts to improve standards of living and to achieve these goals.</text>

This command does not work on PostGreSQL.

You will either need to provide Movies.Code (PK value) as 9 or in table definition set the column Movies.Code as SERIAL.
This will auto increment the Code column every time any record is added.

This will also mean that you need not provide the code values when entering sample data set for Movies table.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Potopt is [[w:Molecular dynamics|molecular dynamics]] software implemented in [[w:C11 (C standard revision)|ISO C11]] and utilizing [[w:Message Passing Interface|MPI]] for parallel processing.

This manual documents a pre-release version of the software, made available at 2014-02-26.  The details of both the implementation and user interface are still not settled, and are likely to change significantly before the first release.

== Synopsis ==

 $ perl yaml2pob.perl \
       &amp;lt; &lt;var&gt;Initial-state.yaml&lt;/var&gt; &amp;gt; &lt;var&gt;Initial-state.pob&lt;/var&gt; 
 $ mpirun -n &lt;var&gt;N&lt;/var&gt; \
       potopt &lt;var&gt;Split&lt;/var&gt; [&lt;var&gt;Iterations&lt;/var&gt; [&lt;var&gt;Step&lt;/var&gt; [&lt;var&gt;Tau2&lt;/var&gt;]]] \
       &amp;lt; &lt;var&gt;Initial-state.pob&lt;/var&gt; &amp;gt; &lt;var&gt;Output.log&lt;/var&gt; 2&amp;gt;&amp;amp;1 

== Summary ==

Potopt is an ISO C11- and MPI-based (tested with GCC 4.8.2 and Open MPI 1.6.5, respectively) code that solves equations of motion for a system of (dimensionless) particles with user-specified masses, initial locations and velocities.  The equations are based on the [[w:Morse potential|Morse potential]], with parameters specified for each interacting pair of particles (which may mean the ones sharing a chemical bond, or otherwise related.)

The &lt;kbd&gt;-n &lt;var&gt;N&lt;/var&gt;&lt;/kbd&gt; parameter given to &lt;cite&gt;mpirun(1)&lt;/cite&gt; specifies the number of processes to run.  Refer to the documentation on the MPI implementation used for more information.

The &lt;var&gt;Split&lt;/var&gt; argument is currently mandatory and is a whitespace-delimited string of positive integer values specifying the number of particles to simulate with each process.  Naturally, these numbers should sum up to a total number of particles in the system considered, such as &lt;kbd&gt;22&lt;/kbd&gt; for modelling the 22-atom [[w:Graphene|graphene]] sample system [[#Availability|below]] within a single process (&lt;kbd&gt;-n 1&lt;/kbd&gt;), &lt;kbd&gt;'11 11'&lt;/kbd&gt; for two processes (&lt;kbd&gt;-n 2&lt;/kbd&gt;), &lt;kbd&gt;'7 8 7'&lt;/kbd&gt; for three (&lt;kbd&gt;-n 3&lt;/kbd&gt;), etc.

&lt;var&gt;Iterations&lt;/var&gt; is the number of iterations to do, and defaults to 64.  A value of 65536 or greater may be more practical.

&lt;var&gt;Step&lt;/var&gt; is the initial time step, in seconds, and defaults to &lt;code&gt;1e-18&lt;/code&gt; (or 1 [[w:Attosecond|as]]), although the values of around &lt;code&gt;2e-19&lt;/code&gt; may be a more suitable choice.  Nevertheless, the software will continuously try to find an optimal time step, based on the constraints set within &lt;code&gt;main_loop ()&lt;/code&gt; (check the &lt;var&gt;redo_p&lt;/var&gt; local variable there.)

&lt;var&gt;Tau2&lt;/var&gt; is the characteristic time the system should lose half of its kinetic energy, and defaults to &lt;code&gt;4e-18&lt;/code&gt; (or 4 as.)

== YAML-based input format ==

The simulation code requires a stream in an ad-hoc (and possibly platform-dependent) binary encoding, which is produced from a [[w:YAML|YAML]] stream with a helper &lt;code&gt;yaml2pob.perl&lt;/code&gt; Perl script.

The input YAML stream may look as follows (for a single six-membered [[w:Aromaticity|carbon ring]], ignoring the [[w:Hydrogen|hydrogen]] atoms.)

&lt;pre
&gt;---
xyz:
  - { a: 0, xyz: [ 0.0, 7.104999999999999e-11, 0 ] }
  - { a: 1, xyz: [ 1.2306220987776874e-10, 0.0, 0 ] }
  - { a: 2, xyz: [ 2.461244197555375e-10, 7.104999999999999e-11, 0 ] }
  - { a: 3, xyz: [ 0.0, 2.1315e-10, 0 ] }
  - { a: 4, xyz: [ 1.2306220987776874e-10, 2.842e-10, 0 ] }
  - { a: 5, xyz: [ 2.461244197555375e-10, 2.1315e-10, 0 ] }
bonds:
  - { a: 0, b: 1 }
  - { a: 0, b: 3 }
  - { a: 1, b: 2 }
  - { a: 2, b: 5 }
  - { a: 3, b: 4 }
  - { a: 4, b: 5 }
&lt;/pre&gt;

The &lt;code&gt;xyz&lt;/code&gt; section specifies the particles (atoms), while &lt;code&gt;bonds&lt;/code&gt; specifies the parameters to the [[w:Morse potential]] used to model [[w:Chemical bond|chemical bonds]].

The parameters are as follows.

; Particles
:* &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; – unique particle identifier (may be any string);
:* &lt;code&gt;xyz&lt;/code&gt; – particle’s initial location;
:* &lt;code&gt;v&lt;/code&gt; – ''(optional)'' particle’s initial velocity; defaults to a zero vector;
:* &lt;code&gt;m&lt;/code&gt; – ''(optional)'' particle’s mass; defaults to &lt;code&gt;1.660539e-27&lt;/code&gt;, or 1.660539 × 10⁻²⁷ g, which is a possible approximation for the mass of a single [[w:Carbon]] atom.
; Bonds
:* &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; – the identifiers of the particles sharing the bond;
:* &lt;code&gt;aa&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;r&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;D&lt;/code&gt; – ''(optional)'' Morse potential parameters; default to &lt;code&gt;2.625e10&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;1.421e-10&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;6.03105e-19&lt;/code&gt;, respectively, which are possible values for the C─C [[w:Single bond|single bond]].&lt;ref name=&quot;multiscale graphene&quot; /&gt;

''Please note'' that apart from the representation conversion, the Perl helper described will ''slightly alter'' both the initial locations and velocities of the particles, as per the &lt;var&gt;$perturb&lt;/var&gt; and &lt;var&gt;$pert_v&lt;/var&gt; variables (specifying the [[w:Standard deviation|standard deviations]] for the respective changes) within the code.  This is intended as both a testing measure ''and'' a possible way to push the system off a local minimum, should the initial state correspond to one.

== The output ==

The resulting system state is sent to [[w:Standard streams#Standard output (stdout)|stdout]], formatted as whitespace-separated values.  The values are ''mass'', ''location'' (3 values), and ''velocity'' (3 values.)

== Building ==

The Potopt executable can be built with a [[w:GNU Compiler Collection|GNU C compiler]], being run under [[w:Make (software)#Modern versions|GNU Make]] as follows.  (No Makefile required.)

 $ cp -- ns8xrqxiojtkiin4drpx4ne19y.c potopt.c 
 $ LC_ALL=C make CC=mpicc CFLAGS='-g -O2 -Wall -std=gnu11' \
       LDFLAGS=-lm   potopt 

Alternatively, the following simplistic &lt;code&gt;GNUmakefile&lt;/code&gt; file can be used, with the GNU Make invocation becoming &lt;code&gt;$ LC_ALL=C make potopt&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;source lang=&quot;make&quot;&gt;
VPATH   = $(srcdir)
CC      = mpicc
CFLAGS  = -g -O2 -Wall -std=gnu11
LDFLAGS = -lm

all: potopt
&lt;/source&gt;

== Bugs ==

The &lt;var&gt;Split&lt;/var&gt; argument should be made optional.

The simulation code reads a binary file in an ad-hoc, and possibly platform-dependent, encoding.  Using encodings specified in [[w:X.690|X.690]] (DER or BER), or perhaps [[w:NetCDF|NetCDF]], may be a better choice.

Worse still, while the simulation code reads the initial system state from a binary file (which, in turn, could be created from a [[w:YAML|YAML]]-based text stream), the resulting state is saved instead in a [[w:AWK|Awk-]] and [[w:Gnuplot|Gnuplot]]-friendly whitespace-separated values form, which requires a separate program (not hereby provided) to convert it into something suitable to continue the simulation.

Some details are reported to [[w:Standard streams#Standard error (stderr)|stderr]] on each iteration in a somewhat verbose and not readily parsable (with, say, Awk or Gnuplot) text format.  For tens of thousands of iterations, the size of the resulting stream may end up being tens of [[w:Mebibyte|mebibytes]].

There’s no proper error reporting.  The code instead relies on a bunch of &lt;code&gt;assert ()&lt;/code&gt; macro invocations.

There’s no proper command line interface, either.

Check also the &lt;code&gt;FIXME:&lt;/code&gt; comments within the code.

&lt;small&gt;''In Syria now, it is a time of division, violence and suffering. When we were there in November 2010 and in August 2011, we recorded many stories of cooperation and development.
''Nowadays, only sad and violent stories are narrated about this wonderful country. What then shall we do with these stories we collected in Syria in what now seems to be a different &quot;age&quot; altogether?''
''Well, we decided to re-edit the videos we had made, include them in the [[Development Cooperation Handbook|Handbook]] we are developing and share them through the Internet. These videos will help us remember what Syria was before the civil war. And we hope that these stories will help restore trust amongst communities in Syria, and build, amongst those who love this country, the motivation to do whatever they can to restore peace and cooperation.''&lt;br /&gt;

Mahmoud Abul-Huda Alhussainy is an Syran Doctor and and a sufi scholar &lt;br /&gt;
The interview was taken on August 2011 in Aleppo, Syria&lt;br /&gt;
We were introduced to him by [[Development Cooperation Handbook/Interviews/Paolo Dall'Oglio|Paolo Dall'Oglio]] who translated in Italian his interview&lt;br /&gt;


The NGOs that deal with
organizing the prayer
the study of Islamic sciences
generally are &quot;official&quot; NGOs

These &quot;official organizations are like cages
that enclose the persons
in roles and activities
that have specific delimitation

instead the action space for the &quot;non official&quot; NGOs
is much wider and tend towards universality


[[File:Mahmoud Abul-Huda Alhussainy - Spiritualita e armoniosita sociale.webm|thumb|left|Mahmoud Abul-Huda Alhussainy - Spiritualita e armoniosita sociale]]  [[File:Mahmoud Abul-Huda Alhussainy - Spirituality and sociality.webm|thumb|Mahmoud Abul-Huda Alhussainy - Spirituality and sociality]]

The charity.
It is generosity,
it is altruism
it is capacity to enjoy
the pleasure of sharing my possessions with others.
Charity comes in me when the spirituality increases
and enriches me with sense of responsibility for my neighbor.

When spirituality increases in me
I become generous with those who are poor,
with those who are ill, with those who do not have enough resources to live with dignity.

[[File:Mahmoud Abul-Huda Alhussainy - A spiritual person better person in society and work.webm|thumb|Mahmoud Abul-Huda Alhussainy - A spiritual person better person in society and work]]

When spirituality increases
the society becomes more harmonious,
more just,
more beautiful.

When spirituality diminishes
conflicts increase.

Such a stand of solidarity with others
is totally independent to any allegiance to any specific religion.

When my spirituality is solid, is well rooted in me
it expresses itself as solidarity to others
independently to their ethnic or religious identities.

It is very painful to take notice to the fact
that some organizations like
Al Qaida , that have
a violent approach to religion
are well organized international.
while the organizations
that are building what we really need
that promote peace and spiritual
are much less funded
and do not receive international attention

[[File:Mahmoud Abul-Huda Alhussainy media serves political-economic interestd.webm|thumb|Mahmoud Abul-Huda Alhussainy media serves political-economic interests]]

Unfortunately in the majority of the cases
Unfortunately in most the cases
medias are not serving peace but the economical and political interests of those who are in power

What we need to do
is an open accesses to the those media
that work for peace education.

== Per capital income figures ==
Per capita GNI or per capita GDP represent measures of per capita income. The difference between GDP and GNI is that GNI excludes incomes earned domestically by foreign factors (which are paid abroad, for example the profits of multinational corporations) but it includes incomes earned abroad by nationals of the country. Per capita income figures are computed by dividing GNI or GDP of a country by the mid-year total population of the country. Usually, per capita income figures are also called PPP (purchasing power parity) dollars, sometimes referred to as 'international dollars,' which have same purchasing power over GDP as a conversion factor, and not the market exchange rate, is that cost of living may differ substantially between countries and market exchange rates do not necessarily adjust to capture these differences.

The World Bank uses per capita GNI to determine the following income classifications: low income was defined as $975 or less in 2008; middle income was $976 to $11,905; and high income was $11,906 or more. A further at GNI per capita - $3,855 - is made between lower-middle income and upper-middle income economies.

The classification is useful and may provide us with some information on the level of development of a country as there is a positive correlation between per capita income and social welfare. Few would question that Norway is more developed than Zimbabwe. But since growth in per capita income does not necessarily imply improved living standards, classification based on per capita income is also fraught with problems. Using per capita income may mask very significant differences between countries.

These are some issues to be aware of when using per capita income figures to determine the level of development of countries.

* Per capita income fails to incorporate income distribution considerations. Per capita income is just a simple average providing no information on whether income is equitably or very unequally distributed.
* Using per capita income figures does not take into account the value of the environmental degradation often associated with increased production. Te pressure on agriculture to produce more food products is responsible for soil erosion and the burning of forests. Industrialisation is also often accompanied by massive migration from rural to urban areas, leading to heavily polluted and congested cities. Emissions from industry and increased energy requirements also decrease the quality of life.
* Per capita income figures fail to include non-marketed subsistence production which may be relatively significant in some low-income countries. Non-marketed subsistence production refers to foods and other goods and services produced by a family for its own consumption. More generally, per capita income figures fail to include the size of parallel ('black' or shadow) economies in developing countries.
* Relying on per capita income also conceals useful information on the composition of output. Two economies with equal per capita income levels may differ with respect to living standards because of different output mix. A country that spends a large proportion of its GDP on, say, defence, devotes resources there that could have been used to otherwise in the production of pro-development goods. The value of leisure, a very important 'good' an individual may enjoy, is not included in the calculation of GNI or GDP. It makes a big difference to workers if the average working week is over 50 hours and they can seldom take a holiday, or if the working week is only 35 hours and everyone enjoys four weeks' paid leave every year.
* Lastly, per capita income does not include the value of the stream of services flowing from the accumulated social other capital of an economy that individuals enjoy. Living standards at any point in time are not affected just by the current income but also by the stock of accumulated wealth. For example, the existence of a high-quality and free public school system implies that households with children may devote more of their income to goods and services not related to education.

Despite these and other shortcomings, per capita income remains the best single indicator of development available but must be employed with caution in any analysis.

== Other single indicators ==
Single indicators of the level of development of a population include the following:

* Health-related indicators may be used, such as health expenditure per capita; life expectancy at birth (years); infant mortality (per 1,000 live births); mortality of children aged under fie years (per 1,000); malnutrition prevalence, weight, and /or height for age (of children under five years old); births attended by skilled health staff (% of total); maternal mortality ratio(per 100,000 live births); immunisation, DPT, and measles (% of children aged between 12 and 23 months); improved sanitation facilities (% of population with access); prevalence of HIV (% of population aged between 15 and 49 years); physicians (per 10,000 people); hospital beds (per 10,000 people).
* Education-related indicators may be taken into account, such as literacy rate (% of people aged 15 years and older); mean years of schooling (of people aged 25 years and older); expected years of schooling (years); expenditure per student, primary, secondary, and tertiary (% of GDP, per capita); pupil-teacher ratio, primary; ratio of girls to boys in primary and secondary education (%); school enrolment, primary secondary, and tertiary (%); trained teachers in primary education (% of total teachers).
* Other indicators include newspaper circulation per 1,000 population, energy consumption per capita, percentage of GDP derived from each sector of the economy and urban population.

An excellent source of current data on health, education, and other development-related indicators are the statistical tables at the end of the World Development Report published annually by the [http://www.data.worldbank.org/ World Bank].

== Composite indicators ==
No single indicator is powerful enough to illustrate satisfactorily the complex issue of development. It is therefore preferable to rely on several indicators synthesised into a single variable.

A number of composite indices have been devised. They integrate economic, social, and even political aspects of development. The most widely quoted and used composite indicator is the human development index (HDI). The HDI measures average achievements of a population in terms of health, education, and access to goods and services and was devised as a simple rival to GNP concentrating only on longevity, basic education, and minimal income. The HDI 'succeeded in challenging the hegemony of growth-centric thinking' (that is, it was successful in displacing per capita income as a summary measure of development).

The health dimension of the HDI is captured by life expectancy at birth. In 2010 the indicators used to measure progress in education have been revised and now include the mean years of schooling that a child of school entrance age could expect to receive if prevailing patterns of enrolment were to stay the same (instead of adult literacy and gross enrolment rate). Access to goods and services is measured by per capita income which in 2010 has also been revised and now refers to GNI per capita in PPP dollars, replacing GDP per capita. The reason for this change to GNI is that in a globalised world it is preferable to focus on the income of the residents of a country as this income may significantly differ from domestic production.

Major drawbacks of the HDI include:

* a reliance on national averages which conceals skewed distributions in the variables included within a population, and
* the absence of 'a quantitative measure of human freedom'

Being an average it may conceal important differences within a country. Women and rural populations as well as the very old and the very young often suffer disproportionately but this is not illustrated through the HID. In addition, environmental concerns are not addressed. It is possible for a country to have a high HDI and be 'unsustainable, undemocratic, and unequal.'

Note that three composite indicators were introduced by the UNDP in 2010 capturing multidimensional inequality (the inequality-adjusted HDI, known as the IHDI), gender disparities (the gender inequality index) and extreme deprivation (the multidimensional poverty index).

* The IHDI is a measure of human development that takes into consideration the extent of inequality in the country. Under perfect equality the HDI and the IHDI are equal. Inequality in the distribution of health, education, and income lowers the HDI on an average person in society below the aggregate HDI of the country (based on the UNDP Human Development Report, 2010).
* The gender inequality index attempts to reveal differences in the distribution of achievements between women and men in a country. Often women and girls are discriminated against in health, education, and in the labour market, which negatively affect their freedom.
* The multidimensional poverty index replaces the human poverty index. It complements money-based measures of poverty by considering 'multi deprivations and their overlap.' Low level of income is byt one dimension of the poverty experienced by people in many countries of the world − poverty extends to other dimensions such as poor health and nutrition, low education and skills, inadequate livelihoods, bad housing conditions, social exclusion and lack of participation. The multidimensional poverty index shows the number of people who are poor (suffering a given number of deprivations) and the numbe rof deprivations with which poor households typically struggle.</text>

== Education and health ==
Labour productivity is defined as output per worker, or the quantity of goods and services a worker can produce per hour of work. It critically depends on the education, skills, and training of workers as well as on the type of capital they use in the production process. Growth in productivity is the key to long-term growth which in turn is a prerequisite for development

Investments in human capital formation are necessary to achieve higher labour productivity, faster long-term growth and improved living standards. Better health and education increase labour productivity and allow individuals to have more, better, and higher-paid employment opportunities. Better education and health are also responsible for number external benefits (both are the most important examples of merit goods). Remember too that achieving better health and education are themselves development goals.

== Appropriate technology ==
Growth is necessary for any long-term progress in development but not all types of growth do lead to development. The technology employed determines whether any acceleration in growth will translate into human development gains or not.

In general, technologies can be distinguished into capital intensive or labour-intensive. Capital-intensive production process rely mostly on the use of physical capital (on machines) whereas labour-intensive production processes rely mostly on the use of labour (on workers). Remember that in many production process there is no choice: you cannot construct a labour-intensive oil refinery.

Since in most developing countries labour is the relatively abundant factor of production, it follows that appropriate technologies are labour-intensive. A labour-intensive technology translates to increased employment and income generation for the population of the country and an exit from poverty. On the other hand, capital-intensive technologies lead to what is referred to as jobless growth, which is a type of growth that does not lead to improved living standards.

== Credit and microcredit ==
The importance of credit and micro-credit institutions lies in the simple fact that typically, if you cannot borrow, you cannot make any investment in physical, natural, or human capital. It follows that a functional credit system is vital in breaking the poverty cycle explained earlier.

Credit institutions induce people to save, as they offer not only safety for whatever income people do not spend but also a rate of return. Banks allow people to borrow money that can be used to increase their human capital or to start a small business, which may enable them to break the poverty cycle. Unfortunately, a functional credit system is not enough as very often it is also the absence of well-defined property rights that prevents poor people from borrowing from commercial banks.

Microcredit, on the other hand, focuses on making available very small loans to the very poor, helping them to start a small business or expand an existing one or meet an emergency arising from disease, theft, or bad weather. The pioneer of microfinance is Bangladeshi economist Muhammad Yunus who created the Grameen Bank several decades ago. Yunus won the Nobel Peace prize for his efforts in 2006. The Nobel Committee adopted the view that reducing the gap between the rich and the poor is necessary to crease conflict in the world.

Many microfinance loans have been offered to women who have not only shows that they spend the money carefully and roductively but also that they are more likely to pay the loans back. Lending money to women has helped them in their empowerment. Their participation in such programmes gives them greater bargaining power and enables them to ttake part in family decision making whilst it also increases their mobility.

Microfinance has been considered to paly a significant but rather limited role in the development process of nations. Microcredit has lately come under attack: 

{{quote|...most borrowers do not appear to be climbing out of poverty, and a sizable minitority is getting trapped in a spiral of debt, according to studies and analysts|New York Times, 2011}}

== Women and their empowerment ==
Policies that aim at improving gender equity have been found to improve human development. Not only will deprived girls and women benefit from such policies but also the growth and development process will accelerate: 

{{quote|Human development if not engedered, is endagered.|Mahbub-ul Haq}}

There are numerous routes through which this can be accomplished. Educating girls is considered one of the most is significant investments for a developing  country as it resutls in even greater, gender-specific benefits. An educated mother will enjoy higher earning ability outside the home for each extra year of schooling. She will have fewer children so will create conditions for capital deepening (which means more capital will be available per worker), resulting in even higher long-term productivity and output gains. Her children will be healthier and she will make sure that her children are also educated, creating a virtuious circle. Educating women decreases mortality in children younger than five years old, decreasing the costs of health-care intervention.

Lasty, better and more educated women can lead to higher women's participation in the labour force as well as in politics, allowing them to influence policy.

== The distribution of income ==
High and rising income inequality is considered a major barrier to economic development. It follows that policies aiming at reducining income inequality and making growth inclusive will encourage development. Poverty reduction depends not only on income growth but also on how incoem is distributed: poverty is reduced and development is achieved if there is growth accompanied by narrowing income inequality.

A more equitable distribution of incoem will make it easier to reach a consensus among different population groups. This is a necessary  condition for a government to be willing and able to undertake successfully the required institutional and economic reforms that accelerate growth. Lower income inequality decreases the prevalance of corruption in a coutnry and corruption is considered a major obstacle to the development process as it increases the costs of doing business and it distorys efficiency. Trust between economic agents increase, also decreasing the cost and icnreasing the likelihood of doing business, another necessary condition for growth to accelerate. A more equitable distribution of income will decrease the number of the very poor so that more people will have access to education and health resources and so become more productive members of society. The probability of civil unrest will be lower, decreasing the risks for investors and leading to more domestic and foreign investment spending in the country. Lower income inequality may accelerate savigns and result in more investment and greater demand for locally produced goods and services, which may increase income and further decrease inequality.</text>

== Trade-related barriers ==
=== Barriers to primary export-led growth ===
Overspecialisation on a narrow range of primary exports cannot effectively lead to the way of economic development. Here are some of the reasons for this:

* Demand for most primary exports is income inelastic and, as a result, market for such products in high-income countries do not grow fast enoug to help accelerate growth.
{{IB/HigherLevelOnly|
* The terms of trade of countries exporting primary products will deteriorate exporting primary products will deteriorate in the long run. They wil need to export a greater colume of primary exports to be able to import one unit of manufacturing goods. However, this will only lead to a further decrease in the price of these primary products as most of these markeys are competitive. 
* Export earnings may exhibit significant year-to-year fluctuations as prices of farm products are affected by the weather and other random factors. This may mean that domestic aggregate demand becomes unstable and investment spending is more risky.
* Primary exports may be dominated by a gew multinationals and middlemen so that linages with the rest of the economy may prove inefficient.
}}
* Prices received for many primary products have decreased t hrough time. FOr example, technology and an increase in the number of coffee-producing countries have pushed down the world price for coffee.
* Agricultural exports have to face the trade protection that advanced economies (the USA, the EUropean Union, and Japan) grant their farmers in the form of subsidies. The resulting inability to access these markeys is a more general barrier developing countries face. The statement does not indiscrimantely apply to all developing countries, though, as many falsely believe. It mainly applies to the so called Cairns Group of developing countries, which includes Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, South Africa, Thailand, and Urugua which are mostly middle-income countries with a strong comparative advantage in agriculture. It follows that the main beneficiaries of liberalising trade in agriculture would be this grup of countries. The last developed countries as defined by the UN (which include all countries in SUb-Saharan Africa; Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cambodia, Lao, Maldives, and Nepal in Asia; and Haiti in Central America) will actually be hurt by this liberalisation, the main reason for this being that most of these countries are net food importers and elimination of agricultural subsidies will translate into higher food prices for them.

== Trade-related strategies for growth and development ==
=== The strategy of protection: import-substitution industrilisation (ISI) ===
In the 1950s it was thought that the problem of development was a structural problem in that developing countries relied to heavily on the primary sector and did not have a manufacturing sector. The greation of an industrial base to substitute domestically manufactured goods for imports became known as ISI. The goods targeted were non-durable manufactured goods (for example textiles) that were simple to produce and were for doemstic consumption. Trade barriers were erected to protect the newly established domestic firms. These barriers would stay in place until the firms grew sufficiently in size anad acquired the necessary know-how to lower averagecosts. Trade barriers were reduced when the firms were able to compete with importans and surive within the domestic markets.

Typically, the exchange rate was kept overvalued so that prices of necessary imported materials and intermediate products (machines and other manufactured inputs) used by the infant industries were artifically low.

Several problems are associated with an inward-oriented strategy. Since the domestic industry had its own 'captive' markey to sell its products, it never had the incentive to become efficient. The price and cost disciplines that competitive imposes on firms were totally absent. In some cases, low-quality, high-cost, and high-priced goods were produced.

The overvalued exchange rate acted as a tax on traditional primary exports as f armers earned less omestic currency for each dollar of primary exports. Poverty for large segments of the population therefore increased. In some developing countries the ISI strategy created a priviledge for élite which became more and more powerful as the industrial sector grew. In many cases, the protective trade barriers were never eliminated. In addition, the new established industries were often capital-intensive, employing inappropriate technologies which led to jobless growth as minimal employment opportunities were created. Remember that jobless growth is a type of growth to avoid as development does not follow.

=== Export promotion: outward-oriented strategies ===
In some East Asian countries, including those known as the four East Asian Tigers (Korea, Taiwan, Hong King, and Singapore), the structural change that the ISI strategy represented was follow by an attempt to export the simple, non-durable, manufactured goods these countries had been producing for their markey. These, and later other developing countries, adopted an outward orientation.

In this process, the role of the state varied among countries but, in all of them, it played a sifnificant, complementary role. It provided guidance and assistance to the private firms buy only if they achieved specific performance standards typically associated with export targets. These firms were forced to produce low-price, high-quality goods in order to continue to enjoy any state subsidies or cheaper loans from banks.

Export promotion is not sufficient to promote development and to ensure the sustainability of the process. The state in these countries invested heavily in education, slowly creating a more productive labour force with higher skills. The state also ensured that the fruits of economic growth were enjoyed by all. This meant that these countries avoided the costs associated with rising income inequality.

The first Asian country to intiate such an approach to the growth and development problem was Japan. It was followed by the four East ASian Tigers (and other countries, such as Malaysia, INdonesia, Thailand, and Vietnam, have been added to this list). China and India are the current starts of the export-or outward-oriented strategy.
==== Advantages of outward-oriented strategies ====
* Focusing initially on the production and export of simple, manufactured non-durable goods changed the structure of these economies. Employment opportunities increased for the rural migrants, asthese industries were mostly labour intensive.
* The export revenues earned alleviated problems with the balance of payments as they were used to finance the importantion of necessary intermediate and capital goods. There was less danger of the economy running into foreign exchange and foreign debt problems. Rising export revenues also increased aggregate demand (AD), so they can fuel growth in output and incomes.
* Focusing on the larger export markets forced firms to grow in size and acquire economies of scale (EOS). This is especially important for small countries.
* Firms were forced to learn more about manufacturing their products more efficiently. International competition provided the stimulus. The state also invited technical assistance from abroad but it usually limited contracts so that they lasted no more than three years, forcing domestic firms to learn the necessary technology. Operating successfully in world markets enable firms to acquire the markey, financial, managerial and, most importantly, entrpreneurial skills. Exposure to world competition allowed a local entrepreneurial class to evolve and mature.
* Through varing degrees of state guidance these economies slowly shifted their comparative advantage and production to more sophisticated and complex manufactured products and later to knowledge-based and technology-intensive products. Their economies therefore diversified and were more insulated frm industry-specific risks.

==== Possible disadvantages of outward-oriented growth ====
* Since the growth process is driven by exports, it depends on how fast the adcanced economies are growing. If their incomes are rising fast then they will be absorbing more imports which are the exports of the developing countries. A deep recession in the USA or in EUrope, though, will be costly as it will slow down the process, especially if domestic demand is weak and the government is not in a position to adopt expansionary fiscal policiy. In response to the 2008 global crisis, China was not able to adopt a huge fiscal stimulus programme, but not all countries were able to do the same.
* Outward-oriented growth must successfully overcome the barriers created by trade proteciton in developed countries.
* Outward-oriented strategies may lead to worsening income distribution as the rural sectory may be left behind. A larger share of national income will accrue to those involved in the export sector. It follows that only if there are redistributive policies in place will development ensue (using the term 'redistributive policies' in its broad sense here − that is, including spending on better health and education).
* The drive to produce cheaply for export markets may lead policy makers to ignore the costs of environmental degragation. This is very evident in China where export-driven growth is seriously damaging the natural resource base of the country and generating major environmental costs, undermining the sustainability of the country's long-term growth and development prospects.
* Achieving outward-oriented growth forces policy makers to keep the exchange rate artifically undervalued to provide an extra competitive edge to their exports, risking not only rising protectionist sentiment abroad but also inflation at home.
* Focusing on outward-oriented growth may lead policy makers to postpone the creation of a social safety net that would include state pensions and health insurance, as the growth process does not rely on te ability of the population to spend on domestic goods and services.

=== Preferential trading agreements ===
Regional integration among developing countries is often referred to as south-south integration. Originally, in the 1960s and 1970s, developing countries had attempted to create a number of preferential trading agreements as a way of reducing the cost of ISI through opening their markets to other developing countries. A block would increase the size of the potential market for each exporting firm and so it would lead to EOS. Any complementarities in production would also help reduce costs and allow specialisation. The regional agreements since the 1990s are referred to as a 'new regionalism' and are part of a broader trade liberalisation scheme where export promotion is featured as the grow and development strategy of choice.

Expamples of preferential trading agreements among developing countries include the Latin America Free Trade Association (LAFTA), formed in 1961; MERCOSUR, a customs union among Argentina, BRazil, Urugua, and Paragua formed in 1991; the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), a group of 21 nations that border the Pacific Ocean, established in 1989 and promoting freer trade and cooperation among its members; the Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS), established in 1982 and including Burundi, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, COngo, Equatorial Giunea, Gabon, Rwanda, São Tomé, and Principe; and the Economic COmmunity of West African States (ECOWAS), established in 1975, with 16 member countries.

Possible benefits of increased regional cooperation among developing countries include:

* increased trade creation as a result of the resulting expanded market,
* the possiblity of EOS that may lead to more exports outside the bloc,
* greater political and bargaining power in negotiations with developed economies, and
* a decreased level of dependence on developing countries' markets.

Here are some reasons many attempts at regional cooperation among developing countries have faile or have resulted in limited success:

* The structure of production and of trade in developing countries lacks a sufficient complementary nature. The similarity of their economies has result in more trade diversion that trade creation.
* Many attempts have encountered significan organisational and administrative problems.
* Political rivalry both between and within countries and lack of commitment have also prevented problems.
* Transaction costs are often high due to the high share of raw materials and non-duirables in these countries' mututal trade. There are high transport costs, especially since infrastructure is poor (for example, there are few roads).</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Once you've gotten past [[Japanese_Phrasebook/Greetings_and_farewell|greetings]] and other [[Japanese_Phrasebook/Common_phrases|common phrases]], it's useful to learn how to survive on your own. Conversation with new acquaintances in Japan can be frustratingly [http://japaneseruleof7.com/the-japanese-rule-of-7/ predictable at times], but this is a good thing when you're still learning the language.

Another survival tip:

Downloading Rikaichan for Firefox is highly recommended, all you need is a basic understanding of the backwards sentence structure that Japanese has compared to English and you'll be able to read web pages like the [[wikipedia:ja:%E3%83%A1%E3%82%A4%E3%83%B3%E3%83%9A%E3%83%BC%E3%82%B8|Japanese Wikipedia]]. Slowly, word-by-word, but at least it's possible through the interactive dictionary.

'''Luring a child'''&lt;br&gt;
172.1 (1) Every person commits an offence who, by means of a computer system within the meaning of subsection 342.1(2), communicates with
:(a) a person who is, or who the accused believes is, under the age of eighteen years, for the purpose of facilitating the commission of an offence under subsection 153(1), section 155 or 163.1, subsection 212(1) or (4) or section 271, 272 or 273 with respect to that person;
:(b) a person who is, or who the accused believes is, under the age of 16 years, for the purpose of facilitating the commission of an offence under section 151 or 152, subsection 160(3) or 173(2) or section 280 with respect to that person; or
:(c) a person who is, or who the accused believes is, under the age of 14 years, for the purpose of facilitating the commission of an offence under section 281 with respect to that person.
&lt;P&gt;
'''Punishment'''&lt;br&gt;
(2) Every person who commits an offence under subsection (1)
:(a) is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for a term of not more than 10 years and to a minimum punishment of imprisonment for a term of one year; or
:(b) is guilty of an offence punishable on summary conviction and is liable to imprisonment for a term of not more than 18 months and to a minimum punishment of imprisonment for a term of 90 days.
&lt;P&gt;
'''Presumption re age'''&lt;br&gt;
(3) Evidence that the person referred to in paragraph (1)(a), (b) or (c) was represented to the accused as being under the age of eighteen years, sixteen years or fourteen years, as the case may be, is, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, proof that the accused believed that the person was under that age.
&lt;p&gt;
'''No defence'''&lt;br&gt;
(4) It is not a defence to a charge under paragraph (1)(a), (b) or (c) that the accused believed that the person referred to in that paragraph was at least eighteen years of age, sixteen years or fourteen years of age, as the case may be, unless the accused took reasonable steps to ascertain the age of the person.
&lt;P&gt;
2002, c. 13, s. 8; 2007, c. 20, s. 1; 2008, c. 6, s. 14; 2012, c. 1, s. 22.
|[http://canlii.org/en/ca/laws/stat/rsc-1985-c-c-46/latest/rsc-1985-c-c-46.html#sec172.1 CCC]}}

==Proof of Offence==

'''172.1(1)(a)'''&lt;br&gt;
The crown should prove the following elements:
# accused communicated by means of a [[Canadian Criminal Law/Computer System|computer system]] (see [http://www.canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec342.1 s. 342.1(2)])
# the accused communicated to a person who
##is under the age of 18 or
##is believed to be under the age of 18
#accused’s “specific purpose” in communicating is to facilitate the commission of a specified secondary offence with respect to the under-aged person. (specifically section 153(1), 155 or 163.1,  212(1) or (4), 271, 272 or 273)

'''172.1(1)(b)'''&lt;br&gt;
The crown should prove the following elements:
# accused communicated by means of a computer system (see s. 342.1(2)) 
# the accused communicated to a person who
##is under the age of 16 or
##is believed to be under the age of 16
#accused’s “specific purpose” in communicating is to facilitate the commission of a specified secondary offence with respect to the under-aged person. (specifically section 151, 152, 160(3) or 173(2) or 280)

'''172.1(1)(c)'''&lt;br&gt;
The crown should prove the following elements:&lt;Ref&gt;R. v. Alicandro [http://canlii.ca/t/22h4d 2009 ONCA 133], R. v. Quinones, [http://canlii.ca/t/fqbvb#par5 2012 BCCA 94] at 5&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Legare, [http://canlii.ca/t/26vbx#par9 2009 SCC 56 at 9]&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;
# accused communicated by means of a computer system (see s. 342.1(2))
# the accused communicated to a person who
##is under the age of 14 or
##is believed to be under the age of 14
#accused’s “specific purpose” in communicating is to facilitate the commission of a specified secondary offence with respect to the under-aged person. (specifically s. 281)


{{Reflist|2}}
==Interpretation==
The purpose of s.172.1 is to “shut that door on predatory adults who, generally for a sexual purpose, troll the Internet for vulnerable children and adolescents. Shielded by the anonymity of an assumed online name and profile, they aspire to gain the trust of their targeted victims through computer “chats” — and then to tempt or entice them into sexual activity, over the Internet or, still worse, in person.”&lt;ref&gt;Legare [http://canlii.ca/t/26vbx#par2 at 2]&lt;/ref&gt;

This is an “inchoate” offence that is separate and apart from the sexual offence that it precedes. It does not require the sexual offence to have happened. This includes not requiring that the accused actually go to meet the victim in person.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Legare, [http://canlii.ca/t/26vbx#par25 at 25]&lt;/ref&gt; Nor is it necessary for the accused to be “objectively capable” to commit the secondary offence.&lt;ref&gt;Legare [http://canlii.ca/t/26vbx#par42 at 42]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Reflist|2}}
===Purpose of Facilitating an Offence===

It is not criminal to engage in sexually explicit chats with an underage person unless the prohibited purpose is established beyond a reasonable doubt.&lt;ref&gt;R v Pengelley&lt;/ref&gt;

The intent must be specific to the objective and must be determined subjectively.&lt;Ref&gt;Legare [http://canlii.ca/t/26vbx#par32 at 32]&lt;/ref&gt;

Facilitating can include actions that help “bring about or [make] easier or more probable the commission of such an offence, by grooming or reducing the inhibitions of a young person or by exploiting their curiosity, immaturity or precocious sexuality”.&lt;ref&gt;Legare at 28&lt;/ref&gt;

The contents of the messages can be used but are not determinative of a sexual purpose.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Legare, 2009 SCC 56 at 31&lt;/ref&gt; The issue must be determined on the evidence as a whole. &lt;ref&gt;ibid.&lt;/ref&gt; 

{{Reflist|2}}

===Reasonable steps to ascertain age===
Under s. 172.1, the accused can only claim to have believed the alleged victim was not of a prohibited age where he took reasonable steps to ascertain the age of the victim. This is to foreclose any any defence based on claims of the accused without any objective evidential basis.&lt;Ref&gt;R. v. Levigne, 2010 SCC 25 at 31, 35&lt;/ref&gt;


{{Reflist|2}}

==Typical Defences==
* If under s.172.1(1)(a) and the secondary offence is under s. 163.1, the defence of [[Canadian Criminal Law/Offences/Child Pornography|“private use”]] 
* Mistaken belief of age
* [[Canadian Criminal Law/Defences/Entrapment|Entrapment]]

==Related provisions==
* s.486 - the judge may order the ''exclusion of members of the public''

==Cases==
* R v Pengelley, -- acquitted based on the evidence that the child’s account showed a picture of someone in their 20s.

==History==
On August 9, 2012, the section was amended to include a mandatory minimum of 90 days on summary conviction and 1 year on indictable election.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sockpuppet_(Internet) Sockpuppetry] is the creation of deceptive online accounts that appear to be independent from a cause, company or organization that they support or oppose. It differs from using a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudonym pseudonym] in that a sockpuppet intentionally masks intentions while a pseudonym is typically used for privacy purposes. It also differs from standard [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troll_%28Internet%29 Internet trolling] in that there are motives for a sockpuppet's actions beyond the desire to create discord online. Sockpuppetry occurs at an individual, company and governmental level.  It is important to be aware of this practice because of the power it has in guiding online discussions and misrepresenting public opinion. This issue is made more serious given our increasing reliance on the Internet as a source of information.

He created Amazon accounts under the names “Nicodemus Jones” and “jellybeans” and wrote reviews of work within his field. Using these sockpuppet accounts, he commented on his own works, writing, “It really is a magnificent book.

===Wikipedia===
Wikipedia has a very strict [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Sock_puppetry policy] against sockpuppetry, and prohibits individuals from having multiple accounts for deceptive purposes. &lt;ref name=&quot;Wikipedia:Sockpuppetry&quot;&gt;Wikipedia:Sockpuppetry. (2006, April 8). In Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia. Retrieved 18:00, May 5, 2014, from http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Sockpuppetry&amp;oldid=47591539&lt;/ref&gt; The community opens sockpuppetry investigations and uses the CheckUser tool to verify accusations. &lt;ref name=&quot;Wikipedia:Sockpuppetry&quot;/&gt;. Ultimately, identified sockpuppets are blocked from Wikipedia. &lt;ref name=&quot;Wikipedia:Sockpuppetry&quot;/&gt;

In August 2012, a Wikipedia page for an internet security company, CyberSafe, was recommended for deletion because a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedians Wikipedian] named [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Doctree Doctree] did not believe the company warranted its own Wikipedia article.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wikipedia Daily Dot&quot;&gt; Owens, S., 2013. The battle to destroy Wikipedia's biggest sockpuppet army. The Daily Dot http://www.dailydot.com/lifestyle/wikipedia-sockpuppet-investigation-largest-network-history-wiki-pr/&lt;/ref&gt; Doctree looked at the CyberSafe article and first noticed that many of the citations were not directly relevant to CyberSafe.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wikipedia Daily Dot&quot;/&gt; The editing log showed that many different users had edited the page but barely communicated with each other, as if it was one person with multiple accounts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wikipedia Daily Dot&quot;/&gt; Doctree then noticed that many user accounts were arguing against the page's deletion in a similar manner, again leading him to believe that the arguments were actually from one person.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wikipedia Daily Dot&quot;/&gt; He reported the user accounts for sockpuppetry and an investigation ensued. Wikipedia uncovered a network of 300 sockpuppet accounts that had edited hundreds of pages.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wikipedia Daily Dot&quot;/&gt; This remains the largest discovered sockpuppet network in Wikipedia history. Wikipedia banned the user accounts and deleted the edited pages.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wikipedia Daily Dot&quot;/&gt;

Reporters discovered that the user accounts were associated with a company known as [https://www.wiki-pr.com Wiki-PR]. Companies had hired Wiki-PR to create and manage their Wikipedia pages for a fee. &lt;ref name=&quot;Wikipedia Daily Dot&quot;/&gt; The Wikimedia foundation retained Cooley LLP to investigate allegations against the company after which it sent a [https://blog.wikimedia.org/2013/11/19/wikimedia-foundation-sends-cease-and-desist-letter-to-wikipr/ cease and desist letter] to Wiki-PR.

She states, &quot;Our readers know Wikipedia’s not perfect, but they also know that it has their best interests at heart, and is never trying to sell them a product or propagandize them in any way.&quot;&lt;ref&gt; Gardner, S., 2013.

Wikimedia blog hhttp://blog.wikimedia.org/2013/10/21/sue-gardner-response-paid-advocacy-editing/&lt;/ref&gt; The Wikipedia community not only edits articles but also checks each other to ensure reliability. Sockpuppetry undermines this effort by introducing bias that cannot be accounted for by the community. As a result, the purpose of Wikipedia has been tainted, and users have been deceived into reading propaganda rather than the unbiased facts they expect.

=Legal Consequences=
Currently there are no formal laws in the United States regarding sockpuppetry. However, there have been instances where sockpuppetry has led to legal ramifications. In 2007, the Securities and Exchange Commission investigated the CEO of Whole Foods Market, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Mackey_%28businessman%29 John Mackey], for logging onto a Yahoo message board with a sockpuppet account and praising his company in order to raise its stock.&lt;ref name=&quot;CEO&quot;&gt; Stone, B., Richtel M., 2007. The Hand That Controls the Sock Puppet Could Get Slapped. The New York Times http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/16/technology/16blog.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=1&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar case, Hollinger International's CEO, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conrad_Black Conrad Black], attempted to persuade the chief of investor relations to use a sockpuppet in a chat room to blame short sellers for the company's poor stock performance. &lt;ref name=&quot;CEO&quot;/&gt; This instance was used as evidence in Black's criminal fraud trial in which he was found guilty of mail fraud and obstruction of justice.&lt;ref name=&quot;CEO&quot;/&gt;

In a 2014 trial that may dictate future sanctions on sockpuppetry, a Virginia court ruled that Yelp must turn over the identities of 7 alleged Yelp sockpuppets &lt;ref name=&quot;Howell, Swarts&quot;&gt; Howell, K., &amp; Swarts, P. (2014, January 8). YELP critics must be identified, court rules in online landscape altering decision. From http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jan/8/court-rules-yelp-website-must-identify-seven-negat/?page=all &lt;/ref&gt;.  The plaintiff, a carpet cleaning company owner, claimed Yelp users were leaving negative comments about his business&lt;ref name=&quot;Howell, Swarts&quot;/&gt;.  Revealing the identities of these reviewers provides concrete consequences for sockpuppets, and may set a precedent for harsher sanctions on the practice.
  
Some legal experts contend that sockpuppetry would be illegal according to UK law. The [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgery_and_Counterfeiting_Act_1981 Forgery and Counterfeiting Act of 1981] states that &quot;a person is guilty of forgery if he makes a false instrument, with the intention that he or another shall use it to induce somebody to accept it as genuine, and by reason of so accepting it to do or not to do some act to his own or any other person's prejudice.&quot; This would only apply if a website or social network was shown to be biased as a result of sockpuppetry. &lt;ref&gt; Fielding, N., Cobain I, 2011. Revealed: US spy operation that manipulates social media. The Guardian http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/mar/17/us-spy-operation-social-networks &lt;/ref&gt;

=Conclusion=
These examples show that sockpuppetry threatens the use of the Internet as a place for free expression and an open exchange of ideas. With an estimated 50% of the world using the Internet, over 3.5 billion people are perhaps exposed to this purposeful opinion bias manipulation on a small scale everyday.&lt;ref&gt;International Telecommunications Union&lt;/ref&gt; Today the internet can be viewed as a public resource, and in the same way the nation works to protect water supplies, there must be steps taken to protect the Internet. Sockpuppetry degrades this resource, and although internet users could work to question the bias of every opinion presented on the Web, the reactions of the Chinese netizens and respected organizations, such as Wikipedia, reveal that the future of the Internet may lie in the enforcement of and agreement to ethical standards by all netizens.

== '''About Edubuntu''' ==

Labdoo project supply laptops with Edubuntu already installed.

Edubuntu, also previously known as Ubuntu Education Edition, is an official derivative of the Ubuntu operating system designed for use in classrooms inside schools, homes and communities.

Edubuntu has been developed in collaboration with teachers and technologists in multiple countries. Edubuntu is built on top of the Ubuntu base, incorporates the LTSP thin client architecture and several education-specific applications, and is aimed at users aged 6 to 18. It is designed for easy installation and ongoing system maintenance.

Included with Edubuntu there is a large number of educational applications including GCompris, KDE Edutainment Suite, Sabayon Profile Manager, Pessulus Lockdown Editor, Edubuntu Menueditor, LibreOffice, Gnome Nanny and iTalc as well as many more. Some of them as enjoyable as Tux Math or Celestia.

In this guide you'll know about especific educational software and other software like Firefox or Rhythmbox. Those other software could seem not educational software but could it be very useful for students and so many people.

== '''Education Software''' ==

'''&lt;u&gt;Blinken&lt;/u&gt;'''

Blinken is based on an electronic game released in 1978, which challenges players to remember sequences of increasing length. On the face of the device, there are 4 different color buttons, each one with their own distinctive sound. These buttons light up randomly, creating the sequence that the player must then recall. If the player is successful in remembering the sequence of lights in the correct order, they advance to the next stage, where an identical sequence with one extra step is presented. If they are incorrect, the game is lost, and the player must start again from the beginning. The goal is to get a high score - each step in the sequence is worth one point, so correct entry of a sequence of 8 lights is worth 8 points on the high score table.

[[Image:Blinken.png|thumb|center|300px]]


'''&lt;u&gt;Celestia&lt;/u&gt;'''

Celestia is a 3D astronomy program created by Chris Laurel. The program is based on the Hipparcos Catalogue (HIP) and allows users to travel through an extensive universe, modeled after reality, at any speed, in any direction, and at any time in history. Celestia displays and interacts with objects ranging in scale from small spacecraft to entire galaxies in three dimensions using OpenGL, from perspectives which would not be possible from a classic planetarium or other ground-based display.

'''&lt;u&gt;Educational suite GCompris&lt;/u&gt;'''

'''&lt;u&gt;GCompris Administration&lt;/u&gt;'''

'''&lt;u&gt;Kanagram&lt;/u&gt;'''

Kanagram is an educational game that creates anagrams, re-assortment of letters in a word, and the user needs to guess what the original word is. It is licensed under the GNU Public License v2, and it is part of the kdeedu package, and the user interface is designed to be approachable even by very young children. There is no time limit or limitations at attempts, and a hint system is built in.

'''&lt;u&gt;KBruch&lt;/u&gt;'''

'''&lt;u&gt;KHangMan&lt;/u&gt;'''

KHangMan is the classical hangman game. The child should guess a word letter by letter. At each miss, the picture of a hangman appears. After 10 tries, if the word is not guessed, the game is over and the answer is displayed.

'''&lt;u&gt;Kig&lt;/u&gt;'''

'''&lt;u&gt;KmPlot&lt;/u&gt;'''

KmPlot is a mathematical function plotter for the KDE-Desktop.

It has built in a powerfull parser. You can plot different functions simultaneously and combine their function terms to build new functions. KmPlot supports functions with parameters and functions in polar coordinates. Several grid modes are possible. Plots may be printed with high precision in correct scale.

'''&lt;u&gt;KTouch&lt;/u&gt;'''

A program that helps you to learn and practise touch typing.

'''&lt;u&gt;KTurtle&lt;/u&gt;'''

KTurtle is an educational programming environment that aims to make learning how to program as easy as possible. To achieve this KTurtle makes all programming tools available from the user interface. The programming language used is TurtleScript which allows its commands to be translated.

'''&lt;u&gt;KWordQuiz&lt;/u&gt;'''

KWordQuiz is a general purpose flash card program. It can be used for vocabulary learning and many other subjects.

KWordQuiz is the KDE (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KDE) version of the Windows program WordQuiz. If you have just switched to Edubuntu/Linux you can use all files created in WordQuiz with KWordQuiz. Additional information about KWordQuiz is available at [http://peterandlinda.com/kwordquiz/ the author's own website].

'''&lt;u&gt;Lybniz graph Plotter&lt;/u&gt;'''

Function graph Plotter

'''&lt;u&gt;Marble&lt;/u&gt;'''

Versatile, yet easy to use. Use Marble similar to a desktop globe; pan around and measure distances. At closer scale it becomes a world atlas, while OpenStreetMap takes you to street level. Search for places of interest, view Wikipedia articles, create routes by drag and drop and so much more.

Marble is a virtual globe and world atlas. More information here: http://marble.kde.org/

'''&lt;u&gt;Parley&lt;/u&gt;'''

Parley is a program to help you memorize things.
Parley supports many language specific features but can be used for other learning tasks just as well. It uses the spaced repetition learning method, also known as flash cards.

Creating new vocabulary collections with Parley is easy, but of course it is even better if you can use some of our premade files.

[[Image:Parley KDE Spanish Catalan German.png|thumb|center|300px]]


'''&lt;u&gt;Step&lt;/u&gt;'''

Step is an interactive physics simulator. It works like this: you place some bodies on the scene, add some forces such as gravity or springs, then click &quot;Simulate&quot; and Step shows you how your scene will evolve according to the laws of physics.

You can change every property of bodies/forces in your experiment (even during simulation) and see how this will change the outcome of the experiment. With Step you can not only learn but feel how physics works !

      <comment>Document default values</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Calculating values ===

Define a '''function''' for code readability and re-use.

'''Usage examples:'''

 diameter = 20;
 function r_from_dia(dia) = dia / 2;
 echo(&quot;Diameter &quot;, diameter, &quot; is radius &quot;, r_from_dia(diameter));

Functions can have multiple input variables of different types. The

'''Usage examples:'''

 function f(x, vec) = x * vec[0] + 2 * x * vec[1];
 echo(f(3, [4, 5])); // produces ECHO: 42

=== Default values ===

Starting from the last parameter, it's possible to define default values. Those are assigned in case the function call does not give all the parameters.

'''Usage examples:'''

 function f(p1, p2 = 3, p3 = 0) = 100 * p1 + 10 * p2 + p3;
 echo(f(3, 2, 1)); // produces ECHO: 321
 echo(f(3, 2));    // produces ECHO: 320
 echo(f(3));       // produces ECHO: 330


=== Recursive function calls ===

[[w:recursion (computer science)|Recursive]] function calls are supported. Using the Conditional Operator &quot;... '''?''' ... ''':''' ... &quot; it's possible to ensure the recursion is terminated.

Note: There is a built-in recursion limit to prevent the application to crash. If the limit is hit, the result of the function call is undef.

'''Usage examples:'''

 // recursion - find the sum of the values in a vector (array)
 // from the start (or s'th element) to the i'th element - remember elements are zero based
 
 function sumv(v,i,s=0) = (i==s ? v[i] : v[i] + sumv(v,i-1,s));
 
 vec=[ 10, 20, 30, 40 ];
 echo(&quot;sum vec=&quot;, sumv(vec,2,1)); // is 20+30=50</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The exam questions are very hard to predict and this site is by no means going to give you everything you need for the questions you'll sit.  The most important thing you should do is learn how to program, and learn how to program well!

The exam is split into 4 sections that must be completed on a computer:

===Section A===
&lt;35 minutes&gt;
Theory Questions based on the material you have covered for Unit 1.  For an overview of what this might include see the [http://filestore.aqa.org.uk/subjects/specifications/alevel/AQA-2510-W-SP-14.PDF AQA specification] and this wikibook.

*[[../../|Section A]]

===Section B===
&lt;20 minutes&gt;
Programming solutions to short problems, not based on the preliminary material or skeleton code.
* [[/Section B/]]

===Section C===
&lt;10 minutes&gt;
Theory questions about the preliminary material and skeleton code.
*[[/Section C/]]

===Section D===
&lt;55 minutes&gt;
Program solutions based around the preliminary code.  The guidance below doesn't pretend to offer the actual questions that will be set in the exam, but by doing them you should hopefully get a better grasp of the code and be able to answer any questions thrown at you during the exam.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Section B Introduction=
This section will ask you questions that you will have to find programming solutions to.  The past exams have always provided a strict program specification in the form of variable names and pseudocode. You should be able to interpret pseudocode, structured english, structure charts, stepwise refinement tables and  decision tables. Any of these techniques could be used to communicate an algorithm to be coded.   

==Practice questions==
Obviously all the past papers from AQA have good section B questions that you should attempt. Here are some around this year's theme... 
===Question 1===
{{CPTQuestionTab}}
Question 1
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;xbasic&quot;&gt;

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
   'Solution to Question 1
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

=== At the end of the game the player is asked to enter their name. Currently the player can just enter nothing by pressing Return. Modify the program to disallow empty inputs.===
VB.Net solution
{{CPTAnswerTab}}
Modify the function GetPlayerName() as follows:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
Function GetPlayerName() As String
    Dim PlayerName As String
    Console.WriteLine()
    Do
        Console.Write(&quot;Please enter your name: &quot;)
        PlayerName = Console.ReadLine
    Loop Until PlayerName &lt;&gt; &quot;&quot;
    Console.WriteLine()
    Return PlayerName
End Function

an alternative solution

  Function GetPlayerName() As String
        Dim PlayerName As String
        Do
            Console.WriteLine()
            Console.Write(&quot;Please enter your name: &quot;)
            PlayerName = Console.ReadLine
            Console.WriteLine()
            If PlayerName.Length = 0 Then
                Console.WriteLine(&quot;INVALID - Please enter your name.&quot;)
            End If
            If PlayerName.Length &gt; 15 Then
                Console.WriteLine(&quot;INVALID - Please enter a name that is shorter than 15.&quot;)
            End If
        Loop Until PlayerName.Length &gt; 0 And PlayerName.Length &lt;= 15
        'i did this so that they have to enter a name and the length of the name is capped
        Return PlayerName
    End Function





 Function GetPlayerName() As String
        Dim PlayerName As String = &quot;&quot;


        While PlayerName = &quot;&quot; Or PlayerName.Length &gt; 15
            Console.WriteLine()
            Console.Write(&quot;Please enter your name (max 15 characters): &quot;)
            PlayerName = Console.ReadLine
            Console.WriteLine()

=== Replay a shuffled deck. Add a menu option to replay the last &quot;shuffled&quot; game.  ===
As each card is thrown away and moved up the deck this requires changing the deck handling to include a pointer. Is this 
Likely? &lt;br /&gt;
This does not appear to be needed.  You can just replay with Deck as the contents of that are not lost.  There is no need for a copy of the Deck to play again.  
No it doesn't. As the person who produced the Pascal solution has shown - just take a copy of the shuffled deck before you start playing. You can play this copy again and again.&lt;br /&gt;
GetCard effectively pops card from deck and fills in a blank on bottom so destroys the deck while playing Python version available as well&lt;br /&gt;

'AUTHOR: Kiran Joshi, The Queen Katherine School, Kendal
'NOTES:
'Firstly I think its less likely that this will come up due to the extensive modifications to the program as a whole and the structure of the &quot;PlayGame&quot; Subroutine but don't hold me to it.
'When you are mid game and want to quit you are able to quit the game by using char &quot;q&quot;. Data for the game is stored in a text file called &quot;SavedGame.txt&quot; in the program directory.
'You can load a game by selecting &quot;Option 5&quot; at the menu.
'Anyways I have written two very simple routines &quot;SaveGame&quot; and &quot;LoadSavedGame&quot; and modified &quot;PlayGame&quot; , &quot;GetChoiceFromUser&quot;, &quot;DisplayMenu&quot; and &quot;Main&quot;
'Im sure there must be a easier way of doing this.

'OVERVIEW:
'+ SaveGame &amp; LoadSavedGame have been added as SubRoutines
'+ Load(bool) has been added as a parameter to PlayGame SubRoutine
'+ Main and DisplayMenu have been edited to include options to LoadSaveGame
'+ GetChoiceFromUser has been modified to give the option to quit and save
'+ PlayGame now allows you to quit game midway and automatically save by calling function SaveGame.

'STRUCTURE OF SAVE FILE
'104 Lines have been used to store Deck Data. 52 Suits and 52 Ranks = 104.

'As explained in the Pascal Solution (thanks James Tarpy) cards are popped of the deck and removed. As the deck gets smaller all the spaces in the array at the bottom are replaced with 0s.

Words are tools of communications. That is why each group has its special work to do. Nouns are the names of persons, places, and things. Pronouns take the place of nouns. Verbs are words that express action. Adjectives and adverbs help express the ideas that give color and more definite meanings to nouns, verbs, and other words. A preposition is a word used before another word to indicate how that word is being used. Conjunctions are joining or connecting words, and interjections are words that come between words that express different ideas. The most important fact to keep in mind when learning a new word is its function or use in a particular sentence. If you keep this in mind, you will easily learn the word and how it is used in relation with other words in sentences.

The first group or class of the Parts of Speech is the Noun - each group has its special work to do.

==Kapampangan Grammar: NOUNS (Lagyu) ==

A '''Noun''' is a word used to name something. It is the word that tells what you are talking about. For example, there are names for persons, animals, places, and objects that can be pointed out and recognized. There are also names for substances, qualities, actions, and measures of time or quantity.

In Kapampangan, like English, nouns and other parts of speech have no gender. 

==Kinds of Nouns==

There are several kinds of nouns depending on how they are used.  Some kinds of nouns are '''common nouns, proper nouns.and collective nouns.'''

A '''common noun''' names any one of a class of persons, places, or things. An example of a common noun is the word 'tau' (person) and the word 'tau' can be used to refer to any person in the world.

However, when we want to refer to a particular person, we must use a special name. The name of a particular person might be 'Juan' or 'Pedro'. These particular names are called proper nouns. A '''proper noun''' is the name of a particular person, place, or thing.

A '''collective noun''' names a class or group: e.g. aguman, pibale-bale, balayan, kumite, at aliwa pa.

The following list includes examples of different kinds of nouns

Examples of Nouns used in Sentences (the words in bold letters are the nouns):

#Ing talaturung i Juan mayap yang kaluguran.
#:(The teacher John is a good friend.)   
#Ing asu, ing pusa, ampon ing kabayu mikakaluguran la.
#:(The dog, the cat, and the horse are friends.)
#Ing kakung bale king Menila malapit ya king palengke.
#:(My house in Manila is near the market.)</text>

&lt;ref&gt;Information about the equations can be found at http://mrob.com/pub/comp/xmorphia/#formula.
&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = D_{u} \nabla ^{2} u-uv^{2}+F (1-u)
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial v}{\partial t} = D_{v} \nabla ^{2} u+uv^{2}-(F+k)v
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The above reaction-diffusion system describes the density of two chemicals ,(&lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;), reacting with another. First term in the equations is for the diffusion, the second describes the reaction of &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;,(&lt;math&gt;u+2v&lt;/math&gt; → &lt;math&gt;3v&lt;/math&gt;) and the last term in the first equation is the input of new &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt;, while in the second the last term removes &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; from the system.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is the grammar of the Tajik language.
== Ҷонишинҳои шахсӣ (Personal pronouns) ==
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!  !! Singular !! Plural
|-
| 1st person || Ман || Мо
|-
| 2nd person || Ту || Шумо
|-
| 3rd person || Вай, ӯ || Онҳо
|}

Now we will create simple phrases with the pronouns and the words '''хона''' - house and '''доштан''' (асоси замони ҳозира: дор) - have.

Ман хона дорам - I have a house

Мо хона дорем - We have a house

Ту хона дорӣ - You have a house

Шумо хона доред - You (pl.) have a house

Вай хона дорад (Ӯ хона дорад) - He has a house

Онҳо хона доранд - They have a house

== Асосҳои феълӣ (Verb stems) ==
=== Масдар (Infinitive) ===
The infinitive in Tajik consists of the past tense stem and the infinitive ending '''-ан'''.

пухтан - to bake

рафтан - to go

кардан - to do

харидан - to buy

омадан - to come

бурдан - to carry

гирифтан - to take

доштан - to have

додан - to give

рақсидан - to dance

гуфтан - to say

хӯрдан - to eat

афтидан - to fall

нӯшидан - to drink

давидан - to run

мондан - to lay (transitive verb)
=== Асоси замони гузашта (Past tense stem) ===
The past tense stem indicates the singular 3rd person past simple verb (he did, etc.). To form the past tense stem, the -ан ending is detached from the infinitive. However, some verbs are irregular.

афтод - he fell
=== Асоси замони ҳозира (Present/future tense stem) ===
The present/future tense stem is mostly irregular. It indicates the imperative.

паз - bake!

рав - go!

кун - do!

хар - buy!

ой - come!

бар - carry!

гир - take!

дор - have!

деҳ - give!

рақс - dance!

гӯй - say!

хӯр - eat!

афт - fall!

нӯш - drink

дав - run!</text>

== '''Introduction''' ==
=== Overview ===
We are Norman Borlaug Community School District (NBCSD), a school district of 1400 students located in northeastern Iowa. NBCSD is a combination of three surrounding towns, Rice, Hampton, and Turkey. We have four different schools, Oat Elementary, Wheat Elementary, Barley Middle School, and Corn High School. Out of the student enrollment, 92% of them are Caucasian, 1% are Chinese, 2% are African American, and 2% are Hispanic. In addition, over 80% of the students maintain a free and reduced meal status.

[[File:NBCSD 1-1 Program Plan.png|thumb|Norman Borlaug Community School District 1:1 Program Plan]]
=== 1:1 Program ===
In terms of technology, the NBCSD is a fairly sophisticated and technology infused district. The superintendent and school board have consistently supported technology integration and have made a number of upgrades to the network infrastructure, wireless, and servers in advance of the impending 1:1 Program. By next fall, all our students in grades K-6 will have an iPad and in grades 7-12 they will have a MacBook Air.

=== TPACK Assignment ===
This specific assignment will cover specifically the Corn High School, and more specifically grades 11 and 12, as we focus on 21st Century Skills. All of our teachers have an updated computer and depending on their grade level also an iPad so that they can begin planning for the technology rollout.  Students are not expected to have prior knowledge of the topics, themes, and information covered in the lessons, but they do have basic computer skills (including Internet, typing, and core productivity suite applications) that they have learned from their use of the many mobile and stationary computer labs spread throughout Corn High School.  These TPACK lessons were created with the mindset that they will take multiple 55 minute class periods to complete, but if more time is required they can work on the material at home with the district provided LMS/CMS.

Thinking about our school district as a whole and considering a specific subject area to take a look at, as a group we determined that the 21st Century Skills would be the best fit. It is a subject area that all three of us have in common and can easily write about, speak about, and form lesson plans on.  In addition, 21st Century Skills usually gets a bad rap as being &quot;integrated&quot; within a 1:1 Program.  We firmly believe that this skill set is something that we cannot take for granted.  Just because our students grew up in the 21st Century does not mean that they possess these skills.  Instead, 21st Century Skills must be integrated, demonstrated, and focused on in our classes.  In order for this to actually happen more effectively our group decided to look closely at these skills so that they can be outlined, demonstrated, and understood before any other integration of TPACK knowledge in the other subject areas can occur.  We hope that leading by example our group will promote the use of 21st Century Skills and the integration of TPACK throughout the NBCSD.

== '''Standards and Benchmarks''' ==
TPACKing at NBCSD is based on the [https://www.educateiowa.gov/iowacore Iowa Core Curriculum] and in particular the [https://www.educateiowa.gov/documents/iowa-core/2013/12/iowa-core-21st-century-skillspdf 21st Century Skills]. There are many skills present in this section of information, but for this project our group decided to focus on Civic Awareness, Employability Skills, and Technology Literacy.  Having taught or interacted with students in the NBCSD before, we understand that these three areas of 21st Century skills are essential and important. In planning future professional development for our staff, we thought that we would lead by example and create lessons that fit into these key areas.

The framework for our individual lessons is based on the lesson activity types for each of the main benchmarks for our focus areas. Below you will see an outline of each of the main benchmarks for our three focus areas:
:1. The development of civic awareness to effectively add to society - '''Civic Awareness'''
:2. The ability to hopefully at one point be employed - '''Employability Skills'''
:3. The awareness of how technology can help them be successful both today and into the future - '''Technology Literacy'''

=== Civic Awareness ===
I. Understand the rights and responsibilities of each citizen and demonstrate the value of lifelong civic action.
:A. Activity / Technology: ''The class will break apart the rights and responsibilities of each citizen and then produce a video based on Jay Leno’s Jaywalking segment where they interview people about those characteristics. This will provide students with the ability to interact with digital media, real people, and all the challenges that go along with interviewing and editing a video with a team. They will share their final product and process work at a selected movie day in the future. The most creative and highest rated entries from the students will appear at an evening short film festival in the spring.''
:B. Activity / Technology: ''Students will spend some time in a creative and artistic venture of their choice (typical responses will be photography, comics, short stories, etc.) where they will describe the value of lifelong civic action by reflecting and planning what they hope to accomplish in the future. This activity will allow students to be reflective on exactly what they want to accomplish later in life, while at the same time being creative with exactly what type of media they would like to produce. There will be a rubric provided that allows for breath of the expression and depth of the answer, but does not limit on the specific format.''

II. Understand how the government established Constitution embodies the enduring values and principles of democracy and republicanism.
:A. Activity / Technology: ''In small groups students will spend a very short and frantic time researching and then producing a two minute presentation of any kind or format - as long as it covers how the government established the Constitution and everyone in the group must say at least four sentences. This activity will provide students with the real life experience of working in a group and under a significantly tight deadline. In addition, groups have free reign to produce their final product in whatever format that they desire so grading may be difficult for the instructor, but it will provide a great foundation for the discussion later on in the class.''
:B. Activity / Technology: ''Individually students will spend the evening reflecting on the activities in class today in two specific formats. One, they must write a short reflection of their experience and what they learned from it and post it to the instructor’s online dropbox. Second, they must participate (post three new comments and add three comments to others’ postings) in an online class discussion in the CMS/LMS where they are to discuss the values and principles of democracy and republicanism.  This activity will force students to be reflective of their class activities in addition to furthering the discussion and collaboration among each other as they factor in what they know, want to know, and have learned about these two concepts.''

III. Understand the purpose and function of each of the three branches of government established by the Constitution.
:A. Activity / Technology: ''The entire class will be broken into three different groups, one for each branch of the government. Then the entire class will be put through a simulation of passing a law, hearing a supreme court case, and providing aid to a foreign country. As soon as the activity is complete students will be asked to discuss with a partner their thoughts, feelings, and reflections of the three branches of government. This discussion will be documented through a cell phone camera, camera on a computer, or an audio recording - all of which will be submitted to the instructor through the CMS/LMS before the class period is over.  This activity will allow students to actively participate in the three branches of government, see how they interact with one another, and then reflect on the process with one individual.  This activity as a whole will provide a good idea of the students’ understanding of the Constitution and their use of either video or audio recording will allow the instructor to document that information.''

IV. Understand the differences among the complex levels of local, state and national government and their inherent, expressed, and implied powers.
:A. Activity / Technology: ''Students will form a group of three and then document through a mind mapping or creative mapping software of their choice (Keynote or PowerPoint being the default choice if they can’t decide in two minutes) the multiple levels of local, state, and national government. Then in their short, three minute (one minute per person) they are to describe their map as well as the inherent, expressed, and implied powers of each section. Through this activity students will work together, collaborate using a software of their choice, and ultimately be provided with the option to dive deep into the material and enhance their own presentation skills. The specific media and presentation type are up to the students, but a rubric will be provided for the content.''

V. Understand strategies for effective political action that impact local, state, and national governance.
:A. Activity / Technology: ''Students will craft either a poem, rap, or short political speech for a cause that impacts either a local, state, or national cause. They are forbidden from using technology of any kind for this project. This should focus them on their content and not the expression of that content. In addition, providing multiple ways of producing and then presenting this material will allow students to express their information in a broad and explanative way. This activity should force the students to think critically about the message they want to portray, the way they want to do that, and the process to which they arrive at that decision. This activity will be recorded so that students can produce a self critique as part of the overall assessment.''

VI. Understand how law and public policy are established at the local, state, and national levels of government.
:A. Activity / Technology: ''Students will individually research one law that has been presented and voted upon by either the local, state, or national bodies. They will then work by themselves to improve the law to make it better in hopes of obtaining more votes or in hopes of passing it through. They must then represent this law to the class as an individual would at each level of government. This activity will allow students to research a number of laws that impact them - either indirectly or directly.  Students will then have the ability to work through the law and understanding the jargon and information that goes along with it. They will have to dig deep into the information and determine what to change or modify in order to represent it to the class. This activity also will improve upon their presentation skills in addition to their research and writing skills.''

VII. Understand how various political systems throughout the world define the rights and responsibilities of the individual.
:A. Activity / Technology: ''Students in groups of two will complete a templated activity where they will research a developed and then an undeveloped country and determine the rights and responsibilities of the individuals in those two countries.  Then at the time of submission the CMS/LMS the students must also post a short entry outlining some of the most stark differences between the two countries they researched.  Students will be provided with a base set of websites for the research, the template they are to use, and the group member they will be assigned to work with. Outside of that, time and direction will be given and the rest will be up to the students. This activity will encourage them to work with a partner, determine through research the differences and similarities, and then produce a short, collaborative writing piece.  A rubric will be provided before the activity begins and the submission of the final work will be on the CMS/LMS.''

VIII. Understand the role of the United States in current world affairs.
:A. Activity / Technology: ''Students will individually research the role of the US State Department and the World Affairs Councils of America. They will then prepare a set of questions and a short reflection on the role of each organization. Then the best questions will be provided an opportunity to ask their question live via Skype to a member from each organization.  The rest of the class will be live blogging the event and discussing the information that is being discussed.  After class is over a short reflection will be required to be posted to the instructor at his or her LMS/CMS page.  This activity will promote the critical thinking and role of the United States in a variety of world affairs.  In addition, it will bring the idea of civic action to the forefront of what they have been working on and learning about.  Discussion points, reflection points, and question points will be awarded to the students throughout and after the activity is complete.''

=== Employability Skills  ===
I. Communicate and work productively with others, incorporating different perspectives and cross-cultural understanding, to increase innovation and the quality of work.
:A. Activity / Technology: ''Students in the 9-12 classrooms will participate in class presentations using presentation software such as Haiku Deck, Google Presentation, or Prezi. They will also hold meetings with a community college class via videoconferencing such as Tandberg. Students will work in both small and large groups, research topics, hold informal debates, and work collaboratively to create informational videos about various communication and teamwork topics. Technology that may be used includes presentation software, video conferencing, word processor, discussion forum such as blog or wiki, digital camera, and video creation software such as iMovie.'' 

II. Adapt to various roles and responsibilities and work flexibly in climates of ambiguity and changing priorities.
:A. Activity / Technology:  ''In groups, students will be given a specified task to complete. As the students work through the tasks, the teacher will change the rules. This continues for a length of time with frequent rule changes. Afterwards, students will discuss how they adapted to the change of rules, how their roles within the group changed as the rules changed, and how priorities changed and why. Working in pairs or small groups, students will create various work-related scenarios using Google Docs or other collaborative tools. Students will role-play the various scenarios and focus on the different roles and responsibilities and how circumstances change often, many times with little or no warning.  As a culminating activity, students will create digital storybooks (e.g. Storybird) describing how they could effectively deal with changes in the workplace.'' 
 
III. Demonstrate leadership skills, integrity, ethical behavior, and social responsibility while collaborating to achieve common goals.
:A. Activity / Technology: ''Students will participate in a teacher-led class presentation (presentation software, video clips) about leadership skills, integrity, ethical behavior, and social responsibilities in the workplace. Students will research ethical issues in the workplace and share links on a class wiki. Students will work in small groups to come up with their own definition of “workplace ethics.” Each group will share their final definition on the class wiki. Students will be presented with various workplace ethics case studies. Breaking into small groups, students will work through each case study using the four step process introduced earlier in the lesson. For each different scenario, a different student will act as group leader. At the conclusion of the lesson, each student will create a blog discussing the decision-making process as well as his/her role as group leader.'' 

IV. Demonstrate initiative and self-direction through high achievement and lifelong learning while exploring the ways individual talents and skills can be used for productive outcomes in personal and professional life.
:A. Activity / Technology: ''Students will complete an online career assessment tool to explore possible career choices. Once they have chosen a career path of interest to them, the students will conduct an online search of various businesses/companies that fall into their area of interest. Using a notetaking app such as Evernote, students will compile information about their chosen career and the company websites they examined. Information will be used in a future assignment.'' 
:B. Activity / Technology: ''Students will explore social media and its use in business. The teacher leads a Prezi presentation and discussion on social media in the workplace. This lesson ties in nicely with other lessons involving business ethics. Students brainstorm a list of advantages and of risks associated with social media. Students explore and complete Cyber Smart! online activities (Common Sense Media).'' 

V. Demonstrate productivity and accountability by meeting high expectations.
:A. Activity / Technology: ''In small groups, students discuss what accountability means to them personally and for on the job. Students brainstorm possible consequences from lack of accountability. After compiling a list of accountability issues and possible consequences on the Smartboard, each group chooses one topic to research and create a short presentation presenting the accountability issue, possible consequences, and its overall cost to the economy (e.g. absenteeism).''

=== Technology Literacy Skills  ===
I. Demonstrate creative thinking, construct knowledge, and develop innovative products and processes using technology.
:A. Activity / Technology: ''Students develop an eportfolio individually to showcase their professional growth in learning. They use image editing tools, computer, iMovie, google apps for education, and web 2.0 tools to host and showcase their portfolio.''

II. Use digital media and environments to communicate and work collaboratively, including at a distance, to support individual learning and contribute to the learning of others.
:A. Activity / Technology: ''Students in classes work together in small groups to collaborate and explore different web 2.0 tools for creating an eportfolio. This portfolio will showcase to a larger audience for the students to show their professional growth in learning.'' 

III. Apply digital tools to gather, evaluate, and use information.
:A. Activity / Technology: ''Students use web 2.0 tools to collect and choose the documentation that will provide their professional growth of learning for the senior capstone project. There senior capstone project will be evaluated by using a rubric.''

IV. Demonstrate critical thinking skills, using appropriate tools and resources, to plan and conduct research, manage projects, solve problems, and make informed decisions.
:A. Activity / Technology: ''Students gather and collect documentation to showcase within the eportfolio. In the design of an eportfolio students will troubleshoot different areas to figure out how images, videos, and documentation can be embedded into the hosting site.''  

V. Understand human, cultural, and societal issues related to technology and practice legal and ethical behavior.
:A. Activity / Technology: ''Students learn how to paraphrase information for creating research documents to avoid plagiarism. Students will develop proper note-taking, appropriate paraphrasing of information, and how and when to cite sources for their eportfolio. Students who are researching may need additional help to avoid plagiarism while using web resources.'' 

VI. Demonstrate a sound understanding of technology concepts, systems and operations.
:A. Activity / Technology: ''Students will publish their senior capstone project to larger audience for evaluation on their technical details into the design of the portfolio, key skills learned throughout their course work, and how they are prepared for the real world experience before graduating.''

== '''Conclusion''' ==
=== Decision Process ===
In order to TPACK out our lessons for this assignment the group members really needed to think critically about the three very different, but related, areas of TPACK: Technological Knowledge, Pedagogical Knowledge, and Content Knowledge. Each of these three areas presented its own unique, but challenging aspect when trying to come up with out lesson plans. The first thing that we all did with this assignment was to determine which of the many content areas we were going to focus on as a group.  We quickly determined that the 21st Century Skills area would be the best fit for our group composition. After this hard decision was made we began to look a bit more critically at the specific areas of this subject area on the Iowa Core Curriculum website.  After determining and looking through each of the five framework areas we thought it would be best to pair up individuals with their strengths and teaching background.  It was natural to pair Amy up with Employability Skills, based on her teaching background and the same went for Heather as well and the Technology Literacy area.  The tough one was Randon and his background in English/Literature, but after looking a bit more at the standards and benchmarks we determined that civic literacy would be a nice fit for him as he had done a lot of co-teaching with that framework area in the past.

=== Standards and Benchmarks ===
Once the specific framework areas of the 21st Century Skills subject area were determined we decided to begin work on a Google Document that would keep all our thoughts and ideas as a group contained and in one place.  Then we decided the next course of action was to put in all the essential concept or skills for our framework area, basing this knowledge on the information that we noted from previous example groups.  This included a lot of copying, pasting, and then finally re-formatting.  However, this was only putting in the information from the Iowa Core Curriculum, at this stage of the game we had no overall integration with TPACK and the activity types based on the Harris/Hofer article and the William and Mary School of Education Wiki.  Then collaboratively we were able to take a look at these, and with the assistance of other group members really narrow down and determine, using the previously noted information as a guide, the activity / technology for each of the standards and benchmarks in our framework area.  We understand that this was a lot of work and something that may or may not have been necessary, but in order to really prepare us for our own individual lessons we really wanted to address all the essential concept or skills.  This decision, we believe, would pay off when we went to complete our own individual lessons as we would have a more holistic view of TPACK and 21st Century Skills, but more specifically the relationship of these two to our individual framework area.

=== Individual Lessons ===
Then we moved on to our individual lessons and creating those to the best of our ability.  This involved us really taking a closer look at the Harris/Hofer article in addition to the William and Mary School of Education wiki to help us guide our lesson planning.  We were able to pair that knowledge with our own previous teaching experiences and lesson plans.  This allowed us to align our lessons to the content (CK) and pedagogy (PK) that we already knew and then pair it easily with the integration of technology (TK) so that all three sides of TPACK were brought together.  We firmly believe that we have put together three quality lessons.  Furthermore, we hope that these lesson plans that can be used for our colleagues at NBCSD so that they can contextualize TPACK and 21st Century Skills effectively as part of our future our 1:1 Program.

=== Final Thoughts ===
There were a number of challenges that we faced when completing this assignment.  First, we had to overcome the obstacles of not teaching in the classroom on a regular basis, as our individual jobs focus on different portions of the teaching profession or do not find us in front of students on a daily basis in a high school classroom.  Second, we were working with a specific portion of the Iowa Core Curriculum, 21st Century Skills at the high school grade level, that we each did not have any individual experience with. This proved difficult at times to overcome, but in the end we pushed through.  Third, our group had to think critically about the specific activity types that were necessary for this assignment, because this specific content area is not listed on the William and Mary School of Education wiki.  Finally, as a group we wanted to think a bit outside of the box for this assignment.  After deliberate thinking and lots of percolating, we determined that the best course of action was to complete the assignment as written.  This was frustrating and for a short time did prove to be a challenge as we did not know how best to complete this project.  However, once we were set on the right track we were off and running! 

In addition to the challenges, there were a number of realizations that happened throughout this project.  Probably the biggest one for us as a group, one that we all had individually at some point in this project, is that we do this stuff all the time.  The planning of our lessons, pairing activity types, looking at the eight corresponding continua, and then integrating that with TPACK all at once seemed normal to us.  That is not to say that we are experts at this, but we typically integrate these activity types and continua selections without thinking or even considering them.  The structure that was imposed upon us for this project at moments seemed unnatural and a bit too structured for our liking.  Part of this realization may have been the number of years that we each have been teaching or maybe our holistic/district/higher education view of teaching and learning.  Either way, we believe that “we do this stuff without thinking.”  That is a good thing!  Our other realization for this project is that students need to have options when completing the format for submitting a project.  Providing an open format for submission has its benefits, but also its drawbacks.  The same conversation can be had, though, for restricting the submission to one individual format.  This realization was partly compounded by the fact that submitting our material onto the Wiki Book was a bit like learning a second language.  It took time, effort, and research to produce a product that appeared presentable to the whole world and specifically our instructor.  We strive, individually, on providing our students with relevant and limitless ways of completing projects in the format that works best for them.  At some points it is helpful to restrict this, but for this individual project we spent significantly more time working on the submission than the creation of the content.  We all struggle with this balance in our own classrooms, but we saw it here firsthand.  In the end, we love that we learned a new way of submitting work and are excited to see that everything is together and posted on one page in a Wiki Book for the world to see - and more specifically for our staff at NBCSD to learn from in the future.

Thanks!

== '''Introduction''' ==

=== 1:1 Program ===



=== Overview Of TPACK ===
Lee Schulman(1987), an educational psychologist, believed that the teacher preparatory programs of the time were treating subject knowledge and pedagogy as one in the same. He argued that developing general pedagogical skills was not enough for preparing content teachers. Schulman believed the key to distinguishing the knowledge base of teaching rested at the intersection of content and pedagogy--PCK. Schulman introduced this as Pedagogical Content Knowledge (PCK). That intersection is the overlap of information about subject knowledge, which is the knowledge of the subject being taught, and pedagogic knowledge, that is the knowledge of how to teach, which is the strategy, planning, assessment, etc. A teacher may have deep understanding of their subject area, but there must also be an understanding of how to teach those concepts to the learner.


Piggybacking on this PCK model, technology was added into the formula. &quot;Whatever technology you select, it is the intersection of Pedagogy, Content Knowledge and Technology within a Context that will carry the message for the learner. It will determine the topic's relevance to the learner and ultimately learners' interest in remembering and using the new information.” [http://coordtech.blogspot.com/2012/02/module-4-tpackin-for-wild-learning-trip.html Dr. Z RWLD]

TPACK is this framework that was developed for understanding the complexity of teaching with technology. Mishra &amp; Koehler (2006)introduced the first and somewhat definitive presentation of the TPCK framework. Effective technology integration is successful when it meets our curricular goals. It needs to support some of the key components of learning: sound pedagogical knowledge, rich content knowledge, and technology awareness.

=== TPACK Assignment- Reflection ===
As a group of elementary educators, one kindergarten teacher, third grade teacher, and fourth grade teacher, our task was to create and design learning scenarios by integrating the TPACK model.  Our vision is to implement a 1:1 Ipad elementary school providing rich, meaningful learning for our student. We strive to create lessons incorporating technology through the TPACK framework. However, adding technology for technology sake is not our objective. We feel that technology should allow the learner to do something they couldn’t do without that technology, and transform the learning experience. A pencil and paper may be the best technology for the job.
In the design process, we didn’t start with the tools, but rather think about all three domains of our teaching: content knowledge, pedagogy, and technology and where they intersect. Creating the learning experiences is the end result of several instructional decisions.
  1. Choosing learning goals (Content Knowledge- Iowa Core)
  2. Making practical pedagogical decisions about the learning experience and student needs (Pedagogy)
  3. Selecting and sequencing activities that meet the learning goals
  4  Select formative and summative assessments
  5. Select tools and resources that will best help students benefit from the learning experiences  (Technology)
 
First, as a team we decided on the content in which this design would be implemented. All three of us are currently working on implementing the ELA Common Core in our classrooms. We each chose the ELA standards that we are currently planning for our students. After understanding the standards to be taught, each group member identified the appropriate activity types to best teach those standards, using the resources provided for us.

Once the standards were in place we worked to choose activity types that would be most appropriate and best fit our standards and grade level.  We wanted to enhance our activities with technology that would help meet our students learning goals while keeping the content at the core of the lessons.  This proved to be a challenge.  Making the sure that the technology aspect of our lessons provided students with enriched content focused learning.

After designing lessons that focused on content, pedagogy, and technology, our group realized the importance of carefully selecting particular teaching strategies that will best communicate the benchmark being taught and then using the correct technologies to enhance the lesson. When teachers are able to combine the benchmark they’re teaching with a research-based teaching strategy that will most effectively help students learn, and then add a piece of technology perfect for the lesson they’re teaching, then students are provided with a learning opportunity that will shape them into 21st century learners capable of working in a global society.

== Abstract ==
In this report, a case analysis on the knowledge management practice of an organization in Hong Kong is conducted, using variety knowledge management concepts. Background of the organization and its key knowledge management strategies are stated and analyzed. Evaluation and relevant recommendations are also given out, according to such implementations. Through this project, an overview of some issues and development in knowledge management field is reported in order to allow audience understand how knowledge management is actually applied in a utility company.

== Introduction ==
As more and more emphasis is put on the knowledge society and knowledge-based global economy, the ability of the organization to manage knowledge soon become the key to business success; especially for the organization which heavily rely on the past knowledge and experience to run the business, such as utility company. 

Utility industry is a highly knowledge-intensive industry. Knowledge management (KM), is absolutely critical to ensure effective management of knowledge asset, reuse past experiences and enhance knowledge creation and innovation. KM in utility company aims to capture and organize knowledge and experience systematically gained from staff and business partners to make the knowledge readily accessible to users and encourage knowledge generation and learning and at last to achieve the organization objectives (Wiig, 1993). Many utility companies have implemented a structured approach of KM but the effectiveness of the approach is rarely analyzed. It is worth exploring the implementation of KM in utility company and the relationship between KM activities and business performance measures. 

In this study, a small scale KM research is conducted and a KM-related business case in utility industry is analyzed to investigate the KM strategies used in utility company and evaluated the effectiveness of those strategies to see if how KM helps the company.

== Literature Review ==

=== 1. Role of KM in utility industry ===
KM in utility industry refers to the management process for knowledge acquirement, study, organization storage, sharing, communication, utilization and innovation in the production process (Li &amp; Li, 2010). According to Li, Li and Zhou (2010), knowledge assets become primary power for utility company to create fortune, which in turn, arouses the awareness of organizing knowledge and speeds up the urge of employing KM. KM takes up important role in coordinating many aspects of organizations through putting in more and more information communication and share. To utility company, KM is effective in Research and Development (R&amp;D), since this is the most intensive field of knowledge demand, which requires massive knowledge archiving, handling, accumulating, transmitting and sharing. Also, KM would eventually foster innovation, in which new knowledge is generated based on archived knowledge.

=== 2. KM tools &amp; strategies for utility industry ===
&lt;I&gt;&lt;U&gt; A) After Action Review (AAR)&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/U&gt;

After action review (AAR) was first implemented by U.S. Army Research Institute (ARI) since mid-1970s (Morrison &amp; Meliza, 1999). It is a tools originally adopted for training programme for the US army. Later on, it is applied in several business operations, and even knowledge management.

AAR is an on-going practice which used to capture lessons learned from past successes and failures, aiming to improve the future performance of the organization. With the reference to the AAR processes applied by US Army, AAR comprises of 4 steps, namely, planning, preparing, conducting and following-up (Department of the Army, 1993).
According to Signet Consulting Group (2002), AAR is conducted in various companies:

*A motor company uses AAR for new product launches, by gathering opinion for adjusting planning assumptions and performance standards, so as to ensure the new products meet the standards. 

*One of the leading oil companies even employed “Before Action Review” to discover the “ground truth” for the next phase of a project, in order to take the lesson learned of the previous stage to the next stage. 

*Wine producers adopts AAR to capture lessons from each warehouse manager for reviewing warehouse operations quarterly, via conducting one-on-one AAR.

&lt;I&gt;&lt;U&gt; B) Elicitation Interviews &lt;/I&gt;&lt;/U&gt;

Elicitation interviews use a stimulus (e.g. photographs or written records) to encourage participants to discuss subjects in greater detail than during standard interviews (Henry &amp; Fetters, 2012). This method is useful for knowledge management, especially in the part of knowledge sharing via socialization, which aims at transferring tacit knowledge between individuals (Becerra-Fernandez &amp; Sabherwal, 2001). 
Henry and Fetters (2012) suggested that, video elicitation interviews refer to interviews with video recording. It is commonly used by companies nowadays, since it helps produce high-quality data, even though it is relatively more time-consuming and complicated. 5 major steps are involved for elicitation interviews:

1.	Conceptualizing a video elicitation study (i.e. choosing suitable research topics and deciding the scope)

2.	Participants and sampling (i.e. determining unit of analysis and sampling)

3.	Data collection and management (i.e. choosing appropriate equipment, designing steps for conducting video recording and training interviewers)

4.	Data analysis (i.e. reviewing interview and data quality regularly and choose method for analyzing the data)

5.	Mitigating limitations of video elicitation interviews (i.e. deciding what kinds of interview data are needed for different purpose)

&lt;I&gt;&lt;U&gt; C) Taxonomy &lt;/I&gt;&lt;/U&gt;

Taxonomy provides carefully developed definitions for each major knowledge categories that a company recognized (Krathwohl, 2010). With an appropriated taxonomy, search terms can be commonly attached when search engine is working. In aerospace industry, it is to adjust the posting permissions and develop appropriate taxonomy to enhance the search (Jafari, Rezaeenour, Akhavan &amp; Fesharaki, 2010).

&lt;I&gt;&lt;U&gt; D) Newsletter &lt;/I&gt;&lt;/U&gt;

Dalkir (2011) mentioned that the knowledge sharing system should not be complicated in order not to let users feel troublesome since all the knowledge sharing activities must be self-motivated. Alavi and Leidner (2001) expressed that knowledge sharing is always easy that even the newsletter within the company is an effective way to share knowledge. People do not necessary decide complex information sharing model, since knowledge sharing can be done once the participant is willing to spend time on it. 

&lt;I&gt;&lt;U&gt; E) Wikis &lt;/I&gt;&lt;/U&gt;

According to the definition of Wiki by Wagner (2004), Wiki is described as a set of linked webpages, created through the incremental developed by a group of collaborating users. Its uniqueness lies both in its software and in the use of the software by collaborating members.

An investment bank uses corporate Wikis for employees to contribute and edit their corporate website without the need of special permissions of knowledge of HTML or web-authoring skills. It first started in IT department, then introduce bankwide wikis that provides access to most bank employees (Becerrs-Fernandes and Sabherwal, 2010)

&lt;I&gt;&lt;U&gt; F) Portal &lt;/I&gt;&lt;/U&gt;

Portal provides a company with rich and complex shared information workspace. It can be classified into 2 types: extranet and intranet. Intranet portal is widely used as a way to access disseminated information within a company, since information can be stored in various systems using different formats (Benya, Passiante &amp; Belbaly, 2004).

In electric power enterprise, users visit all information through portal which has two major functions regarding knowledge management. The first function is to provide knowledge map and the second one is to form coordination and task pushing systems. Both of them are belongs to the layer of knowledge application. In addition, Portal is mainly supported by business supporting information e.g. ERP, business subsystem information etc. and management supporting information e.g. OA, HRM etc. Both of them are belongs to the layer of knowledge creation (Li J., Li G., 2010).

&lt;I&gt;&lt;U&gt; G) SharePoint &lt;/I&gt;&lt;/U&gt;

SharePoint is a software developed by Microsoft, as an end-to-end solution for managing documents. Usually, custom portal is also developed to aggregate content from multiple sources into a single location (Ngai &amp; Chan, 2005).
In multi-national enterprise, SharePoint is the integration of collaboration, portal, content management, business, process and business intelligence to help users easily find, use and share information and increase productivity. The target of SharePoint is much more than just collaboration between humans. Instead, it connects people, process and information across organizational boundaries in the enterprise. In addition, SharePoint provides an extensive search framework. As a result, enterprise not only can break down knowledge silos, but also facilitates effective knowledge reuse within the corporation (Laahs, McKenna &amp; Vanamo, 2008).

&lt;I&gt;&lt;U&gt; H) Decision Support System &lt;/I&gt;&lt;/U&gt;

Decision support system is a computerized system which facilitates decision making. For example, it helps a company to choose the best supplier and assign the optimum order quantity between selected supplier, through looking in both tangible and intangible factors (Ghodsypour &amp; O’Brien, 1998). According to Nihalani, Silakari and Motwani (2009), this technology helps decision making through searching the internet, brainstorming via data-mining technology, interpreting internet-derived material, the human web interface, remote condition monitoring and many other areas. 

In e-commerce industry, Wen, Chen and Pao (2008) suggested a mobile knowledge management decision support system using multi-agent technology for automatically providing efficient solution for decision making and managing an electronic business. With the help of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies, users can modify, add, or drop their latest knowledge riles from the system. The AI system can automatically evaluate accurate action or alternatives solution when a new knowledge is introduced. Last but not least, the decision support system improves financial management by using a neural network for predication the future financial measures.

&lt;I&gt;&lt;U&gt; I) Communities of Practice (CoP) &lt;/I&gt;&lt;/U&gt;

CoP is a network in which employees voluntarily participate to facilitate exchange of knowledge, especially tacit knowledge (Wenger &amp; Snyder, 2000; Zboralski, 2009). It is a useful tool for decreasing time required to training new employees (Lesser &amp; Storck, 2001).
For example, science-based Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) gain benefits from CoP, for supporting incremental innovation in the form of problem-solving activities. The CoP they conducted are usually inter-organizational CoPs, where different people (e.g. customers, technicians etc.) are joined together, since the leveraging of personal relationships helps bring people together (Pattinson &amp; Preece, 2014).

&lt;I&gt;&lt;U&gt; J) Reward and Recognition &lt;/I&gt;&lt;/U&gt;

Reward and recognition is the driving force for successful knowledge management, particular in the aspect of knowledge sharing (Swan, Newell, Scarbrough, &amp; Hislop, 1999). In the past, these two elements never be included as best practice, however, it is mentioned by McDermott and Dell (2001) that reward and recognition can highlight the most important things that the company feels and in turn, motivate the staff.
Example for companies using reward and recognition for KM:

*A technology and management firm makes knowledge sharing as a criterion to receive the highest rating on a performance evaluation. They track the frequency that the staff contribute to knowledge base through uploading reports, and these data are used for promotion discussion. Annual awards such as “Knowledge in action” and “Best practices awards” are issued to recognize staff’s participation and contribution (McDermott &amp; Dell, 2001).

*An IT service management company give reward as fame or recognition to the engineer for providing applicable solutions (which are evaluated by peer assessors) to solve tricky problems. This incentives is rather a visible one and communal (Earl, 2001).

=== 3. Problems tackled by utility industry ===
Utility industry is an industry with unique knowledge, knowledgeable staffs equipped with unique expertise in handling the high-value assets in utility company are essential. As suggested by Poole and Sheehan (n.d.), the loss of knowledge and experience will be particularly pertinent among manufacturing, engineering and R&amp;D professional. Potential to innovate will be harmed and there will be a higher risk for making mistakes, if the knowledge and experience of senior staff and experts is not transferred to the next generations either through teaching or process.

However, not many experienced people are available in the market due to the limited companies in the industry, which means this industry is prone to knowledge drain when there is any staff movement or retirement (Singh &amp; Yadav, 2009). Therefore, it is important to determine the knowledge needed and retain those critical one for the company.

=== 4. Improvement/Further development trend for KM in utility company ===
As suggested by Martin-Rios (2014), building inter-firm network would probably be the future trend to make companies gain more through sharing knowledge, especially human resource management (HRM) knowledge. Utility industry is not an exception. Since it is so obvious that utility company is now facing knowledge drain, apart from keeping the professional knowledge of this domain from the experts, it is also critical for firms to gain knowledge about how to manage their employees. By doing so, staff would have greater loyalty towards the company and sharing culture can be fostered, which in turn, help the company to run KM smoothly.

== Research Method ==

Results of this research are concluded from qualitative research which is interview. An interview was conducted with the knowledge management manager from Company A to collect the information about KM strategies and tools used in Company A, as well as the effectiveness of those strategies. As KM implementation in each industry is different, interview is important in this research as it helps obtaining first-hand information about the actual implementation of KM in a utility company.

Interview questions were drafted in advance so as to gather the required information. After the interview, interview were then processed and interview notes were transcribed to prepare for analysis. 

For interview questions, please refer to Appendix A.

== Case Study of utility company in Hong Kong ==

=== A. Background of company ===

Company A is a Hong Kong based company focusing on the electricity supply business and has served Hong Kong for over 110 years. It generates and supplies reliable electricity to the Kowloon Peninsula, the New Territories and outlying Islands in Hong Kong. Company A operates a vertically integrated electricity business with three major business group, namely,  generation business, power system group(transmission and distribution business) and customer service group as shown in Figure 1 (Chan, 2007). 


 
Company A is a large-scale business with over 2000 employees. It is obvious that large amount of information and knowledge is generated. For the whole business group, the ratio of explicit knowledge (e.g. documents) to tacit knowledge (e.g. experience and skills not codified) were found to be 51:49 (Shek Cheung, Lee &amp; Chong, 2007). This indicates that the amount of hidden knowledge asset was large, and the knowledge assets would be lost when these employees left the company. Therefore, Company A has applied KM for more than 10 years, and during the years various pilot KM initiatives were implemented to capture the crucial knowledge and promote knowledge sharing culture. In 2010, the company won the Most Admired Knowledge Enterprise (MAKE) Award 2010 to recognize its outstanding performance in KM practices.

=== B. Problem/Issues before KM implementation ===

Company A implements knowledge management mainly due to 2 majors reasons: difficulties in outsourcing and prepare for knowledge drain (Shek Cheung, Lee &amp; Chong, 2007).

&lt;I&gt;&lt;U&gt; Unique in business nature &lt;/I&gt;&lt;/U&gt;

Business nature of the power industry is unique and focus on engineering professionals. As there are only limited number of power utility companies in the industry and the standard of Electricity Company is not equivalent with other countries, it is hard to outsource in the market. Therefore, company A has to create, capture, and store the relevant knowledge assets by itself to capture the invaluable capital from the incident experiences. 

&lt;I&gt;&lt;U&gt; Prepare for the knowledge drain &lt;/I&gt;&lt;/U&gt;

Prepare for the knowledge drain is the major need for KM. As many senior staff are going to reach the retirement age, Company A is losing a significant knowledge packed into the minds of those staff. It is hard to find replacements for experienced staff in short notice as there is insufficient experienced personnel in the market and it requires over 10 years to develop a qualified engineer.  Therefore, critical knowledge and experience is needed to retain for junior employees and to shorten their learning curves.

=== C. KM Journey ===

Company A has employed systematic knowledge management processes for more than 10 years. A number of pilot KM initiatives such as developed PSBG Wiki, After Action Review (AAR) and Community of Practice (CoP) were adopted. In 2014, the KM implementation is mainly focus on strengthening the learning and sharing culture (Figure 2).

[[File:2. KM Journey of Company A.png|center|thumb|600px|Figure 2: KM Journey in Company A]]

=== D. Implementation of KM (Tools &amp; strategies used) ===
Collison and Parcell (2004) mentioned that 3 perspectives: technology, people and process must be taken in account when designing KM activities in a company. Balance among them should be maintained in order to deliver the optimum outcome. In this part, this model is applied to explain the implementation of KM in Company A (Figure 3).

[[File:3. Three perspectives of KM (Collison &amp; Parcell, 2004).png|center|thumb|600px|Figure 3: Three perspectives of KM (Collison &amp; Parcell, 2004)]]

==== &lt;I&gt;&lt;U&gt; Technology &amp; Process: KM Tools &lt;/I&gt;&lt;/U&gt; ====

[[File:4. Integrated KM Cycle (Dalkir, 2011).png|center|thumb|600px|Figure 4: Integrated KM Cycle (Dalkir, 2011)]]

According to the model suggested by Dalkir (2011), KM cycle includes three aspects: knowledge capture and creation, knowledge sharing and dissemination, as well as knowledge acquisition and application. It means that knowledge is assessed through sharing and dissemination among people after they are captured and created. Later on, knowledge are contextualized for acquisition and application. After knowledge is applied, it will in turn update the original knowledge in the knowledge repository or even create new knowledge for future use.

Besides, other elements like KM strategy, KM technology, KM team and KM metrics are essential for running KM in a company. Most importantly, organizational culture would be the vital factor to decide whether the KM is successful or not. Figure 4 illustrates all the elements involved in Dalkir (2011)’s model.

In the following part, this KM cycle is used to describe the KM strategies used in Company A.

===== 1. Knowledge Capture and Creation =====
====== I. Content Creation ======

*&lt;U&gt; After Action Review (AAR) &lt;/U&gt;

Company A implemented AAR when there is projects or specific tasks, meaning it is project-based KM tools. Face-to-face AAR session, aiming to harvest tacit knowledge from each projects, is held for staff to gather together to share good practices and lessons. Especially, AAR is organized for projects with external consultant involvement.

In company, AAR is conducted after identifying key milestones in project. After that, harvesting template would be uploaded to knowledge portal repository (i.e. K portal), with active email alert sent to staff. The process are described in Figure 5:

[[File:5. AAR process in Company A (Chan, 2007).png|center|thumb|600px|Figure 5: AAR process in Company A (Chan, 2007)]]

*&lt;U&gt; Elicitation interviews &amp; Video development &lt;/U&gt;

Elicitation interviews was launched in Company A since 2004, after they have identified 11 core business knowledge themes. This aims to capture in-depth core business tacit knowledge from subject matter experts. In recent years, videos are taken for recording the whole process of interview.

Knowledge elicitors first interview a panel of subject matter experts and record the interview in digital format. Those files (e.g. transcript, video etc.) are uploaded to tacit knowledge repository platform after restructuring the materials into the format suitable for upload. The process are described in Figure 6:

[[File:6. Elicitation interview process in Company A (Chan, 2007).png|center|thumb|600px|Figure 6: Elicitation interview process in Company A (Chan, 2007)]]

====== II. Content Management ======

*&lt;U&gt; Taxonomy of document repository and layout &lt;/U&gt;

In Company A, knowledge taxonomy being a classification scheme of resources is implemented. It is organized and assists user in navigating through the content. By using card sorting methods, which allows user to participate in classification of glossaries and names of documents, documents can be classified into a particular class. Consequently, a customized search engine could be done, based on knowledge domain taxonomy. 

An expert directory is created as taxonomy to manage documents systematically in Electronic Document Management Systems (EDMS). The Criteria for nomination of knowledge domain into the Expert Directory includes:
- Experience in the field
- Communications skills
- Knowledge sharing inclination

*&lt;U&gt; Electronic Document Management System (EDMS) &lt;/U&gt;

In Company A, Microsoft SharePoint 2010 is used as EDMS, which is the base of SharePoint to support SharePoint. All formal company documents reside in EDMS. Through hyperlinks associated with materials, user can find documents in a particular subject. EDMS stores forms, policies and references, best practice and so on by classifying into different areas e.g. department, usage and function etc.


After recording the practice of knowledge capture and creation, following parts illustrate how the organization effectively “use” the information:

===== 2. Knowledge Sharing and Dissemination =====
Knowledge sharing and dissemination is particularly important as it is the most obvious practice of the whole knowledge management process, as stated by Lee (2011).

====== I. Communication and Collaboration technologies ======

*&lt;U&gt; Knowledge E-Quiz (K E-Quiz) &lt;/U&gt;

Company A sets up online quiz system which is also a reward-based system for all employees. Questions in the quizzes are collected and generated from the senior staff or Internet sources related to the knowledge of the company practice. 

*&lt;U&gt; Knowledge Newsletter (K Newsletter) &lt;/U&gt;

In Company A, newsletter is issued in digital form. Content of newsletter includes asset management, engineering, safety technology and health and environment. It is used to spread out the latest news in the company regularly.

*&lt;U&gt; Wikis &lt;/U&gt;
The Wikis developed by Company A follows the practice of Wikipedia which collects collaborative knowledge of company Wiki users (i.e. internal users). Knowledge on Wikis is arranged by the several core business themes. Information keeps updating as users continuously edits the content or adds new information. 

*&lt;U&gt; KM Blog &lt;/U&gt;

KM Blog in Company A is a more general technology sharing platform, compared to the above-mentioned Wikis. Staff can freely write anything on the blog to share anything they like.

====== II. Networking technologies ======

*&lt;U&gt; K Portal &lt;/U&gt;

K Portal is a web application which allows users to search for subject-related knowledge. In Company A, with the single entry point for various knowledge, it is easy for users to access the K Portal. Better still, the contents are arranged in logical structure for easy navigation and information retrieval. In addition, it provides web search engine and glossary. For development of K Portal, it is continuous improved based on the results of the knowledge audit. Subject Experts has been nominated to provide advices on technical enquiries.

*&lt;U&gt; SharePoint site&lt;/U&gt;

In Company A, SharePoint is adopted as a platform to share knowledge by sharing document of different areas among different departments. SharePoint acts as an intranet for internal usage in Company A. Access right is granted for staff by their position in the company and the level of security. SharePoint also links up with K Blog, by storing those documents of the postings created in KM Blog and KM Newsletter. As a result, staff can easily access to the document by simply clicking the hyperlink in K Blog or KM Newsletter. 

===== 3. Knowledge  Acquisition and Application =====

====== I. Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies ======

*&lt;U&gt; Intelligence Decision Making System &lt;/U&gt;

Company A employs a number of knowledge-based systems which provide services in an ontological framework. The intelligent knowledge management is supported by Artificial Intelligence techniques for practical applications. For instance, for generation, it created Generation Efficiency Monitoring System; for transmission and distribution network, it invented Lightning Detection System for System Operation and; for customer services, it produced Customer Voice Management System.

==== &lt;I&gt;&lt;U&gt; People: Strategies fostering sharing cultures &lt;/I&gt;&lt;/U&gt; ====

*&lt;U&gt; Communities of Practice (CoP) &lt;/U&gt;

Communities of Practice is widely adopted in Company A, targeting to gather a group of employees to share knowledge regarding certain subject matters. Learning Communities (LC) is established for members with particular domain to join together to share knowledge or resources concerning that domain. Experience sharing session is also organizaed in order to invite experienced staff to share their experience to junior staff.

*&lt;U&gt; Recognition Ceremony &lt;/U&gt;

Company A launches recognition ceremony as a rewards and recognition to employees so as to recognize contribution from knowledge contributors, including LC participants, AAR participants, KM coordinators and subject experts.

*&lt;U&gt; K Seminar &lt;/U&gt;

K Seminar is held to invite external professionals from other utilities or organization to share knowledge regarding certain specialized topics. For example, electric power enterprises from other countries like Japan or India, or even local public transport company.

*&lt;U&gt; KM Ambassador &lt;/U&gt;

Company A assigns several KM ambassadors in each department, whose job is to facilitate knowledge management in that department. Knowledge elicitation workshop is held regularly such that training is provided for KM ambassadors to assist them in putting forward different KM solutions, as well as identifying appropriate knowledge to be collected in the next stage and evaluating existing KM strategies.
&lt;br /&gt;

== Finding and Analysis ==

=== Evaluation of KM tools &amp; strategies ===
The assessment methods by Becerrs-Fernandes and Sabherwal (2010) and Alavi and Leidner (2001) is applied in this part for evaluation the KM tools and Strategies in Company A. The methods included 2 aspects: KM impacts and organizational impacts.

&lt;U&gt; Aspect 1: KM impacts – Impacts on KM processes &lt;/U&gt;

[[File:7. KM Assessment on KM Processes (Becerrs-Fernandes &amp; Sabherwal, 2010).png|center|thumb|600px|Figure 7: KM Assessment on KM processes (Becerrs-Fernandes &amp; Sabherwal, 2010)]]

4 processes are taken for assessment, namely knowledge discovery, capture, sharing and application (Figure 7).

&lt;U&gt; Aspect 2: Organizational impacts &lt;/U&gt;

[[File:8. KM Assessment on Organization Processes (Becerrs-Fernandes &amp; Sabherwal, 2010; Alavi &amp; Leidner, 2001).png|center|thumb|600px|Figure 8: KM Assessment on Organization Processes (Becerrs-Fernandes &amp; Sabherwal, 2010; Alavi &amp; Leidner, 2001)]]

To see the effectiveness or influence of knowledge management practice, it could be evaluated through measuring its impacts on the organization as a whole. According to Alavi and Leidner (2001), knowledge management practice would affect the employees (process of learning and adaptability), organization processes (improvement on effectiveness and efficiency), organization products (introduction of value-added products) as well as organization performances (development of competitive advantages). At the same time, people would further affect products while processes would have influences on organizational performance (Figure 8).

==== Technology &amp; Process ====
&lt;B&gt;&lt;U&gt; 1. Knowledge Capture and Creation &lt;/B&gt;&lt;/U&gt;

Elicitation interviews and video development are constructive to Company A as they are the important steps for knowledge discovery, creation and capture. Somehow, they are like the keys so build up a good knowledge base. Without them, knowledge would not be generated for storage. Employee learning is stimulated as a result of having this elicitation tools since they hugely increase the staff’s awareness towards knowledge discovery and capture. Moreover, comprehensive procedures for conducting elicitation interviews and video development is well-written, enhancing the efficiency of the whole company in capturing knowledge.

KM tools in the company like taxonomy and EDMS are successful as they greatly enhance the effectiveness and efficiency in Company A, since knowledge and documents are systematically arranged and stored. Taxonomy is useful such that it helps increase the average number of annual hits in the document repository by facilitating staff to manage and find suitable documents, as well as uploading sharing materials. Powerful content management also enables the company to streamline certain operation processes, say, spending less time on sending out document requests to other staff for getting certain documents, as all the documents are put on EDMS. Besides, taxonomy can allow employees to look for information or knowledge easier in order to generate reports faster, as well as saving time for searching certain knowledge, since knowledge are arranged in a structured way such that staff can locate the needed knowledge easily. All these contribute to higher overall efficiency.

Unfortunately, there is big problem in launching these KM initiatives: Employees are generally reluctant to use these tools as they generally see these KM tools are time-consuming. This problem is particularly serious in the case of AAR meeting, the KM initiative with the least participants; since it is always difficult to gather a group of experts for discussion when they have finish certain project milestone or when their working hour have ended. Indeed, engaging in these KM strategies take up a rather longer time for staff, say, they have to spend time on completing the AAR template or preparing interviews or video editing etc. But, if the company can let the employees understand that the company actually emphasis employees to share knowledge and eventually, change the attitude of the employees, it would gradually increase the participation rate in those KM initiatives.

&lt;B&gt;&lt;U&gt; 2. Knowledge Sharing and Dissemination &lt;/B&gt;&lt;/U&gt;
Practices of communication and collaboration of knowledge could easily be observed in Company A. The company has ranges of practices of knowledge sharing and dissemination which are effective to promote knowledge management in the entire company. They include one-way communication as well as interactive communication.

Members within the organization could access to the information or knowledge that captured by the organization’s effort. And it would link to knowledge acquisition and application for further use of the knowledge created. As the middle step of knowledge management practice, the company performs quite well in this area. The company has done the practice of knowledge sharing and dissemination in a high extent to arouse the awareness of knowledge management among junior employees and senior staff as well. 

The unique K E-Quiz demonstrates the efforts put in gathering questions (knowledge). It is so unique that even some large corporates like MTR and Police Force do not have such questioning system or activities for internal members. This unique feature shows that the company is highly willing to put resources to develop the most high-end knowledge sharing system.

The K Newsletter regularly arouses the interest of employees towards different kinds but related knowledge which in turn improves the employee learning. The response rate is high since there are rewards for high participation record. This practice is common for many well established corporates to share knowledge or opinions regularly. Suggested by Dalkir (2011), this one-way regular knowledge sharing approach is only useful when organization members are engaged in reading the newsletter shared by other staff. However, this practice reflects the well-being of business practice to competitors as it shows the sufficient knowledge storage and resources put in knowledge management. It also lets the employees know the most recent performance or activities of the entire organization. Sometimes, promotion of certain events and compliments for some employees would also be shown in this newsletter.

Job satisfaction is also enhanced as senior staff has a platform to share their valuable working experiences to the juniors. According to Wagner (2004), the introduction of Wikis brings convenience to every internet user to share knowledge in a more leisure manner. Employees of the company have free access to this collaborative platform to share what they know, without much restriction. This collaborative tool bring great effect to the entire company. 

Similar to Wikis, KM Blog encourages the knowledge sharing among internal staff. Even they do not know each other, they could easily gain the knowledge shared by others. The flow of knowledge within the company improves the innovativeness of different staff after learning others’ knowledge and it could bring eventual advantages to the company. It is more likely for senior staff to share their knowledge or even opinions or life experiences in KM Blog. The blog is useful in terms of free sharing. According to the manager, in the past, there were less interactions between senior and junior staff, let alone across departments’ interaction. With KM Blog, everyone could read the sharing post or conference video recordings freely which could in turn strengthen relationship among staff while effectively sharing knowledge. 

The K Portal serves as the backbone of the whole knowledge sharing and dissemination system. With the advanced single entry point, staff could browse the online resources (knowledge) effortlessly without much searching time, which enhances the efficiency of the whole process and leads to high level of user-friendliness. It does not only contain the internal resources but also the hyperlinks for other online useful resources. The SharePoint site is another knowledge sharing platform, which is not the same as Wikis mentioned above, as it is the knowledge asset of the company. The comprehensive and centralized database includes the catalogs of ranges of knowledge that is also very convenient for users to browse.

However, some recorded drawbacks are found. There is no incentive or effective encouragement for staff to participate more in the entire knowledge sharing system. The only attraction is the reward system of the E-Quiz, which brings high cost to the department. The participation rate will drop significantly after removing the reward system. Moreover, the knowledge in K Newsletter lacks in-depth analysis since it should avoid knowledge leakage to the competitors, which harms the competitive advantages, and it would affect the organization performance as a whole. When the knowledge is not deep enough, staff may lose interest in it since the knowledge shared never surprises them.

&lt;B&gt;&lt;U&gt; 3. Knowledge Acquisition and Application &lt;/B&gt;&lt;/U&gt;

According to Wen, Chen and Pao (2008), with the help of AI technologies, knowledge management decision support system provides efficient solution for decision making and managing electronic business. Moreover, it can automatically evaluate accurate action or alternatives solution when a new knowledge is introduced. The decision support system improves financial management by using a neural network for predication the future financial measures. 

Decision-support system in Company A is well organized since it improves effectiveness, efficiency and the overall performance in organization. Increasing use of decision-support system can foster knowledge discovery and application and at the same time, helping managers to make quicker rational and even-handed decisions, through using the database and data mining technologies behind. Organizational process is enhanced through boosting the employees’ degree of innovation in the company, since the system can help staff to produce creative solutions for problem. Organizational products can also be refined by advancement of value-added products. Employee learning is encouraged by learning from prior experience of former employee. 

However, same as the previous KM tools, there is very few staff updates the knowledge assets since it is not too popular to use it in daily routine.

==== People ====
&lt;B&gt;&lt;U&gt; Strategies fostering sharing cultures &lt;/B&gt;&lt;/U&gt; 

In Company A, KM tools applied is common, e.g. CoP and K Seminar; on the other hand, tools like recognition ceremony and KM ambassador is rather special to certain extent.

To KM processes, tools like CoP and K Seminar are efficient in fostering knowledge discovery and capture, which in turn encourage employee learning via socialization (i.e. transfer tacit knowledge to tacit knowledge). With better employee learning, intellectual capital can be enhanced as human capital is improved as a result of better skills and competencies of Company A’s personnel. Besides, innovativeness increase in Company A when employees gather together to look for solution. For instance, it is found that CoP actually helps the company in producing value-added products e.g. automatic fault location system, which aims at identifying the most probable fault locations in a fast and accurate way.

At the same time, by offering rewards in recognition ceremony or some other small gifts as incentives, sharing culture is cultivated in a long run and this is important for knowledge sharing. On the other hand, employee adaptability is increased since those tools greatly encourage staff to adopt change of culture and be more prepared to respond to change (i.e. changing from a traditional to a rather open sharing culture). All these can generally increase the collaborative climate in the company and make Company A a learning organization.

However, there are still some reasons which lowers the effectiveness of the KM tools. Since most of the incentive are intangible, and employees are not too keen on getting those recognition, as times go on, they become less willing to share knowledge or join any CoP. One more hidden reason is that, those recognition do not help promotion or bring any actual benefits to them. Besides, most of the employees are afraid that they might get replaced if they have poured out all the knowledge they have in their brain. This indicates the problem of trust in Company A and eventually, affect the effectiveness of KM tools originally planned to foster sharing culture.

==== Overall evaluation ====
&lt;I&gt; Knowledge Management Metrics (Brown, 2010)&lt;/I&gt;
To evaluate KM strategies in a more systematic way, Bose (2004) suggested that effective implementation of a right KM strategy for a knowledge-based company is seen as a compulsory circumstance of success for organizations because they enter the era of the knowledge economy. However, there is not much standardized KM metrics for evaluating the effectiveness of certain KM strategies (Fairchild, 2002).

In order to quantify knowledge and convince the stakeholders of KM implantation, Brown suggested “Knowledge Management Metrics” to evaluate KM. In his metrics, 4 types of measurement listed should be taken to evaluate the effectiveness of the KM strategies, which are awareness, behavior, outputs and outcomes (Figure 9).

[[File:9. Knowledge Management Metrics (Brown, 2010).png|center|thumb|600px|Figure 9: Knowledge Management Metrics (Brown, 2010)]]
 
Awareness means the access to documented knowledge as well as database; behavior refers to the participation level of organization member in KM activities; outputs is defined as the creation of database or any physical or digital storage of knowledge; outcomes is the influence of knowledge towards organization performance in terms of cost, revenue or other economic concerns.  
This model is used to analyze the overall performance of KM in Company A.

&lt;I&gt; Evaluation of Company A &lt;/I&gt;
Company A develops quite a comprehensive knowledge management system. Its components include knowledge capture and creation, knowledge sharing and dissemination as well as knowledge acquisition and application. The entire system is decided to capture and store the knowledge for internal staff’s use. Company A is the pioneer in Hong Kong which actively puts resources in the development of KM.

Four measurements suggested by Brown (2010) are useful to evaluate the how knowledge management practices in the company function and its corresponding impacts: 
In terms of arousing employees’ awareness of the knowledge management and knowledge sharing, the company performs well. A number of activities, namely After Action Review (AAR), K Newsletters and introduction of several systems (e.g. Intelligence Decision Making System and Knowledge Portal), provide employees with the detailed information about the knowledge captured. Employees across departments develop the sense of involvement and importance of knowledge management practice, which in turn benefits the KM development of the company as a whole. 

The second aspect regarding behavior of the measurements shows that there is high participation of the knowledge management process. Elicitation interview and recognition ceremony are two of decent examples showing different levels of employees could participate in knowledge sharing events at the same time. Making presentation in K Seminar by inviting external professional guests to have sharing sections on particular subjects also encourage high participation rate of staff in different departments. 

Outputs of the knowledge metrics can also be found in the company. Practical implementations like database creation (e.g. Electronic Document Management System and the centralized database in SharePoint Site) are the visible “outputs” for the KM practice. There are also thousands of pieces of learned reports of reference and best practices about the knowledge shared by different staff.  

However, Company A does not perform well in terms of outcomes. The overall knowledge management implementation does not focus on the improvement of organization performance. It is hardly to find that there is significant impact of KM to the new product sales, productivity or other related aspects. It could attribute to the business nature of the utility company that its business model would not change from time to time frequently.

All in all, Company A in general performs well in introducing knowledge management to the entire company. By referencing the index with four types of measurement suggested by Brown (2010, the company performs well in three specific areas which are arousing company members’ awareness, encouraging behavior and creating outputs. More than ten KM practices cover those three aspects to enhance the KM environment in the company. There are several minor drawbacks of implementation of each KM tool or technique, namely low participation rate on KM Blog, and the overall ineffectiveness of improving organization performance.

=== Recommendations ===
After evaluating the KM strategies applied in Company A, we found that there is still a need for further improvement in order to raise the effectiveness. Hence, two recommendations are suggested to ease the obstacles that the company faces when implementing the KM initiatives.

Collison and Parcell (2004) states that KM is a hybrid discipline which consists of people, technology and the process elements. Nowadays, drain of professional knowledge is the main reason that why Company A has to establish KM climate. Therefore, the effectiveness of KM strategies should be improved by those three aspects mentioned by Collison and Parcell. In this case, only the people and technology aspects will be focused.

&lt;I&gt;&lt;U&gt;People: Compulsory participation in KM activities &lt;/I&gt;&lt;/U&gt;

Refer to the Company A’s KM manager, awareness of senior staff to share knowledge is rather low. Although the junior staff are more likely to involve in the KM aspect, knowledge sources (e.g. experiences to deal with the serious electricity incidents) actually come from the senior employees. However, senior staff passively take part in KM such that they are not frequently involved in the Wikis or KM Blog (e.g. not browsed or updated frequently). At the same time, new staff movement trend (i.e. more resignation and retirement) directly leads to knowledge drain within Company A, making the company suffer from insufficient high qualifications’ personnel. Nowadays, it typically needs more than ten years to develop a qualified engineer or inspector for this field in Hong Kong. However, there are less young people willing to enter such a professional sector, which is the second reason leading to knowledge drainage.

To solve the problem, people who know and who need to know should be connected (Collison &amp; Parcell, 2004). It is recommended that Company A can put KM as compulsory activity for all employees to take part in exchanging knowledge and experiences with others. For example, current staff are compulsory required to attend the seminars or focus groups regularly. Staff resigned are also expected to upload all document they produced such as working procedures or guidelines (e.g. procedures of dealing with customer complaints) or AAR template to SharePoint, so as to facilitate the hand over process before they leave. In order to generate greater outcome, Company A can even include KM under job specifications, making taking part in KM an obligation and responsibility for all employees. Because of the restricted working duty and guidelines, KM becomes part of their daily work and employees are compulsory to participate in some indicated KM activities according to their positions.

Compulsory experiences sharing session is recommended in order to foster the general sharing culture in Company A. Currently, participation rate of sharing session is low as the company do not make it a must for all employee. However, if it is made compulsory as part of their working scope, it can greatly increase the participants. Moreover, employees are only required to capture or share opinions in an easier way (e.g. face-to-face chatting), but not to do many extra work like keep updating the blogs or forums, or documentation work.

Jie, Gang and Xin (2010) stated that skills and experiences exist in employee brain in the form of implicit knowledge. This part of knowledge is crucial to utility enterprises like Company A. Therefore, adjusting the employees’ working scope, which means including KM as their daily task, can facilitate the knowledge sharing process. With this practice, both critical tacit and explicit knowledge from the experienced employees can be retained for the next generation more efficiently. Employees can also learn from previous experiences, which assist them in decision making as well.

&lt;I&gt;&lt;U&gt; Technology: Enhance platforms for knowledge sharing &lt;/I&gt;&lt;/U&gt;

Hasan and Crawford (2003) pointed out that informationization makes electric power enterprises accumulate a lot of data and those enterprises begin to have the awareness of selecting useful knowledge from messy data and making the best of the data, meaning those enterprises start their knowledge management times. Staff wish to obtain more data so as to assist business decision-making in utility enterprises like Company A, and the wide and better use of information technology makes it possible.

The existing online K platforms in Company A do not perform very well as expected. It is found that the user interface of SharePoint is rather complicated and mass information is still messy. Even though documents are categorized according to different knowledge domains, document versioning problem still exist, making staff confused and hard to find the most suitable documents. Because of this, staff are reluctant to use the system. This technical problem badly affect the smoothness of knowledge acquisition and application process.

As mentioned, all KM tools and strategies can be classified into 3 categories (Dalkir, 2011). Company A has put much effort to develop different strategies under the first two categories (i.e. knowledge capture and creation, as well as knowledge sharing and dissemination). However, the third one (i.e. knowledge acquisition and application) has not done enough.

Polprasert (2011) pointed out that making use of the learning technologies can facilitate KM processes. Collison and Parcell (2004) also stated that a common and reliable technology infrastructure can benefit to information sharing among people. Therefore, it is advised to enhance the supporting technologies for the existing online knowledge repository like portal and Wikis, which are related to the third category, in order to provide a better learning channel for employees and at the same time, capture their professional knowledge. E-learning and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies in the K platforms can be enforced by improving computer-based learning technology (CBT) and intelligent filtering tools.

With computer-based learning technology, better e-learning environment can be provided for staff, since online tutorials (e.g. tutorial on guiding users to locate relevant information) are available, making it possible to deliver courses of certain domains via company intranet. Besides, AI technologies like intelligent filtering tools is an autonomous computer program which assists users and acts on his or her behalf. For example, watcher agents can help staff to handle mass information effectively.

Carroll and Tansey (2002) indicated that most industries need different technologies to raise efficiency of their work. Especially in utility enterprise like Company A, their unique and specific knowledge like engineering experiences (e.g. electricity network) or product detailed information (e.g. features about transformers) should be located in a reliable, well-structured and accessible common area for internal employees. Therefore, it is convinced that those practices suggested can help Company A to establish a more powerful and collaborative platform for accessing knowledge and employee learning, which in turn facilitates the KM cycle in a more comprehensive way and eases the problem of low usage in K-platforms.

Due to the uniqueness of the business nature (there is only one direct competitor of Company A in Hong Kong), Company A cannot rely on other means (e.g. public internet) or organizations (e.g. other industry area) to gain relevant knowledge about electric power issues. In light of this, it has to develop and manage the sole knowledge assets by itself. The two above suggestions can surely raise the effectiveness of KM strategies within Company A in a long run, by removing the obstacles that it faces while implementing those measures.

== Conclusions ==
In this technology era, increasing number of business is turning into knowledge-based. The importance of managing knowledge within an organization has significantly and obviously increased. For the organization or company in the knowledge-intensive industry, the need of effective knowledge management is indispensable. The utility company investigated in this report is exactly in this kind of industry, which relies heavily on much knowledge to sustain the whole business.  

With over a century of experience serving Hong Kong for electricity provision, the utility company generates and creates countless unique knowledge regarding electricity generation as well as transmission and distribution network. The concerns of implementing KM are the difficulties of outsourcing the business as well as preparing for knowledge drain. The unique business model generates and creates numerous of valuable knowledge that requires knowledge capture. The implementation directly refers to the KM tools and strategies used, for instance, After Action Review is the “tool” of content creation and Taxonomy of document repository and layout is the strategy for the content management. After creating and capture the knowledge, the utility company carries out knowledge sharing and dissemination by holding an Knowledge E-Quiz reward system, SharePoint site and so forth. The knowledge is “flown” to the employees across different departments. The lowered boundary of knowledge sharing access promotes a positive atmosphere of knowledge sharing, hence knowledge management practices. The last step of KM process is the knowledge acquisition and application. Thanks to the effective KM, the Intelligence Decision Making System is made for creating different systems to cater different and specific needs. The company sees people as the important and determine factor to the KM success. Communities of Practice (CoP) and K Seminar are held so as to provide platforms for employees to have real-time knowledge sharing and more concreted experiences of KM implementation.

Generally speaking, the utility company does well in KM implementation of the aspects mentioned above. The examples include the successful stimulation to staff’s awareness to KM by elicitation interviews. The taxonomy and EDMS also help with enhancing effectiveness and efficiency of company because of the systematic storage of ranges of important knowledge. In other words, employees have easier access to knowledge for any formal or informal use which benefits the company as a whole. For communicating and collaborating of knowledge, the practices of publishing regular K Newsletter and setting KM blog allow employee to participate in this stage through a number of means. They enhance the KM awareness while bring job satisfaction the senior staff since they have several platforms to share their invaluable experiences to the juniors. The communication goes well because of the contribution of knowledge capture and creation. Employees have the chances to explore diverse knowledge regardless of their domains which effectively broaden their horizons. The last stage of the entire KM process can be seen by the successful invention of Decision-support System, which processes the knowledge and information captured in a systematic way to help company to carry out effective decision-making. There is still some drawback of such implementation and it is commonly found in other organization. Since the company does not set the practice of KM participation as compulsory work, the participation rate of not satisfied. 

The overall evaluation of the whole KM implantation is done by referencing the knowledge management metrics suggested by Brown. In terms of awareness, behavior and outputs, the utility company performs satisfactorily. There is room for desire for the level of facilitation in outcomes (organizational performance), since it is hard to significantly improve the company practice immediately after the KM implementation. 

Last but not last, it is suggested that compulsory participation in KM activities could bring benefits to the company in terms of higher participation rate of knowledge sharing and more knowledge would be generated. The second recommendation is related to technology that makes enhancement on the knowledge sharing platforms. It could be the interface of SharePoint site, E-learning and artificial intelligence (AI) technology for enhancing computer-based learning.

== Acknowledgements ==
We have to express our heartfelt gratitude to the KM manager in Company for his kindliness of accepting our interview request. Useful information were given to help us walk through all the stages of writing this report.

Nevertheless, we are also greatly indebted to Dr. Samuel Chu, for his encouragement and guidance. Without his precious information and insights towards the project, the report could not have reached its present form.

      <text xml:space="preserve">:: '''If you are planning to edit this,''' &lt;u&gt;please read [[/Chapter 0: Preface | the Preface]]&lt;/u&gt;: it describes the history of editorial disputes on Wikipedia that resulted in this becoming a Wikibook in order to maintain its completeness.

'''This book resulted from changes that were rejected''' to Wikipedia's [[Wikipedia:List of Tor hidden services]]. In this original author's opinion the article has virtually no verifiable content without these changes (which included adding Tor sites as primary sources about themselves), as the article lacked (and may still lack) any other sources, but they were rejected by other editors because they (and material about Tor in general) '''can &lt;u&gt;virtually never&lt;/u&gt; satisfy Wikipedia's guidelines for reliability and notability'''. For reasons why, and the background and history of the editorial dispute that took place in general, see [[/Chapter 0: Preface | the Preface]].

:: '''IMPORTANT NOTE:''' &lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;Editorial comments made by '''individual people (such as me,''' whether or not I am the original author) '''should be written in &lt;u&gt;purple font&lt;/u&gt;''' like this (using the HTML font color tag, see the Wikitext for an example) '''in order for them to be distinguished from the text of the book.'''

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{status|0%}}{{DISPLAYTITLE:Computational Thinking, Problem-Solving, and Programming}}
Computer science is sometimes defined as the study of algorithms and their efficient implementation in a computer. The focus now is their role in problem solving, strategies for developing the, techniques for following and testing them. Because algorithms operate on data, we examine ways to structure data so that it can be more efficiently processed. 
== General principles ==
=== Thinking procedurally ===
{{IB_Computer_Science/Statement|4.1.1|Identify the procedure appropriate to solving a problem.}}
Generally speaking, all problems begin with an idea. Finding the connection between this information and the solution lies at the heart of problem solving. To do this, the following strategies can be utilised.

==== Ask questions ====
When given a problem or task verbally, one typically asks questions until what is needed is known fully and clear. Generally, when, why, and where are asked until the task is completely specified. If the instructions are written, one might put question marks in the margin; underline a word, a group of words, or a sentence; or in some other way indicate the parts of the task that are not clear. Perhaps the questions might be answered in a later paragraph, or one might have to discus them with the person giving the task. If the task is one that it self-set, this sort of questioning might not be verbal, but instead takes place on the subconscious level.

In this case, some typical questions that one should consider are:

* What should I know about the problem?
* What does the solution look like?
* What sort of special cases exist?
* How will I recognise that I have found the solution?

==== Look for familiar things ====
{{IB_Computer_Science/Statement|4.1.2|Evaluate whether the order in which activities are undertaken will result in the required outcome.}}
We constantly break up a large problem into smaller units that we can handle. The task of cleaning the house or apartment may seem over-whelming. The task composed of cleaning the living room, the dining room, the kitchen, the bedrooms, and the bathroom seems more manageable. This principle is especially relevant to computing.

{{IB_Computer_Science/Statement|4.1.3|Explain the role of sub-procedures in solving a problem.}}

Do not reinvent the wheel. If a solution exists, use it. If you have solved the same or a similar problem before, just repeat the successful solution. We usually do not consciously think, &quot;I have seen this before, and I know what to do&quot; - we just do it. Humans are good at recognising similar situations. We do not have to learn how to go to the store and buy milk, then to buy eggs, then to buy candy. We know that going to the store is always the same and only what we buy is different.

Recognising familiar situations is particularly useful in computing. In computing, you see certain problems again and again in different guises. A good programmer sees a task, or perhaps part of a task (a subtask), that has been solved before and plugs in the solution. For example, finding daily high and low temperatures in a list of temperatures is exactly the same problem as finding the highest and lowest grades in a list of test scores. You want to the largest and smallest values in a set of numbers.

=== Thinking logically ===
{{IB_Computer_Science/Statement|4.1.4|Identify when decision-making is required in a specified situation.}}
{{IB_Computer_Science/Statement|4.1.5|Identify the decisions required for the solution to a specified problem.}}
{{IB_Computer_Science/Statement|4.1.6|Identify the condition associated with a given decision in a specified problem.}}
{{IB_Computer_Science/Statement|4.1.7|Explain the relationship between the decisions and conditions of a system.}}
{{IB_Computer_Science/Statement|4.1.8|Deduce logical rules for real-world situations.}}

=== Thinking ahead ===		 
{{IB_Computer_Science/Statement|4.1.9|Identify the inputs and outputs required in a solution.}}
{{IB_Computer_Science/Statement|4.1.10|Identify pre-planning in a suggested problem and solution.}}
{{IB_Computer_Science/Statement|4.1.11|Explain the need for pre-conditions when executing an algorithm.}}
{{IB_Computer_Science/Statement|4.1.12|Outline the pre- and post-conditions to a specified problem.}}
{{IB_Computer_Science/Statement|4.1.13|Identify exceptions that need to be considered in a specified problem solution.}}

=== Thinking concurrently === 		 
{{IB_Computer_Science/Statement|4.1.14|Identify the parts of a solution that could be implemented concurrently.}}
{{IB_Computer_Science/Statement|4.1.15|Describe how concurrent processing can be used to solve a problem.}}
{{IB_Computer_Science/Statement|4.1.16|Evaluate the decision to use concurrent processing in solving a problem.}}

Concurrent processing allows for faster computation, as multiple tasks are run simultaneously. However, concurrent processing is a lot more difficult to program.

=== Thinking abstractly === 		 
{{IB_Computer_Science/Statement|4.1.17|Identify examples of abstraction.}}
{{IB_Computer_Science/Statement|4.1.18|Explain why abstraction is required in the derivation of computational solutions for a specified situation.}}
﻿{{IB_Computer_Science/Statement|4.1.19|Construct an abstraction from a specified situation.}}
{{IB_Computer_Science/Statement|4.1.20|Distinguish between a real-world entity and its abstraction.}}

== Connecting computational thinking and program design ==
=== Searching algorithms ===
==== Sequential search ====

﻿{{IB_Computer_Science/Statement|4.2.1|Describe the characteristics of standard algorithms on linear arrays.}}
There are numerous algorithms that exist in the realm of computer science, however, sorting and searching are two of the most important types. 

Sequential, or linear, search is the simplest search algorithm; it is a special case of brute-force search. Its worst case cost is proportional to the number of elements in the list; and so is its expected cost, if all list elements are equally likely to be searched for. Therefore, if the list has more than a few elements, other methods (such as binary search or hashing) will be faster, but they also impose additional requirements.

'''Binary Search'''

This relies upon the linear array being sorted into order. Assume we want to find X.
# Start at the middle element.
# Is X greater than or equal to that element?
# If yes, remove all lower than that from the population.
# Move to the middle of the new population and repeat.
Note the 'middle' is always the larger element when you have an even set.

'''Bubble Sort'''

Assuming we are sorting a list of numbers from lowest to highest.
# Starting from the left, compare that number X to the one on its right Y.
# Ix X&gt;Y then swap X and Y around.
# Repeat through the entire list.
# Repeat whole process until nothing needs to switch on a full pass through.

'''Selection Sort'''

&lt;!-- A data type is a set of values and the basic operations that can be applied to values of that type. An abstract data type, therefore, is a data type whose properties (data and operations) are specified independently of any particular implementation. Remember that the goal in design is to reduce complexity through abstraction. If one can define useful struyctures and the operations that manipulate them at the logical level, one can use them as if they exist when needed in their designs. --&gt;

{{IB/Group_4/Computer_Science/Object-Oriented_Programming_Languages}}
Object-oriented design is another way of looking at the design process, which views a program from the standpoint of data rather than tasks. Because the functionality associated with this design process is often incorporated into high-level programming languages, we need to understand this design process before looking at specific high-level languages.

This book which you created has been queried for a few reasons:
* the book isn't categorized meaning other people won't be able to find it easily.
* the book contains no pages and is very long.  The title suggests it is the front page of the book and should therefore lead onto the other pages of the book.  This page should be split into several different pages.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{FUN-top|both=s|IT=}}
==DLS Overview==
The '''Download Station'''&amp;mdash;or more commonly the '''DLS''' '''{{plain link|https://www.auran.com/TRS2004/DLS.php|(DLS Web Link)}}'''&amp;mdash;is N3V Game's public repository&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;N3V's Zec Murphy has stated officially the web page access is not supported for more recent releases of Trainz, but it works and many of us choose to use it's graphical browsing and expanded information to shop for assets to download.&lt;/ref&gt;) of 3rd-party custom Trainz assets created and shared by other Trainzers ('{{TL|Content Creators}}') in the world wide community. 
&amp;nbsp;
The DLS was instituted late in the {{TL|Trainz 1.3}}&amp;mdash;{{TL|Trainz UTC}} era (versions v1.3&amp;ndash;v1.5) with the user community wanting an easier means of sharing {{TL|CDP file}}s, very early in the history of Trainz releases (2000&amp;mdash;2003, when it's initial website took on much of it's current form and function. By the release of TRS2004, the so called ''''''Black Pages'''''' website was up and running with T'04 providing primitive file management and interfacing using a suite of individual Windows EXE files. During those early years of explosive Trainz growth, it's library of assets swelled from a few hundred assets well into the thousands.

&amp;nbsp;
The number of assets available for download in July 2013 numbers over 2,500 routes and 270,000 assets overall, but varies by the trainz-build version of the users Trainz installation (older Trainz can access less, and are blocked from more recent higher trainz-build number assets for the newer may use technologies unknown to the older). Then again there are assets which are functional duplicates of previous versions, dutifully updated using the Trainz {{TG|K|KUID}} and KUID2 system of version tracking and management, and those cut the count down since they obsolete prior releases. Similarly, assets with entries in the {{TBS|obsolete-table}}s also diminish the total count of assets, but whatever the ever changing usable total may be (''{{plain link|http://forums.auran.com/trainz/forumdisplay.php?20-Freeware-Announcements|as this forum thread shows, more are added daily}}''). In Trainz, no one can say there is a poor selection of alternative assets!
&amp;nbsp;
===Foundation knowledge on 3rd Party sourcing===
It is said that Trainz would not exist without the Download Station and the communities willingness from the earliest pre-Beta Test days to share content. Until recently, any registered Trainz user may upload their home-built content and/or download content made by others using the cloud based facility. 
{{TrainzTip|Most of such content is quite good, but alas, there have been many items uploaded by novice content creators which fail the sniff test as well. Now days any budding content creator prematurely uploading an experimental asset that lacks professional qualities is likely to hear about it in vociferous and discouraging ways!
* They'll also likely receive coaching and help in upgrading it to acceptable standards, unless they're an offputting and abrasive personality&amp;mdash;who's content will be shunned until they mature a bit and adapt to accept constructive criticisms gracefully.}} 
Overall, content creators are beloved, so support and encouragement and help will be found on the forums&amp;mdash;so the harsh words of a few trolls, should be given the attention they deserve. Ignore them.
&amp;nbsp;
====The New reality==== 
In recent years policy on uploading has been belatedly changed to vett and pre-error-check uploaded content in an attempt to weed out assets made to older technology standards, ensure only legal tag names (key words) and newer data types and data structures are incorporated, and an asset is complete as well as has all dependencies on the DLS. These are all good things, but N3V Games has also begun to limit uploading by {{TBS|trainz-build tag}}s, which has created more than a little friction with the user community. Some of that vetting (the forcing of new uploads to the latest {{TBS|trainz-build}} is both unnecessary and unwise, but the N3V reputation for stubbornness is well deserved, so getting them to provide a path for'' 'functionally just fixing' ''an older asset so it works with all releases seems less likely than a snowball's chances to make it out of hell.'' 'Them's with the gold, makes the rulez', ''it is said in an old folk bit of wisdom, and unfortunately, many a good content creator has quit producing assets or uploading new goodies as a result. 
{{TrainzTip|BG=white|The later circumstance is probably an unresolvable problem, as only the asset creator may upload an asset or update it, and many for philosophical reasons choose to not lend their efforts to be freely shared on the DLS.
*'''Bookmark me! {{plain link|http://www.trainzkuidindex.com/|This link attempts to list all known Trainz fansites}}''', most are content providing and hosting sites provided for the occasional need to locate a asset missing on the DLS to get that new route or session up and running.
}} 

Their programmer's created the compatibility issues, but won't own the responsibility for them by ''auto-translating during pre-processing'' when necessary&amp;mdash;a particularly unprofessional attitude in the staff supporting a data base product. Historically, over 90% of software programming involves such compatibility programming, but since it's'' 'boring code maintenance' ''N3Vs programmer's have gotten away with it by citing their small size and numbers.
===De-Trainzing===
Others content creators have left Trainz or digital trains modeling for various reasons (including passing-away, or those'' 'going over to the darkside' ''&amp;mdash;now modeling for a competitor product) and others don't feel an obligation to perpetually update assets they authored a decade or more ago. It must be understood, Auran was already a successful mid-size game company when it undertook Trainz' development in 1998, but by 2006 they were almost totally focused on the expensive development of a {{wp|N3V Games|MMORPG based game that totally flopped}}, and left Auran in bankruptcy proceedings selling off pieces, laying off nearly every employee and badly needing rescue cash from N3V Games. That event was tramatic and spawn many fan-sites in order to protect the Trainz community from the loss of the DLS and forums. After six weeks, the servers came back on line, but to this day, many an long-time Trainzer content creator hedges his bets with fan-site hosted content that takes it's time wending it's way onto the DLS. N3V's policies continue to tick people off even today, so politics and preference enter the motivations.

Hence even when a creator now wants to upload assets he once hosted personally on a fan site, he'd have to update them just to patch the missing asset a route has called for. Many of these, especially the older retirees who fueled Trainz early explosive growth in asset wealth have no real interest in a newer Trainz release, nor mounting the learning curves of converting things to the newer technologies since incorporating updates on the DLS to advance older (still working digital) models to the minimum trainz-build level now demanded by N3V requires expending $$resources to comply. While often friendly to users making enquiries, those folks have put Trainz into a past chapter of their lives. 
{{TrainzTip|BG=white| 1='''New User Tip''' Missing assets with an updated form. 
Assets meeting this condition is also a source of confusion in operating CM, for a missing asset might have a more updated {{TL|KUIDs|kuid}} on the DLS and Content Manager will flag the obsolete asset as a missing dependency&amp;mdash;a check by author will show the updated version (a kuid2 or another replacement kuid with an {{TBS|obsolete-table}}  while CM is just looking at the initial kuid, a minor bug, but as true for CMP as for CMP-3.x!). Once downloaded, the replacement/upgraded asset can then fill in the dependency association tracking correctly and the dependent asset then can be used. 
*Since once locally downloaded, the condition is cured by the presence of the local updated version, {{BL|the first step in fixing faults should be to check for an updated version of the asset!}} Once that is obtained, the version with the error can be safely deleted, or archived, for from the time a new asset obsoletes an old, CM will know locally to substitute the one for the original. This is the strength of the KUID2 system. It's weakness is CM's don't track every asset by KUID2 encoding. By definition &lt;code&gt;&lt;kuid:abcdef:ghijki&gt; is the same as {{BL|&lt;kuid2:abcdef:ghijki:0&gt;}}&lt;/code&gt; 
}}
&amp;nbsp;
===Those missing assets===
There are many long time Trainzer's who disdain downloading older routes, because it may require fault fixing. Then their are others who disdain newer routes for containing missing assets. In the end, where's their sensible room to complain, you are paying nothing or a pittance for a digital model that took upto 8 man-months to draft, texture and test. 

For the missing assets, there are over 400 other Trainz asset sources {{plain link|http://www.trainzkuidindex.com/|(index and search engine)}} on the web hosting downloadable assets and various nationalistic/linguistic camps &amp;mdash; plus two broad, major, and diametrically opposed philosophies fueling their continuance: &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'''A)''' One camp, knowing the time and effort it takes to make a digital model feels they should receive some monetary compensation for their time, so charge a bit to download same. The extreme end of this group is sites which offer only or at least, almost all, {{wp|payware}}.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'''B)''' Others, feeling the assets should be free and no money-grubbing capitalists should benefit from having their asset in payware (which includes routes released by N3V as part of a release, and some reason as well the revenue stream created for N3V/Auran by the DLS First Class Ticket costs) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'''C)''' Lastly, and to a lesser extent are sites resenting English as the mandatory language for asset names and descriptions, so host in Spanish, German, Russian, or other such languages since translation is time consuming and costly.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
Essentially, since technically all content is intellectual property eligible for copy-write under international law, all groups are within their rights, and begrudging a person who wants paid for their time is absurd. The Auran/N3V DLS upload release agreement essentially asks up-loaders to waive those rights, allowing N3V to use any DLS asset as it sees fit. Since many content creators opposed to payware also feel N3V's use of an item in a route released in a new Trainz version is also payware and deserved monetary compensation, said believers often host their own content on a fan-site. Similarly, use of an asset from a payware site means those folks want paid. N3V on the other hand, selects routes secretly from a group submitted voluntarily from the user community, and given the expense of hosting the forums and DLS servers, customer services, et. al. aren't about to pay anyone much of anything, except partners whom they have contracted with for DLC, payware hosted by N3V at the {{plain link|http://www.simulatorcentral.com/|Simulator Central web-store}}.
 
The unresolvability of the problem is that before dependency checking on uploading (a recent development in the overall time frame), many, perhaps even most, routes and sessions used such proprietary assets, because they are frequently superior or special in some way.}}

Early in the {{TL|TS2009}} era, the N3V Games instituted a controversial policy of only accepting content 'made to' or 'upgraded to' currently supported releases of the software, concurrent with a policy implemented to limit their customer support to such {{N3V|Trainz_Life-Cycle_Policy}} supported versions. This policy is still causing resentment among many an old-time Trainzer. It also effectively enslaves a content creator by demanding ongoing maintenance and upgrades for some favor he did for someone else years ago!

Content on the Download Station had historically shown significant rates of errors or missing dependencies. This is being addressed via the {{N3V|Download_Station_Cleanup|Download Station Cleanup}} initiative, albeit slowly as the program is now nearly five years old. 

In point of fact, many so-called faults or errors in the majority (i.e. scenery assets) have trivial data model evolution caused faults resulting from unwise technical choices based in lazy and inconsiderate programming standards by a small group of young programmers lacking experience in large project politics. &lt;br/&gt;The damning point of fact is the programmer's chose a path easy for them with insufficient consideration of the impact on the ten's of thousands in the customer base. As a pointed and common example, assets which worked fine in pre-TS2009 releases suddenly weren't able to find their own mesh tables despite being located in the same sub-folders that were part of the earlier (actually earliest) Trainz data model standards, when a few more lines of code could have'' 'handled the error' automatically using excerpts of proven TRS2006 software,'' when instead the programmer's chose to force a {{TBS|mesh-table}} or {{TG|T|texture.txt file}} down users throats. Before v2.0 (TRS2004-SP0) Trainz didn't know about mesh-tables. Hence good programming assumptions would have handled such older constructs the same old way as the TRS series of releases.

{{TrainzTip|BG=white|Fact: V1-3 and V1-5 assets usually fail because they assume a more modern structure in the config.txt whilst any considerate programming staff with two or more brain cells would have just written a routine to translate the old style to the new more desired model (from the programmer's point of view) instead of creating a ongoing cancerous issue.&lt;br&gt; A second example is the unecessary elimination of older legal keywords instead of just ignoring the line, N3Vs programmers generate errors if updating the asset beyond version {{TBS|trainz-build}} 2.6.}}

;usage
This template (Mnemonically'' 'Trainz Error' Fixing'') forms an internal link to the [[Trainz]] wikibook, [[Trainz Error Fixing]] volume with parameter &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{{1}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, and incorporates an option to access a sub-sub-page given the optional 3rd default parameter: &lt;code&gt; &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{3}}} &lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; as well allowing for as an optional pretty-link re-title parameter &lt;code&gt;'2' allowing &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{2}}} and/or '|3=sub-page/' &lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; formatted link calls ... all forming the link and all links in the wikimarkup as:&lt;br/&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Trainz/{{{3|}}}{{{1}}}|{{{2|{{{1}}}}}}]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/code&gt;
* Users unfamiliar with wiki-markup parameter parsing, just focus on &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{2}}} or '|2=text' &lt;/nowiki&gt; overriding the presented text of the link, 
* and &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{3}}}/  or '|3=sub-sub-linktext/' &lt;/nowiki&gt; giving a prefix to a sub-sub-page, so &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{3}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;,
: if and when given, &lt;u&gt;MUST HAVE&lt;/u&gt; a trailing '/' to form a proper link.
&amp;nbsp;
&lt;big&gt;&lt;u&gt;Application and operation behavior will be as from the examples below from the related {{tl|TL}} templates&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/big&gt;
'''&lt;u&gt;Example-1, expanded paste down&lt;/u&gt;:'''
:This is because all template default parameters, formally 'numbered parameters' can also be specified like this:
 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{TL
 |1=Tips And Tricks
 |2=Tips
 }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 which wiki-markup language is processed exactly
 the same as &lt;nowiki&gt;{{TL |Tips And Tricks |Tips }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;. 
;caution
When using a template such as this which forms a link, it is best to NOT use spaces between the pipe characters &quot;|&quot; as done for clarity above.
{{TrainzTip|Spaces in the 'pretty-text' part are fine!
}}
'''&lt;u&gt;In-line Examples&lt;/u&gt;:'''
* &lt;nowiki&gt;{{TL|Tips And Tricks}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; links as: 
:::&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Trainz/Tips And Tricks|Tips And Tricks]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and the other formulation: 
:::&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[/Tips And Tricks|Tips And Tricks]] &lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; both would.
:But... is much easier to edit around on a page when trying to get the best prose presentation.

* Similarly: 
:::&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{TL|Tips And Tricks|Tricks}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; links as if the constructs: 
:::&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Trainz/Tips And Tricks|Tricks]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and 
:::&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[/Tips And Tricks|Tricks]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; which is perhaps part of the phrase you want.

* Sub-subpage links will mainly be needed in the forthcoming Errorfixing series of tutorials and the Programmed Instruction (Trainz A-Z) linked progressive tutorials off their own sub-TOC base page. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
:Planned use of Sub-sub-pages... '''Better than splitting the book down the multiple tracks'''... we're going to make ''a lot of new pages'' in the PI tutorials! Whether for beginners or intermediate Trainzers, they'll all end in content creation and other advanced topics like TransDEM map generation anyway.

== Pywikibot wikibook ==

Hello all,

As far as I can see, [[Pywikibot]] seems to basically be an outdated copy of the official docs, and not an actual wikibook. I would like to suggest to remove the pages on wikibooks, as this might cause users to try outdated instructions, and therefore fail. I am not a wikibookean (?), however, and I'm unsure where to suggest this (other than here).

[[User:Valhallasw|Valhallasw]] ([[User talk:Valhallasw|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Valhallasw|contribs]]) 14:00, 9 February 2014 (UTC)
:Do you really want to propose [[:Category:Pywikibot|all these 48 pages]] to [[Wikibooks:Requests for deletion]]?
:On the one hand it could be relevant to avoid doubles between the projects (because it's too long to read, someone often wants to merge, and awful to maintain), but on the other hand we could also propose to download an old Pywikipedia version, compatible with the current sites and our book (without any fork or a small dead end to adjust).
:I don't have a favorite choice, but the second option to keep an old version would have made me saved a few times when I migrated my own scripts on my Windows and my Linux. [[User:JackPotte|JackPotte]] ([[User talk:JackPotte|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JackPotte|contribs]]) 23:17, 9 February 2014 (UTC)

::I think 'removing' was not the word I should have used --- I'd like to make the pages redirects/links to mediawiki.org (if they are copies) or moving them to mw.o (if they do not exist yet). I'm also OK with just adding a banner 'This page may be out of date -- see mw.o for the most up-to-date documentation'.
::Unfortunately, there is no 'old version' that is compatible with the current sites -- the recent HTTPS switch made that impossible. [[User:Valhallasw|Valhallasw]] ([[User talk:Valhallasw|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Valhallasw|contribs]]) 09:12, 10 February 2014 (UTC)

== wikiapps: a revised wiki project proposal ==

{{mbox-side|type=notice|image=Smiley green alien mmm.svg|msg=What are [[m:WikiApps|wikiapps]]?}}
Hi, this is a bit off-topic (but very much related to the wikibook [[Canvas 2D Web Apps]]): I've revised the proposal for a new wiki project called [[m:WikiApps|WikiApps]] on Meta-Wiki to cover a repository of editable, downloadable, open source HTML5 web apps in JavaScript. If you are interested, see the [[m:WikiApps|full description of WikiApps]] on Meta-Wiki for details. --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Martin Kraus|contribs]]) 11:50, 23 February 2014 (UTC)

== Call for project ideas: funding is available for community experiments ==

''I apologize if this message is not in your language. Please help translate it.''

Do you have an idea for a project that could improve your community? [[m:Grants:IEG|Individual Engagement Grants]] from the Wikimedia Foundation help support individuals and small teams to organize experiments for 6 months. You can get funding to try out your idea for online community organizing, outreach, tool-building, or research to help make {{SITENAME}} better. In March, we’re looking for new project proposals. 

Examples of past Individual Engagement Grant projects:
*[[m:Grants:IEG/Build_an_effective_method_of_publicity_in_PRChina|Organizing social media for Chinese Wikipedia]] ($350 for materials) 
*[[m:Grants:IEG/Visual_editor-_gadgets_compatibility|Improving gadgets for Visual Editor]] ($4500 for developers)
*[[m:Grants:IEG/The_Wikipedia_Library|Coordinating access to reliable sources for Wikipedians]] ($7500 for project management, consultants and materials)
*[[m:Grants:IEG/Elaborate_Wikisource_strategic_vision|Building community and strategy for Wikisource]] (€10000 for organizing and travel)

'''[[m:Grants:IEG#ieg-applying|Proposals]] are due by 31 March 2014.''' There are a number of ways to [[m:Grants:IEG|get involved]]! 

Hope to have your participation,

      <comment>Sex as a verb</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The opening paragraph claims that ''sex'' is a noun and a verb.  This is true but the example of the verb is not.  In the phrase ''to have sex'', sex is not a verb.  The only use of sex as a verb would be ''he sexed the puppies shortly after they were born'' or ''the minister was accused of sexing up the document'' (British English).--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Estonia.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 19:34, 3 March 2014 (UTC)</text>

I posted the [[Stuttering]] wikibook in 2007 as a draft of my book &quot;No Miracle Cures.&quot; The book is downloadable for free from my website (http://casafuturatech.com/free-stuttering-e-books), as well as available on Amazon. I've updated the book several times so the 2007 draft is out of date. I put the draft on Wikibooks with the hope that other people would contribute but I can't find any contributions that anyone else has made. Duplicate content confuses Google. I don't see any reason to keep it on Wikibooks.--[[User:Tdkehoe|Thomas David Kehoe]] ([[User talk:Tdkehoe|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Tdkehoe|contribs]]) 17:18, 22 July 2013 (UTC)
:{{keep}} Too much usable content to be discarded, note that your contributions here will probably have a freer licensing in regards to reuse and that in general we do not delete stubs (exceptions regarding editors/author requests mostly apply to these). As the main author/contributor you could simply add some information to the book, pointing to the free version or both.
:I also note that access your free version is limited as it requires registering.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 12:23, 6 August 2013 (UTC)

:::If you are the sole contributor I have no problem with that wording but since Wikibooks is a mutable copy of the original a better wording would be that a stable version maintained only by yourself is available and the location.

Cut down version of a Wikipedia article. Not a textbook and unclear how it ever would become one. [[User:QuiteUnusual|QuiteUnusual]] ([[User talk:QuiteUnusual|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/QuiteUnusual|contribs]]) 12:36, 20 August 2013 (UTC)

* [[File:Symbol delete vote.svg|15px|alt=|link=]] '''Delete''' Unfortunately, this page isn't a nascent book.  If undertaking to write a book about the Titanic, one would better start from scratch rather than attempt to evolve from this.  The only thing in it of interest is its note that there's material on Wikivoyage.

: (Aside:  This seems to me to further highlight the core difficulty that some sort of ''assistance'' (of a highly flexible and readily community-customizable sort) is needed for most specialized tasks in the wikimedian sisterhood.  Creating a book is one such task; it really ought to be aided by a good interactive wizard, with of course further, customized assistants for all matter of later tasks in book development and maintenance.  The core difficulty is that the wiki software is designed for writing documents on the assumption that all stylistic decisions will be sorted out by iterative revision by many editors, which tends to discourage expertise rather than helping users to apply and acquire it.)  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 13:26, 20 August 2013 (UTC)

* [[File:Symbol delete vote.svg|15px|alt=|link=]] '''Delete'''. It would make an excellent subject for a book but in this case I very much doubt that this will be the result. Too many books are started and then left in the hope that they will attract further editors. Writing a book of any sort takes times and constant attention over a long period of time. The reward is a more comprehensive tract about a subject than would be found in an encyclopedia entry. If the editor who started this book was intending to encourage such an endeavor than that is to be commended. In this case I doubt the interest is there and therefore it should be deleted after an appropriate time.

This chapter contained one link to a YouTube video which I have now removed. The chapter now has no content and I propose that it be deleted.

[[File:Ubuntu 10.04 LTS.png|right|thumb|[[w:Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]], a popular Linux-based operating system.]]
A computer generally has one operating system that becomes active and takes control when the system is turned on. Computer hardware is wired to initially load a small set of system instructions that is stored in [[IB/Group 4/Computer Science/Computer Organisation#RAM_and_ROM|permanent memory]]. You've likely used at least one operating system before. The various versions of Microsoft Windows (from NT, to XP, and Vista to 8) are popular choices for personal computers. UNIX has been a favourite of serious programmers for years, and a version of UNIX called [[w:Linux|Linux]] is popular for personal computer systems. 
{{IB/Criterion|6.1.1|Identify the resources that need to be managed within a computer system.}}
The various roles of an operating system generally revolve around the idea of &quot;sharing nicely.&quot; An operating system manages resources, and these resources are often shared in one way or another among the various programs that want to use them: multiple programs executing concurrently share the use of main memory; they take turns using the CPU; and they compete for an opportunity to use input and output devices.  The operating system acts as the playground monitor, making sure that everyone cooperates and gets a chance to play.

There various aspects or resources that require management in a computer system, including: primary memory and secondary memory, processor, bandwidth, graphics and sound, networks, and cache.

== System resources ==
=== Memory management ===
{{IB/Criterion|6.1.7|Outline OS resource management techniques: scheduling, policies, '''multitasking''', virtual memory, paging, interrupt, polling.}}
[[File:The Fetch-Execute Cycle.svg|thumb|[[IB/Group 4/Computer Science/Computer Organisation#The_Fetch-Execute_Cycle|The Fetch-Execute Cycle]]]] An executing program resides in main memory and its instructions are processed one after another in the [[IB/Group 4/Computer Science/Computer Organisation#The_Fetch-Execute_Cycle|fetch-decode-execute cycle]]. Multiprogramming is the technique of keeping multiple programs in main memory at the same time; these programs compete for access to the CPU so that they can do their work. All modern operating systems employ multiprogramming to one degree or another. An operating system must therefore perform memory management to keep track of what programs are in memory and where in memory they reside.

==== Primary memory ====

			Memory is a continuous set of bits referenced by specific addresses.
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

All programs are stored in main memory when they are executed. All data referenced by those programs programs are also stored in main memory so that they can be accessed. Main memory can be thought of as a big continuous chuck of space divided into groups of 8, 16, and 32 bits. Each byte or word of memory has a corresponding address, which is simply an integer that uniquely identifies that particular part of memory. To the right there is a representation of memory, where the first memory address is 0.
{{IB/Criterion|6.1.5|Explain the role of the operating system in terms of managing memory, peripherals and hardware interfaces.}}
Earlier it was stated that in a multiprogramming environment, multiple programs (and their data) are stored in main memory at the same time. Thus, operating systems must employ techniques to:

* track where and how a program resides in memory, and
* convert logical program addresses into actual memory addresses.

A program is filled with references to variables and to other parts of the program code. When the program is compiled, these references are changed into the addresses in memory where the data and code resides. But since one doesn't know exactly where a program will be loaded into main memory, how can one know what address to use for anything?

The solution is to use two kinds of addresses: logical addresses and physical addresses. A logical address (sometimes called a virtual or relative address) is a value that specifies a generic location, relative to the program but not to the reality of main memory. A physical address is an actual address in the main memory device − again shown in the figure.

When a program is compiled, a reference to an identifier (such as a variable name) is changed to a logical address. When the program is eventually loaded into memory, each logical address finally corresponds to a specific physical address. The mapping of a logical address to a physical address is called address binding. Logical addresses allow a program to be moved around in memory or loaded in different places at different times. As long as one keeps track of where the program is stored, one is always able to determine the physical address that corresponds to any given logical address.
{{IB/Extension|
The following sections examine the underlying principles of there main memory management techniques. To simplify examples, all address-binding calculations are performed in base 10.
===== Single contiguous memory management =====
{{info|Section entitled &quot;'''Single contiguous memory management'''&quot; is planned.}}
===== Partition memory management =====
{{info|Section entitled &quot;'''Partition memory management'''&quot; is planned.}}
===== Paged memory management =====
{{info|Section entitled &quot;'''Paged memory management'''&quot; is planned.}}
}}

==== Virtual memory ====
{{IB/Criterion|6.1.7|Outline OS resource management techniques: scheduling, policies, multitasking, '''virtual memory''', paging, interrupt, polling.}}

The demand paging approach gives rise to the idea of virtual memory, the illusion that there are no restrictions on the size of a program (because the entire program is not necessarily in memory at the same time). In all of the memory management techniques examined earlier, the entire process had to be brought into memory as a continuous whole. Therefore there is always an  upper bound on process size. Demand paging removes that restriction.

However, virtual memory comes with lots of overhead during the execution of a program. With other memory management techniques, once a program was loaded into memory, it was all there and ready to go. With the virtual memory approach, one constantly has to swap pages between main and secondary memory. This overhead is usually acceptable - while one program is waiting for a page to be swapped, another process can take control of the CPU and make progress. Excessive page swapping is called thrashing and can seriously degrade system performance.

===== Limitations =====
{{IB/Criterion|6.1.3|Identify the limitations of a range of resources in a specified computer system}}
{{info|Section entitled &quot;'''Limitations'''&quot; is planned.}}

====== Consequences ======
{{IB/Criterion|6.1.4|Describe the possible problems resulting from the limitations of the resources in a computer system.}}
{{info|Section entitled &quot;'''Consequences'''&quot; is planned.}}

==== Secondary memory ====
The most widely used [[IB/Group_4/Computer_Science/Computer_Organisation#Secondary_Storage_Devices|secondary storage]] device is the magnetic disk drive. It includes both the hard drives that are found in the computer's main casing and disks that are portable and can be moved easily between computers. Storing data onto secondary storage requires a mechanism of organising the electron medium. As such, the use of individual files are used, and from the user's point of view, the smallest amount of data that can bet written to secondary memory. A file system is the natural solution to managing these files, and is the logical view that an operating system provides so that users can manage data as a collection of files. A file system is often organized by grouping files into directories. Additionally, a file is a generic concept. Different types of files are managed in different ways. A file, in general, contains a program (in some form) or data (of one type or another). Some files have a very rigid format; others are more flexible.

The most important hardware device used as secondary memory is the magnetic disk drive. File systems stored on these drives must be accessed in an efficient manner. It turns out that transferring data to and from secondary memory is the worst bottleneck in a general computer system.

The speed of the CPU and the speed of main memory are much faster than the speed of data transfer to and from secondary memory such as a magnetic disk. That's why a process that must perform I/O to disk is made to wait while that  data is transferred, to give another process a chance to use the CPU.

Because secondary I/O is the slowest aspect of a general computer system, the techniques for accessing data on a disk drive are of crucial importance to file systems. As computer deals with multiple processes over a period of time, requests to access the disk accumulate. The technique that the operating system uses to determine which requests to satisfy is called disk scheduling.
{{IB/Extension|
A magnetic disk drive is organized as a stack of platters, where each platter is divided into tracks, and each tracks is divided into sectors. The set of corresponding tracks on all platters is called a cylinder.

=== Process management ===
&lt;!-- Another key operating system concept is the idea of a process, which can be defined as a program in execution. A program is a static set of instructions. A process is the dynamic entity that represents the program while it is being executed. Through multiprogramming, a computer system might have many active processes at once. The operating system must manage these processes carefully. At any point in time a specific instruction may be the next to be executed. Intermediate values have been calculated. A process might be interrupted during its execution, so the operating system performs process management to carefully track the progress of a process and all of its intermediate states. --&gt;
Another important resource that an operating system must manage is the use of the CPU by individual processes. TO understand how an operating system manages processes, one must recognise the stages that a process goes through during its computational life and understand the information that must be managed to keep a process working correctly in a computer system.
=== The process states ===
{{IB/Criterion|6.1.5|Explain the role of the operating system in terms of managing memory, peripherals and hardware interfaces.}}
Processes move through specific stages as they are managed in a computer system. That is, a process enters the system, is ready to be executed, is executing, is waiting for a resource, or is finished. Below is flow chart that represents these process states.
&lt;center&gt;[[File:Process Life Cycle.svg|The process life cycle]]&lt;/center&gt;
In the figure, each box represents a state a process might be in, and the arrows indicate how and why a process might move from one state to another.

Examining what's happening to a process in each state:
* In the ''new state'', a process is being created. It may, for instance, be a login process created by a user logging onto a timesharing system, an application process created when a user submits a program for execution, or a system process created by the operating system to accomplish a specific system task.
* A process that has no barriers to its execution is in the ''ready state''. A process in the ready state is not waiting for an event to occur or for data to be brought in from secondary memory. Instead, it is waiting for its chance to use the CPU.
* A process in the ''running state'' is currently being executed by the CPU. Its instructions are being processed in the fetch-execute cycle.
* A process in the ''waiting state'' is currently waiting for resources (other than the CPU). For example, a process in the waiting state may be waiting for a page of its memory to be brought in from secondary memory or for another process to send it a signal that it may continue.
* A process in the ''terminate state'' has completed its execution and is no longer active. At this point the operating system no longer needs to maintain the information regarding the process.

Note that many processes may be in the ready state or the waiting state at the same time, but only one process can be in the running state.

After the process is created, the operating system admits it to the ready state. When the CPU scheduling algorithm dictates, a process is dispatched to the running state.

While running, the process might be interrupted by the operating system to allow another process to have its chance on the CPU. In that case, the process simply returns to the ready state. Alternatively, a running process might request a resource that is not available or requires I/O to retrieve a newly referenced part of the process, in which case it is moved to the waiting state. A running process may finally get enough CPU time to complete its processing and terminate normally; otherwise, it may generate an unrecoverable error and terminate abnormally.

When a waiting process gets the resources it is waiting for, it moves to the ready state again.
{{IB/Extension|
==== The process control block ====
The operating system must manage a large amount of data for each active process. Usually those data are stored in a data structured called a process control block (PCB). Generally, each state is represented by a list of PCBs, one for each process in that state. When a process moves from one state to another, its corresponding PCB moves from one state list to another in the operating system. A new PCB is created when a process is first created (the new state) and persists until the process terminates.

=== CPU scheduling ===
{{IB/Criterion|6.1.7|Outline OS resource management techniques: '''scheduling''', policies, multitasking, virtual memory, paging, interrupt, polling.}}
Related to the ideas of memory management and process management is the need for CPU scheduling, which determines which process in memory is executed by the CPU at any given point. The problem of how to capitalise on computers' greater capabilities and speed has led to the concept of timesharing. A timesharing system allows multiple users to interact with a computer at the same time. Multiprogramming allowed multiple processes to be active at once, which gave rise to the ability for programmers to interact with the computer system directly, while still sharing it resources, whereas timesharing systems create the illusion that each user has exclusive access to the computer. That is, each user does not have to actively compete for resources, though that is exactly what is happening behind the scenes. One user may actually know they are sharing the machine with other users, but does not have to do anything special to allow for it. The operating system manages the sharing of the resources, including the CPU, behind the scenes.

CPU scheduling is the act of determining which process in the ready state should be moved to the running state. That is, CPU scheduling algorithms decide which process should be given over the CPU so that it can make computational progress.

CPU scheduling decisions are made when a process switches from the running state to the waiting state, or when a program terminates. This type of CPU scheduling is called nonpreemptive scheduling, because the need for a new CPU process is the result of the activity of the current executing process.

CPU scheduling decisions may also be made when a process moves from the running state to the ready state or when a process moves from the waiting state to the ready state. These are examples of preemptive scheduling, because the currently running process (through not fault of its own) is preempted by the operating system.

Scheduling algorithms are often evaluated using particular metrics, such as the turnaround time for a process. This is the amount of time between the time a process arrives in the ready state to the time it exits the running state for the last time. One would like, on average, for the turnaround time for a processes to be as small as possible.

There are various approaches that can be used to determine which process gets chosen first to move from the ready state to the running state. Here there is an examination of three:

==== First-come, first-served ====
In first-come, first-served (FCFS) scheduling approach, processes are moved to the CPU in the order in which they arrive in the running state. FCFS scheduling is nonpreemptive. Once a process is given access to the CPU, it keeps it unless it makes a request that forces it to wait, such as request that forces it to wait, such as a request for a device in use by another process.
{{IB/Extension|
{{info|Section entitled &quot;'''First-come, first-served'''&quot; is planned.}}
}}

==== Shortest job next ====
The shortest-job-next {SJN} CPU scheduling algorithm looks at all processes in the ready state and dispatches the one with the smallest service time. Like FCFS, it is generally implemented as a nonpreemptive algorithm. 
{{IB/Extension|
{{info|Section entitled &quot;'''Shortest job next'''&quot; is planned.}}
}}

==== Round Robin ====
{{IB/Criterion|6.1.5|Explain the role of the operating system in terms of managing memory, peripherals and hardware interfaces.}}
Round-robin CPU scheduling distributes the processing time equitably among all ready processes. The algorithm establishes a particular time slice (or time quantum), which is the amount of time each process receives before being preempted and return to the ready state to allow another process its turn. Eventually the preempted process will be given another time slice on the CPU. This procedure continues until the process eventually gets all the time it needs and terminates.
{{IB/Extension|
Note that the round-robin algorithm is preemptive. The expiration of a time slice is an arbitrary reason to move a process from the CPU. This action is presented by the transition from the running state to the ready state.

[[File:Network_card.jpg|left|thumb|A network card. Click the image for specific details relating to the card itself.]]
Operating systems must also take into account the fact that computers are usually connected to networks. Today with the World Wide Web one would take network communication for granted, however, the vastly connected and interactive world requires management on the data level. Operating systems will be able to process the inputs and outputs to and fro the physical computer - usually through a network card of sorts. This communication between the network card and the computer is usually managed through a Network Interface Controller (NIC), a small component that handles two of the [[IB/Group_4/Computer_Science/Networks#Open_Systems|OSI layers]]; the physical and data link layer.

=== Sound and graphic management ===
Along with other peripherals, the most fundamental aspect which operating systems must deal with is that of graphics and graphic management. Computer graphics can be very generally described as the setting of pixel values on the computer screen. As such, computer graphics play a role in many aspects in computer science, the most common application being the graphical user interface (GUI) of the modern operating systems. Files and folders are represented as icons on the screen, with the icon indicating the file type, for instance. The operating system must account for the whereabouts and calculation of computer graphics, and is typically done using its own individual Graphics Processing Unit (GPU).

=== Miscellaneous ===
==== Cache management ====
&lt;div class=&quot;thumb tright&quot;&gt;
	&lt;div class=&quot;thumbinner&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;
		[[File:Crystal Project cookie.png|110px]]
		[[File:HTTP-Cookie-Google.svg|220px]]
		&lt;div class=&quot;thumbcaption&quot;&gt;
			A [[w:HTTP Cookie|HTTP Cookie]] is a type of cache.
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
Aside from the obvious, there are various other miscellaneous system concepts that require management, which may not be entirely obvious. One is that of cache. Cache is a component that transparently stores data so that future requests for that data can be served faster. The data that is stored within a cache might be values that have been computed earlier or duplicates of original values that are stored elsewhere. If requested data is contained in the cache, this request can be served by simply reading the cache, which is comparatively faster. Otherwise, the data has to be recomputed or fetched from its original storage location, which is comparatively slower. Hence, the greater the number of requests that can be served from the cache, the faster the overall system performance becomes.

== The role of the operating system ==
=== Operating system types ===
{{IB/Criterion|6.1.2|Evaluate the resources available in a variety of computer systems.}}

=== Physical systems ===
[[File:Personal_computer,_exploded_5.svg|thumb|left|Standard hardware components.]]
An operating system is responsible for communicating with a variety of devices. Usually that communication is accomplished with the help of a device driver, a small program that &quot;knows&quot; the way a particular device expects to receive and deliver information. With device drivers, every operating system no longer needs to know about every device with which it might possible be expected to communicate in te fuure. It's another beautiful example of abstraction. An appropriate device driver often comes with new hardware, and the most up-to-date drivers can often be downloaded for free from the manufacturing company's website.

==== Dedicated operating systems ====
{{IB/Criterion|6.1.8|Discuss the advantages of producing a dedicated operating system for a device.}}
Mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablet computers, run operating systems that are tailored to their needs. The memory constraints and the smaller set of peripherals involved, for example, are different than those of a typical desktop or laptop computer. [[w:Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s iPod Touch, iPhone, and iPad all run the iOS mobile operating system which is derived from Mac OS.
The Android operating system, developed by Google, is an open source project as part of the Open Handset Alliance. It has become the most popular OS for a variety of mobile devices. Android and iOS dominate the current market for mobile operating systems, though there are other competitors.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Below is the table of numbers as written in devanagari.


&lt;center&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable sortable&quot; rules=all style=&quot;text-align: center; border: 1px solid darkgray;background-color:white&quot; cellpadding=10
|-
! Devanagari 
| &lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;० || &lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;१ || &lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;२ || &lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;३ || &lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;४ || &lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;५ || &lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;६ || &lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;७ || &lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;८ || &lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;९
|-
! Cardinal 
| 0 || 1 || 2  || 3   || 4  || 5 || 6  || 7   || 8    || 9
|-
! Roman
|   || I || II || III || IV || V || VI || VII || VIII || IX
|}
&lt;/center&gt;


Number greater than 9 can be formed with help of these first ten. For example—
*1 is written as &lt;font size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt;१&lt;/font&gt;
*2 is written as &lt;font size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt;२&lt;/font&gt;
*3 is written as &lt;font size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt;३&lt;/font&gt;

So 123 can be written as &lt;font size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt;१२३&lt;/font&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Thoughts are complex things. In AI, logic is a way to simplify thoughts to their essences in a formal manner so that they can be reasoned about by machines. Like any representation, logical representations ignore some details and make a big deal out of others. 

We will discuss propositional logic, and then predicate logic. But here we'll just give you a taste of what they are like. 

Let's suppose you have a thought: &quot;Ocelots are endangered.&quot; Propositional logic would represent this with a single letter, for example, &quot;P.&quot;

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
P
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

Note that it ignores the fact that Ocelots are animals, that there is more than one, etc. In predicate logic, we might represent this fact like this:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
Endangered(Ocelots)
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

Notice that in predicate logic we have more structure. This is more powerful, and in AI, this makes it slightly less efficient. In AI, there is often a tradeoff between representational power and complexity and computational efficiency.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Knowledge representation (KR) is the name we give to how we encode knowledge, beliefs, actions, feelings, goals, desires, preferences, and all other mental states in artificial systems. As nearly all of AI research is done by programming computers, these representations often end up being some kind of character set in software. However, we can discuss them at a higher level than that of code: the information level. 

Suppose, for example, we have a list of countries in North America in the year 2000. The knowledge we encode would be the three countries: The United States, Canada, and Mexico. This is an unordered list. We can then represent this knowledge in different ways in different computer programming languages. For example:

Python: 
&lt;code&gt;
NorthAmericanCountries = (&quot;The United States&quot;, &quot;Canada&quot;, &quot;Mexico&quot;)
&lt;/code&gt;

LISP:
&lt;code&gt;
(setq north-american-countries '(the-united-states canada mexico))
&lt;/code&gt;

...and so on. The world is a complex place, and the job of the AI programmer is to decide which details to encode in the KR and which to ignore. Sometimes this is simple. For example, if you were programming a computer to decide on chess moves, it's not necessary to encode exactly where on the square each piece is. It's irrelevant to what move will be made. Other decisions are more difficult. 

In general, though, you want to have as much complexity as you need and no more. The reason for this is that added representational complexity results in more complicated programming and computational processes when you run the AI program.

Having &quot;as much complexity as you need&quot; is a call for &quot;representational adequacy,&quot; which basically means that your representation has the information it needs to do what it needs to do. Three ways to evaluate a KR are in terms of clarity, precision, and naturalness.

'''Clarity'''

A KR that has clarity is one that is not ambiguous. One of the reasons we use programming languages at all is that the languages we use naturally, such as English, are ambiguous. Programming languages are designed to have no ambiguity.

'''Precision'''

A KR with precision gets to the level of detail necessary. In chess, it's not enough to know that a piece is on the board--the agent needs to know which square it's on, what kind of piece it is, and what color it is. Whether or not a piece has a scratch on it is not necessary for playing chess, so details like this can be left out of the representation.

'''Naturalness'''

A third criterion is naturalness, which is how easily the KR can be interpreted by people, or, perhaps, how easily it can be translated into something a person can understand. This is important because people in many instances don't want to simply trust what an AI tells them--they want an explanation. Being able to see what reasons the AI used to generate its output is only useful if the KR has a degree of naturalness.

Naturalness is also important for the programmers. It's good to have a natural KR so that future programmers (perhaps even you!) will be able to make sense of what was written at a later date. For this reason, it's important that your KR have explicit semantics and syntax.

For example, look at this representation:

&lt;code&gt;
red(car)
&lt;/code&gt;

What does this mean? &lt;code&gt;red&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;car&lt;/code&gt; are just symbols; they can mean whatever we want them to mean. Let's assume that the KR was designed to be natural, and they mean what they appear to man in English. There's still ambiguity. Does it mean that all cars are red? That a particular car is red? Is it a function that returns true if the car is red? Or is it a command to paint a car red? 

What looks obvious at programming time might be confusing later. 

Let's return to our example above, representing North American countries. There's no reason why the three countries in the list need to be ordered. However, in LISP and in Python the list data structures are ordered. In the language Smalltalk, for example, there is a data structure called &quot;bag&quot; which can hold an unordered collection of items. The programming language we choose often puts constraints on the KR.

How many countries are in North America? There are three, but is this explicitly represented in the code above? No. Lists are represented. If we wanted to encode the list lengths explicitly, we could do something like this:

&lt;code&gt;
NorthAmericanCountries = (3, &quot;The United States&quot;, &quot;Canada&quot;, &quot;Mexico&quot;)
&lt;/code&gt;

However, it's so easy to count the things in a list that most programmers would just recalculate the list length with a function when needed. This also keeps the system from needing to change the explicitly represented number every time the list length changes. 

This gets at the '''inferential adequacy''' of the KR, which is how well the system can use the KR to infer what it needs to. '''Representational efficiency''' refers to how efficiently the AI can use the KR to do its reasoning--in terms of time or computational resources, as appropriate.

Although any programmer can make up any KR he or she wants to, there are many already created, and their properties are well understood. It's often advisable to use a a well-known KR than to make up your own. In this book we'll show you many different KRs. In the next parts, we'll talk about two: semantic networks and frames.

I have reverted your recent edits to this page because you removed a large quantity of text without explaining your reasons in the Edit Summary.  If this was a genuine edit you can change it back again but please leave an Edit Summary so other Wikibooks users know what you are doing.--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Estonia.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 10:59, 14 March 2014 (UTC)

: I note your further edits to this book and the accompanying edit summary.  It does look rather ambitious and suspicious for Wikibooks content.  Looks like you made the right call.--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Estonia.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 02:15, 15 March 2014 (UTC)

:Thanks for your message on my talk page.  If you feel that text has been taken from copyrighted sources then feel free to remove it.  If it turns out that we're wrong then things can get reverted later.  Do you just suspect this or do you know of any particular sources where this material has come from (online or offline)?  With regards to stuff that is copied from other Wikibooks books I'd say don't worry about that.  I'll try to take a closer look at the World History book when I have some free time.--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Estonia.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 02:19, 16 March 2014 (UTC)

:Having done a random search for a piece of text (''most probably to surmount the Maginot Line of defenses on the Franco-German border'') it seems that much of content just removed comes from the Wikipedia article.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The storage of glassware is an important aspect of any bar, be it commercial or in the home. Proper storage of glassware helps reduce breakage, keeps things readily accessible, and encourages good hygiene.

==General Principles==
Glassware, regardless of the material of construction, should be stored face-down, either hung from appropriate supports (such as glass rails), or on anti-slip mats somewhere within easy reach of the bartender. This prevents both potentially dangerous chipping of the rim of the glass as well as the ingress of dust, dead insects and other detritus found in most every room. Glasses which do not nest should not be stacked, as the stack may collapse when unstable. Moreover, even if glasses are designed to stack they should not be stacked if they have just come out of the washer, as the warmer glasses may contract and shatter glasses they sit atop. 

Glasses should be periodically inspected for chips or scratches, and those damaged glasses discarded immediately -- sudden heat from washers or sudden cold from bar ice or chilled drinks can cause structurally weakened glass to shatter, and chipped glass may cut drinkers. 

Delicate stemware should be stored away from heavy-bottomed glasses, and more frequently-stored glasses (depending on the establishment) stored nearer the bartender and in greater quantity. Finally, glassware should be stored away from edges, elbows and other moving hazards.

Oops! I created this page without making it a proper section of the [IB Mathematics SL] WikiBook. I have created the section properly, and all that is left to be done in cleaning up my mistake is to delete this page.

The International Baccalaureate expects Mathematics Standard Level students to know these formulae and related concepts.

==Area of a parallelogram:==

&lt;math&gt; A = b \times h &lt;/math&gt;

==Area of a triangle:==

&lt;math&gt; A = \frac {b \times h} {2} &lt;/math&gt;

==Area of a trapezium==

&lt;math&gt; A = \frac {1} {2} (a + b) h &lt;/math&gt;

==Area of a circle==

&lt;math&gt; A = \pi r^2 &lt;/math&gt;

==Circumference of a circle==

&lt;math&gt; C = 2 \pi r &lt;/math&gt;

==Volume of a Pyramid==

&lt;math&gt; V = \frac {1} {3} (Area _ {base} \times height) &lt;/math&gt;

==Volume of a Cuboid (rectangular prism)==

&lt;math&gt; V = l \times w \times h &lt;/math&gt;

==Volume of a Cylinder==

&lt;math&gt; V = \pi r^2 h &lt;/math&gt;

==Area of the curved surface of a cylinder==

&lt;math&gt; A = 2 \pi r h &lt;/math&gt;

==Volume of a Sphere==

&lt;math&gt; A = \frac {4} {3} \pi r^2 &lt;/math&gt;

==Volume of a cone==

&lt;math&gt; V = \frac {1} {3} \pi r^2 h &lt;/math&gt;

==Distance between two points &lt;math&gt; ( x_1, y_1, z_1 ) &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; ( x_2, y_2, z_2 ) &lt;/math&gt;==

&lt;math&gt; d = \sqrt {(x_1 - x_2)^2 + (y_1 - y_2)^2 + (z_1 - z_2)^2 } &lt;/math&gt;

==Coordinates of the midpoint of a line segment with endpoints (&lt;math&gt; x_1, y_1, z_1 &lt;/math&gt;) and (&lt;math&gt; x_2, y_2, z_2 &lt;/math&gt;)==

&lt;math&gt; \left ( \frac {x_1 + x_2} {2} , \frac {y_1 + y_2} {2} , \frac {z_1 + z_2} {2} \right ) &lt;/math&gt;</text>

Thanks for correcting mistakes in Wikibooks' pages.  Please be careful as it appears, one two occasions, that you corrected words which didn't need correcting (the word ''comments'').--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Estonia.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 22:00, 5 March 2014 (UTC)

I somehow mistyped 'constants' into 'contants'. Maybe this is the cause of the revert? If you believe it should be 'comments' instead of 'constants', please read the paragraph again. It talks about constants, not comments. Thanks!</text>

      <comment>Added some initial content about MPLS</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">MPLS stands for Multi-Protocol Label Switching, and is a protocol that was originally developed out of work by Cisco but was formalised into an IEEE standard. It’s a protocol that is used to provide transparent access over a backbone network to data that uses other protocols.

MPLS is sometimes characterised as “layer 2.5”. This is most obvious in the way the packets are wrapped (the MPLS data goes between the Ethernet frame header and the IP packet in IP-over-Ethernet, for example), but it’s also a description of the bigger picture of the protocol. MPLS doesn’t provide routing, and makes use of another interior routing protocol (iBGP, IS-IS, OSPF or others) to route packets. But neither is it fully a layer-2 protocol, since it relies on existing layer 2 to do the framing of the data and provide communication between nodes. MPLS can deterministically control where data goes in a way that layer 2 switching can’t.

== Switching performance ==

One of the factors driving MPLS early on was that the switching of packets under MPLS could be implemented efficiently in hardware, which IP routing couldn’t (at the time). This is no longer true. In this sense, MPLS is just a way of “baking down” the routing tables into a high-performance switching infrastructure. Though this played a part in driving the development of MPLS initially, it’s no longer relevant.

== Actual advantages of MPLS ==

=== Backbone infrastructure for heterogeneous networks ===
MPLS can switch any layer 3 protocol over any layer 2 protocol. It’s thus useful for providing the backbone on a network where many different protocols (including future protocols yet to be specified) may want to travel over the backbone. Previously this kind of thing was only possible with Frame Relay or ATM.

MPLS can also carry layer 2 packets over the backbone, since the contents are ignored. This means that any layer 2 protocol can be carried over MPLS, known as AToM (any transport over MPLS)

=== IP over ATM ===

ATM was originally viewed as a potential replacement for IP as an end-to-end network, but it never happened. However, ATM is still widely used as a WAN network. Now that IP dominates the internet, it’s necessary to transport IP over these existing ATM networks. There are several specific solutions for implementing IP over ATM, but they’re all complicated to implement and MPLS can replace all of these.

=== Traffic management ===

BGP (for example) provides ways to customise which way data goes by using route maps and communities and such. But this is fiddly and opaque to implement. MPLS can allow different streams of data to be switched in different routes through the network very flexibly and with very direct control.

=== Tunnels and VPNs ===

MPLS has a layered structure that allows packets to be wrapped up in an unlimited number of additional containers. Only the outer label plays any role in routing the packet through the network at any time, so you can use this to tunnel traffic through parts of the network while ignoring what’s inside the packet.

The contents of the packet inside the label are ignored entirely by MPLS. This means you can encapsulate a full ethernet frame inside an MPLS label (with a further layer 2 frame outside of that) and pass the entire ethernet frame around the network unchanged, simulating a wire in a layer 2 broadcast domain that spans long distances and many routing hops.

== Types of VPNs ==

There are two types of VPNs:

* overlay
* peer-to-peer

In the overlay model, the service provider sets up links between customer’s routers across the network. The customer’s routers peer with each other directly across these links, and don’t peer with the service provider’s routers.

In the peer-to-peer model, the service provider’s routers peer with the customer’s routers. This requires more work on the part of the service provider, since the provider edge routers need to be updated in response to changes in the customer network.

The overlay model used to be the most common way of providing VPNs, but MPLS made it simpler to provide peer-to-peer VPNs.

== LDP ==
LDP is the protocol used to distribute labels in an MPLS network (RSVP and MP-BGP can also distribute labels). It’s based on TDP, a Cisco proprietary protocol. LDP is similar enough that it has entirely superseded TDP.

LDP doesn’t choose the routes, it merely distributes labels for routes that have been determined some other way. For the case of IP over MPLS, the routes that are labelled using LDP will have been determined using a standard IP routing protocol. This most simple form is mostly an anachronism (though a surprisingly young one); at a time when routers couldn’t do wire-speed IP routing, replacing a route with a label improved performance.
Nowadays, the more interesting cases are where “routes” other than standard IP routes are being switched using MPLS, e.g. VPNs or traffic engineering. This will involve another protocol making the decisions and then using LDP to coordinate labels.

=== Label distribution modes ===

There are two major modes for distributing the labels: Downstream Unsolicited and Downstream on Demand. The on-demand form saves memory on the routers because only the labels that are needed are transferred. However, the DU form converges faster. The DU form is more common now that routers tend to have more than enough memory (Cisco uses DoD for LC-ATM, but DU for everything else).

=== Label Retention modes ===

In Conservative Label Retention mode, the router stores only those bindings that are associated with the next-hop for a particular FEC. That is, for each FEC there is only one label held at a time (the label that’s programmed in the LFIB).
In Liberal Label Retention mode, the router stores any bindings that it receives.

=== LSP control modes ===

There are two control modes: ordered, and independent. In independent control mode the LSRs exchange labels for any routes that are in their routing table. This is simple to understand and reason about, but it has the disadvantage that it means that different parts of the LSP will come up at different times. It may be that traffic can make it part way across the network to a router that doesn’t have a label binding set up, at which point the router can’t take the right action with the packets. This may cause the router to fall back to slower IPv4 routing (e.g. in software).
Ordered control mode causes labels only to be assigned for routes that are directly connected or that already have labels established with the next hop router.

=== FECs ===

LDP is based on the idea of a Forwarding Equivalence Class (FEC). A FEC is defined by a class of traffic that will all be treated in the same way. An obvious example would be all IP packets with a destination address in a certain prefix, but it could be anything else that can be defined in a way that both LDP speakers agree on. A pseudowire between two LSRs would act as a FEC.

=== LDP peerings ===

LDP routers discover each other by sending HELLO messages as UDP multicast packets to the “all routers on the subnet” multicast address, so it isn’t necessary to explicitly set up the addresses of peer routers. When a HELLO message is received, the receiving router retains the address the packet came from. The HELLO packet contains a hold time, which is the length of time between HELLO messages. If this is exceeded, the peering is regarded as having failed.

Each LSR has an LDP ID, which is 4 bytes identifying the router and 2 bytes for the label space in use. The 4 byte router ID is in practice an IPv4 address, though it isn’t used for messaging; the only requirement is that it’s unique. Zero for the label space indicates the platform-wide label space, while a non-zero value indicates a per-interface label space. 

In Cisco IOS, the router ID is actually treated as an IP address and the router checks that the address is in the routing table.</text>

* &lt;font size=3&gt;The first meter was installed in 1923.
* All franks contain “HELVETIA”.
* Frank dies are designed and furnished by postal authorities rather than meter manufacturers. Although these designs are changed periodically, within each design period all stamps closely resemble each other, and this often makes accurate identification a challenge.
* Native meter manufacturers in Switzerland: Frama, Franco, Francopost, Hasler, and Safag.
* Swiss meter stamps were applied to gummed labels as well as directly to the mail piece. Early labels had the name of the mailer or his logo pre-printed, and it often included a frame and the meter number. Stamps applied to such personalized labels are usually worth a premium.
* The stamps are grouped according to appearance and purpose as follows:
:: A - Oval frank
:: B - Horizontal frank with incomplete outer frame
:: C - Horizontal frank with complete frame, inscribed &quot;HELVETIA&quot; in top panel and an outline “P” in each side panel
:: D - Horizontal frank with complete frame, inscribed “CH” in top panel and “HELVETIA” in left panel
:: E - Digital frank without frame, with 2D barcode data code field
:: PO - Stamps generated only at Post Office counters
:: PD - Stamps used for collecting Postage Due
:: PS - Stamps used to frank Postal Stationery
:: PV - Stamps from public self-service vending machines
:: OO - Stamps used only for Official government mail

* For specialized information about the meter stamps of Switzerland, see ''Die Freistempel der Schweiz'', Band I and Band II, by Heiner Dürst and ''Repertorio Catalogo delle affrancature meccaniche svizzere nel terzo millennio'', by Roberto Di Casola. The listings in the present catalog were heavily influenced by both works.

'''NOTE''': Franco survived only a few years. After its demise several meter numbers assigned to Franco were additionally assigned to other meter companies. In some cases the Franco meters continued to be used and the dates of use overlap. The numbers are 105, 106, 107, 112, 114, 117, 119 and 121. They can be differentiated as follows:
* 105: 
:– Franco if mailer is Schweizerisch Ruckversicherungs-Gesellschaft. Franco if value is 40 or 80.
:– Hasler (Type A2) if value is 7½, 50, 70, 90 or 1F.
:– Shared values are 5, 10, 20 and 30. Overlapping dates are 1925-1941.

* 106:
:– Franco if mailer is Societe de la Viscose Suisse, Emmenbrucke. Franco if dated before July 1927.
:– Hasler (Type A2) if value is 60 or 70.
:– Shared values are 5, 10, 20, 30, 50 and 1F. Overlapping dates are July 1927-1934.

* 107:
:– Franco if mailer is Oberpostdirektion, Bern.
:– Universal (Type A3) if value is 50, 150, 1F, 2F, or 3F.
:– Shared values are 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 60, and 80. Overlapping dates are 18 May 1926 to 1928.

:– Franco if dated before March 1930. Franco if value is 40 or 80.
:– Francopost (Type A4) if dated after March 1930. Francopost if value is 7½, 50, 70, 90 or 1F.

&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size=3&gt;
* Starting in 1946 meter numbers were assigned without regard to meter manufacturer or model and are no longer useful for identification.
* Because the Swiss postal service furnishes all stamp dies, the stamps are quite similar and are difficult to tell apart. Although there are exceptions, the stamps usually can be identified by the size of the &quot;P&quot; at the sides of the frank and by differences in the corner ornaments.


[[File: Switzerland stamp group BB P ornaments.jpg|center|500px]]


* Three “P” sizes were used: Medium (6+ mm tall by 3+ mm wide), Narrow (6+ mm tall by 3- mm wide), and Tall (7- mm tall by 3+ mm wide).


[[File: Switzerland stamp group BB corner ornaments.jpg|center|750px]]


* Three variations of the corner ornaments exist, Closed, Open, and Dashed. Looking at the lower left ornament examine the ends of the third and fourth lines from the top. With &quot;Closed&quot; the two lines are bridged. With &quot;Open&quot; they are unconnected. With &quot;Dashed&quot; they are also unconnected but a small dash is present in the opening.

* Proper identification requires care as the size of the &quot;P&quot; is not easily identified without a millimeter gauge. The corner ornaments are not always reliable. Occasionally one finds different ones on the same stamp!  Thus the following table is not foolproof.

* &lt;font size=3&gt;'''NOTE''': In addition to using themeter stamps described in this section to frank postal stationery, Switzerland PTT has also prepared postal stationery with nearly identical looking press-printed indicia. Excellent meter impressions can often appear to be press-printed so care must be taken in identifying one from the other.

'''TPACK Group Report:'''

The group started the TPACKing process by identifying the Iowa Core Economics standards for grades nine through twelve.  Each group member chose a standard to base their individual lesson on.  Each of the group members use TPACK to break down their individual lesson into Technology Knowledge, Content Knowledge, Pedagogical areas in order to develop activities.  To guide the TPACK lesson creating process, the group used resources found in the RWLD and focused on the article written by Harris and Hofer titled Grounded Tech Integration.  As a supplement to the article, the group used the shared Google Doc that details the five steps to TPACK lesson planning.  The links we used as references are listed below.

Overall, the group didn’t encounter many challenges.  We realized that we could only go so far as a group before we really needed to focus on our individual lesson plans.  As we completed our individual lesson plans, we were better able to understand and communicate the learning activity types and technologies involved.

      <text xml:space="preserve">

=== Overview ===
William Heights Elementary School opened in August of 1958. In addition to general education students, William Heights also serves students throughout the district with mental and physical disabilities. Special Education, Title I and ELL (English Language Learners) students are integrated in the general education classrooms through the inclusion program. The current organizational plan consists of a grant preschool class, two sections of Head Start (preschool), and four sections of K-5 classrooms. William Heights has a population of over 500 students comprised of diverse racial, religious, cultural and socio-economic back grounds. William Heights Elementary is part of the district William Heights Community Schools. Our schools comprise the largest district in the state of Iowa.

=== Technology: ===
At William Heights we offer two full mac computer labs (32 computers/lab).  Each classroom is also equipped with two student laptops, a teacher laptop, and a hub set up to the smart board.  Each school in our district has a school librarian that also acts as our technology coach. We have one technology coordinator for the entire district.  We also have a district help desk that assists with technology problems.

=== Group Report ===
'''Curriculum: Literacy''' 

We decided on literacy due to our belief in the importance of this subject matter.  We also felt we each had a varied perspective, and use of literacy in the classroom that would make this an interesting subject choice.  

=== '''Grades: 3rd - 5th''' ===

Making the choice of grades proved to be more challenging than we originally thought.  Originally we thought we would do an overarching view of grades K-5, but on further review of the assignment we realized we needed to identify specific grades.  In this case majority was the decider, as two of our group members are upper elementary.  

=== '''Standards:''' ===

When choosing our standards we took a collaborative approach. We chose to meet in a google hangout and look at the 3rd-5th grade literacy standards together.  We then each identified standards of interest that would also support each other, and   decided from there.  
We decided on the following standards:

Ask and answer questions to demonstrate understanding of a text, referring explicitly to the text as the basis for the answers. (RL.3.1)
Refer to details and examples in a text when explaining what the text says explicitly and when drawing inferences from the text. (RL.4.1)
Quote accurately from a text when explaining what the text says explicitly and when drawing inferences from the text. (RL.5.1)
Recount stories, including fables, folktales, and myths from diverse cultures; determine the central message, lesson,
or moral and explain how it is conveyed through key details in the text. (RL.3.2)
Determine a theme of a story, drama, or poem from details in the text; summarize the text. (RL.4.2)
Respond to challenges or how the speaker in a poem reflects upon a topic; summarize the text. (RL.5.2)
Describe characters in a story (e.g., their traits, motivations, or feelings) and explain how their actions contribute to the sequence of events. (RL.3.3)
Describe in depth a character, setting, or event in a story or drama, drawing on specific details in the text (e.g., a   character’s thoughts, words, or actions). (RL.4.3)
Compare and contrast two or more characters, settings, or events in a story or drama, drawing on specific details in the text (e.g., how characters interact). (RL.5.3)

=== '''Activities/Technologies:''' ===

When determining our activities we decided to do this individually by dividing the work.  Each group member was asked to pick 3 standards, and then for each standard choose three activities and three technologies to align with each standard.  This was beneficial because we were each allotted the freedom to select and create our own activities, while still building upon each others work due to the standards supporting one another.  When creating these activities and determining the technologies each group member was expected to have reviewed the RWLD, and have read the articles so that each activity aligned with the conceptual ideas of TPACK.

1.  Ask and answer questions to demonstrate understanding of a text, referring explicitly to the text as the basis for the answers. (RL.3.1) 
      Activity/Technology #1 - Login to newsela.com and choose an article with “Anchor 1” (located at the top near the article title). Read the article and take the quiz, using the text as a    reference to answer the questions.

     Activity/Technology #2 - Write a friendly letter to an author of your choice (may be teacher chosen)  using readwritethink letter generator, asking questions about a given story.  You must include  the 5 W’s and an H in your letter, and you should refer to the text in your letters to create your questions.

     Activity/Technology #3 - Work with your group to become ‘text detectives’.    Create a bubbl.us mind map of the story using the 5 W’s and and H as your guide.  Be sure to  include bubbles referring to the problem and solution in your story.  Use the text while creating your map.

2.  Refer to details and examples in a text when explaining what the text says explicitly and when drawing inferences from the text. (RL.4.1)

     Activity/Technology #1 - Work with your group.  Create a commercial for your novel using imovie.  You will need to use the storyboard app on your ipad to create your detailed plan of how you will present your book and it’s main theme.  Your commercial needs to include the 5 w’s and an h, and should also refer directly to the text.  Your commercial should be no more than 3 minutes long.

     Activity/Technology #2 -Create a voicethread ‘quiz’ for your classmates with your partner about the book your group is reading..  Use the text to help you create your quiz.  Try to ‘stump’ your classmates by writing questions that make them think about what the author is trying to tell you.  These questions might start with, ‘Why do you think...’ or ‘When the author says...’.

     Activity/Technology #3 - Pretend you are one of the characters in the story.  Using blabberize or voki, tell the story from your point of view.  Use google docs to plan your 2 minute audio clip.  Use details from the story in your summary, and be sure to include how ‘you’ are feeling in the story.

3.  Quote accurately from a text when explaining what the text says explicitly and when drawing inferences from the text. (RL.5.1)

     Activity/Technology #1 - Work with your group.  Pretend you are  characters in a fictional story of your choice (may be teacher chosen).  Create a dialogue between the characters that refers to the central theme of the story, and create a comic strip using toonlet.com.  Your comic strip needs to quote directly from the text, and must convey the theme through the character dialogue.

     Activity/Technology #2 -  Write a review of the story using your google docs account.  Your job is to convince your classmates why you would or would not recommend this book.  You must use the text directly in your argument, and quote directly from the text.

     Activity/Technology #3 - Work with your partner to create a powtoon or moovly presentation that will challenge your classmates to answer questions about the story.  Use the text to write your questions, and you must quote the text directly when writing your questions. For example, you might start a question by saying ‘On page 45 of the story Charlotte’s Web,  Wilbur refuses to eat...’  Use the 5 W’s and and H to be sure you are hitting all parts of the story in your questions.

4.  Recount stories, including fables, folktales, and myths from diverse cultures; determine the central message, lesson,
or moral and explain how it is conveyed through key details in the text. (RL.3.2)

     Activity/Technology #1 - Read one of the three texts offerings provided by the teacher.  Once you have finished the text create a concept map using mindmeister that at it’s central location discusses the central message/lesson/moral, then support this with key details and ideas from the text.  

     Activity/Technology #2 - To complete this activity you must first have completed the mindmeister activity.  Once your concept map is completed meet with your assigned groups to compare your Maps.  Then create a group concept map using Inspiration that joins your ideas and thoughts into one centralized location.  

     Activity/Technology #3 - Now that you have created your individual concept map and group map it is time to teach the class.  Using animoto create a presentation that tells the class what the lesson of your story was and how you came to this conclusion.  Use your Maps to guide this process. 

5.  Determine a theme of a story, drama, or poem from details in the text; summarize the text. (RL.4.2) 

     Activity/Technology #1 - First access your poem of choice (from pre-approved teacher list) on adobe reader.   First go through and read the poem a few times getting an idea of its rhythm and expression.  Once you have read the text a few times use adobe reader to highlight and take notes on the main ideas.  

     Activity/Technology #2 - Now that you are familiar with your poem share what you think the theme of the text is and why.  To share your thoughts I want you to use voicethread, beyond that it is up to you.  

     Activity/Technology #3 - Once you have completed your voicethread go through and listen to all of your peers.  Once you have completed this pick five threads to comment on.  Get a discussion going, respond to questions and ask them.  This process should be meaningful and reflective.  

6.  Respond to challenges or how the speaker in a poem reflects upon a topic; summarize the text. (RL.5.2)

     Activity/Technology #1 -  Using the same poem you chose for your voicethread activity I want you to reflect on the idea of where the author’s voice came from.  Put yourself in the writer’s chair for a moment and create an idea of what the author’s idea or history behind the poem was, and what their emotions were when writing this poem.  Once you feel like you have a good idea, create an outline using freemind to guide your discussion.  

     Activity/Technology #2 - Using the outline you just created, write a blogpost that goes in depth into the ideas posted in your outline.  

     Activity/Technology #3 - Review 3 of your classmates poems and blogs.  Once you have completed this, choose 1.  After you have chosen a blog, determine whether you agree or disagree with your classmates view.  Create a podcast using podomatic that discusses why.  

7.  Describe characters in a story (e.g., their traits, motivations, or feelings) and explain how their actions contribute to the sequence of events. (RL.3.3)

     Activity/Technology #1 - Choose a fictional story (may be teacher’s choice) and create a video diary of the main character. Using Voki, create your character’s avatar and be sure to included the character’s feelings about events and other characters.

     Activity/Technology #2 - Create a Character Scrapbook for at least two characters from a fictional story (may be teacher’s choice). On one side create a visual image of the characters and on the other side include important character traits.

     Activity/Technology #3 - Create a character map using bubbl for at least two characters from a fictional story (may be teacher’s choice). The following elements must be included: Character’s name; What the character says and does; How the character looks and feels; What others think about the character; Also, include a place to give your feelings about the character.

8.  Describe in depth a character, setting, or event in a story or drama, drawing on specific details in the text (e.g., a   character’s thoughts, words, or actions). (RL.4.3) 

     Activity/Technology #1 - Using a Google Doc, you and a classmate should collaborative create an alternate ending to a story. Be sure to use base your choices on changes to the ending on details from the story and inferences and/or predictions you made as you read.

     Activity/Technology #2 - Create a series of at least 4 comic scenes using Pixton to illustrate the climaxing moment from your story. Be sure to draw details about setting from the text, as well as character’s feelings. Also include direct character quotes from the text.

     Activity/Technology #3 - Create a 3D popup book using ZooBurst to highlight the main character from your book. Be sure to include important character traits, events involving your character, your character’s feelings and relationships with other characters.

9.  Compare and contrast two or more characters, settings, or events in a story or drama, drawing on specific details in the text (e.g., how characters interact). (RL.5.3) 

     Activity/Technology #1 - You and a classmate should collaborate to produce a VoiceThread that both compares and contrasts two characters from your story. One partner should contribute by voicing the comparisons, the other should voice the contrasts.

     Activity/Technology #2 - Compare and Contrast two different versions of the same fairy tale.  You may choose to compare/contrast characters, setting, or events. You do not have to do all three. Create two Blabberize photos to illustrate your comparisons and contrasts. The photos you chose should be relevant to your story.

     Activity/Technology #3 - Use the online Venn Diagram tool from ReadWriteThink to compare and contrast the character, settings, or events from two of the stories we have read in class. You should indicate in your title which element you are comparing/contrasting. When you finish, email your diagram to your teacher.

__TOC__
&lt;/div&gt;


One of the basic steps during database development cycles is the fixing of decisions about the table structure. To do so there is the CREATE TABLE statement with which developers define tables together with their columns and constraints.

Because a lot of features may be activated by the command, its syntax is a little bit complex. This page shows the most important parts. The syntax is not straight forward. At some points it is possible to use alternative formulations to express the same purpose, e.g. the Primary Key may be defined within the column definition as a column constraint, at the end of the command as a table constraint or as a separate stand-alone command 'ALTER TABLE ADD CONSTRAINT ...;' .

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot; style=&quot;background:LightGreen&quot;&gt;
CREATE TABLE &lt;tablename&gt; (
  &lt;column_name&gt; &lt;data_type&gt; &lt;default_value&gt; &lt;identity_specification&gt; &lt;column_constraint&gt;,
  &lt;column_name&gt; &lt;data_type&gt; &lt;default_value&gt;                          &lt;column_constraint&gt;,
  ...,
  &lt;table_constraint&gt;,
  &lt;table_constraint&gt;,
  ...
);
&lt;/source&gt;

== General Description ==
After the introductory key words CREATE TABLE the tablename is specified. Within a pair of parentheses a list of column definitions follows. Each column is defined by its name, data type, an optional default value and optional constraints for this individual column.

After the list of column definitions developers can specifiy table constraints like Primary and Foreign Keys, Unique conditions and general column conditions.

An first example was shown at the page [[../Create a simple Table#Fasten_Decisions|Create a simple Table]] and a second one here:

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
CREATE TABLE test_table (
  -- define columns (name / type / default value / column constraint
  id             DECIMAL                           PRIMARY KEY,
  part_number    CHAR(10)          DEFAULT 'n/a'   NOT NULL,
  part_name      VARCHAR(500),
  state          DECIMAL           DEFAULT -1,
  -- define table constraints (eg: 'n/a' shall correlate with NULL)
  CONSTRAINT test_check CHECK ((part_number  = 'n/a' AND part_name IS     NULL) OR
                               (part_number != 'n/a' AND part_name IS NOT NULL))
);
&lt;/source&gt;

The table consists of 4 columns. All of them have a data type and some a default value. The column ''id'' acts as the Primary Key. The table constraint ''test_check'' guarantees that ''part_name'' is mandatory if ''part_number'' is recorded.

== Column Definition ==
=== Data Type ===
The standard defines a lot of predefined data types: character strings of fixed and variable size, character large objects (CLOB), binary strings of fixed and variable size, binary large objects (BLOB), numeric, boolean, datetime, interval, xml. Beyond there are complex types like: ROW, REF(erence), ARRAY, MULTISET and user-definded types (UDT). The predefined data types are explained on the [[../Data Types|next page]]. To keep things simple we use on this page only CHAR, VARCHAR and DECIMAL.

=== Default Value ===
A column can have a default value. Its data type corresponds to the type of the column. It may be a constant value like the number -1 or the string 'n/a', or it is a system variable or a function call to determine dynamic values like the username or the actual timestamp.

The default clause affects those INSERT and MERGE commands, which do not specify the column. In our example database the ''person'' table has the column ''weight'' with the default value 0. If we omit this column in an INSERT command, the DBMS will store the value 0.

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
-- This INSERT command omits the 'weight' column. Therefore the value '0' (which is different from
-- the NULL value) is stored in the weight column.
INSERT INTO person (id, firstname, lastname,    date_of_birth,     place_of_birth, ssn)
VALUES             (11, 'Larry',   'Goldstein', date'1970-11-20', 'Dallas',        '078-05-1120');
COMMIT;

-- This SELECT retrieves the row ...
SELECT * 
FROM   person
WHERE  id = 11
AND    weight = 0;

-- ... but not this one:
SELECT * 
FROM   person
WHERE  id = 11
AND    weight IS NULL;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Identity Specification ===
The ''identity specification'' serves for the generation of a series of unique values which acts as the Primary Key to the tables rows. The standard defines the syntax as: &quot;GENERATED { ALWAYS | BY DEFAULT } AS IDENTITY&quot;. Unfortunatelly most DBMS vendors do not support this formulation. Instead they offer different syntaxes and even different concepts to generate primary key values. Some use a combination of generators/sequences and triggers, others a special data type or different key words.

An overview about the wide spread of implementations is available in the wikibook [[SQL_Dialects_Reference/Data_structure_definition/Auto-increment_column|SQL Dialects Reference: Auto-increment_column]].

=== Column Constraint ===
The column constraint clause specifies conditions which all values must meet. There are different column constraint types:
:NOT NULL
:Primary Key
:Unique
:Foreign Key
:Check values

&lt;br /&gt;
The &lt;u&gt;NOT NULL&lt;/u&gt; phrase defines, that it is not allowed to store the NULL value in the column.

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
-- The column col_1 is per definition not allowed to hold the NULL value
CREATE TABLE t1 (col_1 DECIMAL NOT NULL);

-- This INSERT command will fail
INSERT INTO t1(col_1) values(NULL);

-- The same applies to the following UPDATE command
INSERT INTO t1(col_1) values(5);
UPDATE t1 SET col_1 = NULL;
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
The &lt;u&gt;PRIMARY KEY&lt;/u&gt; phrase defines that the column acts as the Primary Key of the table. This implies that the column is not allowed to store a NULL value and that the values of all rows are distinct from each other.
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
CREATE TABLE t2 (col_1 DECIMAL PRIMARY KEY);

-- This INSERT will fail because a primary key column is not allowed to store the NULL value.
INSERT INTO t2(col_1) VALUES(NULL);

-- This INSERT works
INSERT INTO t2(col_1) VALUES(5);

-- But the next INSERT will fail, because only one row with the value '5' is allowed.
INSERT INTO t2(col_1) VALUES(5);
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
The &lt;u&gt;UNIQUE&lt;/u&gt; constraint has a similar meaning as the PRIMARY KEY phrase. But there are two slight differences. 

First, the values of different rows of a UNIQUE column are not allowed to be equal, which is the same as with PK. But they are allowed to hold the NULL value, which is different from PK. The existence of NULL values has an implication. As the term ''null = null'' never evaluates to ''true'' (it evaluates to ''unknown'') there may exist multiple rows with the NULL value in a column which is defined to be UNIQUE.

Second, only one PK definition per table is allowed. In contrast, there may be many UNIQUE constraints (on different columns).
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
CREATE TABLE t3 (col_1 DECIMAL UNIQUE);

-- works well
INSERT INTO t3(col_1) VALUES(5);
-- fails because there is another row with value 5
INSERT INTO t3(col_1) VALUES(5);

-- works well
INSERT INTO t3(col_1) VALUES(null);
-- works also
INSERT INTO t3(col_1) VALUES(null);

-- check the results
SELECT * FROM t3;
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
The &lt;u&gt;FOREIGN KEY&lt;/u&gt; condition defines that the column can hold only those values, which are also stored in a different column of (the same or) another table. This different column has to be UNIQUE or a Primary Key, whereas the values of the foreign key column itself may hold identical values for multiple rows. The consequence is that one cannot create a row with a certain value in this column before there is a row with exactly this certain value in the referred table. In our example database we have a ''contact'' table whose column ''person_id'' refers to the id of persons. It makes sense that one cannot store contact values before storing the appropriate person.

Foreign Keys are the technique to realise 1:m relationships.
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
-- A table with a column which referes to the 'id' column of table 'person'
CREATE TABLE t4 (col_1 DECIMAL REFERENCES person(id));

-- This INSERT works as in table 'person' of our example database there is a row with id = 3.
INSERT INTO t4(col_1) VALUES(3);

-- This statement will fail as in 'person' there is no row with id = 99.
INSERT INTO t4(col_1) VALUES(99);
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Column checks&lt;/u&gt; inspect the values of the column to see whether they meet the defined criterion. Within such column checks only the actual column is visible. If a condition covers two or more colums (eg.: col_1 &gt; col_2) a table check must be used.
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
-- 'col_1' shall contain only values from 1 to 10.
-- A hint to MySQL users: MySQL accepts the syntax of column checks - but it ignores them silently.
CREATE TABLE t5 (col_1 DECIMAL CHECK (col_1 BETWEEN 1 AND 10));

-- This INSERT works:
INSERT INTO t5(col_1) VALUES(3);

-- This statement will fail:
INSERT INTO t5(col_1) VALUES(99);
&lt;/source&gt;

== Table Constraint ==
Table constraints defines rules which are mandatory for the table as a whole. Their sematic and syntax overlaps partially with the previous shown [[../Create_Table_Syntax#Column_Constraint|column constraints]].

Table constraints are defined after the definition of all columns. The syntax starts with the key word CONSTRAINT and includes the possibility to denominate them with a meaningful name, ''t6_pk'', ''t6_uk'' and ''t6_fk'' in the next example. In the case of any exception most DBMS shows this name as part of the error message - and if you havn't defined one it uses its internal naming conventions which may be very cryptic.

=== Primary Key, UNIQUE and Foreign Key ===
In the same manner as shown in the [[../Create_Table#Column_Constraint|column constraints part]] Primary Key, UNIQUE and Foreign Key conditions can be expressed as table constraints. The syntax differs slightly from the column constraint syntax, the semantic is identical.

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
-- A table with a PK column, one UNIQUE column and a FK column.
CREATE TABLE t6 (
  col_1 DECIMAL,
  col_2 CHAR(10),
  col_3 DECIMAL,
  CONSTRAINT t6_pk PRIMARY KEY (col_1), -- 't6_pk' is the name of the constraint
  CONSTRAINT t6_uk UNIQUE      (col_2),
  CONSTRAINT t6_fk FOREIGN KEY (col_3) REFERENCES person(id)
);
&lt;/source&gt;

=== NOT NULL and Simple Column Checks ===
In a similar way as shown in the [[../Create_Table#Column_Constraint|column constraints part]] NOT NULL conditions and simple column checks can be expressed as table expressions.

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
CREATE TABLE t7 (
  col_1 DECIMAL,
  col_2 DECIMAL,
  CONSTRAINT t7_col_1_nn    CHECK (col_1 IS NOT NULL),
  CONSTRAINT t7_col_2_check CHECK (col_2 BETWEEN 1 and 10)
);
&lt;/source&gt;

=== General Column Checks ===
If a condition affects more than one column it must be expressed as a table constraint.

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
CREATE TABLE t8 (
  col_1 DECIMAL,
  col_2 DECIMAL,
  col_3 DECIMAL,
  col_4 DECIMAL,
  -- col_1 can hold only those values which are greater than col_2 
  CONSTRAINT t8_check_1 CHECK (col_1 &gt; col_2),
  -- If col_3 is NULL, col_4 must be NULL also
  CONSTRAINT t8_check_2 CHECK ((col_3 IS     NULL AND col_4 IS     NULL) OR
                               (col_3 IS NOT NULL AND col_4 IS NOT NULL))
);

-- This two INSERTs work as they meet all conditions
INSERT INTO t8 VALUES(1, 0, null, null);
INSERT INTO t8 VALUES(2, 0, 5, 5);

-- Again: MySQL ignores check conditions silently

-- This INSERT fails because col_1 is not greater than col_2
INSERT INTO t8 VALUES(3, 6, null, null);

-- This INSERT fails because col_3 is not null and col_4 is null
INSERT INTO t8 VALUES(4, 0, 5, null);

&lt;/source&gt;

== Column Constraints vs. Table Constraints ==
As you have seen some constraints may be defined as part of the column definition, which is called a ''column constraint'', or as a separate ''table constraint''. Table constraints have two advantages. First, they are a little bit more powerful.

Second, they do have their own name! This helps to understand system messages. Furthermore it opens the possibility to manage constraints after the table exists and contains data. The ALTER TABLE statement can deactivate, activate or delete constraints. To do so, you have to know their name.

== Clean Up ==
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
DROP TABLE t1;
DROP TABLE t2;
DROP TABLE t3;
DROP TABLE t4;
DROP TABLE t5;
DROP TABLE t6;
DROP TABLE t7;
DROP TABLE t8;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Exercises ==
&lt;div style=background:gold&gt;
Create a table 'company' with columns 'id' (numeric, primary key), 'name' (strings of variable size up to 200), 'isin' (strings of length 12, not nullable, unique values).&lt;br /&gt;Create a solution with column constraints only and another one with table constraints only.
&lt;/div&gt;
{{ExerciseSolution|width=100%|text=
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
-- column constraints only
CREATE TABLE company_1 (
  id   DECIMAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(200),
  isin CHAR(12) NOT NULL UNIQUE
);
-- table constraints only
CREATE TABLE company_2 (
  id   DECIMAL,
  name VARCHAR(200),
  isin CHAR(5),
  CONSTRAINT company_2_pk PRIMARY KEY (id),
  CONSTRAINT company_2_uk UNIQUE      (isin),
  CONSTRAINT company_2_check_isin CHECK (isin IS NOT NULL)
);
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

&lt;div style=background:gold&gt;
Create a table 'accessory' with columns 'id' (numeric, primary key), 'name' (strings of variable size up to 200, unique), 'hobby_id' (decimal, not nullable, foreing key to column 'id' of table 'hobby').&lt;br /&gt;Create a solution with column constraints only and another one with table constraints only.
&lt;/div&gt;
{{ExerciseSolution|width=100%|text=
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
-- column constraints only
CREATE TABLE accessory_1 (
  id       DECIMAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name     VARCHAR(200) UNIQUE,
  hobby_id DECIMAL NOT NULL REFERENCES hobby(id)
);
-- table constraints only
CREATE TABLE accessory_2 (
  id       DECIMAL,
  name     VARCHAR(200),
  hobby_id DECIMAL,
  CONSTRAINT accessory_2_pk PRIMARY KEY (id),
  CONSTRAINT accessory_2_uk UNIQUE      (name),
  CONSTRAINT accessory_2_check_1  CHECK (hobby_id IS NOT NULL),
  CONSTRAINT accessory_2_fk FOREIGN KEY (hobby_id) REFERENCES hobby(id)
);

-- Test some legal and illegal values
INSERT INTO accessory_1 VALUES (1, 'Fishing-rod', 2);
COMMIT;
-- ... 
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{BookCat}}In a general sense to empower is  &quot;to give authority or power&quot; but in the development field to empower is &quot;to enable&quot;, &quot;to promote the self-actualization&quot;. &lt;br /&gt;

The World Bank defines empowerment as 
::&quot;''the process of enhancing the capacity of individuals or groups to make choices and to transform those choices into desired actions and outcomes.''&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/EXTPOVERTY/EXTEMPOWERMENT/0,,contentMDK:20272299~pagePK:210058~piPK:210062~theSitePK:486411~isCURL:Y,00.html| title = What is Empowerment? | publisher = World Bank}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

In the UN Guidelines on Women's Empowerment empowerment is defined in terms of the faculties achieved once empowered.
::''&quot; Women's empowerment has five components:  women's sense of self-worth; their right to have and to determine choices; their right to have access to opportunities and resources; their right to have the power to control their own lives, both within and outside the home; and their ability to influence the direction of social change to create a more just social and economic order, nationally and internationally.''&quot;  &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.un.org/popin/unfpa/taskforce/guide/iatfwemp.gdl.htm | title = UN Guidelines on Women's Empowerment | publisher = United Nations}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Empowerment cannot be &quot;given&quot; in the same way that education cannot be delivered and [[Development Cooperation Handbook/The participatory approach|participation]] cannot be bought. It is a process that requires [[Development Cooperation Handbook/Cooperation and Communication|communication]] and [[Development Cooperation Handbook/Defining Cooperation|cooperation]]  and that it is possible only as far as the counterparts are acting in a reciprocally empowering manner, because they recognize that, in order to fully realize themselves, they need the self realization of the others. &lt;br /&gt;

It is possible to act in a reciprocally empowering modality only if there is [[Development Cooperation Handbook/Communication Skills/Building a Climate of Trust|reciprocal trust]] and all counterparts believe that they would benefit much more acting in a [[Development Cooperation Handbook/Cooperation and Communication/The relational content of communication/the social games|positive sum game]] modality rather then in conflictual manner.  Persons, communities and institutions act in reciprocally empowering manner when they believe that their authority is reinforced  by the authority of the others. A typical form of institutional empowerment is the practice of [[Development Cooperation Handbook/Definitions/Subsidiarity|subsidiarity]]. &lt;br /&gt;

Like [[Development Cooperation Handbook/Cooperation and Communication|communication]] produces new knowledge that none of the communicators had beforehand, so &quot;empowerment&quot;  is a process that establishes a new authority in the partners of the process of empowerment. Through successful [[Development Cooperation Handbook/Cooperation and Communication|communication]] and [[Development Cooperation Handbook/Defining Cooperation|cooperation]] the partners actualize a new potentiality of their being, a dimension of themselves that they could not realize in mutual isolation. Their respective potentialities are in fact actualized by understanding where there is equality and where there is difference amongst them. By valuing these differences in a spirit of equal dignity, they act , reciprocally and simultaneously,  as the &quot;empowerer&quot; and the &quot;empowered&quot;.

CONTEXTUAL SITUATIONS AND DEMOGRAPHICS''' &lt;br /&gt;
'''-Student knowledge level:'''  &lt;br /&gt;
Students are in their 2nd semester of 8th grade social studies.  The focus of first semester was early American history.  Students have also studied a bit about prominent leaders and civilizations that had major impact throughout history.  Many government and civics standards have been met, so this semester is focusing on history standards, with special attention given to those where students can reflect on a person or group that sparked change.&lt;br /&gt;

'''-Resources:''' &lt;br /&gt;
Social studies text book, online databases, library resources (print &amp; eBook), grade level computer lab and mobile cart, iPads, digital cameras, video cameras, Google Suite Apps, video chat, Web 2.0 Tools, and local experts&lt;br /&gt;

'''-Time:''' &lt;br /&gt; 
16-18 weeks, most of 2nd semester.  Class meets once per day for 45 minutes.  The technology teacher also coordinates to help with the projects, and one technology class period a week is dedicated to social studies work time.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

'''Group Reflection:'''&lt;br /&gt;
Our group found the TPACK process pretty smooth. As a group we selected social studies as we wanted a subject that would easily lend itself to incorporating technology. One of the group members suggested doing something a long the lines of inventors and how they changed society. We felt that this fit well with the Iowa Core Standards for social studies. Once we had our idea of inventors and how they changed society we read through the standards for 6-8 social studies and selected the ones that we thought may fit with this idea.  We listed the ones we felt may fit and starting selecting our activities. We used the Taxonomies to help us come up with 10 different activities that we felt would fit into social studies lessons. Once we had 10 activities selected we allowed each member to select the ones they felt they wanted to work on. Each member created their lesson based on those activities and posted it back to the original Google Doc. We used Google Docs and Gmail/Chat as our main means of communicating during this process. Our philosophy was that we could accomplish more if we divided and conquered. We did set a few meeting times to collaborate as a team and discuss difficulties or clarifications.&lt;br /&gt;</text>

'''Chair Yoga is a simple path of yoga practice. It is suitable for beginners. With Chair Yoga, you can quickly relax at home or at work and recharge with good energy.'''  

[[w:Chair Yoga|Wikipedia:]] ''Chair yoga is the term generally used to describe a gentle form of yoga that is practiced sitting in a chair, or standing using a chair for support. It is not recognized formally as a type of yoga distinct from other types, such as Iyengar Yoga or Ashtanga yoga. However the poses, or Asanas, are often adaptations of Hatha yoga poses. Chair yoga has helped people with the symptoms of many health issues including: hypertension (high blood pressure), anxiety, chronic fatigue syndrome, arthritis, vertigo (medical), multiple sclerosis, carpal tunnel syndrome, clinical depression, and chronic pain.
Chair Yoga is one of the gentlest forms of yoga available.''

== Tips ==
*Yoga can be easy. Beginners need simple yoga exercises. The presented exercises involve two levels. First, they are a simple gymnastics, well suited for quick relaxation and for stress relief. Second, they activate all the major chakras and help people to get good energy.
*Chair Yoga is a new development in yoga. Chair Yoga can be done in the office or in a simple way in front of the computer. Most people do not need difficult and complicated exercises, but yoga techniques that are easy to practice and can be made in a short time. The most important thing for most people is to do every day something for their health. This series of exercises is very helpful for this.
*Do yoga as it is good for you. If you cannot do something, don't do it.  Many people exercise wrong. They practice yoga only formally (as an external form) without inner feeling. They do not resolve tensions. It is important that we practice effective and with endurance.

== Stress at Work ==
[[File:Team work.jpg|thumb|400px]]
Too much stress is one of the main problems of today's professional life. Who is constantly under great stress harms the long run his health and his inner happiness. He becomes mentally negative, weak and often plagued the rest of his life from various diseases. Those who do not learn clever to deal with stress consume quickly their life energy.

The root cause of job stress lies in our current economic system. It creates profit for a small number of people and the majority of the world population suffers from  increasing poverty and destitution. It produces on the one hand a lot of unemployment and on the other side many working people having an extreme pressure in their job. In the long term we need to make the inner happiness to the center of a new economic world order. The economy must be organized so that it provides everyone with sufficient food and labor, that the health of the working people is protected, that there is no destruction of the environment, and that the inner happiness grows. Not the profit (the money), but the love must be the engine of world economy. In the short term we will have to live with the unwisdom of the ruling politicians. The more important it is that all people care good for themselves and secondly, that we work as powerful as possible for a better world.

Every working person has to do enough exercises every day for his body and his soul. With a lot of stress at work for everyone a daily health and relaxation program is absolutely necessary. The law of life is relentless. Who does not care for his body has not very long something from it. A well maintained car lasts twice as long as a badly treated car. A human body can live 20 to 30 years longer if he is properly fed, sufficiently relaxed and moved well. Who wants to live healthy, must first take a clear decision. Only this gives him the self-discipline for a healthy life. He must clearly define his health goals and create a strong will to do the necessary things. Just then man has the strength to live a long healthy and positive life.

Second, one must look closely at his life situation. One has to recognize what his body and his mind exactly needs. One must consider how to organize his life so that long-term he maintains his health and increases his happiness. One must create a clear daily schedule of sport, relaxation and a healthy diet.

Third, you have to implement your health care plan at least two months every day consistently. Then your mind gets used to it. The daily health practices are then part of your life.

Incorporate the necessary health exercises creativity in your life. At least you should go for a walk on the weekend for an hour. You can meditate on the train or during breaks at work. You can use any contact with your fellow human beings to practice love and full of positive thinking. The big secret for more energy while working is to sensitively put many small breaks in the workday. Anyone who takes a break five minutes every hour, doubles his work force.

Chronic stress we must avoid. If we cannot work long term in our profession relaxed enough, we are not suited for the job. Then we have to change something in our life. We should always think long term. Our job should feed us, and he should contribute to the happiness of all beings. He should not destroy us in our health and inner well-being. If our work over calls us, we must reorganize something, work less, or if necessary, change our profession.

The most important thing in life is to live in the essence. The essence of life is health and happiness. We should take good care of us. Who cares good for himself, sometimes must say &quot;no&quot;. He must say &quot;no&quot; to self-defeating thoughts and self-injurious behavior. We alone are responsible for our life. We should organize our lifes so that we at the end are happy with us. Not our job is the center of our life, but the spirituality. If you look at things this way, you can live much more relaxed. You can work relaxed. And you can let go your profession, if it needs to be. You set the priorities in your life right. Those who live by the right goals, know when and how they have to act.

==The Ten Points of Happiness==
[[File:Face-smile.svg|thumb|300px|Smile and be happy.]]

The most important results of today’s [[w:Happiness economics|happiness research]] can be summed up in ten points.

1. '''A Proactive Life is a Happy One'''

Happy people have positive goals and positive tasks. Proactive people are 15% more satisfied with their lives than more passive people. Happiness researcher Ed Diener explains, “happy people set goals for themselves again and again.” 

2. '''An Active Life is a Happy One'''

Regular physical activity keeps the body healthy and makes the spirit happy. Daily walks raise the level of happiness 12%. David Niven says, “people who stay fit via sports are healthier, more positive, and more successful.”

3. '''Doing Good for the World is a Source of Happiness'''

Those who regularly do good things for others are 24% happier than those who only live for themselves. John A. Schindler wrote, “live as a giving person. Those who give are happier than those who only take. Those who give to others discover the beauty in the world.” 

4. '''Rest and Relaxation Bring Happiness'''

The central point of a healthy and happy life is to find the balance between rest and activity. Besides, work, physical activity, and time spent with others, we need time to rest and relax. We need to get enough sleep. Scientific research shows that relaxed people think more positively and are happier. Every hour of sleep missed lowers the positivity one can experience during the day. 

Where that point of balance between rest and activity lies, must be decided for oneself. Everyone needs to experiment a little to find this correct balance. We have to figure out who much sleep we need and how much relaxation time we need and at what speed we function at our best. We in the western world of „go, go, go“ who wish to stay happy and healthy, must also live extra clever. We need to organize our lives in an intelligent way to facilitate inner happiness and find one’s personal way to inner balance. 

5. '''Positive Thinking'''

Those who think positively double their chance to realize happiness. Those who wish to be happy should think positively. The positive characteristics of wisdom, love, peace, inner power and joy in life should be set as the central point of one’s life. One should exercise a conscious decision to be positive. Fo example, we can ask ourselves, “ how can I go through the day in a positive way?”

6. '''Too Much Television Makes You Unhappy'''

Scientific research states, „ every hour of television lowers the general quality of life by 5%“. TV orients people around superficial things, and the concept of superficial happiness. It raises desire, increases aggression, and creates sorros. Those who would like to grow in terms of happiness, should stop watching TV. (David Niven: Die 100 Geheimnisse glücklicher Menschen. München 2000, Seite 32 f.)

The way to positive TV viewing consists of : a) choose your programs carefully. Avoid negative films. B) Find the correct amount of TV. Children should watch a maximum of one hour per day of television. C) After watching TV, one should practice some form of spiritual exercise (such as yoga, meditation, walking, reading, contemplating the meaning of life). 
 
7. '''Foster Friendship'''

Build on your positive circle of friends. Women who talk to others reduce their worries by 55%. Cancer stricken women who met with a group once a week raised their survival chances to twice as high as those who didn’t meet with a group. In the western world, there is a strong tendency towards isolation. There are many single and lonely people. People who have a good circle of friends are happier and not isolated. We should take care of our friendships and practice positive activities with them. 
 
8. '''Facilitate Joy'''
 
Those who can find little elements of joy in their lives can raise their overall happiness by 20%. Nils once felt bad and in order to raise his spirits, he ate a lot of sweets. His spirit brightened more and more. Then he visualized the sweets in his stomach and awakened his kundalini energy. He awakened a strong energy which quickly brought him back into the light. Nils learned to thus connect outer enjoyment with spiritual exercises. One then needs less sweets. Just a bit of outer enjoyment is enough for inner happiness. 

9. '''Humor''' 

Those with a good sense of humor raise their positivity by 33%. We should foster our sense of humor and learn to not take things so seriously. We should learn to laugh at our selves. Those who are able to do so, can live lighter and brighter. It is good to see cheerful films, read funny books, and to visit joyful people. 

10. '''Self-Confidence'''

Happy people believe in themselves. They believe in their goals, their wisdom, and their power. They see themselves as winners. They know they will prevail in the long term. In a world of doubt, all followers of the way of bliss need inner strength in order to go about their way successfully. The followers of inner happiness need a clear anchor in terms of wisdom, self-discipline, and self-confidence to avoid being brought back by materialism and doubt.

== The Path of Inner Happiness ==

'''Basically, the path of inner happiness consists of health practices and of mental work.''' Health exercises are sports (walking, jogging, biking - if necessary on the exercise bike), yoga and meditation. Add to this a healthy diet. Mental work means to avoid negative thoughts and to encourage positive thoughts. Negative thoughts lead to internal tensions, the destruction of the health and to bad social relationships. They are often associated with feelings such as fear, anger and addiction. 

'''Positive thoughts create positive feelings and a constructive external behavior. Positive thoughts we get by self-reflection, positive intentions and reading in positive books.''' Importante is a constant attention to the inner thoughts, feelings and positive life principles (love, peace, truth, strength, happiness). Recommendable are the philosophy of happiness (Epicurus), Buddhism, Christianity and Yoga. '''The positive psychology found many good ways to live a happy life.''' It is important that we are always in touch with ourselves, our inner truth and love. A spiritual teaching gives us an orientation. For proper application in our concrete situation we are responsible for ourselves. What is good for us? What brings us forward on the path of happiness? What is usefull to build up a happy world?

'''The easiest way of spiritual centering is the daily reading in a spiritual book. We can also read something positive in the internet. We must not read much. A small text, a meditation a day is enough to keep us on the path to lasting happiness. For many people a daily oracle card is helpful to get a positive outlook on life.''' For this we need each day just a minute. That time has everyone. The gain is long term immeasurable. 

Think about your daily happiness practice. '''How can you integrate [[The Five Principles of Health]] into your life? What is your main way of spiritual centering (Yoga, Buddhism, Christianity, Philosophy, Positive Psychology)? Which spiritual role-model inspires you and gives you energy for a positive life (Buddha, Jesus, Epicurus)?''' What exercises do you want to practice regularly?

=== Second Declension ===
Second declension nouns and adjectives end in -ο, and their declination follows the pattern
given below. To decline a second-declension noun, we take the ending in the table and add it to the 
stem (which always ends in -ο). If a vowel is underlined, then we replace the ο in the stem with that vowel.
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Case !! Singular !! Plural
|-
| Nominative || ς || ι
|-
| Genitive || υ || &lt;u&gt;ω&lt;/u&gt;ν
|-
| Dative || &lt;u&gt;ῳ&lt;/u&gt; || ις
|-
| Accusative || ν || υσ
|-
| Vocative || &lt;u&gt;ε&lt;/u&gt; || ι
|}

When we give a noun, we typically give the singular nominative form of the noun, as well as the ending
for the singular genitive case.

Example:
Here is the declension chart for the noun κύριος, -υ, which means &quot;lord&quot;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Case !! Singular !! Plural
|-
| Nominative || κύριος || κύριοι
|-
| Genitive || κύριου || κύριων
|-
| Dative || κύριῳ || κύριοις
|-
| Accusative || κύριον || κύριους
|-
| Vocative || κύριε || κύριοι
|}

Here is the declension chart for second declension neuter nouns:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Case !! Singular !! Plural
|-
| Nominative || ν || &lt;u&gt;α&lt;/u&gt;
|-
| Genitive || υ || &lt;u&gt;ω&lt;/u&gt;ν
|-
| Dative || &lt;u&gt;ῳ&lt;/u&gt; || ις
|-
| Accusative || ν || &lt;u&gt;α&lt;/u&gt;
|-
| Vocative || ν || &lt;u&gt;α&lt;/u&gt;
|}

Example:
Here is the declension chart for the noun τέκνον, -υ, which means &quot;child&quot;.
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Case !! Singular !! Plural
|-
| Nominative || τέκνον || τέκνα
|-
| Genitive || τέκνου || τέκνων
|-
| Dative || τέκνῳ || τέκνοι
|-
| Accusative || τέκνον || τέκνα
|-
| Vocative || τέκνον || τέκνα
|}

Most second declension nouns are either masculine or neuter, although there are feminine second declension nouns as well.

===First Declension===

First declension nouns end with α or η, and are typically feminine (although there are masculine ones as well).
They fall under two slightly different patterns that differ only in the singular genitive and dative. 

'''Pattern 1''' (at *, we add an ι-improper diaphtong to the vowel: α -&gt; ᾳ, η -&gt; ῃ)
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Case !! Singular !! Plural
|-
| Nominative || - || &lt;u&gt;α&lt;/u&gt;ι
|-
| Genitive || ς || &lt;u&gt;ω&lt;/u&gt;ν
|-
| Dative || * || &lt;u&gt;α&lt;/u&gt;ις
|-
| Accusative || ν || &lt;u&gt;α&lt;/u&gt;ς
|-
| Vocative || - || &lt;u&gt;α&lt;/u&gt;ι
|}

Example: καρδία, -ας (Heart)
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Case !! Singular !! Plural
|-
| Nominative || καρδία || καρδίαι
|-
| Genitive || καρδίας || καρδίων
|-
| Dative || καρδίᾳ || καρδίαις
|-
| Accusative || καρδίαν || καρδίας
|-
| Vocative || καρδία || καρδία
|}

Example: φωνή, -ής (Voice)
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Case !! Singular !! Plural
|-
| Nominative || φωνή || φωναί
|-
| Genitive || φωνήσ || φωνών
|-
| Dative || φωνῄ || φωναίς
|-
| Accusative || φωνήν || φωνάς
|-
| Vocative || φωνή || φωνά
|}

'''Pattern 2''': Virtually identical, except we change α to η in the singular genitive and dative cases.
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Case !! Singular !! Plural
|-
| Nominative || - || &lt;u&gt;α&lt;/u&gt;ι
|-
| Genitive || &lt;u&gt;η&lt;/u&gt;ς || &lt;u&gt;ω&lt;/u&gt;ν
|-
| Dative || &lt;u&gt;ῃ&lt;/u&gt; || &lt;u&gt;α&lt;/u&gt;ις
|-
| Accusative || ν || &lt;u&gt;α&lt;/u&gt;ς
|-
| Vocative || - || &lt;u&gt;α&lt;/u&gt;ι
|}

Example: δόξα, -ης (Glory)
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Case !! Singular !! Plural
|-
| Nominative || δόξα || δόξαι
|-
| Genitive || δόξης || δόξων
|-
| Dative || δόξῃ || δόξαις
|-
| Accusative || δόξαν || δόξας
|-
| Vocative || δόξα || δόξα
|}


===Grand patterns===
# The genitive plural of all declensions in Greek (all nouns, pronouns, adjectives, verb participles, basically anything that can decline) end in ων.
# The accusative and nominative of all neuter declensions in Greek are the same.
# In all declensions, the dative case contains an ι, perhaps as an improper diaphtong.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Nouns in Greek are declined (have ending changes) based on ''case'', ''number'' (singular or plural), and ''gender'' (masculine, feminine, neuter).

The ''case'' of a noun indicates the function of the noun in the sentence. There are five different cases:
# The '''nominative''' case marks the subject of a phrase as well as the predicate nominative (i.e., the object of a linking verb (or copulative verb), such as to be). Examples: In the sentence &quot;The dog bit the man&quot;, dog would be in the nominative case. Also, in the sentence &quot;The man is a soldier&quot;, both &quot;man&quot; and &quot;soldier&quot; are in the nominative case.
# The '''genitive''' case denotes source or origin (this function is also called the ablative), or kind or possession. It is also often used for an object of a preposition. It is frequently translated as &quot;of ...&quot;. Examples: In the phrase &quot;The man's wife&quot;, or equivalently, &quot;the wife of the man&quot;, man would be in the genitive case.
# The '''dative''' case denotes an indirect object (translated as &quot;to ...&quot; or &quot;for ...&quot;); means or agency, especially impersonal means (translated as &quot;by ...&quot;); or a location. It is also frequently used as an object of a preposition, and often, a preposition can take a noun in either the genitive or dative case with different meanings. Examples: In the sentence &quot;I spoke to John&quot;, John would be in the dative case. Also, in the sentence &quot;By grace, you have been saved&quot;, grace would be in the dative case.
# The '''accusative''' case denotes a direct object. Example: In the sentence, &quot;I saw the cat&quot;, cat would be in the accusative case.

In Greek, nouns fall under three different patterns for case endings, called declensions.
The first declension contains nouns whose stems end in α or η. They are mostly feminine nouns.
The second declension contains nouns whose stems end in ο. They are mostly masculine or neuter.
The third declension contains all other nouns (mostly, nouns whose stems end in a consonant). There are 
broad patterns in third declension endings, but much more special cases than for first and second declension nouns.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Watchdog Timer ==

In an embedded environment, far away from the lab, and far away from the programmers, engineers, and technicians, all sorts of things can go wrong, and the embedded system needs to be able to fix itself. Remember, once you close the box, and shrink-wrap your product, it's hard to get back in there and fix your mistakes.

In a typical computer systems, cosmic rays flip a bit of RAM about once a month{{fact}}.
If that happens to the wrong bit, the program can &quot;hang&quot;, stuck in a short infinite loop.

Turning the power off then on again gets it unstuck.
But how do you jiggle the power switch when you are on Earth and your embedded system is near Neptune?
Or you are in Paris, and your embedded system is in Antarctica?

One of the most important tools of an embedded systems engineer is the '''Watch-Dog Timer''' (WDT). A WDT is a timer with a very long fuse (several seconds, usually).

The WDT counts down toward zero(*), like the big red numbers counting down on the bombs in the movies.
Left to itself, eventually the counter will reach zero.
When the counter reaches zero, the WDT resets the microcontroller (as if the power were turned off, then turned back on).

When the system is running normally, you don't want it to randomly reset itself, so you need to make sure that your program always &quot;feeds the watch-dog&quot; long before time runs out.
Good practice is to reset the WDT less than halfway-through its countdown.
For instance, if the WDT has a timer of 20 seconds, then you will want to feed the WDT at least once every 10 seconds.

Unlike when our hero deals with bombs in the movies, feeding the watch-dog doesn't stop the countdown.
When the code uses a &quot;reset&quot; or &quot;clear&quot; command to feed the watchdog, it merely sets the WDT back to some large number -- and then the watchdog timer immediately starts counting down from there.

If the programmer fails to feed the watchdog in time -- or if the program hangs for any reason -- then sooner or later WDT will time out, and the program will reset, hopefully getting your system unstuck.

Some &quot;multi-stage&quot; watchdogs have a first stage that interrupts the CPU.
The corresponding interrupt handler logs debug information about the current state information (crash dump) and attempts a &quot;soft&quot; recovery.
If some fault causes the soft recovery to timeout, the the final stage of the watchdog will reset the entire system.

&lt;/ref&gt;

(*) Some watchdogs count up. With this kind of watchdog, &quot;feeding the watchdog&quot; resets it to zero. If it ever reaches some high limit, it resets the system.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Timber for woodworking can be bought either 'dressed' (when it has already been sawn or 'broken down' to the desired width and thickness, and planed smooth) or 'rough' (when it is in the same state as when it left the sawmill, and either green or seasoned). It is quicker to begin woodworking projects with the former, but the latter is cheaper.

This chapter deals with the processes of taking rough, seasoned timber and sawing it to the required dimensions (width and thickness only), and then planing it smooth enough to begin the main woodworking tasks (cutting joints etc.).

== Breaking down ==

Purchasing timber in its rough-sawn state can be more confusing for a beginner, because the nature of the grain and quality of the wood can be somewhat concealed.

[TBA]

== Dressing ==

The next stage is to dress the ripped pieces. This is done with a [[../Scrub planes|scrub plane]].

:''Die Bourgeoisie kann nicht existieren, ohne die Produktionsinstrumente, also die Produktionsverhältnisse, also sämtliche gesellschaftlichen Verhältnisse fortwährend zu revolutionieren. Unveränderte Beibehaltung der alten Produktionsweise war dagegen die erste Existenzbedingung aller früheren industriellen Klassen. Die fortwährende Umwälzung der Produktion, die ununterbrochene Erschütterung aller gesellschaftlichen Zustände, die ewige Unsicherheit und Bewegung zeichnet die Bourgeoisepoche vor allen früheren aus. Alle festen eingerosteten Verhältnisse mit ihrem Gefolge von altehrwürdigen Vorstellungen und Anschauungen werden aufgelöst, alle neugebildeten veralten, ehe sie verknöchern können. Alles Ständische und Stehende verdampft, alles Heilige wird entweiht, und die Menschen sind endlich gezwungen, ihre Lebensstellung, ihre gegenseitigen Beziehungen mit nüchternen Augen anzusehen.''&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
:::The bourgeoisie cannot exist without continually revolutionizing the instruments of production, and thereby the relations of production, and with them the whole relations of society. Conservation of the old modes of production in unaltered form, was, by contrast, the first condition of existence for all previous industrial classes. Perpetual revolution in production, ceaseless disturbance of all social conditions, everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeoise epoch from all that have come before. All fixed, fast-frozen relations, with their train of ancient and venerable beliefs and opinions, are dissolved; all new-formed ones grow obsolete before they can ossify. All that is solid melts into air, all that is sacred is profaned, and man is at last compelled to face with sober senses his position in life and his relations with his kind.

:What did it mean to be a slave? It is hard to imagine it today. We think of oppression beyond all conception: cruelty, degradation, whipping and starvation, the absolute negation of human rights; or on the contrary, we may think of the ordinary worker the world over today, slaving ten, twelve, or fourteen hours a day, with not enough to eat, compelled by his physical necessities to do this and not to do that, curtailed in his movements and his possibilities; and we say, here, too, is a slave called a &quot;free worker,&quot; and slavery is merely a matter of name. 

:But there was in 1863 a real meaning to slavery different from that we may apply to the laborer today. It was in part psychological, the enforced personal feeling of inferiority, the calling of another Master; the standing with hat in hand. It was the helplessness. It was the defenselessness of family life. It was the submergence below the arbitrary will of any sort of individual. It was without doubt worse in these vital respects than that which exists today in Europe or America....

:The slavery of Negroes in the South was not usually a deliberately cruel and oppressive system. It did not mean systematic starvation or murder. On the other hand, it is just as difficult to conceive as quite true the idyllic picture of a patriarchal state with cultured and humane masters under whom slaves were as children, guided and trained in work and play, given even such mental training as was for their good, and for the well-being of the surrounding world. 

:The victims of Southern slavery were often happy; had usually adequate food for their health, and shelter sufficient for a mild climate. The Southerners could say with some justification that when the mass of their field hands were compared with the worst class of laborers in the slums of New York and Philadelphia, and the factory towns of New England, the black slaves were as well off and in some particulars better off. Slaves lived largely in the country where health conditions were better; they worked in the open air, and their hours were about the current hours for peasants throughout Europe. They received no formal education, and neither did the Irish peasant, the English factory-laborer, nor the German Bauer; and in contrast with these free white laborers, the Negroes were protected by a certain primitive sort of old-age pension, job insurance, and sickness insurance; that is, they must be supported in some fashion, when they were too old to work; they must have attention in sickness, for they represented invested capital; and they could never be among the unemployed. 

:On the other hand, it is just as true that Negro slaves in America represented the worst and lowest conditions among modern laborers....  They represented in a very real sense the ultimate degradation of man. Indeed, the system was so reactionary, so utterly inconsistent with modern progress, that we simply cannot grasp it today. No matter how degraded the factory hand, he is not real estate. The tragedy of the black slave's position was precisely this; his absolute subjection to the individual will of an owner and to &quot;the cruelty and injustice which are the invariable consequences of the exercise of irresponsible power, especially where authority must be sometimes delegated by the planter to agents of inferior education and coarser feelings.&quot;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dr. DuBois here quotes Charles Lyell, [http://books.google.com/books?id=cMTmD5ubYQkC&amp;lpg=PA154&amp;ots=vDoI5SdXDY&amp;dq=%22the%20cruelty%20and%20injustice%20which%20are%20the%20invariable%20consequences%20of%20the%20exercise%20of%20irresponsible%20power%22&amp;pg=PA154#v=onepage&amp;q=%22the%20cruelty%20and%20injustice%20which%20are%20the%20invariable%20consequences%20of%20the%20exercise%20of%20irresponsible%20power%22&amp;f=false Travels in North America, in the years 1841-2: with geological observations on the United States, Canada, and Nova Scotia] (New York: Wiley &amp; Putnam 1845), Vol. I, p. 145:

::''If due exertions be made to cultivate the minds, and protect the rights and privileges of the negroes, and it nevertheless be found that they cannot contend, when free, with white competitors, but are superseded by them, still the cause of humanity will have gained. The coloured people, though their numbers remain stationary, or even diminish, may in the mean time be happier than now, and attain to a higher moral rank. They would, moreover, escape the cruelty and injustice which are the invariable consequences of the exercise of irresponsible power, especially where authority must be sometimes delegated by the planter to agents of inferior education and coarser feelings.''&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">A schizophrenic man who is undiagnosed begins to blog, and begins to remember the first voices he ever heard and what they said. A furious story unwinds from his mind and takes him, and us, to strange places.

The author sends us on a journey into his mind. Started from events he knows to be true and continuing on to things that no one has ever thought of before. He follows religions as far as he can go. Writes to new religions that don't yet exist. Crosses space and time, twice. Takes our souls and turns them into answers. All through science fiction.

As a writer I was first noticed in Elementary School when a poem I had written about driving to my grandmothers house won a contest. Again in High School my English teacher expressed interest in my writing. Again in College my Literary Class Professor noted my ability to write. Once full of material and in my late twenties I exploded into the book The Crayola: Tome if Infinite Will.

The book was converted to Adobe PDF years ago and the original was lost.

Feel free to use my dropbox download. But for whatever reason Wikibooks blocks dropbox. So I'll have to get back to you. Feel free to ask for it.

Thanks!</text>

Hi, I am Goldenburg111. I may pop here out of nowhere from time to time because I am a SWMT member, who patrols small wikis, like en.wikibooks, for vandalism or spam. As you can see, I currently have reviewer rights to help me in counter vandalism here, and I am also part of the Counter Vandalism unit here at en.wikibooks. I look forward to also creating wikitext books here, and have done so. I am the creator of [[Wikijunior:Extinct Birds]], I am usually contributing to Wikijunior Books.

&lt;center&gt;Userpages: [[wikiquote:User:Goldenburg111|My Wikiquote]], [[meta:User:Goldenburg111|my Meta]] and [[wikiversity:User:Goldenburg111|my Wikiversity]].&lt;br&gt; 

'''These are the wikis I am usually active in counter-vandalism and content work.'''&lt;/center&gt;</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">When we look at the world, it appears to be a seamless whole. This makes it difficult to understand, and sometimes even difficult to believe, that our visual perceptual experience is created through a series of smaller perceptions of simpler things. But that's how it happens. 

Vision is turning light into something useful. In our retinas we have photosensitive neurons. They increase their firing rate when photons (particles of light) hit them.  At a first approximation, you can think of the first layer of neurons as a bunch of pixels, encoding some color at some location. But this is just the first layer. After that, they start to detect higher level patterns. 

One of the first discoveries was that there were certain neurons that detected lines at particular angles. That is, there would be a neuron that would increase its firing rate in the presence of line at, say, 90 degrees, but not at other angles. As a shorthand, we'll say that the neuron &quot;detects&quot; lines at 90 degrees. David Hubel and Torsten Weisel discovered this in 1958, studying the dog's visual system. They were exposing the dogs to images, and recording the activity of single cells in the visual pathway from the eye to the brain. The images weren't doing much, but when they moved the slides sometimes the neuron would go crazy. It finally dawned on them that the neuron was responding to the edge of the slide, not the picture in it! This is one of many stories in science of accidental discovery (Martinez-Conde &amp; Macknik, 2014). 

So what happens? Does the neuron increase firing only in the presence of lines at ''exactly'' 90 degrees? No. If the line is slightly off 90 degrees, the neuron will increase its firing rate to a lesser extent. The closer the line is to 90 degrees, the higher the firing rate. There are neurons for detecting angles of all orientations: some for 180 degrees, some for 30 degrees, etc. Each one has a particular &quot;receptive field.&quot; With the information from all of these neurons firing, an cognitive system can tell with some good degree of accuracy the orientation of a line. Hubel and Weisel found that the further &quot;upstream&quot; you go, away from the retina and toward the rest of the brain, the more complex are the detections. That is, lines are fairly simple, but those lines are used by higher neurons to detect even more complex patterns.

Black has a clear advantage. White will attempt to mate the black king with a series of checks, but with proper play black will come out ahead.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Preamble ==

This is the opening page to the Digital Media and Culture Yearbook 2014.

As the title suggests, this is a book which seeks to record contributions to the understanding of a specific set of topics, loosely grouped under the title &quot;Digital Media and Culture&quot;, of particular salience to 2014. 

It is put together through the combined talents and efforts of a cohort of students taking the FMS9A4 module during the Spring of 2014 at the [[Wikipedia:University of Stirling|University of Stirling]] in Scotland. The aim is, firstly, for students to record the content of their learning and their contributions to this book will reflect their studies on one of the featured themes. However, secondly and most importantly, the hope is that students will learn the values associated with working at different levels as individual researchers, as research teams, and as research communities. That is to say: producing knowledge; collaboration and sharing; and peer-reviewing the work of others for the good of the community. Students will thus gain hands-on experience of a wiki environment, within the auspices of one of Wikimedia's large projects (i.e. Wikibooks) and make something that adds to currents in the academic field of digital media.

== Chapters ==
*[[/Chapter 1: Technological Determinism/]]
*[[/Chapter 2: Online Identity/]]
*[[/Chapter 3: Always-on Culture/]]
*[[/Chapter 4: Cognitive Surplus/]]
*[[/Chapter 5: Crowdsourcing/]]

== List of Contributors ==

This wikibook is being put together as an on-going a collaborative project by the following Wikimedian contributors. Together, they form a cohort of students studying Digital Media and Culture as part of their degree programme in the Division of Communications, Media and Culture, The University of Stirling, Scotland, UK. Doubtless, there are other contributors within the Wikibooks and Wikipedia community who have contributed advice, support, suggestions and content in collaboration with these students. Your help and advice is most appreciated. Thank you!

This template is used to tag the Trainz Wikibook categories and list messages apropos to the use and classification of the category.

# &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{admin}}}--when defined, the page is classified as Admin,&lt;/nowiki&gt; so adds the page to [[:category:Trainz Admin]] and message changes to [[:category:Trainz Admin|Administration]]. When undefined, page is auto-categorized as [[:category:Trainz Maintenance|sub-admin category Trainz Maintenance]].
# &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{noMaint|}}} --explicit alternative,  overrides the second (normal) case above, the page is NOT classified as Maintenance.&lt;/nowiki&gt;
# &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{inhibit}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;--when defined, same as admin undefined and noMaint=1, so neither auto-category is placed on the page targeted by using the template.
# The template ''normally always'' adds a page to [[:Category:All Trainz categories]] so &lt;nowiki&gt;|ALLinhibit if defined&lt;/nowiki&gt;--suppresses inclusion in that category and BOTH the foregoing as well. ? (and any page categorization must be manual).{{indent

=Putting it all Together:  A Dragon!=
{{B3D:N2P/ForVersion|2.69}}

I downloaded Blender without knowing much about how to use it, probably like you.  I hunted around for a good tutorial and found this one.  It is teaching me wonderful things!  I have diligently followed every lesson from the beginning, as I hope you have.  Every lesson seems to contain some valuable technique.  So now it is time to put it all together into a single project.

Hopefully, you now know
*  How to add objects, move and rotate them, scale them in various dimensions, and change their shape.
*  How to use proportional editing to change them even more.
*  How to parent, join and separate objects.
*  How to use materials and textures.
*  How to use images in materials.
*  How to use basic lights.
*  How to use modifiers including subsurf and array.
*  Basic use of curves
*  It will help if you know how to use a photo editor such as GIMP to produce seamless textures

This project will build on all that background. Since all those things have been covered before, this will not be a key-by-key tutorial but rather a description of the general steps to take to make the finished scene. 
__TOC__
==Modeling from the Image==

[[File:Komodo Dragon (2007).jpg|thumb|300 px|left|Komodo Dragon]]
[[File:Dragon 003.png|thumb|300px|right|Using cubes to model the dragon]]
[[File:Dragon 008.png|thumb|200 px|left|The basic body smoothed.]]
It happens that the Komodo Dragon is one of my favorite creatures.  Let us start with that and let our imagination run wild.  In the lesson on '''[[Blender_3D:_Noob_to_Pro/Modeling_a_Fox_from_Guide_Images|Modeling a Fox from Guide Images]]'''  we learned how to make a beautiful 3 dimensional wolf from an image.  (Yes, I know.  The fox turned into a wolf.  If you did that lesson you understand.)   Here is a nice picture of a Komodo Dragon by wallygrom from [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page Creative Commons] with a proper license.   We can then set that picture as a background image and apply the technique of starting with a cube and scaling it, extruding it, scaling again and so on.  We only have one view, so our imagination and application of other pictures has to help with the top and end views, and we have to add a nice long tail.  As you build your cubes keep in mind that you will have to create faces and extrude the legs so place a well sized face at the proper spot.

We will use the techniques we learned to split faces and add the legs.  Be sure to provide a nice mouth to put teeth in later, and pay particular attention to modeling the claws. I modeled one entire foot and then duplicated it three times to have them all, and joined each one to the body at the appropriate spot.

Once you have outlined the dragon with the cubes, remember what we learned in '''[[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Detailing Your Simple Person 1|Smoothing Your Simple Person]]''' and apply subsurf modifier and smooth the entire thing.  You can then push and pull on vertices to help make it look as good as possible.  I wanted to try to maintain the look of an ordinary creature and stay close to my Komodo Dragon, rather than a huge fierce beast to take on St. George.




==Setting the Body Materials and Textures==

Use what we learned in '''[[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Image Textures|Image Textures]]''' to give the dragon his scales.  The most used technique in this tutorial is:
*  Search [http://www.flickr.com/creativecommons/by-sa-2.0/ Flicker  Creative Commons] for a properly licensed picture that has a good material in it.  If you use Google or some other search, be sure that the picture you get is properly licensed if you plan to share the image.
*  If your image is NOT a single seamless texture, use photo editing software (such as GIMP) to produce a usable seamless file. 
**  Load the image into GIMP. Crop it to a reasonable size showing a relatively uniform texture.
**  Choose ''Filters &gt; Map &gt; Make Seamless''.  Other photo editors will usually have a similar operation.
**  Save the image with a suitable file name.
*  Add a material and a texture using the image.  Adjust the settings as needed to look good.
*  If you are following my steps, I have put all the textures in this article for you to copy if you wish.  Click on the thumbnail image and go to the Wiki page from which you can download.

[[File:Flickr 2.0 lic Komodo Dragon SKIN.png|left|thumb|266 px|Fantasy Dragon Skin seamless texture]]You can just select a rectangular swatch of skin from the picture and use GIMP to make it seamless.  But Komodo Dragons are a depressing color.  For a fantasy creature we need a brighter skin!  So you can play with GIMP Colorizer until you have a suitably colored swatch.  I used red and gold, but use your imagination!  This becomes the first material and texture for the dragon's body.  It will probably be necessary to repeat the image several times in both the X and Y directions.  I used X:6 and Y:2 in this particular case.






==Adding the Eyes==
[[image:Dragon 009.png|thumb|300 px|left|The first rendering.]]The dragon needs suitably scary eyes.  Hopefully you have already modeled eyes for the '''[[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Procedural Eyeball|Procedural Eyeball]]''' tutorial. I chose the cat's eye.  In '''[[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Simple Vehicle: Some Assembly Required|Some Assembly Required]]''' we learned how to append a file.  Append the Cat's Eye, and then work on the color textures until you have a suitably scary dragon eye.  Then duplicate it and put one eye on each side of the dragon's head.  I joined the eyes to the body, but you can also just parent them if you are careful.  You will notice in later renderings that I kept playing with the eye color and position.






==A Dragon Needs Teeth and Claws==
[[image:Dragon 025.png|thumb|300 px|left|Assigning texture to the claws]][[image:Dragon 026.png|thumb|100 px|right|Four rows of Teeth]]
Using the technique from '''[[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Multiple Materials Per Object|Multiple Materials per Object]]''' , isolate the claws and give them a nice shiny black material.  Too much Specularity will make the claws look like plastic, too little will make them dull and uninteresting.  I added just a little bit of Mirror also.  It will be something to experiment with until you get the look you like. Click on the picture to enlarge it and see the setting I settled on.  Remember that you have to select the area of the mesh and ASSIGN it to the material or you will wind up with a dragon that is black all over!  (That is the voice of sad experience speaking).

A dragon needs teeth.  A lot of teeth!  Modeling all those teeth would be a big job.  Fortunately we learned how to use array modifiers in '''[[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Building a House|Building a House]]'''.   Add a cone, scale it down very small, and extrude some more parts so you can shape it into a nice curve.  When you have a beautifully sharp tooth, add the Array modifier and make it into a whole row of sharp teeth.  Then duplicate the whole thing three times, rotate it around as needed, and you will have four rows of teeth, enough for both jaws. This is why we left the mouth open when we made the original model.  

==Horns, a Crest, and Nostrils==

[[image: Dragon 013.png|thumb|left|300 px|Using the Curve Modifier]][[image: Dragon 015.png|thumb|right|200 px|The color settings for the horns]][[image:  Dragon 029.png|thumb|left|100 px|Nostrils]]Lets give the beast some horns.  Here we can use what we learned in '''[[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Deforming Meshes using the Curve Modifier|Deforming Meshes using the Curve Modifier]]''' to make some gracefully curved horns.  Just as in that lesson, add a cone and extrude segments to give a lot of vertices.  Then create your Bezier Curve and set it as a modifier to the horn mesh.  Properly done your horn will mold itself to the shape of the curve.  Duplicate it and rotate it to fit the other side of the head and put them in place.

Animal horns are some of the most beautiful structures in nature.  We should make a particularly pretty material for them.  We can use the blending colorband as in the tutorial '''[[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Basic Carpet Texture|Basic Carpet Texture]]''', updating it a bit for 2.69, to give the horns a nice color appearance. Then add '''[[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Subsurface scattering|Subsurface Scattering]]''' as taught in that tutorial, with a lot of experimenting, until you get a really beautiful appearance.  The settings I used are in the picture but it is fun to try different things.  

An impressive crest should dominate the dragon's back.  I found a picture of a basilisk lizard and used it as a background model for the crest. The Crest texture was produced in GIMP exactly the same way as the dragon skin texture.

Reptile nostrils are sort of nondescript, so lets make some nice nostrils like a snorting bull might have.  You can use the technique from '''[[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Spin a goblet|Spin a goblet]]''' to model one nostril, then duplicate it, rotate the pair until they look fierce, and give them a nice color like the dark red brown I picked.  Then put them in place and parent them to the body. 





Now you can render your dragon and see the basic body shape, but something is missing.  What is it?[[Image:  Dragon 016.png.jpg|thumb|center|400 px|Teeth, Claws, Crest and Horns]]

==Giving the Dragon Wings==

[[Image:  Dragon 027.png|thumb|left|200 px|An attempt at wings.]]

The wings were the hardest part, because we have not had many tutorials in this series that dealt with the problems involved.  I started with a cylinder object and went from there, joining other cylinders to it, and then selecting edges and using{{B3D:N2P/Do|FKEY}} to create faces.  There may be other better ways to do it.  I wanted the wing sail parts to be semi transparent and give an appearance of shimmering colors.  Experimenting with the transparency and the materials as seen in the screenshot gave me some I liked pretty well.  I am not completely satisfied with it but perhaps it is the best that can be done with the tools we have so far learned.  Joining the wings to the body seemed to produce some distortions so I just parented both of them to the body object.

Now there is just one more thing that a perfect dragon needs.








==FIRE!==
[[image: Dragon 023.png|thumb|right|300 px|Settings for flames]][[File:Flickr 2.0 lic flames.png|thumb|left|273 px|Seamless flame material]][[image: Dragon 017.png|thumb|left|100 px|Scaling the cylinders]]
[[image: Dragon 017a.png|thumb|left|100 px|Distorting the cylinders]]
Everybody knows that dragons breathe fire.  It seems that there are many different ways to do flames in Blender. However, I am attempting to use methods covered so far in this tutorial series, so I wanted to experiment and see what could be done with just what we have learned.  I came up with something reasonably close to flame breath using basic techniques.  I started with a series of cylinder objects, scaled at one end until they are almost cones, and then stacking them inside each other.  I used the proportional editing that we learned about in '''[[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Mountains Out Of Molehills|Mountains Out Of Molehills]]''' to pull and stretch into some more or less random shapes.  I found the flame picture and turned it into a seamless material swatch.  Then I wrapped it around my cones and began playing with the settings for transparency, and added an Emit setting just to see how it looked.  (If you want to jump ahead refer to [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Making Fire|Making Fire]] in the next section of this series.)















==Ground to Stand on==

[[image: Lava seamless texture.png|thumb|left|273 px|seamless lava texture]][[image:  Seamless grass.jpg|thumb|right|300 px|seamless grass texture]]Now it is time to complete the scene by giving him something to stand on.  Since his front feet are raised, put in a sort of lava flow for him.  That seems appropriate for a dragon.  Try Adding a series of cubes. Stack them up and pull them out of shape with proportional editing. Add a subsurf modifier, and then the set the lava rock as an image texture. Again I made a seamless material out of a photo. 

Then create a plane and again use the proportional editor to make some nice hills.  A seamless green grass texture repeated multiple times completed the ground.  



==Lighting==

[[Image:Dragon 031.png|thumb|left|100 px|The No Shadow setting]]So far the lighting has just been the default point light.  I think it is a bit more dramatic to use the Sun style of lamp.  As we learned in '''[[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Light a Silver Goblet|Light a Silver Goblet]]''' go to ''Add&gt;Lamp&gt;Sun'' and place a sun type lamp rather high in the sky.  You will notice that now you get two overlapping shadows, one from the Sun and one from the default point lamp. You could just delete the point lamp, but, to advance beyond what has already been covered, it is useful as fill lighting. You can select the point lamp, go to the properties panel and click on the light icon[[File:Blender-2.5 lamp radio button.png]].  Scroll down to Shadow and click No Shadow and the point light becomes a fill light.  Setting the horizon color in the world panel [[File:Blender268TextureIconWorld.png]] is the last step to produce this scene.

















=THE FINAL RESULT=

[[image:Dragon 028.jpg|thumb|center|700 px|The Final Result]]

I think it nicely combines pretty much all I have learned about Blender so far in the tutorial! If you want to try your hand at a project, it is not as hard as you might think.  You and I have really learned a lot by going through the first two sections of''' Blender 3D:Noob to Pro'''.  I thank all the authors who have worked hard to bring us to this point.

I challenge you to show off what you can do with your newly acquired knowledge and put your finished work up here.  It will probably be a lot better than mine.

      <comment>Some brief notes.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Side note|side=right|{{Java Swings/Content}}}}
This chapter explains how to separate Swing applications into a more maintainable triad of components: the domain model, the view of the user interface, and the controller that oversees these. A minimal class structure is shown below.

[[File:Java Swings Wikibook, MVC class diagram.svg|center|600px]]

The main application class is the controller: it creates a model object (which is Observable), and a view object (which is an Observer of the model). The controller adds the view as an observer of the model.

When the model changes, it calls &lt;code&gt;setChanged()&lt;/code&gt; and then &lt;code&gt;notifyObservers()&lt;/code&gt;. This means that the model can react to user input.

The controller doesn't touch the view (apart from instantiating it and giving it the model).

The view has access to the model, including to change it.</text>

== About the Me and the Book == 

I am the Director of the Texas Conference Adventurer Ministry. The Adventurer Club is my passion. Since I can remember I have been involved with the clubs in one way or another. I was introduced to the Adventurer Club when my oldest daughter was of adventurer's age, and just felt in love with the adventurers, and the adventurer's activities. I had so much trouble finding information and appropriate activities for Adventurers that I started collecting information. Years later, I felt the necessity to share this information with our staff in the Texas Conference. This book is the result of years of searching and collecting information. Please feel free to add more information or links to make this a great book to share with all of our Adventurers Friends.

      <text xml:space="preserve">On drawings, v&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; should be on the output of 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; op-amp, that is on the anode side, left side, of diode.
Cathode side, right side, is on virtual 0 V.

The author says &quot;MOS are symmetrical devices, so we could replace the drain with the source without affecting the behavior of the device.&quot; but this is an over generalization.  Many discrete mosfets have a body source-drain diode.  They are definitely not symetrical.

      <text xml:space="preserve">LCR stands for Load Compliment Register. The use of this instruction results in loading of the value in two's complement format from the second operand register into the first. Basically, the value (number) loaded is the opposite sign of what was in the second operand register. That is, a negative 3, for example. will be made positive when loaded into the first operand register; and again for example, a positive 3, will become negative 3 when loaded into the first operand register.</text>
